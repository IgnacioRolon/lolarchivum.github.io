I don't think the Grevious Wounds defined who she is, but it helped her against sustain supports a bit.\n\nNot to be contradictory, but I think you're a little off in your interpretation of how her Ult works with Grievous Wounds. Her ult never actually applied Grievous Wounds itself - the tooltip specifically lists that it applies the stacks FROM Impure Shots. We can assume that it still applies the stacking magic damage, but given that Impure Shots lost its Grievous Wounds, it's equally safe to assume that the ult lost this as well. While I will defer to your opinion on how it affects her laning phase, there's not denying that this is still a pretty nasty nerf to her ultimate in mid/late game teamfights where its damage has never been particularly good (not to mention if the opposing team had any kind of coordination you'd never get a full channel off). Losing the ability to apply such a strong debuff over an entire team in a short window is a pretty big loss.\n\nAlso i'm not sure saying her Q's \"crit\" is entirely accurate. It says they do bonus damage if the first bounce kills, but I don't think they ever said that it was a critical striking. It's still a strong tool in lane tho.\n\nThe problem here is that she was already pretty crap in the late game. The added move speed on Impure Shots is nice for rotations and map movements, but it's useless in duels/2v2s given that you'll almost certainly be taking a lot of direct damage to cancel the buff. I don't see how anything they gave her makes her a stronger duelist. The Q bonus require minions to be present, the bonus move speed can be cancelled easily, and the slow is only effective if she's already winning the duel. Her Make It Rain will definitely make ganks easier in lane, that's definitely true.\n\nI think overall the frustration is with a missed opportunity to give her some more love. Her scalings still seem to be really wonky, her ult is still just a shittier version of Lucian's (particularly now that Grievous Wounds is gone), and the buffs she got never really felt targetted at solving any of her core issues. She's faster, has an equitable laning phase, but still suffers most of the same problems as before.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-07T23:24:27.545+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Finally, a real argument besides\n\n\"gg mf is trash\"\n\nI'm not 100% sure about the situation of her ultimate, but they said that it was left untouched so I assumed that it included the Grevious Wounds.\n\nMiss Fortune's real problem is not from her scaling or her transitions throughout the game.

I feel I should clarify - I actually don't dispute the assertion that she is essentially as strong as she was before the update, nor that she in fact may very well be stronger in certain areas. She absolutely is. My problem with the update is more aimed towards the fact that they've emphasized things she was already good at in lieu of addressing the outdated aspects of her play pattern.\n\nIt's totally fine that she's not much of a late game character - Corki isn't either. The problem is as you say - outplay potential. Her improved passive, more responsive Q, and improved E are all great additions but they don't answer the question of what exactly this champ is supposed to do when the game moves past her power spike.\n\nYou brought up Sivir and I think this is a good point of comparison. Sivir has a similarly strong laning phase and a very mid-game focused damage profile. The key difference here is that Sivir has a very clear gameplay pattern to build from - strong wave control and a great utility with her ultimate. Even when her damage falls off, her ultimate and ability to push lanes gives her clear power points to build from. This is why she became so much more viable after her update.\n\nAshe's recent update had a similar vibe - the passive change gave her much better utility to go with her amazing vision on her Hawkshot and the alreayd incredibly engage power of her Ult. They removed a silly passive that made no sense and replaced it with an abilty that gives her strong late game damage and a ton of utility to work with. CLEAR IDENTITY UPDATE!!\n\nNow let's look at MF - how does this update clarify her identity? The changes to her passive and W definitely give her stronger map movements. This reinforces the idea of trying to crush in lane and then affect the rest of the map through roaming. Unfortunately, she can't duel worth a damn and her ult becomes useless in late game, so unless she gets suitably far ahead in the early/early-mid game she will become somewhat useless. She has inferior damage to later game carries, inferior utility to people like Ashe, inferior poke to a Corki, and inferior waveclear compared to Sivir. \n\nPeople have brought up that Grievous Wounds gave her something special - i agree. It was cool to have her be sort of the \"health shredding armor shredding teamfighter\". Do I think it's good to have her entire identity tied to GW? Nope. But simply removing it and putting her in a scenario where she needs to get WAY ahead early on in order to stay effective doesn't seem like a suitable solution either. Her new mobility is nice, but is that really what MF was intended to be about? I dunno.\n\nYou've played her more than I have, so I respect your opinion. I dont' want her to be like all the ADCs, but I think they could've done more here","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-08T01:38:12.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see your point, that Grevious Wounds was definitely unique on her. However I think they're trying to make Strut to be sort of like, her identity. \n\nI think that Strut's ability to be much more stronger will make her different. An ADC with a lot of movement speed that can probably be even better than Vayne at chasing an enemy down. They're trying to allow Miss Fortune this mobility without a ton of dashes or blinks and I really like it. I want people to notice Miss Fortune being naturally fast and take that into consideration. Rather than people saying \"lel mf passive so bad gg\". I think with her passive being MUCH stronger, it will make people think twice about how they engage on her or how they disengage. I feel like it's similar to Ashe's ult. Ashe's ult is global and it can set up amazing teamfights and snipe people as a global execute. It definitely is part of Ashe's identity and if they removed it, I don't think it would be appropriate to even call her Ashe anymore and they might as well of just made a new champion. However this isn't the case with Miss Fortune's identity which should be more reinforced into her passive.\n\nAs for Miss Fortune's dueling and ultimate, her ultimate can actually hit easily for around 1,350 damage I believe late game if they take the 2 seconds. This and her dueling powers are honestly one of the best of ADCs. Her Q gives her auto attack resets on a really low cooldown that also does damage, her W is really nice for the attack speed buff, and her E is now doing more damage. Also, ult'ing in a duel usually guarantees me winning them if played right. Don't underestimate Miss Fortune, she does damage and while she's not really that good late game, her early and mid game dueling and teamfighting outclasses most ADCs. I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for that, but it simply true. Sure, Vayne definitely can out-duel Miss Fortune, and Twitch can definitely have better teamfighting, however Miss Fortune is still able to do both really effectively.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-07-08T03:21:00.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can say this confidently as someone who played a lot of and against a lot of MF's...\n\n\nHer R rarely goes smoothly unless the entire team is CC'd or somehow hampered long enough to eat that full channel.

Maybe I didnt read the notes clearly enough, but i dont see how your choices change at all.\n> \n> Please explain?\n\nSure. Let me start with current/live Miss Fortune. On paper it looks like the W active does 2 distinct things:\n\n* Increase Attack Speed, and\n* Apply Grievous Wounds\n\nWhile that's a true summary, you generally want both of those at the exact same time. So there was no decision-making here... you just press W whenever you're auto-ing the enemy for an extended period of time. So really, her W active does only 1 thing:\n\n* You duel better for 6 seconds\n\nGrievous Wounds isn't a decision, it's just there. Almost invisible power in a lot of cases. Some exceptions of course (looking at you, Volibear!), but the majority of the time you just aren't deciding between \"optimal timing for attack speed steroid\" and \"optimal timing for grievous wounds\" - they're the same.\n\nWith the update, that's no longer the case. There are actually 2 distinct parts now:\n\n* Increase Attack Speed, and\n* Reset passive (which is also better now)\n\nAnd these are indeed 2 unique situations. Sometimes, they'll be competing with one another - in lane, if I activate W to chase/trade, I won't be able to use it to reset my passive when minion aggro knocks it off.\n\nBut knowing when to use each mode adds a skill element that was really lacking before. What's more, a more skilled MF will find ways to double up (see what I did there?) on the W benefits. Rather than needing to pick one or the other, you can actually have both, if you set up the right situations. Again, more reward for champ skill.\n\nNow, just introducing these probably isn't worth it without adding some power elsewhere. But her Q and Passive are also better, and I consider E stronger too (others may disagree here).

As somebody who enjoys playing current MF, and considers myself pretty successful with her, I don't often feel that I make good \"MF plays\".

High Mana costs on E and can be avoided easily, her Q has high yet unreliable damage. and her ult depends on way too many aspects to be effective.
