This is really awful for supports since they don&#039;t have very much gold income in general and would need to keep 1000G just to buy  {{item:3105}} . \nSo I think the build path should be:\n{{item:3801}}(600G) + {{item:1033}}(500G)  = {{item:3105}} \nThis means you get the health regen without using up an item slot and you also have to save up less money. Instead of 1000G you just need 800G to complete the item. \nOr if Riot really wants to make it cheap for supports to save up then the build could be {{item:3801}}(600G) + {{item:1057}}(850G)  = 1450 G Total cost. So then the price of {{item:3105}} would be 350G. So now I will list all the builds and final costs below.\n\n✦Current✦\n{{item:1028}} + {{item:1033}} + {{item:1006}} = {{item:3105}}  \n400G + 500G + 180G = 820G To finish recipe\n\n\n✦Option 1✦\n{{item:3801}} + {{item:1033}} = {{item:3105}} \n600G + 500G = 800G to finish recipe,\n\n✦Option 2✦\n {{item:3801}} + {{item:1057}} = {{item:3105}} \n600g + 850g = 350G to finish recipe\n\nBonus Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_DgYgvG9rY","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-27T17:56:47.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know why Riot don't put the {{item:3801}} into {{item:3105}}  and {{item:3102}}  yet. This change are too delayed, I don't know why they don't put yet.\n\nBoth give health and health regeneration, and have weird buid paths, in Aegis you need to save 1000g to end the Aegis (820 if you take the Rejuvenation, but nobody do that) and Banshee you need 1150g (1550g if u don't have a slot for Ruby Crystal) I really think that this need to be fixed very soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-28T00:40:45.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot already went over this (sorry, but I haven't been able to find the link to it), but *they don't want to improve its build path*, because it is already a strong item and they would have to nerf it pretty substantially if they implemented this change (which has been suggested several times since preseason).\n\nBasically, Aegis is already a cost effective item that builds into another very strong and popular item (also one less popular but still strong item, yay Banner!), and making the build path even smoother would be a substantial buff to anyone who uses it at all, meaning they would have to nerf the finished item in some way to compensate, or instead leave it in the healthy place it is now.\n\nThis is a case of \"If it ain't broke, don't break it\" where it seems like a good idea, but is like asking for a Sejuani buff right after Cinderhulk came out.","replies":[]}]}
