Players not being good is completely relative. A gold to a bronze is good but a gold to a diamond is bad.

At the end of the day they are both poop. You just want something to feel special about but being gold/plat is nothing special its like getting a c+ on a test sure you did a little bit better but you are not even close to A or A+ level.
