How, in what way is that attractive? Also, what the hell is that growth on her chin, and since we're focusing on the face, she looks like she's about to sneeze... that's not very attractive.\n\n> Is she not pretty?\n\nNo, not anymore.\n\n>Less hair?\n\nToo much.  It _does_ look better in the December version than it did in the October, however, what didn't change was that it's still a tangled mess.\n\n>What is it you don't like and why?\n\nLook at her old pose - it gives off a graceful elegance and makes it seem like she's dancing away from something while the new one looks like she's falling in an awkward uncomfortable position.  \n\nLook at their faces, not only has she seemed to age 15-20 years and gone through a series of plastic surgery procedures, there looks to be enough makeup to make Keith Richards look like he's alive. \n\nLook at the background.  The original was in an Ionian forest, while this new one appears to be a dank, dark, swampy environment.\n\nI mean, they forgot the bell and she had cat ears in the first update, but one great thing I can give them props for is at least she didn't have blue eyes.  Holy shit that would have been terrible following the enraged response from her fanbase from how she was portrayed (completely wrong) in A New Dawn, which is what this splash seemed to be based off of.\n\nThe worst part about this was following the October splash being taken down and replaced with the original, there was rejoice that Riot registered that this didn't hit the mark they were expecting (surprise) and we had the one most of us supported instead.  Two months later, twice the amount of time it apparently takes to create a new splash from scratch,  _minimal _ modifications were made, and in the case of her face, it was even worse.  But they sent it through anyway because of deadlines or something.","replies":[{"poster":"nightsharks","date":"2016-01-11T23:09:42.673+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks, I understand this whole thing a bit better now.  \n\nStill, I don't really get why people are so heated about it. Personally, I believe it further depicts her identity as a soul-sucking vampire fox. She looks darker, less cutesy. Like she'd steal your essence in a heartbeat. I like both splashes. The old one is more traditional, both in setting and style, and the new one has more detail and finesse. \n\n> there looks to be enough makeup to make Keith Richards look like he's alive.\n\n^this made me laugh though.

Why the fuck does that matter. They wanted to make Fiora more of a duelist, they nailed it, and taking the hair out wasn't a bad idea initially, why would you want hair covering your eyes in combat when you are so centered around hitting vitals with accuracy.\n\nAhri evolved from a fucking fox, she's not even full human, so they made that more clear in her facial features, yeah, she's not AS beautiful (still is hot), but she does better reflect her actual lore, same with Fiora.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-01-12T03:30:18.351+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You find Fiora's hair unrealistic because of limiting vision, in the same game that has a blindfolded monk flying around booting people. \n\nAlso there is noting wrong about people complaining about Ahri's face and how they feel it is a misrepresentation of an already well established character.
