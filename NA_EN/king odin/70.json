(1100 Range)\n\nI have not seen this item built since season 4 preseason. Not by top laners nor supports, I personally think that it needs a little buff, maybe some more health so it&#039;s more viable for top laners or possibly point runner. I don&#039;t personally know what exactly would be best but hopefully you all can think of something :)\n\nEdit: I played Shen support in ranked just now and built it after my {{item:3401}}, I got to say it's an amazing item if you have the right team for it. We had {{champion:92}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:90}} and me as {{champion:98}}. Let's say between the 10% life steal and +20 dmg and my Ult and {{item:3401}} we were unkillable. Even {{champion:90}} benefitted from the lifesteal enough. \n\nThough it was a good item I still feel as if it needs more.\n\n( Edit ) http://grabilla.com/0541a-1dcc3bfe-d02a-45af-be04-997ebc3250c1.png","replies":[{"poster":"Gooberp","date":"2015-04-26T03:57:42.051+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I support, my major issue with Zeke's is that it has too much CDR. It's a great niche item, but to be a niche purchase it needs to give 10% CDR so you can fit it into the third/fourth purchase on a support, where they typically will have 5-10% from runes and masteries, 10% from gold item, and 10-20% from Grail/Crucible/Morello's/Locket. For those cases where you buy Crucible or Locket, giving you 25-30% CDR, Zeke's would be a great addition in specific team comps, but you waste 5-10% CDR, making it not worth the cost.\n\nI would personally buy Zeke's a lot more often if it gave 10% CDR and had more defense stats, either higher HP or a meager amount of armor/mr. Lowering the cost as compensation instead of redistributing stats would be unacceptable, as it's already very slot-inefficient.","replies":[{"poster":"Paress","date":"2015-04-26T17:11:34.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zeke soon removed i guess\n\nBecause new Black Cleaver will give more AD, more HP, same CDR\n\nIt is the easy way for Riot like Atma, Executioner's Calling, Soul Shroud ...

These items take precedence over a niche item that may help IF I have the gold resources and the right team.  Been playing bard a lot just because I love the champ and his concept.

It's a niche item. If it were a good item for solo laners, then the aura would make it godlike-OP. So they leave it as a secretly-OP-in-certain-situations-but-not-most-of-the-time (aka niche) item. For comparison, most good junglers/supports recognize the value of an Aegis when the enemy has 2+ AP carries. A good AD or tank jungler/support/(top?) _should_ build Zeke's if they've got 2+ AD teammates, but you're right, it doesn't happen enough.\n\nFun math: Aegis costs 1900, and the stats on the buyer alone are [worth 1603](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Aegis_of_the_Legion#Cost_Analysis) (84% gold efficient). For every ally the aura benefits, its value goes up by 670, for a max of 2680 (225% gold efficient). Zeke's costs 2450 and is [worth 2590](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Zeke%27s_Herald#Cost_Analysis) to the buyer alone (106% gold efficient). The aura is worth 1270 for each ally it benefits, so Zeke's maxes out at 7670 (313% gold efficient). Granted, your mid LeBlanc won't care about the extra AD/LS, but even benefiting just two teammates takes Zeke's gold efficiency up to 209% (almost as much as a _maxed out_ Aegis).\n\nI don't think the problem is that Zeke's is a weak item, but that people forget how good it can be in certain comps.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"anding","date":"2015-04-26T17:08:00.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i regularly build zeke's herald when im on support and it's an amazing item, especially the cdr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bard in a Diaper","date":"2015-04-26T16:02:10.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this game is overloaded with cooldown, 20% is ridiculous and often goes heavily wasted on the people that would build this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xyrne","date":"2015-04-26T13:41:36.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top laners aren't going to bother building an aura item because they don't realize they have a team for the first 30 minutes, and supports aren't going to bother with it unless they're on a 3-4 AD team.

In a comp with a lot of AD the support should probably buy it eventually (don't want to take up a slot on a main damage dealer that could have a better item) but full AD has problems itself and Zeke's Herald doesn't fix them or even help much.\n\nWhat it COULD do is add MAGIC damage to every auto attack in the aura, which would get around some of the armor stacking without needing to be built on a main damage dealer. Not sure how much damage that should be to be useful enough in high AD comps but avoid becoming core in every single game, but I think it might have more potential to find that sweet spot than the current version.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Buttigieg 2020","date":"2015-04-26T02:51:07.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with zekes is that it has a ton of hidden power.
