And I don't just mean her damage (200 per tentacle at lvl 3 *is* a bit much though).\nFrom my understanding, she's supposed to invest in controlling a single area, similar to Heimer. She's a lane bully. I'm fine with that. But her tentacles were spawning just as fast as I could put them down [with my double-tap passive]. I can deal with it in lane, but it's a problem when she roams. It didn't seem like she was actually losing anything by roaming because there was almost always a tentacle nearby with another on the way.\nNow we add the vessel crap in to the mix. If I can't run *away* fast enough, I loose ~1/3 my health bar and now this ridiculous tentacle spawn rate effectively doubles.\n\nBefore that guy shows up: yes, I lost lane (we won the game).

Unless *you're* the vessel.

Though it can make some ganks unsurvivable. My problem was with the tentacle spawn rate. With just her passive, she spawned them as fast as I could kill them. Her power grew exponentially when the tentacles weren't removed. But they come in so fast, that she's not hindered by roaming as her reveal & Q/A implied.\n\nJust finished my second game with 2 Illaoi's (both top this time). The spawn rate still concerns me.\nJust a thought, have her spawn slower the fewer there are nearby. That way she A) actually has to invest in holding an area and B) lane opponents get some actual breathing room rather than having to choose between losing CS or getting 2-shot by an army of tentacles.\n\nBut again, this is after only 2 games. It could well be that my opinion will change after I've gotten better accustomed to her play style.","replies":[{"poster":"TDubH","date":"2015-11-24T20:19:16.424+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since i played with/against her alot in PBE here's some more tips:\nTip 1\ndon't make yourself have to kill all the tentacles, especially if you're ranged just clear one side of tentacles  and keep to that side that you are safe from the majority.\nTip 2\nIf Illaoi is trying to make you the vessel she's attacking YOUR avatar, which means she IS attacking you, but its at a *percentage* of the damage she would do if attacking you DIRECTLY so while you are tanking for yourself you should use your own front line of yourself to attack her, which is direct damage so you will win the trade.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-11-25T00:19:49.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't forget that if you damage Illaoi enough before she kills your spirit, you reclaim your spirit and she can't hit it anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-11-25T01:33:09.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, WHAT!?\nI only knew about the kill 3 tentacles thing.","replies":[{"poster":"TDubH","date":"2015-11-25T04:40:22.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"WAIT, WHAT RIOT MADE A CHAMP WITH COUNTERPLAY BUILT INTO THEIR OWN KIT?\nSINCE WHEN!?!?!?!?!\nhahahaha. yeah, should've mentioned that.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-11-25T07:40:21.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a little circle around the bottom of the spirit, and if all the lights go out your spirit comes back to your body!
