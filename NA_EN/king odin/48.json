I'll unlock the screen to look around when things are going down elsewhere, but I can see just fine thanks to the mini-map and positioning the camera isn't an additional task I want to add to my load in a crisis.  I simply don't see the benefits it offers when I can move the camera freely via the mini-map even when it's locked to my player.  I also find no benefit in learning to play the game a completely different way when I'm never going to be good enough to matter anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IPinPC","date":"2016-12-01T19:59:09.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"How can you even play with locked screen ?

I use to play on a locked screen when I first began to play (for maybe a month). \n\nIt always felt odd to me, since I come from playing RTS games and look around the map a lot. Then I was told by friends in real life, all who are much better than me at this game (they are platinum mostly with one diamond) to stop playing locked.\n\nI toggled it off and immediately noticed improvement in my game. I was still only a silver caliber player when learning and only recently improved as a player over this past season.\n\nI just have a lot more awareness on enemies, how my teammates are doing, and tunnel vision way less.\n\nLocked screen limits your development as a player in order to focus on your personal mechanics. I think it really inhibits your play and while you can probably get to Gold playing with a locked screen, I think you won't climb much higher.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KitsuneKrash","date":"2016-12-02T01:01:34.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually play using Semi-locked & unlock when I gank a lane to better see if the enemy laner reacts so I know if they warded river.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JoeMG","date":"2016-12-02T00:25:42.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first started playing i didn't have a mouse - used the trac pad instead X) so yeah I learned to play on locked screen and have been that way ever since.
