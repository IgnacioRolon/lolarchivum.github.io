It is really crappy when you are playing ranked down one or more people. It would make people tilt less and it just all around sucks. I don't even feel like when i report it anything happens. Maybe if we just had a system of reporting a leave game/AFK in game and got that taken into account. Something please Riot. Players need less AFKs it just sucks so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T00:29:30.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[**Loss Prevention**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753014) is a tool that's used to give sweeping reimbursement when our servers take a dive. It's meant to be an easy way for us to prevent any loss of LP or MMR for lost matches when the fault was on our end. Having one of your teammates afk isn't the best use of the system, since we can't tell if the disconnection was intentional or not. \n\nThe best way to respond to leavers is to report them, and trust that those reports don't go unnoticed. It takes a little more than just one report for something to happen, but without a reporting we'll never notice what happened!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-01T00:45:37.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Broporo. My main issue with this has always been having an AFK on your team in a ranked game. I was wondering if people who AFK in ranked games receive punishments other than a 5 game LPQ? Do they ever getting bans if they AFK frequently enough in ranked games?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T01:48:01.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They still receive escalating punishments based on how often they're leaving and how many reports they're getting. We don't really ban based on games being left, as we can't be sure of the reason or intent. Regardless it does affect others games so we still take action. \n\nI know it can be especially bothersome to have someone AFK in a ranked match, which is why we implemented the [**/remake feature**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686).","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-01T02:26:47.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that's fair.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Northern Emperor","date":"2017-07-03T20:30:30.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that the point of Loss Prevention is for server issues, but the way it is talked about is that the purpose is for when we lose from events beyond our control. I am just under the impression that when someone leaves or is AFK that I have just as much control as I do with a server issue. I also do acknowledge that the point of the /remake feature is to help alleviate that, but it requires at least 3/4 of your team to say yes and it also doesn't take into account later in the game. My issue is when I am playing a ranked game and someone is AFK at 5 minutes and then we lose because they are gone. It just seems to me that something more could be done, because this only seems to be a common issue in ranked games. I do still recognize that Riot is doing things to help, but it still appears that more could be done. If you assured me that more systems or methods were being used I would be perfectly okay with it, but I don't see or hear anything more being done. Thank you for your response.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mcsquzzy","date":"2017-07-01T00:44:38.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel leavers/afk deserve 3X the LP loss","replies":[]}]}
