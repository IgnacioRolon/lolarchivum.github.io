I do not think this is just me, because the Store does not even show that they exist! [EDIT: they do show the Koi Nami chromas and chroma pack individually, but not on the skin itself. Like the little boxes you click] I spent real money on these beautiful colors and hope that I could get a full refund or my colors back! Any  suggestions? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-25T18:07:21.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey fellow Nami player! ^-^ \n\nI have a few questions for you!
