Since so much is happening, there's also a number of different things that could go wrong obviously like game assets not loading or firewalls/antivirus blocking League from working properly. \n\nDo me a favor and run a quick repair through the client settings, since crashing at the same percentage kind of makes me think it might be some damaged or missing game files. If that doesn't help right off the bat, go ahead and run through the other steps in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) as well just to cover the rest of the basics. Make sure to test these tips in a practice or custom game to avoid getting any possible LPQ's for more crashes!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loliconic","date":"2017-12-05T02:05:54.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/4a1AwZa.png\n\nThanks for the 5 games in low priority que Riot.
