You're spamming Q vs Golds who don't know the matchup well enough to realise when they can be all-in'd. And once Riven gets the first kill in lane it is snowball time gg because jungler isn't going to camp the lane to help their laner recover vs Riven. Then  you can look forward to Riven 1v3'ing the team and typing GG EZ NUBZ or OMG MY TEAM SUX I WIN LANE BUT THEY FEED. REPORT! \n\nAs soon as a champ appears in top lane that counters Riven suddenly you start to see just how unskilled these same Riven players are. When I see boxbox play vs Garen, Darius and Hecarim I'm in awe at how well he plays those difficult matchups against extremely skilled players. I watch boxbox play vs Hecarim a lot and it amazes me how well he plays that. That is the high skill cap of Riven.\n\nWhen I play as Hecarim vs Riven players, I see nothing but freelo riders who have no idea what to do when they actually have to use their brain and can't just mash out abilities every time they are on cooldown and if they make a mistake... they can actually be killed instead of being able to just dash away with one of their near infinite dashes or BS movespeed.\n\nWithout fail  50% of these Riven players respond with \"Fucking OP champ Hecarim\".\n\n**TLDR, Riven is high skill cap, but she is extremely strong even in the hands of unskilled players.

Any braindead can dominate with her at lower skill levels.\n\nI mained Yasuo a lot in top lane for about 200 games. I struggled so hard with the Riven matchup. I memorised the timing on all her cooldowns, I watched vids of yasuo players laning against Riven to get an idea of how to play  against her. Eventually I was able to break even in the lane, and sometimes win, but that required intense concentration and one mistake could be fatal, but at the very least I denied her the chance to snowball.\n\nI decided to try out Riven and low and behold first game enemy has a mid yasuo.

All I remembered was from my experience as Yasuo was that when Riven reaches level 6 she can just straight up all in you 100-0 if you make 1 mistake and if Yasuo tries to ffight back he will lose 100% oof the time. Eventually Yasuo makes a poor dash attack and I say fuck it I'M GOING ALL IN!\n\nI spammed some random combination of E, Q and W and then Mashed R at the end, and Yasuo was LITERALLY DELETED FROM MY SCREEN.\nHe comes back to lane, a minute later my ulti is back and I just do the same thing again and again...\n\nWent on to snowball carry the game while literally having no idea wtf I was doing.\nAfter that I was like fuck it I'm not playing Yasuo anymore to get wrecked by clueless Riven players, so I switched to a champ that dumpsters Riven to give them a taste of their own medicine.

Yasuo is in a very bad spot right now on top of that. Your argument as to why she has a low skill floor, is that Riven has an easy time against a champion that SHE COUNTERS post 6. A champion that you just made evident that you mained, and that frustration of you not being able to beat your counter, is likely the reason you posted this thread. \n\nOn top of that, skill doesn't stop being important after laning phase. Ever see a clueless Riven come to a team fight? May as well be a 4v5 because chances are, she's not positioned correctly, or playing her correctly, which is very important in late game. You may be able to get away with not knowing her mechanics well in the lane phase, against something she counters, but once team fights role around, you're going to be very heavy for your team to carry. Your positioning, rotation, as well as timing are all going to be crucial things for you to have a basic understanding of to excel at team fights, and even then, if you know all that, which btw, is basic Riven knowledge required to be a DECENT Riven, all that has to be done, is for someone to drop Exhaust on you, and not only are you in the middle of the enemy team, with all your CD's blown, but now you have no escape, and no damage. Good bye, Riven.\n\n\nGaren, all you do, is run into the team, pop Q if your slowed, and your defensive CD to soak up damage, if you get CC'd back off and try again your Garen, so you're not going to die. Try it again, sit on top of the carries spinning, and then ult Execute. That would be low skill required. Only way to screw that up is if your team wasn't ready to follow up with you.\n\nRiven, Charge up your third Q, if you can't get the pick before Q wears off, wait for CD and try again, position in a bush behind enemy team, if bush is warded, reposition, wait for them to engage, if they don't, you can't fight because you'll just get blown up. When they finally do engage, flash into 3rd Q range, and land the knock up on one of their carries, land one Auto, then W, then Auto again, proc hydra active, then use wind slash. You've successfully blown up 1 person. That is assuming, you someone didn't interrupt your combo, or peeled you off your target. This is a pretty basic Riven team fight combo, that isn't very easy to get right without a bit of practice, and even still, if you don't manage to lock up the entire back line, chances are your combo is going to get interrupted and you're going to get blown up. This combo is very easy to screw up, but yet is one of her easier ones to pull off. \n\nShe definitely doesn't have a low skill floor. It may not be super high, but its definitely not low.\n\nLiterally the only way this can be avoided for a new Riven player, is if the enemy team doesn't group or team fight and you can run around and pick people off all game. Cool part about this? You literally can pick your targets, so you're almost guaranteed to win the fights you choose, as you chose them for a reason. \n\nI also like how you say you swapped to playing champions that dumpster her, so you don't even need to try. Are you aware right now in the tank meta, almost every laner that played commonly top lane, is considered a counter for Riven? Renekton, Jax, Hecarim, Darius, Garen, Fiora, Swain, Pantheon, Cho'gath, Irelia, Volibear, Kennen, Malphite, Shyvanna. The only way she wins any of these match ups, is if she gets ahead early game, and her lane enemy decides to build straight damage over tankiness, and thats not the Riven being easy to play, thats her opponent being an idiot. \n\nThe only lanes she has the advantage in top lane is like.. Nasus, and Vlad, and even then, a good Vladimir and Nasus wont lose lane to a beginner Riven. \n\n\nI swear, Riven threads are all the same. Very little knowledge, a whole lot of crying.","replies":[{"poster":"r11na","date":"2015-05-09T00:23:40.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":">I also like how you say you swapped to playing champions that dumpster her, so you don't even need to try.
