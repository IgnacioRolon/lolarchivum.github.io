Being deaf doesn&#x27;t effect your ability to read or write. If anything, being deaf would make you less likely to have mistakes that come from words or phrases sounding similar when spoken, making you better at writing than someone who had their hearing.\n\nThis is an old post, but it's w.e.\n\nI took an ASL class in college bout 2 years ago. It is a fact that deaf people have worse schools to go to than regular people. Plus if you cannot hear properly you wouldn't know how something sounds or is supposed to be said. If you cannot say something properly how can you write it properly(talking grammar here btw). \n\nBut yea for some reason deaf schools don't have the actual tools to improve a deaf person's academic needs. I think it was middle school level most of them get to. There is however a community with a very good school, but again it is a community. Which means people have to actually move there to go to this school. Not saying there aren't many schools for the deaf culture. Just saying that there are many that are not at the level they should be at for teaching.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2018-03-26T08:17:00.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"On the upside, you don't ever have to worry about muting pings...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-12-19T23:03:36.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot doesn't tolerate slurs.
