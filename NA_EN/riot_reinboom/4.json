Lots of small changes add up to huge swings in what champions look like coming out of their first clear.\nWhat this means for us is that it's hard to balance early jungle without some more insight, so we're calling on you guys to help. \n\nWe're putting a change that is **PBE ONLY** to help build this shared understanding of how junglers jungle individually: A set of buffs that track your jungle progress in the first portion of the jungle.\n\nBy giving us a direct peak at how you interact with the jungle you give us a chance to improve it. Maybe by making a mechanism more clear, rebalancing a camp, or many other systems. But first this type of information would help us know **which** systems.\n\nHere's what the buffs look like:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GqqauMg.png\n(The primary buff)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/13KFFU4.png\n(After taking 1 camp. In this case, Krugs)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/B12h25a.png\n(After taking 2 camps. Krugs and then Razorbeaks)\n\nIt would be super useful to get these value from you guys from champions you expect to play in the jungle. I'm especially interested in the contrast of:\nThe results of these after you tried it how you normally play the jungle.\nAnd\nThe results of these after you tried to optimize beyond what you normally do (possibly with the help of these buffs).\n\nPlease post your findings here: http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/eEWEardJ-request-screenshots-of-jungle-stats :) ","replies":[{"poster":"straight4free","date":"2015-02-17T10:54:11.233+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"Could this potentially be moved to Custom games or even normals in the future?

I usually start (and Smite) Gromp and then Blue, walking towards red with both pots used, and having Smite up barely in time to kill the Brambleback before it kills me. Then I usually make the risky move of ganking mid or top (even though my HP is quite low) if I see the laner pushed and if I'm successful, it reeeeeally helps me get my game going, but if it doesn't look well it's #1 priority to not die and lose double buffs because it's really hard to recover from that.\n\nI start Q, then E and most often I will get E again lvl3 if I'm going for a gank, Q if I can't, and rarely W if I see that being more useful to get in (or out) that early gank than the extra dmg on another spell. I will get Trailblazer for my second clear and switch it to Stalker's when it's time for serious ganking and immediately enchant with Devourer. Then I like getting Cutlass, Wit's End and upgrade BoRK for that mulptiple on-hit burst damage, since nowadays AD on-hit feels like the only working build on Eve (I liked to play her more Hybrid but well).\n\nI hope this is useful, either for insight into this particular champ or just in general!","replies":[{"poster":"ChangelingRain","date":"2015-02-17T15:31:07.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know how E applies on-hit effects now?

I also follow a couple of streamers and youtubers and see just how good she is when you can properly use her (unlike me atm), and well, I just fail to see relevant tradeoffs.
