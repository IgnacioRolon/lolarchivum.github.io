Reina \"Riot Reinboom\" Sweet here bringing you an update about tooltips.\n\nTooltips in League are both one of the most important features in the game as well as, somehow, one of the least updated. They have gone from the time before season 1 to now with nary a change beyond some color changes and a couple lines added to keep things separated.\n\nThat lack of change wasn&rsquo;t without reason. Each attempt at them was met with the scary overbearing cloud of &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot of champions. And a lot of languages to translate those changes into. Oh no.&rdquo;\n\nWell, we&rsquo;ve decided to finally take that plunge into updating them, and trying to solve one of the bigger problems the LoL tooltips face.\n\nThis dev corner covers the problems we&rsquo;re trying to solve, the current progress, and some future looking things. And to call out that for those future looking things, ***this is all very much a work in progress*** we would love your feedback on. :) \n\n#The Big Problem\nFor League, tooltips serve two major use cases:\n\n**In the moment** - &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the main thing that happens if I press this button?&rdquo; With a bit more familiarity this becomes more nuanced like &ldquo;what&rsquo;s my cooldown?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what&rsquo;s my highest damage skill?&rdquo;\n**All the details** - &ldquo;How do I maximize this ability&rsquo;s potential and use it most effectively?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a lot of parts to League, from items to which position you&rsquo;re in, and understanding how those parts hook together requires a lot more detailed information.\n\nBy trying to serve both cases the current tooltips manage to serve neither very well.\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of this are scaling values (aka ratios). Let&#039;s look at Ezreal&#039;s Mystic Shot:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DvzQnZc.png\n\n\nPretty simple tooltip, but there&rsquo;s some problems. &ldquo;dealing 15 (+79)(+0) physical damage&rdquo; lets us math out that it deals 104 damage (before mitigation) pretty easily, sure, but doing the math can still take up time when every moment counts. Worse though is if you want to know what you should buy. To arrive at that Mystic Shot has 1.1x Attack Damage ratio requires an annoying bit of division and you entirely don&rsquo;t get to know what the Ability Power ratio is until you buy an item.\n\nSo, here we&#039;re off the mark with &quot;**In the moment**&quot; and completely missed with &quot;**All the details**&quot;. If we try to fill the tooltip to the brim with information to solve for &ldquo;**All the details**&rdquo; we will end up a cluttered mess unless we sacrifice showing your current damage that &ldquo;**In the moment**&rdquo; asks for. Either way, we lose the &ldquo;**In the moment**&rdquo; case needed for faster decision making. This problem isn&rsquo;t exclusive to how abilities scale, either. Many tooltips tread the line between the two worlds poorly even when describing the non-numerical parts of how a spell functions.\n\n\n##Proposed Solution\nWe think we can tackle these issues by presenting two options; one option to show the &quot;RIGHT NOW&quot; and another option to deep dive further.\n\nEnter &quot;Press [Shift] for more info&quot;\nWe just give each ability two tooltips serving each need.\n\nThere&rsquo;s a preview of this feature with the Aatrox update:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jQjmVyF.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5zgPie6.png\n\n\n##Future Looking\nThis type of feature isn&#039;t new to other games. But, it&#039;s still new to League and we really need your feedback on where to take it for the sake of LoL specifically. Consider Aatrox more like the &quot;first flare for feedback&quot; rather than a declaration of where all tooltips will go.\n\nWith each champion update and new champion we will take another attempt at landing in a better spot about what the correct mix of information is, and potentially other small new features. All the more feedback on these you can provide, the better we will get them.\n\nOne clear example of feedback we&rsquo;ll be acting on is the demand for &ldquo;let me just always see more info!&rdquo;. Look forward to the option for exactly that in an upcoming patch.\n\n\n\n##Future Future Looking\nUnfortunately, there&rsquo;s some parts of the tooltips we simply can&rsquo;t upgrade due to constraints imposed by how we originally built them... ***for now***.\n\nWe&rsquo;re in the middle of tearing apart the pieces of every tooltip in the game and reconstructing them in a very VERY new way behind the scenes. Some new things (like &ldquo;Press [Shift] for more info&rdquo;) we can release individually, but many new features we cannot. Once everything is over to the new system though (tentative sometime during preseason) you can look forward to some larger scale changes!\n\nAnd to really hit that idea, here&rsquo;s a look at Ezreal&#039;s Mystic Shot we&#039;re testing internally (VERY WORK-IN-PROGRESS):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pCWsh2y.png\n(&quot;**In the Moment**&quot; version)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xm5Z4fV.png\n(&quot;**All the details**&quot; version. Note: The &quot;+1.1&quot; and &quot;+0.4&quot; are ratios and not totals).\n\n\nAnd that&#039;s where the tooltip update project is at right now! Let us know your thoughts, and what use cases you want tooltips to serve!","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-07-12T18:15:32.645+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"I generally like all the details (and so envision myself using that option), but it would be nice if all the details also showed the final result (e.g. \"15 (+1.1)(+0.4)=94 physical damage\" so I really have everything of interest on that single tool tip.\n\nedit: Also, if showing all the details was the default option (and the above isn't incorporated), could hitting shift with that option enabled show us the in-the-moment details?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2018-07-12T18:20:13.727+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mysticman89,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=yIBUoyaP,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-07-12T18:15:32.645+0000)\n>\n> I generally like all the details (and so envision myself using that option), but it would be nice if all the details also showed the final result (e.g. &quot;15 (+1.1)(+0.4)=94 physical damage&quot; so I really have everything of interest on that single tool tip.\n> \n> edit: Also, if showing all the details was the default option (and the above isn&#x27;t incorporated), could hitting shift with that option enabled show us the in-the-moment details?\n\nIn the interim time to the full release we're not able to do that. Once everything is converted over in the new system, having shift be \"flip between the two\" is definitely a possibility.","replies":[{"poster":"top very die","date":"2018-07-14T16:44:50.223+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is really unnecessary to include the little AP/AD icons, they take up a lot of reading space and can be replaced with the actual amount added like 1.1(50)+1.4(25) in the different colors. The colors are standard at this point and pretty much everyone recognizes them as AP/AD, and new players will figure it out pretty quickly based on physical damage and magic damage being similar colors to AP/AD ratio numbers.\n\nOne additional problem is the lack of a option in the client to enable details on always. I glance at the abilities quickly sometimes to see specific details and holding shift while doing that is a pain. Just a simple option in the interface options or whatever.\n\nDetails should also show the final damage of the ability. Not the 50+12+50 or whatever, but just 112 around the end. You leave out details in the detail menu with your Ezreal version. Just because its on the normal screen doesn't mean it should be taken out of the more detailed version.\n\nAlso, wording should be the same across both. Players when using the shift (I will not, I would really appreciate an option to have it on always) will most likely read part, want the details, then the wording is a bit different for no reason. It conveys the same information in the same space. This is a problem with Aatrox's version.\n\nAnother thing, you are safe to include tear and mana cost reduction stuff in the information. For instance: ezreal Q being 28 mana and having 10% of that refunded equals 25.2 mana cost, and include in brackets the original cost like below. You can also include cooldown reduction on top of that.\n\n3.3s (5.5s) \n25 (28) Mana","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ImaginesTigers","date":"2018-07-12T18:14:11.567+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! This looks sweet. One of the issues players seem to be having with Aatrox's tooltips, though, is that information is hidden under the shift key when it's information that should really be readily available (I know his E grants him attack damage; I'm looking at the tooltip to determine how much). Basic numbers should always be available, I feel.\n\nWhat I would love: some communication for AD champions on whether some abilities scale with total AD or bonus AD. An example of this is Caitlyn, who has both ratios for bonus and total on different abilities. She was just the first one that came to mind but there's loads of examples. Any comments on those instances? :)\n\nAdditionally: if you're going ahead with this, there are some champions that could really benefit from more information. For example, Taliyah's Q damage is really hard to determine for most players, and varies against champions, minions, monsters. Ahri's W tooltip provides a \"maximum single target damage\" stat. Is there a way to get that in for some other champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2018-07-12T18:41:28.687+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox:\nYeah, consider Aatrox's tooltips a proof of concept that should still get some iteration. We're still getting a feel of what a good balance of information is.\n\nBonus/Total AD: I totes agree! Currently, I'm leaning towards more of an iconography route to describe this. If you note the little Axe on Ezreal, maybe there's a tiny + or a chevron or similar next to it denoting \"bonus\". Or the inverse. We're still trying to figure out the best way to communicate this split. This same issue also applies to health scaling as well, though in far less frequency.\n\nAnd totally agreed that lots of champions (and items, and other things) need some updates.","replies":[{"poster":"top very die","date":"2018-07-14T16:53:59.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not just a t or a b next to the ratio number? This \"iconography\" seems like a way to make it look fancy without real substance, they are way too big as well and are about looking pretty instead of telling me something I don't already know.\n\nIf you want them just for looking pretty and making it just look better than the original, include them in the \"in the moment\" version to denote what ratio helps what, without showing the actual ratio number.\n\nIcons are redundant because they show the exact same information as the numbers and color, and are obviously just included because someone thought they'd look cool, with no other reason. Putting a + or omitting it or whatever is more vague and strange than actually typing the word bonus or total out and it damn near takes up the same space. \n\nThe only way these icons are actually useful is if its in the 'in the moment' version, as the purpose for the non-detailed page is to show basic information.\n\nIf you really want your tooltips to look pretty, why not include a small bar graph icon about the size of 1-2 lines that shows which is larger for the in the moment version, which are helpful at a glance and show pretty accurately even with a quarter of a second look which is larger.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Elbani","date":"2018-07-12T18:14:07.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tooltip says 15(+79)(0) for Ezreal's mystic shot.

Let us know your thoughts, and what use cases you want tooltips to serve!\n\nLooking at the **Ezreal** example, I think it delivers in a way the **Aatrox** example doesn't. For example, to me, knowing that the damage increases by 25% is actually really different from knowing that it increases by 5% -- and that one extra number doesn't complicate things further while giving me a very good indication of the power increase I get as a reward -- important for training people to use the Edge of the effect more. I also think the Ezreal example would benefit from something that says \"fires a bolt of energy *that damages the first enemy hit*\", as some bolts in *League* pass through, and others don't. Hell -- Ezreal *himself* has both first-target and pass-through bolts.\n\nI also wonder how your icons will distinguish between base AD and bonus AD, or bonus health/base health, which I feel is important to convey. Since the complicated visuals already require a bit more reading, I wonder if simply saying ***+1.1 bonus AD [XX]*** might not be the best solution here, where [XX] shows you the current damage gained. So that line might look like this:\n\n**Ezreal fires a bolt of energy that hits the first target struck, dealing 15 (+1.1 total AD [90]) (+0.4 AP [40]) physical damage (applies on-hit effects)**\n\nIt's also a little odd seeing **bonus damage** as a stat, when nothing in the text of the ability implies that the effect adds bonus damage, but rather seems to imply that it has a flat damage value. I'd consider either rephrasing it as \"Ezreal files a bolt of energy, dealing attack damage + 15 (0.1 total AD) (0.4 AP) bonus physical damage\" or changing \"bonus damage\" to simply \"damage\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"IzzŸ","date":"2018-07-12T18:15:46.417+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have one issue with the \"Press [Shift] for more info\" build - I always want the more detailed information.

I think players should have access to as much information about their champion as possible to make the best decisions about how to itemise and understand where their damage or utility is coming from.\n\nHowever, I feel that creating two types of tooltip (one simple explanation and a detailed version) creates an unnecessary amount of work, when instead work could be done to make the tooltip layout consistent across the board.\n\nAnd the key word here is **consistency**. Players will get confused if the same stats are referenced in different colours, or abilities with similar characteristics are described differently.\n\nWith all that said, I made my own mock-ups of how I think tooltips should be laid out.\n\n**SIMPLE**\n\n[MY VERSION](https://imgur.com/bfxWwE3)\n\n* **1** -- Adding the ability ratios to the top of the tooltip. I think this is the perfect place for ratio scalings to be placed. You even had to clarify yourself, Reinboom, that in the detailed view the numbers inside the ability text were not totals but were in fact ratios. This would confuse the player when they read through the ability. Removing them from the ability text ensures players don't get confused. I also changed the colour of the physical damage ratio for consistency (It was previously a very light brick colour). If colours are going to distinguish damage types and differentiate stats, the colours need to be consistent.\n\n* **2** -- Explaining the ability in more detail. A simple tooltip should not be \"simple\" so to speak. If you really wanted a simple explanation of Ezreal's Mystic Shot you could just write \"Ezreal shoots a bolt of damage\". A good tooltip should explain to the player how an ability behaves in a concise and unambiguous manner. In my opinion that doesn't mean it can't contain a lot of information, or as much info as possible without being overwhelming. In hindsight, you could even expand my description further to say \"stopping at the first target hit\".\n\n* **3** -- Tooltip interaction. This previously said \"press\", but you do in fact have to hold the chosen key to access detailed information.\n\nOverall the tooltip is simple so as not to confuse new players, while also containing relevant information that any players will find useful and can easily see at a glance.\n\n**DETAILED**\n\n[MY VERSION](https://imgur.com/3y6szfl)\n\n* **1** -- Ability damage breakdown. This is pretty much the way tooltips are structured now, but with the addition of the ability ratios present at the top of the tooltip, a player can see where the ability's damage is mainly coming from. Worth noticing is how I labelled the ability base damage in white. I think it's important to distinguish base damage from bonus damage provided by stats, mostly so new players aren't confused.\n\n* **2** -- Just fixing a categorisation error; this previously said \"bonus damage\", whereas the text is referencing the ability base damage.\n\nOverall this detailed tooltip not only provides more information but is still easy to read due to colour consistency and tooltip layout.\n\nI also created another example with a much more complex ability, Riven's Q. [(Current tooltip for reference)](https://imgur.com/pQYWpUF)\n\n**SIMPLE** \n\n[MY VERSION](https://imgur.com/GSa19QA)\n\n**DETAILED**\n\n[MY VERSION](https://imgur.com/XJHDnH6)\n\n I believe even with the large amount of information in the tooltip, it isn't overwhelming and the layout and wording (which I changed) makes it much clearer. The language in the tooltip is just as important as the numbers!\n\nAnyway I really appreciate that something is finally being done about tooltips! Looking forward to some good changes hopefully. :)\n\n**TL;DR** just look at the pictures and tell me what you think lol","replies":[{"poster":"e4zyphil","date":"2018-08-07T11:56:22.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really like your concept to have the ratios on top for better visibility. keep in mind that some champs ratios scale with channel time like vi's Q and varus Q, so you can't put one ratio number for every ability. also some champs have different scalings for their active and passive and such. amumu with his E on the PBE atm for example. he's getting a scaling for his ad reduction passive on his E, while he has another scaling for his active E. if you just put a ratio on top this will cause confusion which scaling refers to which part of the ability. it should be clear on which part of the ability the scaling is referring to.\ni disagree with the needed extended description of his Q in terms of \"in a straight line\".\ni think this is the place where simplicity really takes place. the ability can be best described if seen and maybe add that it stops at the first enemy for the additional contrast to his W, which is nearly the same but it goes through enemies.\nbut is this really necessary? i think a straight tooltip with only numbers would be enough for the most of the lol community because nobody looks up an ezreal Q to see how the ability works. press Q, something happens. like, for every champ. i don't know how much information really should be put into this considering that you could just press it and see what happens, which no text could describe better.\n\nkind regards","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"thefance","date":"2018-07-13T16:49:53.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, the Mystic Shot example looks great. \n\nMy only suggestion is to evenly space the values for \"Bonus Damage\", \"Cooldown\", and \"Mana Cost\" such that they form a grid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GilGaMeSh Jr","date":"2018-07-13T15:50:11.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOLY SHIT!!

If she lives, she is gloriously reborn\" with no mention of numbers at all, including CD, the armor/MR change (I didn't know about that till I went to the wiki) or duration of the egg.

In the simplified version you can quickly glance how much and what type of damage you deal, all the calculations are done, and in the moment it really helps.\n\nThe \"Detailed\" version on the other hand, while yes, it does provide much more detail and is really great to see(Especially the ratios, thank you) the fact that you have to calculate the damage in your head during the game is a bit baffling and counter-intuitive. As some comments pointed out, the final calculation of the damage and damage type in the detailed version would be much better. Its absence is also perplexing in the detailed version due to the sheer amount of dead space in it. The current mana cost has no reason to be under the current cooldown in the top right, and creates a lot of unused space.\n\nI made a quick mock-up of what maybe would be useful for the detailed version and could put some of that dead space to use.\nhttp://puu.sh/AVqLA/986e86d0c0.png\n\nAlso I dont see much point in knowing future rank cooldowns and mana costs. That information is still present in the the ability level up and honestly I dont think you need to know what its going to be in future ranks, the use cases for such knowledge are very very niche imo and rarely useful. What could be used, instead of providing the ratios in this iteration in the main area, it should go back to the old way of showing the amount of damage converted from those ratios. The ratios themselves should replace the future Mana cost or Cooldown part of the view in the bottom.\n\nOverall just adding the total damage calculated to the detailed view is my pressing concern, since playing the switch back and forth between the streamlined and detailed versions kinda goes against the clarity principles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shentorianus","date":"2018-07-12T21:55:28.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just add cast time and range and we're dota","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2018-07-12T19:00:34.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you going to add in the range of the abilities in the tooltip also?

Like healing being shown as a green number on the tooltip, etc.\n\nAre the numbers you have listed at the bottom of the tooltip going to be the standard, moving away from how the per rank tooltip that exists now? (The one that shows you the increase in numbers if you rank the ability on level is)\n\nWhat are some of the constraints you're referring to?

The left side should stick to having only trivial information. The thing about the cooldown and mana however is that they don't follow the same format. You have an icon followed by the amount for the cooldown and the amount followed by the type of energy, in this case mana. It kinda feels like the icon was thrown in there for the sake of having it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fargo79","date":"2018-07-17T11:06:12.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They really need to make all champ stats and abilities available when a person clicks on a champ and looks up what their abilities do.. not just give a VERY brief description.
