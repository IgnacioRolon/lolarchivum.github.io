Squishy early game? Cool down reliant? Ranged harass? Those aren't weakness of Riven, exactly, but rather the characteristics of the type of champion she is. Squishy early game? Most assasin-esque bruisers have this exact same thing. Cool down reliant? Well, she is a resourcless champion, after all. She is only gated by cool downs and since she has a bit of \"hidden\" power in her passive with spell casts, her regular non-empowered AAs pale in comparison. Ranged harass? Melee champion. But this isn't much of a weakness unless that ranged champion has some hard cc/soft cc and an escape. Riven will still dash across the lane and slice your face off. Plus that nifty AD scaling shield to soak up the damage that also happens to be a dash to close the distance.\n\nWhat weaknesses, are there, really? And not just general weaknesses based on her characteristics that her kit otherwise solves.

I've been listening to a thousand different people give their opinion on Riven, but I've never been sure what Riot meant for her to be good at, especially in the context of present-day champion design and philosophy. Obviously she's maneuverable and is meant to deal sustained damage. On paper, those are the two things she's meant to do with her ult finishing off targets. Is that how she operates though? From my understanding, her best case is canceling all of her animations to compress her damage into as short a time frame as possible. She's a sustained champ who works best as faux-burst champ. That may be a slight exaggeration, but it is true that between her animation canceling, her CC, her short cooldowns and her CDR stacking she can get around the time delay of her damage output while keeping an opponent in place (albeit briefly).

The best thing about the changes is how they remove some of her excessive/annoying strength without making her worse at anything necessary. There's less frustration of \"why does this person with 4 dashes also get to run faster than me?\" and her ultimate has gone from being completely impossible to avoid to very unlikely, but reasonably possible.

Broken Wings and Ki Burst both displace/stun in an AOE around her.  Stunned minions aggro resets and any calls for help they received are ignored.  Then Valor shields any other damage she would have received.  This gives her a ton of lane control and allows Riven to dance on peoples faces a midst even huge enemy minion waves.  \n\nOther champs have to move out of aggro range or go out of vision range in order to drop aggro and that should remain consistent with Riven.\n\nSimply put hard CC should not reset minion aggro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Affinity2","date":"2015-05-07T23:32:16.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AEMfAaLy,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-05-07T17:54:05.822+0000)\n>\n> We're testing a reduction to Riven's ult's travel speed to give her opponents a bit more time to react to it at longer range.

He'll go cinderhulk and thornmail whereas Riven will go blood thister/cleaver and tiamat. His ult is different in that it's more for chopping away health over time, whereas Riven's is to execute.

Slice and Dice can also be casted faster. Renekton could easily slice behind Riven, AA-Stun-AA-Q-Dice and deal 300-500 damage. Renekton can punish Riven very harshly for initiating on him. But Renekton is just that type of champ really.\n\nYou could also pick Yorick to zone out Riven.

For example, she holding the blade behind her as it would start growing green before realeasing Wind Slash? \n\nA casting animation would solve the problem of never seing it coming and there wouldn't be the problem of nerfing the skill to the point it nearly becomes useless compared to it's main intention (finishing off weak foes) or a matter of luck. Especially if you make the player still be able to move while casting the Wind Slash and it will then fire towards the location where the mouse is when it ends the cast, that way if the foe gets hit it's because they didn't manage to avoid it, as they had a clear warning of what was comming.\n\nActually a casting animation for other champions would really solve some \"unfairness\" problems, like Annie's ult for example, she could have a casting animation in with she would throw Tibbers like a Zigg's bomb and where it ended at Tibbers would transform, this way foes would know what was comming and how to avoid it,  instead of simply getting a sudden Tibbers to the face and die instantly.\n\nThere's probably more champions that some kind of a casting/channeling animation wouldn't hurt instead of the instant use, especially if you allow a player to move while it's channeling the cast, requiring skill from the player to succeed hitting (making it more interesting and challening) while foes can't complain abaut \"not seeing it comming\". Better then nerfing to a point that a skill either needs to be buffed somehow or ends up really not being a threat at all.\n\nNot saying this nerf to Riven is making Wind Slash useless, but I just think that a simple casting/channeling animation could save alot of work to the balance team, especially towards more champions then just Riven.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-05-07T13:27:52.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ideally you don't want to nerf a champion's strenths, but make their weaknesses worse.

Largely because A) she has a shield that scales off of AD, which is never a good thing, and B) she has a stun whose damage is also based off of AD, with very little counterplay aside from flashing away before she dashes.\n\nI want to propose two possible ideas. The first is making her shield scale either off of bonus health, or not at all (a la Jarvan's shield ability), and having her stun damage either AP based or bonus health based. Anything that takes out free power scaling from building nothing but AD is a plus for Riven.\n\nSecondly, her charge system. Right now, she is encouraged to use her abilities to stick to people, because abilities make her autoattacks more effective. Since her abilities are on such low cooldown, however, this doesn't really feel rewarding so much as free extra damage that's up all the time. What I would propose is that the charges go THE OTHER WAY. Here, autoattacking would build her charges, and her abilities would be more effective based on how many charges she has. They can still be used without her charges, but, say, her oh-so-exploitable stun would be a slow if you used it without any charges built up, but would stun people when you have charges built up. Every use of an ability would absorb one of those charges, and the power of the ability would depend on how many charges you had when you used it. The exception to this could be her ult: it will absorb ALL the charges, and during her ult (until she either releases it or it just wears off), all her abilities would function as if they were used at full charge capacity, or at the charge capacity she was at before her ult. This way, the charge-building mechanic she has would feel a little more rewarding, I believe, and more like a bit of power that you worked hard to build instead of just...free autoattack damage when you spam your abilities.\n\nSo, for example, lets say the cap on your charges is 4. You've just last-hit four minions, so those charges are available to use. You dash, giving you a sizeable shield (max charge level), then stun for a decent amount(level 3), then do your three Q slashes (which absorb only one charge total, level 2). In this example, the shield would've had the strongest \"charge\" scaling, since it was used when you had 4 charges; it then absorbs one charge. Unless you auto-attacked before hitting the target, the stun would have had a third-level \"charge\" scaling, and so would've stunned for a good bit of time, but not as long as if it was used at max charges; another charge gone. Next, the three slashes with Q would've done decent damage, but it would NOT burst someone down too quickly, as it was used with only 2 charges stored; now you're down to one charge. Here, you could potentially ult, but if the ult is modified to follow all the other ability patterns, it would only have a 1-charge effectiveness; all abilities used during ult would only be as effective as if you had one charge built, and no charges are built or consumed during ult. Might possibly make ult either automatically place you at max charges, or give two charges when used.\n\nThe charges would have to have a LONG duration on them, so that you could, say, max it out doing red buff (if you wanna try jungle Riven), then walk down to bot/top lane to pwn somebody. When they DO fall off, they do so one at a time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-05-08T05:54:22.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Change her stun into a slow and Riven will be fair.
