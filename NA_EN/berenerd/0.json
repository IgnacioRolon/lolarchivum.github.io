I have read the other posts and what were said and I have tried it all. I have re installed and hell, I even formatted and reloaded windows 10 onto my computer and this just gets worse every day.  Is it possible something is being corrupted server side where the profile sits?  I know I am not the only one having this issue. I don't play professionally, I am a casual. I understand that I don't bring in as much money as the pro, but please find a fix and not a workaround for this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T00:38:34.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're config settings shouldn't change themselves mid-game, and if so there's something else entirely affecting them.
