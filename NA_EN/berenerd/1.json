I understand that, but I am getting annoyed where I am getting this every 4-5 games and I haven't even logged out, I just went from one game to another. It is really getting annoying when it happens and I have to listen to my team say how they are reporting me for leaving and coming back and yadda.  Is it so much to ask for a perm fix? Every time I try to work with Support they say delete these files or its a network setting. I need to find out what is corrupting these files.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T01:43:31.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're definitely fixing those damaged config files the right way, but you need to add a couple additional steps to ensure they don't just revert back to how they were. Follow these steps one by one, and you should be set!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-07-11T07:11:49.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't he say that he was doing that\nI think that was the fix...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Berenerd","date":"2017-08-13T03:44:04.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am doing all of that, but like tonight, I was going from one URF to another and I had to log out to delete those files again. I hadn't even left the game idle and they got corrupt. There has to be something more I am missing. I would say its my AV but I have set it to not scan that folder, I have set it to not scan at all, I have even switched scanners 3-4 times. I have tried a fresh install of windows and LoL client.","replies":[]}]}
