Usually these errors are driver or game file related, but it could also be a security setting such as an antivirus blocking them from being accessed.\n\nFor now, stick to custom games and go through the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot.  \n\nShould the issue continue then our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide should help make sure that League is being added as an exception.\n\nI know that's a few steps, but getting a bug splat in champ select is pretty rare so we want to make sure everything gets covered.","replies":[]}]}
