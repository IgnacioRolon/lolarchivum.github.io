So, we have until around September/November or, at the latest, January 2020.\n\nBe sure to upvote post. I doubt we'll get a get response until it's too late...

If you want though, I'd recommend sending in a player support ticket asking if there is any information on this matter and if not that you'd like to see a public address.\n\nNo problem on the upvote, good luck on the level ups!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-18T10:05:41.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kikiyu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xNJz2Yxe,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-16T20:41:19.340+0000)\n>\n> I know that macs don&#x27;t get a lot of love\n\nAnd now you know why. =\\","replies":[]}]}]}
