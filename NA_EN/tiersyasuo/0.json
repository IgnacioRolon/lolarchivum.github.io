I get 3 refunds on my account from the time I make it and yet there are so many limitations on it, why am I not allowed to refund a champion just because I have a skin for it, why am I not able to refund random champion shards. \n\nThis is pretty ridiculous considering we only get 3, and not aloud aloud to obtain anymore. So my question here is why so many limitations on something that is already limited already. we only get 3 \n\nI was trying to save up to 3200 ip so I can refund Karma and afford to get a 6300 ip champion, then later realize I can't even refund here and I'm guessing it is because I own a skin for her. Riot I find this really, well, Stupid and I should be able to use my refunds more freely or gain a way for us to obtain more refunds if we are being limited the use for them so much.\n\nthanks\n-Rengore","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-25T23:19:41.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked at your account to see if there is anything we could do to help you get Karma refunded. I did see that you do still have a refund token left! \n\nIf you write into us in a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), we'll be able to refund Karma (you'll still keep her skins) in exchange for your last refund token.","replies":[{"poster":"TIERSYASUO","date":"2017-03-25T23:20:18.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much, I'll do that right away thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
