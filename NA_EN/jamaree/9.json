More or less every depiction of him is the same, griseled angry war vet who was traumatized by the loss of his family and is willing to cross the line of to murderer to do what needs to be done. Sure he has had spats with other super heroes, Daredevil, Spiderman, Captain America who all follow a general don&#039;t kill kind of mindset to his, eye for an eye kind of thing, but where do you think he fits on the alignment table?\r\n\r\nHe ain&#039;t Lawful, that is for sure, kind of his thing that he isn&#039;t, so he falls under the Chaotic Spectrum, but do you think he would be more so Neutral or Good? Do remember he isn&#039;t all bad. He has helped lots of people before, defending and helping kidnapped people get their lives back together, given money to people that needed it, won&#039;t kill innocent, might bloodied them up if they get in his way, but he won&#039;t kill them.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think, Chaotic Good or Neutral?","replies":[]}
