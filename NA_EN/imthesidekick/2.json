Syndra. Aurelian Sol. Kindred. zil even bard would be god tier\r\n\r\neven zed master of shadows. morde who basically has a massive army and cant be killed (can but cant.. who can get to his remains? ) Illinois who has a god fight for ... sorry.. with her or ekko who can rewind time to repeat a fight till he wins.. taric cuz powers\r\n\r\nall of these would be way stronger then lets say... teemo... ashe.. trist... J4. garen and so on\r\n\r\nAnyways my Question is. will we be getting a new reason why all these champions are brought together and are fighting?\r\nwhy would ashe fight her husband tryda? or vi fight her partner cait? why would peace loving karma fight a time rewinding good kid, and sure we all can see why Garen would fight Darius or Kat but why would he fight J4?\r\n\r\nI know there doesn&#039;t need to be a reason why or how they can fight each other, but wouldn&#039;t it be cool if there was? again XD","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-01-13T17:39:42.016+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"My perspective: It's exactly as you stated. Limiting a champion's power for them to be brought into an arena severely limits the kinds of characters we can create. Suddenly, my job would be less about creating (hopefully) compelling characters with flaws and disproportionate power levels or gods and myths, and more about figuring out justifications and explanations for why champions are not at their full potential or how a yordle could kill a star god. This isn't to say we are eschewing rules, but rather embracing a different set. As a writer, I don't want to have to explain gameplay via story and character. My goal is to have story and character enhance the game play fantasy. \n\nAgain, as someone who was not involved in the decision, but is working within League on the narrative team, this is how it impacts my role, and the strengths that I see in divorcing gameplay from the story world. Is it painful to players who loved the old lore? It would be remiss of me to ignore it or write it off. Our goal is to be true to the characters over the old story, because everything is character. \n\nThe story world opens up when you don't have to justify why Kennen can zap Kindred to death (?) or why Tahm Kench can devour Bard in game. Instead, we can focus on characters, relationships, their world, and their stories, all of which reinforce the gameplay. \n\nDoes this help? Please forgive me if I inserted my foot in my mouth somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheSideKick","date":"2017-01-13T18:01:47.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, thanks for replying.\n\nNow to answer your question, \"does this help?\" yes and no.\n\nThe Yes part would be something like:  I know if was not one persons decision. and that it can be hard to give such a massive game with so many champions of different \"main\" character / champions their own story. they find a way for them interact\n\nThe No part would be something like: Figuring out a reason to why they can go from god mode to a less being of power shouldn't inhibit what you can create... only make it more challenging. after all look at Sol's story. he was given a reason why he was brought to his knees by Humans when he is a god.\nthere will always be a way some spell. artifact. rule or even self imposed weakness could power drop a being... and it doesn't even have to be imposed on the champions. as a example. what if Summoners rift is a divine place of power that every one wants to take control of? but to do so it pits each group against each other, and part of the trial is they must fight at equal power\n\n\nEither way I love the game. and maybe I think about it to much. but I still think the story and game play should be connected in some same way XD","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-01-13T18:50:22.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImTheSideKick,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=49bsMMdE,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-01-13T18:01:47.814+0000)\n>\n> First off, thanks for replying.\n> \n> Now to answer your question, &quot;does this help?&quot; yes and no.\n> \n> The Yes part would be something like:  I know if was not one persons decision. and that it can be hard to give such a massive game with so many champions of different &quot;main&quot; character / champions their own story. they find a way for them interact\n> \n> The No part would be something like: Figuring out a reason to why they can go from god mode to a less being of power shouldn&#x27;t inhibit what you can create... only make it more challenging. after all look at Sol&#x27;s story. he was given a reason why he was brought to his knees by Humans when he is a god.\n> there will always be a way some spell. artifact. rule or even self imposed weakness could power drop a being... and it doesn&#x27;t even have to be imposed on the champions. as a example. what if Summoners rift is a divine place of power that every one wants to take control of? but to do so it pits each group against each other, and part of the trial is they must fight at equal power\n> \n> \n> Either way I love the game. and maybe I think about it to much. but I still think the story and game play should be connected in some same way XD\n\nTotally. There are always kryptonites once can create to counteract any supermen. My issue with that reasoning, again -- personal perspective -- is that this particular path leads you into a realm of magic bullets to solve problems. It's way more interesting to tell other stories, or find other ways to circumvent godhood. As other narrative folk have posted in the past, Summoner's Rift creates an story atmosphere of \"level playing field\" which rarely, if ever, occurs in every day life. Nothing is a level playing field, ever. This is what makes life dramatic and drama interesting. Choices, circumvention, and compensation. \n\nThanks for listening and being open. It's a tricky subject and there are lots of feels about it, but I will say, it opens the world up to me and allows me create champs and tell stories that I hope you find more engaging. Unfortunately, I can't experience what Riot was like before the retcon, so I have no genuine comparisons.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-01-13T19:35:36.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Giant star dragons also don't occur in everyday life. Clearly we need to remove Asol from the game. \n\nOf course the League not existing opens the world up for you. I'm sure you, as an author, find it liberating to not have to deal with something that constrains storytelling. But as a reader, I enjoy things that constrains storytelling. It helps make speculation more possible, and provides a clear main plot thread that connects these stories. If League as a video game didn't exist, I wouldn't even know that Bilgewater and Shurima took place in the same universe, or that the Piltover/Zaun megacity didn't take over the entire world.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-01-13T19:49:09.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem with that is... here's the best example. In the old lore, fighting broke out between Demacia and noxus at Kalamanda, and after a short time of this the institute just strikes them down. The institute was able to contain beings of immense power like it was nothing and stop entire wars. Nothing bad could happen as long as it was around because it could just snap it's fingers and the problem was solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-01-13T19:54:37.020+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was pretty clear that it wasn't the institute just 'striking them down', but pulling out every measure possible to stop the war and only just barely succeeding. \n\nI understand that the league constrained storytelling, but now we have the exact opposite problem: nothing is holding the writers back. And that is dreadfully boring; when everything can happen, anything that does happen will be a disappointment, because the readers probably already thought something else was going to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-01-13T19:58:39.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But if you read the journal of justice issue in which they deliver the news about Kalamanda, sure there was danger but they basically just showed up and used magic to solve the whole thing in an instant.

Have some Noxians, upset at the result at Kalamandra, kill some powerful summoners, or lodge a formal protest, or something. Riot deciding 'we can't figure out a way to make this work, so let's just not bother' is incredibly lazy.\n\nYes, it mean that champions don't have to follow the rules of the League. But it also means that most champions have no reason to care about one another. League has a 'cast' of 100+ champions, but in all honesty, it has a bunch of smaller 'casts' of 5-15 champions per location, because most of those champs have no reason to interact with each other. Why should Teemo ever meet Asol? Why should Jarvan ever interact with Amumu? The league gave an easy, understandable reason for every single champion to interact with each other. Right now, most champions live in a bubble, maybe with two or three other champions, and never interact with each other at all.\n\nRuneterra is boring. There's nothing interesting about it. The individual city states are pretty interesting, but those don't interact with each other bar Noxus doing Noxus things and apparently threatening to take over every place at once.  The League gave a connecting thread, so that every place in Runeterra had something to do with every other place. Now that's gone, and there's nothing to replace it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ImTheSideKick","date":"2017-01-13T19:08:16.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well before it was like this (least imho)\n\nthe good joined the league to make the world a better place, or to prove themselves\n\nthe bad joined to gain what they wanted through sheer power\n\nand the Summoners ( a group of extremely powerful mages) would force anything thing extremely dangerous to join (think fiddlesticks) as a way to control their over whelming power that would other wise harm the masses\n\nthen two factions that was having a dispute would chose their 5 favorite champions (is why a darius and a garen could be on the same team. some guy who loves army generals could like them both and want them both on his team ) to duke it out in the SR . with the winner getting the rewards... this would save lives and stop wars before they happened\n\ndoes that explain it a bit?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-01-13T19:26:15.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Doesn't Riot have access to the old lore as they're writing new bios?\n\nAnyway, you are also now facing a new problem of having all of these powerful gods and such in the same world or continent, but with barely any interaction with the other champions.

It's just a series of web novellas. They're not bad, but they have no connection to the game itself, and I think that's a massive disappointment.\n\nThe relationships between characters and their world have no impact on the gameplay whatsoever. Summoner's Rift might not even be a place in Runeterra. And why should I care that Garen and Kat might or might not have a thing going if the only way you'll ever notice from in game stuff is if you have a Garen /joke while a Kat is in eyesight, and that there's nothing else going on to distract you from a dialogue line or two?\n\nI like the lore stories.
