For so long I desired Zelos to be a champion in league, now rip both him and her father.\n\nPersonally I would have preferred the dances to be taught to her by her father as it would have kept in line more with the old irelia lore and her father and brother having died alone in a bloody confrontation defending their village only to have irelia finish it. It also would have avoided the stereotype of grandmother to granddaughter teaching the old ways. \n\nNow her father Lito and Zelos just feel thrown in as homages to her old lore instead of real parts of her lore.\n\nRegardless I still love this update!","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-04-02T17:58:51.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a really nice observation! give me a new prespective on what i read. thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ElectroScalar","date":"2018-04-02T19:53:12.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I liked her more when she learned a fighting technique from her father, not dancing.
