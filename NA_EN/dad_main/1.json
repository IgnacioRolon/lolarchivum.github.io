My girlfriend and i play games together and never lag on the same internet and now i cant even play a custom game with 0 bots without pinging over 1300.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T23:16:47.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like a tech specialist was able to get back to you through your ticket.
