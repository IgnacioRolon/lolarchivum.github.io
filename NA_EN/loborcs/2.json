Anyway, you know me well, but thanks for answers.\n\nTBskyen explains quite well why theres a big gap in the middle\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OojE4W1L9FM\nIts Kled's land duh. \nNo in all seriousness it has to do with the fact that Noxus and Demacia are pretty much always at war with each other, which effectively makes that land in the middle no mans land, because no one can control it for a long enough time to own it. Everytime Noxus would try to expand into that area Demacia's scouts would pick up the scent, then they send their armies out to meet them, the mountainous region also favors Demacia's opposition of Noxus's advancement and as we kno their fights usually end up in a stale mate forcing both sides to retreat as Noxus hasn't advanced and even if Demacia DID win they have no interest in taking more territory they are isolationist and are quite happy with the fertile land they already own which is behind many mountain ranges and is easy to protect.\n\nBesides IF Targon was in the middle it would be way to easy for anyone to reach it, and also Noxus would have to PASS Targon everytime they wanted to fight Demacia which we kno they fight often. Targon is a religious site in part of its mythos, because it so DARN hard to get to, for Noxuians, Demacian, or Freljordians to get to it, because for two of them they have to pass Noxus territory, go through Piltover, pass the unnamed barren and dangerous lands after Piltover (Probably the Kumungu Jungles) pass the desert of climb thousands of mountains along the coast and then pass the final mountain range before getting to Targon. Now THATS an epic pillgrimage worth making a huge religious fuss over, not so much crossing what could be equated to have the width of the United States with only maybe a few mountain ranges in the way. \n\nIf it were in the middles it would be 2 close.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-07-26T02:55:05.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the Persians and the Romans had a huge border dispute and created a buffer state, the state was not larger than either Persia or Rome.

Unless you're Hannibal Barca you don't march an army over the mountain.  You could just march around it, which matches the details given that the bottom of Targon is supposedly a trade post.  Trade posts by their nature are not hard to get to, otherwise there'd be no trade.  It's climbing the damn mountain that was considered the hard part.\n\nThough I have a feeling that this will be retconned, in that it will just never be mentioned again.

I was please to see just how far anyone would have to travel to get there and the trials they would face. For someone like Taric with the assumption he didn't take a boat would have to travel the continent of Valoran, pass Noxian territory, go through Piltover, pass that are the dangerous and barren lands that are currently unnamed but are probably the Kumungu Jungles (cause where else are Nidalee, Zyra, and Wukong supposed to come from), and then pass the entirety of the Shuriman desert, or climb a thousound mountain along the coast and then get the the final mountain range before getting to Targon, I LIKE the epic journey that is!\n\nAnd we KNO Freljordians get around quite a lot, they have boats (while it hasn't been made clear that Demcia has a naval force) and they get ALL over Runeterra because they have ships that make it to Bilgewater, there are houses made of upturned Freljordian ships, Olaf has been there, and Pyke's father was Freljordian, and that means Freljordian ships at some point passed Targon. Because the Canal through Piltover/Zaun wasn't always a thing and some current Freljordians may either not know thats a thing now or may want to stick to the routes they have always taken, cause if u live on the Wester side of the Freljord its easier to sail pass Targon than go north, espcially if u can raid some villages along the way. So i say everything about Targon and its placement make sense even the stuff from the stories.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-07-25T14:47:03.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How big is this planet?

It V=X/T then it becomes X = V*T (as you multiple both sides by t), not X=T/V.\n\nBy that calculation (which you can google for reference: distance = speed * time) your numbers get a result on nearly 12000km...which is nearly three times the other estimates in this thread, and that makes sense as you assumed a 24-hour-a-day walking time as opposed to our 8-hour walking time.\n\nSo your speed is fine, but the calculation isn't. There's just no way you could walk in a straight line at a constant speed of 4km an hour for 3000 hours and only move 760km.","replies":[{"poster":"Loborcs","date":"2018-07-25T10:37:06.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The shadow isles undead forces probably can do it (?)\n\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/universe-map/en_US/85d98a83e3366884d6ac968ce7034cda708f686f/assets/src/assets/images/slides/shadow_entities_07.jpg\n\nOr not but I wanted an excuse to put that image again.

So Valoran might be about the size of euroupe which makes sense actually seeing as how there's only two major kingdoms/empires on it if were too much bigger then the two might be 2 far apart to realistically go to war with each other of even care, and we know that at a certain point in Europe's history where there were different kingdoms that would fight so the amount of space were are working with makes since for the number and size of parties involved. \n\nBut just to be clear ONLY Valoran including Noxus, Demcia, the Freljord and the empty land between would be the size of Europe, Shurima is a whole other land mass that adds much more surface area that is \"livable\" land to Runeterra as a planet","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2018-07-25T02:30:57.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely love the way you're running this thread, Bio.

According to Shurima's latest current Lore \"Bloodlines\" Taliyah is like either in Nashramae or Vakura...but idk the lore or my brain gets kinda wonky cause to me the two cities in that story were like right next to each other, either way she passed the coast of Shurima and is somwhere in the interior, can somone confirm?","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-07-26T01:25:43.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer!
