The real question to assess s whether or not she has the full capacity to continuously surf like that.\n\nSpeed isn't even the prevalent question.  It's how consistent can she go.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-07-26T06:27:36.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We also have two (!!) video examples showing Taliyah travelling.

Cavalry obviously moves faster than troops on foot.  I only used Cavalry because they move faster.  If anything, Stone surfing looks like it could potentially be a horse galloping at full speed (if even that slow).\n\nHorse was a minimal estimate to work around. My main question is how long can she surf continuously.  Even if surfing is faster than a horse, if she can only travel for half as long as the cavalry can, then speed is mute.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-07-25T14:41:35.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Taliyah’s route through the Freljord, though?","replies":[{"poster":"Loborcs","date":"2018-07-25T14:45:59.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"We almost know nothing about her stay at Freljord for now. \n\nWith who did she stay? \nWho was her teacher? \nWhere did she travelled exactly? \n\nLot of questions without answers for now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-07-25T14:56:33.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about the most important question: where did she get that adorable baby deer?","replies":[{"poster":"Loborcs","date":"2018-07-25T15:02:50.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if that's canon at all but if it is we'll probably have to wait for the full story of her Freljordian travels for the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-07-25T15:08:31.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want it to be a heartwarming and wholesome tale about friendship in the Freljordian wilderness.","replies":[{"poster":"Loborcs","date":"2018-07-25T15:17:10.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is recruiting a lot of Warhammer 40k writers.
