However I can still speak to my friends in discord meaning that it is not my actual internet connection that is the issue. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if the retry button didn't continuously loop in the same fashion. The other option is cancel, but the problem is it leaves it as a black screen. Either option leaves me sometimes unable to atl-tab back out of it and force quite the program in which case the only option given is to restart the computer and be forced to either join late to a game, or have your team remake the game making me lose LP. I'm not sure if this is only my problem with the mac client or if it is an issue that occurs to all of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T17:10:47.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black screen and issues you're experiencing here are usually due to an issue with your network reaching our server.
