She&#039;s probably one of my favourite champions. I really wanted to buy a new skin for her, like the Battle Bunny or the Reedemed one. But one day I saw this guy play with this very cool skin that I loved the moment I saw it! Dragonblade Riven! I&#039;ve been wondering if it will ever come back. I know it has to do with the Lunar Revel but will it ever come back? Please answer...\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n{{champion:92}} &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Kendra","date":"2015-05-28T10:20:45.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"99% sure it will be available to purchase next Lunar Revel, which sadly for you is almost a year from now. If you're feeling lucky, you could also receive it as a mystery gift in the meantime!\n\nYou'll have much better luck getting Dragonblade Riven than Championship Riven, at the very least. Not sure if you've heard of that skin but if not you should YouTube it - absolutely gorgeous, ridiculously rare and completely unavailable sadly :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-28T18:15:06.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nDragonblade Riven is a legacy skin, which means that she will come back!

When Riven and Tryndamere were made Legacy, I was expecting the following year's Lunar Revel skins (Katarina, Nidalee and Jinx) were going to be legacy too, as part of a new tradition or something but alas, they were not. Why is that?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
