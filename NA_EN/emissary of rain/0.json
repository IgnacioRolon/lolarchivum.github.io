I got an S on Zoe last night and I'm fairly sure that I had not gotten an S on Zoe before but I didn't receive a chest. I also know that I had available chests to unlock at the time. Even if someone could tell me for sure that I already unlocked a chest for Zoe and forgot about it would be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T19:37:30.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are quite a few things to look at for, like having a chest icon available on your profile for the week.  Sorting through your champion collection in the client should also show gold borders as well if you've already received a chest on them.  Looks like things are cleared up but let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-12-01T19:24:53.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to : http://championmasterylookup.derpthemeus.com/summoner?summoner=Emissary+of+Rain&region=NA\n\nYou have earned a chest on Zoe before.","replies":[{"poster":"Emissary of Rain","date":"2017-12-01T19:28:35.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess so. I just wish it told me when I got one before because for the life of me I can't remember when I got an S before and the champ has only been out for about two weeks. Thank you very much for the help though.","replies":[{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-12-01T19:36:34.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that website helpful when Im in champ select and Im trying to get a chest.\n\nHowever if you are in your client if you go to Collection and look at your champions those who you have earned a chest on will have a border around them like this: \nhttps://i.imgur.com/MmvNMtx.png\n\nMy Jhin has had a chest earnt on him, but my Zed hasn't. There is a nice border around Jhin since he is locked now from chests.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
