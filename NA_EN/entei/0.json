I got banned for writing 3 WORDS riot games. I started playing when I didn&#039;t understand a thing from chat and I was like this troll kid who went duo top with his friends. I went on and got to gold. \r\n- I want to point that every second game in gold I saw that someone wrote &quot;kys&quot; in chat so I didn&#039;t take it hard or something, I thought its like idiot and I never thought about it, BECAUSE ITS JUST A VIDEO GAME.\r\n\r\nanyways, after I got my first suspension for &quot;bad behavior&quot; for 2 weeks, I thought its about how much I am writing in games. I didn&#039;t think for a moment that I got banned for writing &quot;kys&quot; one time in chat, I wrote a lot at this moment of time because I wanted to get my anger out( I just wrote A LOT in chat, no curses or something like that). \r\n\r\nAfter a ban, I tried to keep my chat clean, I didn&#039;t write at all in chat, only tried to cummonicate through it to win the game.\r\nBut, I got on a lose streak and I wrote kys once to a player, and I got the permanently banned account, that I spent a lot of time from my childhood on.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see my chat logs from this ONE GAME here it is:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nPsychic: lets invade\r\nPsychic: im\r\nPsychic: the cc\r\nPsychic: lee top side\r\nPsychic: ty\r\nPsychic: malz?\r\nPsychic: jarven\r\nPsychic: pls camp bot\r\nPsychic: lol\r\nPsychic: j4\r\nPsychic: ur doing\r\nPsychic: 0\r\nPsychic: ganks\r\nPsychic: wtf\r\nPsychic: YES\r\nPsychic: 0\r\nPsychic: GANKS\r\nPsychic: 0 GANKS TOP\r\nPsychic: MAYBE\r\nPsychic: 1 GANK MID\r\nPsychic: AND 1 BOR\r\nPsychic: BOT\r\nPsychic: THATS ALL\r\nPsychic: UR USELESS\r\nPsychic: LULU\r\nPsychic: GO HELP\r\nPsychic: UR LUCIAN\r\nPsychic: WTF\r\nPsychic: lol\r\nPsychic: better supp won\r\nPsychic: not adc\r\nPsychic: lulu\r\nPsychic: u suck\r\nPsychic: ass\r\nPsychic: no\r\nPsychic: justy\r\nPsychic: better supp\r\nPsychic: ye\r\nPsychic: better jg and supp wins\r\nPsychic: JARVEN\r\nPsychic: JSUT\r\nPsychic: KYS\r\nPsychic: WTF\r\nPsychic: J4\r\nPsychic: U LITERLY\r\nPsychic: WENT FOR KRAGS\r\nPsychic: IN A FIGHT\r\nPsychic: j4\r\nPsychic: u suck\r\nPsychic: u cant talk\r\n\r\nWell, I didn&#039;t look at this chat log for half a year, trying to forget what happened to my first account.\r\nI got banned for ONE GAME.\r\nHere is my question for you guys:\r\nIs it even fair to permanently ban a player with this chat logs for ONE GAME, after he played 8 years without writing a thing in chat?

That's why riot made the mute button, right?\nAnother question for you, why can't riot make a PERMANENTLY MUTE punishment?\n\nI opened a discussion on this and some people answered me that riot doesn't permanently mute people because if they are muted they will feed or int or be toxic in any other way.\n\nBut, there are some players who just get frusirated from one game so they write those kind of stuff.
