If you hadn't turned that replay into a highlight before the patch dropped, it might just be lost =(","replies":[{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2018-01-12T00:31:43.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhm.. this was on the last patch.. i had this one 2 nights ago.. no patch dropped between that day and yesterday??","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-12T01:36:51.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had mentioned the replay was 'expired' which sounds like it was made from a previous patch. If that's not the case I'm honestly not sure what could be wrong, unless the client files are corrupted or that replay file is missing. You could also try a repair to see if that helps at all, but it might be more helpful to hit up the techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
