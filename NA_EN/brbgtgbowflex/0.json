He has a unique identity and the concept for the champion is fundamentally strong.\r\n\r\nThat said, Bard has the lowest win rate in the game. When win rate is this skewed against a champion and this far from the norm, there is something particularly wrong with the champion that explain his 40% win rate. Namely, his abilities are a demonstration of complete design cowardice. \r\n\r\nEvery ability is so afraid that it might be useful, powerful, or satisfying, that it decides to limit itself and add disadvantage. Irrational fear that motivates this design and it&#039;s been a trend of League design lately.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s take a look at specific examples and where they demonstrate this lack of integrity and the fear of actually making a champion &quot;good&quot;.\r\n\r\nQ: Cosmic Binding - Okay, so its a stun. But it only works if it either hits a second target or a wall. And it can&#039;t go through minions. Why does he get this limitation when Taric, Leona, Blitz, Thresh, Nami, Annie, Zyra-- nearly every other support, gets a stun that doesn&#039;t just stun, but is either AOE, adds displacement, adds gap-closer, or adds damage with much less ridiculous requirements (hit the target/land an aoe)? So not only is his ability less powerful, but the requirement conditions are more difficult.\r\n\r\nW: Caretaker&rsquo;s Shrine - So, you have a heal that you spend a ridiculous amount of mana on. But wait, it doesn&#039;t heal! It has to sit and charge first! And during that time it can be run over by enemies and all of your mana can be lost for nothing! And if it does heal the value is tiny! Compare this to Taric, Nami, Sona, Soraka, Kayle, Nidalee, Gangplank, Alistar-- they all have heals that just work, that are multi-target, or low mana, or add attack speed, or provide shields. Bard&#039;s just has high counter-play and minimal benefit. And the benefit it does offer is sort of illogical, except as a retreat item.\r\n\r\nE: Magical Journey - I&#039;m struggling to find the value add here. If you use it to engage a teamfight, you funnel all of your team through a clump to be destroyed. If you use it to escape a teamfight, the other team goes through the portal with you and in the end you moved your death through a wall. It&#039;s infinitely inferior to all movement abilities and doesn&#039;t seem to have a great purpose other than baiting enemies into team fights, which is not really as empowering in practice as it sounds in theory.  The problem is-- the built in downside. Would Bard be a great champion without this downside? No, his other abilities have too many issues. But, this downside is entirely not needed. Ezreal does not pull pursuing Darius&#039;s with him when he uses E to escape. No other character has this high of a penalty associated with their ability.\r\n\r\nR: AOE Zhonya - The king of double-edged swords. If you use it outside of very narrow use cases you are basically rolling the dice with helpful/harmful. While Sona, Annie, Soraka, Zilean, Taric, Zyra, Thresh, Blitz, Leona-- nearly every champion in the game get an ultimate that can basically help them to some extent, Bard&#039;s just has complete potential to be useless, ruin a fight, or make things worse.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBasically, the designer was so afraid of making an ability just good that they added a whole bunch of downsides and special conditions. We are paying mana for these abilities. Or we&#039;re paying energy. Or a cooldown. We expect to get a Benefit for the ability and for that benefit to be obtained for the price of our resource. There is already a downside to them in that they incur opportunity cost. But Bard is getting more costs for no reason.\r\n\r\nThis trend started with Zac&#039;s contestable globules and has just gotten progressively worse ever since. Adding huge disadvantages to abilities does not mean you are adding counter-play-- it means you are removing and limiting actual play.\r\n\r\nSo, my advice is, uncripple Bard. Just take away many of these downsides and see if they were even necessary or just designed out of fear. My bet is on the latter.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-04-09T22:45:47.805+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"They released him with different expectations than other recent releases; normally you get an OP champ and they nerf it down to average.

It also has the potential to stun two enemy champions at the same time, a trick you conveniently forgot to mention.\n\nCaretaker's shrine heals more health at full charge than any other supportive heal ability.  The advantage to the high mana cost, the need to wait for a charge, and the requirement that it sit on the back line where an enemy can't step on it is that it sits there until you need it, allowing Bard to leave the lane while still giving his ally some sustainability while he's gone.\n\nYour inability to find uses for his last two abilities speaks more toward your lack of imagination than to their viability.  So because Bard doesn't have an ultimate that is amazing if you throw it down in the middle of a teamfight, it must be useless?  It never crossed your mind to use it to engage a teamfight?

The thing is.....that's exactly who this champion is for. Not necessarily LCS only, but for people who can communicate better than text while attempting to CS, and rely on each other to do well. Let's look at his kit again, this time highlighting some strengths:\n\n\nPassive. How many times have we seen an LCS game where, say, an annie double jungles and ganks the level 5 midlaner at level 2? Bard would do it at level 3 or 4, and can get in position for it a lot faster. he can make a deep ward run others would never succeed in because he would get in and out so much faster. As for the weakness? it's the same as Kalista's ultimate, really. It's totally reliant on your lane partner to paly safe, which is much more likely to happen when you guys know you can rely on each other.\n\nQ:Cosmic Binding. For every other stun you named, it typically requires: flash, hitting a slow and predictable skillshot, or is single target point and click. This is a skillshot too, and while it won't stun if it only hits the one target and no walls, it's a fantastic counter engage tool if their team is charging in with a front and backline, or as an engage followup after they've begun to get knocked out of position already. As for lane, where I susect you're doing most of your considerations, bush control can be huge, but if they're in a bush down there, then nearly any angle will get the wall stun for some poke or even an all in. However, you allies also need to understand why it's being used sometimes, which works better on voice comms.\n\nW: Caretaker’s Shrine. Ok, first off, yes. It's weak for its mana cost. that said, clearly either you or your bard allies are doing it wrong. These shrines aren't dropped midfight on the front line except as a last resort. They're placed where the enemy will have a difficult time getting to them. First to dragon pit for a coming fight? ward the entrances and drop a shrine in the pit, as well as one near the entrance to your own jungle. let the charge and they're ready to refresh allies who aren't at full HP coming in for the fight, or after the fight starts. Going to collect a few chmes or deep ward? leave a shrine under the tower so if the laner gets poked a bit, he can heal right back up. But you need to trust your laner to handle the 2v1 or both of you will suffer for it: bard gets no chimes, laner has a weaker support.\n\nE: Magical Journey. totally teamwork dependent. It can pull you out of a bad spot in a deep ward run if you're lucky, but mostly, you can set stuff up you never would pull off with other characters. If the enemy follows you...just bind them! they move slower than you, stun them as they come out and run/kill them as appropriate. Again though, and more than ever, your teammates need to be in line with your idea here or it just won't be that helpful.\n\nR: AOE Zhonya. While it does have that effect when it hits, I dislike that description because zhonyas is more of a panic button most of the time, while this has a decent travel time and would come too late to deal with certain surprises. The real thing holding it back is that it can screw with your own team as hard as theirs, and in solo Q I've seen way too many teams just throw all 40 abilites into the pot as fast as possible and hope. If bard's team has the better teamfight, that might actually hurt his own team more. Use it to tower dive, it'll work like an ohmwrecker. Use it when their team splits up and goes 2 on drag, 3 stop your team: freeze dragon squad, murder the 3, mop up the dragon squad, take drake. \n\nAll in all, I suspect bard's low winrate is less a testament to him being bad, and more a testament to the fact that most of the team needs to understand him to win. And that's just not something solo Q can expect.","replies":[{"poster":"BRBGTGBOWFLEX","date":"2015-04-10T01:41:19.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Why are you giving any opinions about champions at a high level of play when you are in Silver 5.\n\nIf anything you said was true, we'd be seeing Bard in the LCS.\n\nWe are not seeing Bard in the LCS.

Think that his E is useful? No it's just moving the fight to a different location. The usefulness of this is so situational.\n\nHis Q is strong but other supports can land CC more reliably. There's too many requirements for the stun to work. Firstly you have to hit the skillshot which is slow moving and short range. Secondly a wall or unit must be also hit. For such a slow moving and short range skill it makes it unreliable and only used correctly when successfully predicting movement. The skill is also slow meaning that enemies have plenty of time to react and dodge it. Given the requirements for it to stun it makes this a low success rate skill.\n\nEverything about him is screaming Riot's new design philosophy. Make skills extra readible and allow enemies to get out of it with plenty of warning. I noticed it with Gnar. His stun show clearly the area of which he will stun you with a red rectangle on the ground with a huge wind up time. His boulder toss also a huge windup, his ult almost always requires him to flash as his jump is so readible and so predictable. Veigar now has a big warning circle when his E will come up. Sion has a big warning red area on the ground when he uses his Q. Champs like this make me bored. It's like they don't want to award zone knowledge so they just give it out as free information. \"here's where you shouldn't be standing watch out!\" \"here's a chime, camp here!\" \"here's a health relic, step on it!\" \"A reksai tunnel, step on it!\" ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-04-10T05:40:09.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would rather see a {{champion:432}} who has all of the above countering potential while being amazingly strong, than a Bard who's only strong because he gives his opponents fewer options. {{champion:154}} 's destructible bloblets allowed him to keep the huge lane sustain that was making him a problem until then -- if he didn't have that mechanic added to him, he would've just had to be saddled with numerically weaker healing. He might not be the strongest pick around, but he has a lot of potential to become stronger while offering opponents more options to play against him, and the same applies to Bard.\n\nPutting aside the fact that we don't even know how the recent buffs affected Bard's success (It's been only two days), and that we're still at the early stages where people are trying to figure him out, there is already a lot of stuff he does that nobody else can. He contributes the most mobility out of any support in the game, and despite the potential for opponents to use his E, he can also counter that with a Q to set up kills. He's the only support capable of healing for 210 health instantly at level 1 (and from the other side of the map, too), and his ult can work like a stun whose range is only rivalled by an {{champion:22}} arrow. Despite his low win rate and all the counterability to his abilities, people who play him find him fun. I'm not saying he's perfect (if there's anything Riot was timid about when designing him, it's his scalings, and I think he could afford to have his shrines charge up faster in the late game, along with some AP scalings to the bonus movement on his W and E movement bonuses), but if there's an issue with him, it's not his kit design.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-04-10T03:11:16.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh once I heard that they wanted to create a 'roaming support', I figured 'well, they're certainly not going to make Alistar 2.0, because they can't fucking stand Alistar jungle' \n\nSo they tried making a roamer that wasn't immediately going to be pick or ban.

Speed up the projectile for gods sake.\n\nSecond: his q has such a short range and the projectile is so slow! Good luck landing it on a competent opponent.

(Not to mention the patch came out YESTERDAY so the numbers probably aren't that accurate yet)\n\nMostly what he needs at this point is a Q range buff.

(I wouldn't mind a higher base heal and lower scaling on W, either.) Still, I would add one thing in Rito's defense: Bard is an incredibly *unique* champion. The E and R in particular are very unique abilities with a high ceiling and a low floor. That made it incredibly hard to judge how good he actually is until he hit the live servers. Then within a couple days, we learned he was pretty trash. So, I don't necessarily blame Riot for (severely) undershooting. To be honest, it's probably better to release a severely underpowered champion than a severely overpowered one (although it may be better to release a slightly overpowered champion as opposed to a slightly underpowered one).\n\nThey're probably buffing him up about as fast as they can while being careful not to break him. One thing to take note of in this regard is that he does perform 4ish% better in 5v5 than in solo. So if you made him a 50% champ in solo, you might just break him in 5v5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"killd0zer","date":"2015-04-09T23:55:50.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really get this post.

He's got a great idea going for him, spare his passive, which is easily the most cluttered and random piece of shit ever.

You cannot land his heal, you have to place it somewhere either contestable or protected. So you limit the ability to specific areas. Then that area needs to be safe for a period of time.\n\nNo other heal has to do that much. And the other ones do not cost 100 either. And they can't be denied by opponents.\n\nBards movement ability lets the enemy follow. The whole point of a movement ability is to move and transport the things you desire. For example, if Teemo's W gave equal move speed to his opponent, it would have no point. That is basically what bard's E does.\n\nThen Bard's stun has conditions attached to it, while all the other stun supports either just have to hit, just have to click, or can't miss. Bard must both hit his target and a wall or minion. \n\nBard's ult is extremely limited since its use depends a lot on cooldowns available-- there just aren't a lot of fights where he can get high value out of it and its more likely to cause harm than help. It sounds cool in theory but doesn't work in reality.\n\n---\n\nSo the main issue and my argument is-- all of his abilities have drawbacks. He gets zero \"this is just useful\" abilities. No other champion is punished as hard as bard is across every single ability. That's why I have issues with the design.\n\nYou didn't even read what I wrote. It's nothing about his power. It's about the double-edged nature of all his abilities.","replies":[]}]}]}
