Maybe im crazy and just miss seeing Shen in competitive play","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-30T04:16:15.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Er, not sure why \"tank meta\" automatically makes him higher priority. He's not quite the strongest jungler, and he hasn't received any huge buffs quite yet.\n\nGotta keep in mind why certain meta's exist (tank meta = cinderhulk + recent tank buffs). Shen didn't receive a huge upgrade quite yet. He's strong, but he's still where he was before. And having a tank for the sake of a tank because of a tank meta (and the best tanks currently are the junglers, like Volibear) is going to hurt because {{item:3153}} {{item:3134}} {{item:3035}} exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Natty 9K","date":"2015-03-30T05:06:15.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points. I shouldve specified that I was thinking of him being played strictly in top lane. I feel he could have some playmaking potential and for sure anythings better than these stupid kennen tops that NA plays horribly.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-30T05:08:27.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*shrugs*\n\nJust keep in mind that the meta is the effect, not the cause.

Maokaoi can stop split push with no kill threat really, gnar is mobile does solid damage and is a good diver.\n\nShen has 1 heavily unforgiving bit of CC (to himself. Missing it means no ability to fight) that has no bonus time scale and a low burst and he has to be a secondary initiator by ulting onto someone who is diving the back lines because he cant get there himself and even if they do get back to the back lines on a carry his low damage and lack of CC mean a carry will usually live while their tanks lock down cc and crush your back line","replies":[]},{"poster":"kinglallak","date":"2015-03-31T15:21:05.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What he might have meant was shen can't really do a jungle follow with the same power that maokai or hecarim can.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-03-30T04:15:49.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shens play is almost completely reactive.

He's Flash dependent on engages (most teams will not allow multiple target taunts) and items like QSS/Mekal's shut down his engage even more. Hecarim can just destroy a backline, Mao/Sion can tank for days and Rumble can split the team up. \n\nHe can't jungle quickly, without the items which delays his tanky. (Senjui/Nunu/Vi) just do it better. His clear is lackluster, his pre-6 ganks are weak. His Ult, with the delay is the only saving grace and it doesn't help him with ganking at all but gives him a great counter gank.\n\nShen is just mediocre in what he brings where other champions do it far better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-03-30T07:26:25.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen doesn't really have a lot of crowd-control besides his taunting dash, comparing to the current popular  tanks like Sejuani & Nautilus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pigby","date":"2015-03-30T07:05:27.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to think, why are the tanks that are popular now, popular? \n\nIn the jungle tanks like Zac, Amumu, Nautilus, and Sejuani are popular. And every single one of them isn't 100% reliant on cinderhulk to clear. It helps definitely, but they can clear decently without it. Shen's clear is absolute garbage until he picks up a cinderhulk. \n\nThey also have great CC abilities. Shen has his taunt, and that's it. \n\n\nShen is just underwhelming. He has a good laning phase but outside of that he falls short.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-03-30T04:58:20.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"splitpushing isn't as strong as it used to be, and splitpushing now is only that great if you deal a bit of damage and are actually a 1v1 threat.
