I am new to the forums so I apologize if this is in the wrong forum, however, I have a question regarding the rewards for end season 3. If I were to place gold on a 3's team would I receive the rewards when season 4 starts?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Smelloscope","date":"2013-09-19T21:32:20.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you meet the team participation requirements (something like 10 wins on the team or something) you are viable for the gold rewards.

I can confirm that in order to earn rewards on a Ranked Team (either 3v3, or 5v5), you need to win 10 games on that team to earn rewards based on the highest achieved Tier/division of the Ranked Team.  \n\nFor all other information regarding Season 3 rewards, make sure to check out the End of Season 3 Rewards FAQ found here:\n\nhttp://beta.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/check-out-season-3-rewards-faq\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Smelloscope","date":"2013-09-19T22:49:01.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to link that but I'm at work and had to take care of a customer :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solari Eclipse","date":"2013-09-21T21:46:31.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additional Clarification.  10 wins, no exceptions?
