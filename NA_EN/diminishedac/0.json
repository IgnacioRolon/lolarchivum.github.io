I have a few friends in the waking world who will do crazy stuff with me, but they're rarely on. \r\n\r\nI'm just tired of ranked and tryhard normals. I want to do fun stuff like Rengar + Nami bot, Poppy + Soraka mid, Vayne + Quinn bot; just something that's new and people don't expect! It makes the game so much more fun when not everyone just tries to imitate the LCS players :D\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested, just comment and add me in-game :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T19:37:12.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FUXK yeah!
