Back in around season two Riot had a system for people that got permanently banned, they could go through a system that would almost 80 % of the time work to reform the player and they would never get a ban again, I for one have got such things and think if I were to ever be permanently banned with how much time and money I have invested into this game, would be absolutely depressed over it. I think that it would be much better to have something like that, because Riot Games is the only (Trash) company to permanently ban people over things that aren&#039;t; hacking.

To hopefully for the future of league players \"We have a chance to play the game without having to mute every game in fear of getting permanently banned.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ulfric Storm","date":"2016-09-22T03:15:26.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"No problem, I am stuck here with league.
