For example, if you displayed no toxic behavior and did not even use chat, but yet other players reported you for \"verbal harassment\", these reports would not count as our systems would be able to detect that you did not say such things.  \n\nHowever, we are all responsible for our own actions.  If you engaged with these players and displayed toxic behavior back to them, this may cause punishments to be added to your account.\n\nI hope this makes things a bit more clear!  Let me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[]}]}
