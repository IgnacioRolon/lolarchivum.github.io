If he is lucky, he will get only that embarrassment by receiving a no. If he is unlucky, he gets a yes. \r\n\r\nTo get across why, I will say that an average date will cost the guy $50. It may be more, maybe less, but that seems about average. Remember that with each passing date, and with each passing moment of that small talk you mention, the guy increases his chances that he will say something stupid. Every time a guy opens his mouth, he runs the risk off saying something stupid; and dating requires him to open his mouth a lot. \r\n\r\nSo let's say he goes on one date, spends $50. Second date, $50. Third date, $50. Fourth date, says something stupid, she breaks up with him, but he still has to spend $50. There goes $200 down the drain. Each good date requires that he invest more money for the next date, yet each next date runs the risk of more stupidity and therefore runs the higher risk of a breakup. \r\n\r\nEssentially, the guy invests more money to make his investment less secure. Basic logic should tell him that does not make good business sense.","replies":[]}
