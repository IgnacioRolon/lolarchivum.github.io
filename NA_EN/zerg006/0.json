The mouse cannot click anything without being far away from the actual icon, and player names are nowhere near their characters. The game was working fine last week, and I have made no changes to the computer or game settings. I have tried rebooting the game and reinstalling the game.  Going Fullscreen causes the character bar to take up the entire bottom of the screen, and looks like a resolution of 800x600.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded screenshots of the issues\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/jujbX#5dQrRn3","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T18:30:07.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue has been occurring pretty frequently for players running Windows 10 and a television display. More often than not,[ setting your Windows resolution](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4910-screen-resolution-display-change-windows-10-a.html) to the recommended, along with matching your in-game resolution to that recommended resolution can resolve the issue. \n\nShould it persist, let me know what video card you have (Intel, Nvidia, AMD) and we can try additional steps.
