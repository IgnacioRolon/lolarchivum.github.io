Recently, I qued up for a ranked flex and selected support as my role. When I got in champ select, I got my support role and the Top Laner asked me if he could Support. I said \"Sorry I'm not a great top\" as I'm a hardcore support main. Rather than dodge or play his secondary, he replied, \"Ya sorry. I'm going bot anyway. :'D\" and proceeded to ban the support I wanted to play (Pyke) and choose a support champion (Bard) (He didn't intend to go adc, as the adc was duo with him and chose Kaisa). I screenshotted what happened, and told him that either he dodge, or I'd submit a support ticket. He mocked, \"ooooh noo a support ticket aaaaaah.\" I decided to dodge at the last second since he didn't, and I was sure the game would be pretty toxic.\r\n\r\nThe Rioter who responded to my support ticket was very nice and told me how he also recently dodged because of teammates fighting over a role. I'm sure mostly all of us has experienced toxicity in champ select. The reason I'm telling this story again is because the Rioter suggested that I could provide feedback on boards as Rioters often read our feedback.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the summoner's code should extend to champ select, but currently, there is no way to enforce the code in these situations apart from sending a support ticket. I don't think most players would take the time to do it, and it's kinda inconvenient. I could've just not dodged and reported at the end of game, but that would have likely cost me at least 15 minutes of time (more if the jerk or his duo decided to vote no just to be more toxic) and brought a toxic match not worth playing. The player who gets his role stolen or in situations where he/she experiences toxicity should not be the one who should face a time penalty and decline of lp (or automatic loss if in promos/series). I think the penalty should be put on the person who treats his teammates unfairly.\r\n\r\nTl;dr: Role hijacking eliminates the purpose of choosing your role in que, and the lack of an efficient report option for this situation sends the message that jerks like him can just get away with it.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-01-05T09:14:03.909+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":13,"body":"So... Role hijacking isn't a thing until they get in the game and actually do it. I'm going to get massively downvoted, but hear me out.\n\nIf a player is attempting to \"hijack\" a role, but then the originally assigned role goes the original role of the \"hijacker\" there is instantly a plausible deniability.

If you to focus on reporting a player because he 'stole' your role, you are quite toxic. Rather than adapting you'd create a toxic environment so your chances to win are already slim.

People in promotions can start with -LP if they promote, or have their LP deducted if they don't. If the person gets punished in the meantime, you get the LP back. I'd argue potentially 3 or 10 LP minus the queue timer is a fair price.","replies":[{"poster":"Wacky9","date":"2019-01-06T05:30:40.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many times does this have to be repeated:\n**Reporting someone multiple times is not different from reporting them once.

And it isn't, because he never said that it's how it works. It would be breaking the NDA essentially.
