People talking about &quot;counterplay&quot; like making ADCs have skillshot auto attacks and other silly stuff like that. I&#039;m really against this, I think reliable damage, just like point and click CC, has an important place in the game. \r\n\r\nI think the problem with ADCs is that currently, they simply do the most damage in the game full stop. Their damage values are absolutely fucking incredible. The ADC is the team&#039;s source of sieging and ranged DPS. They should do the most effective damage in a game because their damage is:\r\n1) reliable. auto attacks don&#039;t miss.\r\n2) safe. ADCs with peel are extremely difficult to catch and deliver all of their damage from a place of safety because they&#039;re ranged.\r\n3) constant. ADCs have 100% uptime on their access to their DPS because they do 90% of their damage with auto attacks.\r\n\r\nADCs should have moderate damage values that work out to the highest effective damage in the game _only when played well_ because they deliver constant damage without downtime. The problem is ADCs are doing literally more damage than a mage or assassin does with their entire rotation using only auto attacks and their steroid. I see a lot of people describing ADC damage output as &quot;burst per second&quot;, which I think is apt. Riot just did a huge assassin pass last year that loaded up assassins with all kinds of gates and delays on their damage (which you can potentially dodge in addition to this), but later in the game an ADC can kill squishies and even fighters or off-tanks in 1-2 seconds, no questions asked. melee champs can be seen closing the gap between them and an ADC as a melee champion, successfully getting on top of them, the supposed success condition in a melee versus ranged encounter, and they&#039;ll just die regardless because the ADC bursts them with their autos alone. \r\n\r\nADC play patterns aren&#039;t the problem (that said, ADCs with conditionally gated damage like Caitlyn&#039;s DPS skyrocketing when she consistently lands Es and aims at people trapped by W is still preferably to strictly right click ADCs. Kog&#039;Maw for instance actively avoids using his damaging abilities in a skirmish because they negatively affect his DPS from strictly auto attacking), their damage is simply too high full stop. It trivializes the DPS aspect of the role because they essentially become assassins with 100% uptime.","replies":[{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2017-10-17T00:38:55.682+0000","up_votes":87,"down_votes":17,"body":"My personal opinion on the matter is that the game that was built at the beginning with: \nBurst > Sustained > Tank > Burst was one that worked. \n\nIt also has costs, namely people dying instantly with very little counterplay. \n\nWhen we changed unconditional burst to not be a viable strategy (think old LB, old Rengar), we also removed one of the checks for ADC's.

That only happens because damage is too high across the board. You can have the same hierarchy without having instabursts.\n\nYou would have to nerf sustain, of course, but after that, you could have a world where a burst champion's full combo leaves the adc low and it becomes very dangerous to stick around, as you don't recover all your hp in 2 seconds, as it is now.\n\nLowering overall damage allows for burst champions to be buffed to compensate for the lack of one shots, which makes them feel more bursty by comparison, despite being less bursty. Also, it would make teamfights and fights in general longer, allowing for more skill expression and fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whut Thuh ","date":"2017-10-17T02:30:07.318+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think a large part of the problem is that in addition to their ardent censor, lulu/janna/insert anyone else that can build ardent most adcs have their own form of self protection, my least favorite champ to do this is vayne, i play assassins and as soon as she gets 2 items shes nearly unapproachable . ult q away from stealth so you're left wondering where she was with no gapcloser left and then all of a sudden she e's you into a wall and kills in you in 3 hits. where did i go wrong? burst < sustain > tank >burst thats what this game has turned into. its not enough to \"debate\" about it, its obnoxious when the entire game is decided 80 percent of the time by wether your botlane loses or not. even if you smash your lane 4/0 but your botlane is 0/2 and they have ardent the games over","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-10-17T01:05:16.694+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Trading Stance,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bPE1A1gi,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-10-17T00:38:55.682+0000)\n>\n> My personal opinion on the matter is that the game that was built at the beginning with: \n\n> Burst &gt; Sustained &gt; Tank &gt; Burst was one that worked. \n> It also has costs, namely people dying instantly with very little counterplay. \n> \n> When we changed unconditional burst to not be a viable strategy (think old LB, old Rengar), we also removed one of the checks for ADC&#x27;s.

Based on [this page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Diver_champion) the only champs I'd see who'd be liable to spend a long time sitting around are Rengar, who's barely if even a diver and Pantheon. The rest of them already have very solid DPS.\n\nAs for assassins, yes, this is a defining trait of the class. If they can't kill someone they're shit till their CDs come up. It doesn't matter if they kill you in half a second or 2 seconds, this is a fact of the class. The only assassins who get around this do so by not actually being assassins like Akali, who plays more like Fiora than Zed.\n\n>Just now realizing, you'd also make catcher supports worse since it's easier for enchanters to just shield off damage now that there's less damage to shield.\n\nRiot's already talked about adding a 'shield breaker' item, but what you're talking about is basically boiling down to \"It'll break some champs and hurt other\".
