Usually its fixed in one restart it but in the last ranked game I played it took like 4 or 5 restarts. \n\nit says league is playing through the correct device,I can hear everthing else fine and I even disabled every other audio device on my PC. I have no idea what could be causing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T04:44:11.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have background applications interfering with League when it attempts to access your playback device. I'd like you to [**perform a clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) to ensure no background apps are running so you can hop into a custom match and see if anything's changed.\n\nLet me know what you experienced.","replies":[]}]}
