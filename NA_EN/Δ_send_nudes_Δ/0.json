If you get reported for flaming enough in order to get chat restricted, then you're most likely a toxic player, and Riot wants to stamp out toxicity. Take these lost rewards as motivation to reform your ways and try harder to be a nice person next season. I believe in you! You can get them!\nGames are fun when you're being a nice guy (or girl)! I get lots of positive replies when I try to start my games off on a friendly note, some jokingly negative replies that still make my day (\"Let's have a great game and a fun time!\" \"report Ashe for flaming\"), and then some negative replies that I ignore. No need to get myself frazzled over some guy or girl who can't take a bit of positivity. I'll tell my allies that they did a good job when they get a kill, or when their cs is really high, or when they get an objective, or when we win a teamfight. They might not respond, but getting that kind of encouragement feels good.\nHow do I know that? Because I would feel good if I got my play complimented.\nWe're all human beings here; we're not all that different. Since I like getting compliments, chances are other people like them too. I'd want a positive player in my games, so I be that positive player in others' games.\nMaybe I'll get some compliments back, and that feels good. Maybe I'll inspire someone else to be a bit more positive in his or her next game. That means I made someone else's day better, and that person made other people's days better. That's the kind of thing that makes me really happy.\nThis applies to toxicity as well. I'm sure you wouldn't like mean people populating your games. So what you need to do is stop being a mean player yourself. You're going to make other people's days better (or at least not make them worse), and they'll act happier towards you. You need to be the positive force in the community, so that others can follow your example.\n\nBe the agent of change, and make League a better place! It's all up to you, Oliver Dk10. **Are you going to let me down?**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-12-18T20:56:23.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket.\n\nAlso, were you by any chance chat restricted or banned on November 8?
