Yasuo is a squishy champion and only relies on lifesteal and high damage to survive(he heals a lot because he deals a lot of damage, if he can't deal damage, he can't heal, and thus he dies). If Sion ults and Malphite ults him, Sion is unstoppable while ulting, for one, and if he lands his ult and THEN Malphite ults him, Malphite just wasted a team based ultimate on a tank who will likely just walk away right after unless you all blow your CC on him(because you're not gonna kill him in enough time after landing only one form of CC on a tank), which would be what a tank would want so the rest of your team can fight uninterrupted. THIS is what Charles Barklius is saying. Certain champions are MORE vulnerable to CC than others. Generally squishier champions who have little to no CC of their own to fight back with are champions who are FAR MORE vulnerable to CC than others. While yes, everyone is vulnerable to CC, there are reasons why certain champions are MORE vulnerable to it.\n\nAs for your Yi example, yeah he can be pretty hard to lock down if he has enough attack speed, however Master Yi only goes untargetable, not invulnerable. If the CC is long enough, he'll still be CCed when he gets out of alpha strike.","replies":[{"poster":"greysand","date":"2018-05-11T16:42:30.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ult only yasuo, or ult only sion, is a waste anyway, because that ult is a battle changer, and if u only use it to kill 1 guy, being it soraka or yasuo, is a huge waste, the diference, u CANT ignore yasuo engaging, because he s ENORMOUS threath, while sion must be ignored, because his objetive is not kill, but put it easier for the threaths to do damage, obviously there is champs that have a better time dealing with cc , but also is true that while sion can get dealed by other ways, there is no other way with this other champs, also, u re saying that kill a yasuo by wasting the most powerfull cc you have is usefull in a tf? or is that yasuo is always alone (i know, retarded champ players have that stupid mental disorder of trying to kill in a 1 vs 4 situation because sometimes they manage to do it) but in the same situation, exactly the same, we know that while using that cc on a yasuo is a \"half good idea\" using it on sion, is a bad idea, why? because when sion can be deal by other ways, yasuo, yi, etc etc, re going to destroy everything in half second, u annoy them the same, sion becames useless because u give space to your team, making it a 4 vs 5, same as if u manage to kill yasuo, diference, if u didnt kill yasuo, he can come back to battle. \nalso , and this is the most important fact about this, is that the role that sion and yasuo do, is literaly the oposite, when sion enters is not to kill everyone, but for engage , making a usefull situation for his team, if he kills, fine, but thats not the primary objetive, if the other type of champ enters, is because they will kill, what means that,  engage with sion is not a missplay, while engage with yasuo is","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-05-11T21:25:33.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=greysand,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bAkcYop0,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-11T16:42:30.049+0000)\n>\n> ult only yasuo, or ult only sion, is a waste anyway, because that ult is a battle changer, and if u only use it to kill 1 guy, being it soraka or yasuo, is a huge waste, the diference, u CANT ignore yasuo engaging, because he s ENORMOUS threath, while sion must be ignored, because his objetive is not kill, but put it easier for the threaths to do damage, obviously there is champs that have a better time dealing with cc , but also is true that while sion can get dealed by other ways, there is no other way with this other champs, also, u re saying that kill a yasuo by wasting the most powerfull cc you have is usefull in a tf? or is that yasuo is always alone (i know, retarded champ players have that stupid mental disorder of trying to kill in a 1 vs 4 situation because sometimes they manage to do it) but in the same situation, exactly the same, we know that while using that cc on a yasuo is a &quot;half good idea&quot; using it on sion, is a bad idea, why? because when sion can be deal by other ways, yasuo, yi, etc etc, re going to destroy everything in half second, u annoy them the same, sion becames useless because u give space to your team, making it a 4 vs 5, same as if u manage to kill yasuo, diference, if u didnt kill yasuo, he can come back to battle. \n> also , and this is the most important fact about this, is that the role that sion and yasuo do, is literaly the oposite, when sion enters is not to kill everyone, but for engage , making a usefull situation for his team, if he kills, fine, but thats not the primary objetive, if the other type of champ enters, is because they will kill, what means that,  engage with sion is not a missplay, while engage with yasuo is\n\nThis is the point though. If you kill Yasuo, you're taking away 40% of their damage most likely. There are ALSO OTHER WAYS to kill Yasuo, but Yasuo is EXTREMELY vulnerable to CC, because he is placed in positions that make him easy to be CCed(his ult lasts a long time and keeps him in place for one), and he is very squishy. Sion actually does quite a bit of damage btw, but yes their roles are different. THAT'S THE POINT. Yasuo is there to kill people, which means he is easy to deal with through CC. Sion can get stunlocked, but he'll likely still survive, walk away, and try again at another point. Yasuo will just be dead. Wasting a Malphite ult on a Yasuo is not a waste btw, because again, he's likely going to be 40%+ of that team's damage. Champions that only have damage, are easy to deal with by CCing. Your argument was that CC kills everyone, but it doesn't always. If a Yasuo or a Katarina get CCed for example, they are 95% of the time going to die. The difference in champions vulnerable to CC and not vulnerable to CC are the likelihood that you will be able to CC them(as in they're either close range champions who have to be in range of CC, for example Tryndamere, Yasuo, Katarina, or they're long range champions who can avoid it easier, for example Lux, Xerath, Ziggs), or their survivability after being CCed(Zed vs Sion for example). If a champion has high damage, but little to nothing else, they're going to be easily able to 1v1, but they're going to have trouble vs champions who are able to CC them in teamfights. This is why they're vulnerable to CC. They build very squishy with no resistances and their primary goal is to kill people. If they are stopped from being able to do that for even a second, they're going to die in anything outside of a 1v1 most likely, and there are several times where they can die in that 1v1.","replies":[{"poster":"greysand","date":"2018-05-12T20:14:09.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first of all, the problem is that literally if u cc an enemy u re damaging his power to do his job, second is, that a missplay is a missplay, being it with yasuo or with sion, as in your example.\nso im going to tell you why its not exacly as you say, in the case of a bad engage, every champ in the game has high posibility of dying, sion, as a tank have more chances of survive, because he s a tank, his role is to take hits, in exchange he has less damage, but cc , and yeah, we know that he have a good kit, but still, in the case of a engage, if he enters , then he gets stunned, he has no other way of being usefull, assasins for other part, as you say, re beings created to, kill, and then run, a missplay in that, usually is, they still kill, but cant run, u understand the diference?

ADCs have protectors, assasins don't.","replies":[{"poster":"greysand","date":"2018-05-13T01:22:18.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"assasins dont have protectors? why?alistar cant protect a zed because? reasons? yi dies faster on cc? not at least when he heals himself half hp the second that he s out of that cc, right now katarina is stupid, basicaly because she doesnt even need to hit her kit to kill, literaly kata right now kills with jumps and daggers, the pasive is not even needed, then ult when u know that he cant fight back, assasins have high movility for something, if a kata stays at ur side more than 2 seconds, i assure you, its a bad kata, and that bad kata is still killing you, if u use zed ult to start a fight, u re a retard and i dont need to speak to you, u need that protectors, because they give you time for you to do your job","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-05-13T01:29:06.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=greysand,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bAkcYop0,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-13T01:22:18.938+0000)\n>\n> assasins dont have protectors? why?alistar cant protect a zed because? reasons? yi dies faster on cc? not at least when he heals himself half hp the second that he s out of that cc, right now katarina is stupid, basicaly because she doesnt even need to hit her kit to kill, literaly kata right now kills with jumps and daggers, the pasive is not even needed, then ult when u know that he cant fight back, assasins have high movility for something, if a kata stays at ur side more than 2 seconds, i assure you, its a bad kata, and that bad kata is still killing you, if u use zed ult to start a fight, u re a retard and i dont need to speak to you, u need that protectors, because they give you time for you to do your job\n\nHere is what I'm going to suggest to you. Play an assassin, or any type of champion who people claim is weaker to CC than other champions. Play those champions for at least a WEEK. Then go and play a tank, an ADC, a support for a week. Then come back and tell me the difference in their experiences vs CC. Right now you only talk about how OP assassins are and don't realize their weaknesses. Also no, a support is not going to protect an assassin over an ADC because they stick to their ADC overlords like glue. Most do anyways. SOME supports don't, but you find that rarely, even when you're carrying the game.\n\nAlso you can kill Yi WHILE HE'S CCed. Most other champions will be able to get out of it due to peel, healing, tankiness, etc. A high damage champion who relies on being up close and personal will die before that CC ends 95% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"greysand","date":"2018-05-13T16:21:58.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too late for that, im playing op assasins most of the time, interesting enough my kda is over the clouds right now, basically because kill is easy enough to give me time to think how i need to run away, i played 5 matchs as yasuo, and the only enemy that actually gave me problems was morde, and he dont even have cc, still is a dissapointment how i can overkill 2 of their team and still lose because they have 3 feed enemys XD but needless to say, that happened me in other lanes, playing sup is much worse , so there is that","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2018-05-11T21:14:13.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm okay with the 'cc them' argument in some cases, but not in others.\n\nTake Volibear. To me, saying he's weak to cc is reasonable. His MS steroid isn't too big, and righteous glory has a huge cooldown, so once you use ANY cc on his initial engage (even a slow), he shouldn't be able to get to your damage dealers, and thus gets shut down hard.\n\nNow take Master Yi. His ultimate prevents slows from working, and he has an ability that lets him go untargetable. I don't like the argument there, because he can play around your cc AND you need multiple cc to deal with him. As OP stated, that cc would have been really useful against anyone, and needing to funnel it onto Yi is a big advantage for him. I'm not saying Yi is OP or even strong, just that \"cc counters him\" is a sorry excuse for an argument.\n\nLikewise take fizz. It's great that I can lock him down with cc and kill him. It sucks that I have to wait for him to troll-pole first, and that even though I charm him immediately as he lands, my ADC dies at that moment too. Welp, I played perfectly, but since he lands his R my ADC is dead , so he did his job. Again, cc doesn't counter him because he has tools to avoid it and play around it.\n\nThe way I look at it is, these champions that cc counters, if you put them all together on the same team against a heavy cc team with just 1adc, would they win or lose?\nMost of the time they'd win, because most command multiple cc, which means your heavy cc team will run out of cc due to there being 5 such enemies, and whoever doesn't get cc'd will faceroll you.\n\nHowever a team of Volibears and Tryndameres would absolutely lose in such a scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"greysand","date":"2018-05-13T01:34:35.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats the point that i try to input, also, i liked another of ur points, voli actually is countered by all types of cc, and he actually suffers for it yes or yes, he actually falls under that, singed also, has that counter, IT HAS SENSE, but most assasin dont, (and i say that even when i hate talon, he gets hard time vs cc because he needs to use his ult ofensively if he wants to do all his damage) but then zed, ekko, yi, and fizz, have things to play with the enemy ccs, thats not a counter, thats a skill match, and is not a excuse","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-05-11T21:25:11.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different champions are more susceptible to CC than others.  Using two stuns on an Assassin gets you a lot more mileage than using two stuns on a tank.  If Talon runs into your team to kill your carry and Rammus taunts him, then he's dead.  If Sejuani runs into your team and Rammus taunts her, then she just types \"lul\" in all chat.\n\n\"Just CC them\" is a legitimate form of counterplay for a lot of champions and abilities.  If you manage to pick a team comp with 0 CC and Yasuo steamrolls your team because you can't lock him down, then you deserved to lose the game.
