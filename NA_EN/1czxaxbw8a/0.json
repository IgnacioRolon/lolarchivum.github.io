I started league at the end of season 2. I think league was the funnest game out there, up until almost halfway season 4. I had alot of great moments in the game, me and my roommates started a team ect, lots of laughs, blah blah. OKAY THE REAL POINT OF THIS POST, league of tanks and unhealthy itemization, terrible champs too nerf like &quot;EVERY ASSASSIN,&quot; Making certain champs almost unplayable, Rengar &quot;you nerfed his damage which was fine, but his E in midair is what made his combo out of ult clumpy and he&#039;s unplayable late game,&quot; Also every champ that is point click or takes no mechanics like Graves is in every game, they are tankier than you, they do more damage, and they can play from behind easily. \r\n\r\nCHAMPS THAT NEED REWORKS BADLY! There&#039;s alot of them but im just gonna name one.\r\nTalon\r\n-Champ has most basic abilities and cannot survive any tank or future meta\r\n-His W is good wave clear but it does Zero damage and scales poorly\r\n-unreliable to a team\r\n-no way to survive a team fight if he does his job\r\n-laning against almost any champion, means you have to extremely outplay them\r\n-Overall just low play potential and way to easy to counter\r\n-His E, it&#039;s called cutthroat, does no damage and cool down is super high.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-04-09T18:55:15.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Puddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sAVwoXhV,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-09T18:12:09.060+0000)\n>\n\n> -laning against almost any champion, means you have to extremely outplay them\n\n\nI lold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jon1174","date":"2016-04-09T18:27:05.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Na Na Na Na, Na Na Na Na, Hey Hey Hey...Goooood Bye!! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Valor NA","date":"2016-04-09T18:15:14.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have fun, they always come back tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2016-04-09T18:14:30.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.
