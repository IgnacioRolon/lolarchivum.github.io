However, after some scrubbing, the mode should stabilize, as the mode has far fewer variables on hand. There are more issues when new champions are added, and I don't think many want to see that flow to stop, regardless of the huge amount of champions already available.\n\nAny such mode would be limited on its capabilities, such as only bot mode matches without IP/RP capabilities, and possibly without any skin/champion integration (although I'd hardly consider it a threat to game interests to allow the full champion pool while offline...

It's simply offline capabilities with the game when issues arrive for traditional gameplay.\n\nBut, as far as the rest, an unofficial server can serve people who have difficulty connecting to a traditional server, whether through a firewall in all online networks or through nearby blackouts. Unofficial servers also can break borders that are typically there in normal gameplay, but do not actually effect gameplay for those who wish to play legitimately. Some games have, in fact, managed longer lifetimes than should have been available to them because of such servers, though likely decidedly illegal.\n\nLong story short, private servers have definite effects on the game, but really only to those that are pretty much breaking the rules anyway. If this game had content that was highly coveted and had extreme utility (like a typical MMO endgame item), I would consider the negative impacts from unofficial servers. However, with generally any form of gameplay in the game being available over a week's play (well, once you hit level 30), I don't see the negative effects truly harming this game. Just as was shown with URF mode, the unbalanced gameplay will lose interest over time, even when expressed in a \"seasonal\" fashion. However, sometimes it's helpful to have URF available here and there to keep the standard game from stagnating too much, and that's exactly how private servers can serve a game.\n\nIf you want to play this game legitimately, there are exactly no negative effects from private server usage, as you simply won't use them. However, if for some reason you end up firewalled out of League traditionally, a private server (or just offline capabilities) will serve people who end up stranded without LoL (and therefore probably stranded without any CPU fun).","replies":[{"poster":"VentusDragoon","date":"2015-05-21T12:35:07.080+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I truly think that the only way this could work is if Riot did something like TF2-- where you'd be able to play offline, but not with other players whatsoever.

I'm going to use Maplestory's unofficials (they have tons) as an example.\n\n1. Unofficial servers would allow crackers and programmers to unite and make game modes and champions and skins and all that that rito couldn't, wouldn't, or should not for legal purposes. In maplestory this occurred as people making entirely new classes, better graphics for the attacks of certain classes, and the super-common \"returning your character to level 1 while retaining one high-level ability\". \n\n2. Testing purposes. Yes, exploits and hacks would be easier to find with all the game information you're open to, but in Maplestory, people used the private servers to find out how certain character setups would develop, in the order you developed them, and what would be the absolute best way to make a character with the highest stats, usually exploiting old game mechanics like intelligence gaining higher mana per level up, and then transferring mana to HP with scrolls. They even found out ways of predicting how well armor would protect you in the game, since that information was never released. Also, people could test skins before buying them.\n\n3. No permanence. Without ranked, and without anything official to show the world, people won't stick with private servers for extended periods of time without going back UNLESS...\n\n4. The possibility of a private server doing Riot's job better. It has happened before that a Maplestory ps had done PvP or some other game that Maplestory itself didn't add to the game yet, and soon enough pvp was added to the original Maplestory game. It was glorious! If a private server outperforms riot, it would be a beautiful sight, and riot's hurt pride would force them to either attack the private server or have to *gasp* compete. Riot would never allow itself to be beaten by a completely free service. A little competition would really shape up Riot's lazy attitude.\n\n5. They can only legally run off of donations. The cash shops in Maplestory pservers were always based on money you could get in-game or as a reward for showing your support by posting on the forums or voting on that pserver on a pserver list. If they ever run for money they'd be taken down by force, though at riot's speed it'd probably be a few months before they do anything about it.\n\nSo yeah, mostly out of spite, but I think unofficial servers would be a really good for the players and for riot. They could even hire a scout to look for neat things on all the servers out there and copy them, sort of like what they did with jungle timers.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2015-05-22T02:08:01.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Private servers can't run legally under any circumstances.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-21T04:15:13.746+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"You don't need a server for offline purposes (depending on how it's done one may need it, but only a really small one would do), since you know, it's counter intuitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Painforged","date":"2015-05-21T04:16:42.616+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=MP1PWbvR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-21T04:15:13.746+0000)\n>\n> You don't need a server for offline purposes, since you know, it's counter intuitive.\n\nSorry, not really technical here with using the term \"server\" so forgive me.
