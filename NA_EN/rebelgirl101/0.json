I type in my username and password and try to click sign in, but it just flashes when I click it. I really want to play since I'm a new LoL player, but can't. Please help me!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T19:46:55.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange to hear about this flash, and suggest reporting it with a screenshot over at the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards.  In the meantime, see if you can get back in through the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
