The reason we're all making this very clear is that SO many people come around saying \"oh I didn't leave the game\" and they're technically correct that they did not leave. But then it turns out they were doing one of several other things that's functionally AFK and still gets you flagged by the system. So yeah, when somebody appears to be carefully choosing their words in order to be technically correct like that, it's going to be questioned.\n\nI would say if you strongly believe you were falsely flagged, you should submit a support ticket to have them look into it. But realistically, it's just a leaverbuster penalty. By the time support gets to the ticket, you'll have worked off the penalty anyhow. And it's not like your account is in danger of a permanent ban, because that's an entirely different system. The worst that happens is if you leave another game, you get a longer penalty. But if you don't leave/AFK in games as you said, then that's not even a likely result.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-05-24T15:01:17.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He described literally the only ways to get a Leaver Buster.
