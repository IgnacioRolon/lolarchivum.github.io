Why, you may ask? Because sometimes players want to buy a skin but didn't load any RP onto their account. If you're in champ select and want to match with your friends or buy a skin for a champ you don't pay often, maybe just forgot to buy it between games, you can't currently buy it if you don't have RP already on your account. Most players don't have RP on their account just sitting around, they load their account to buy a specific skin. Add an app to buy RP/buy a skin for your account. And add a refresh button to the champ select screen to manually refresh any purchases made on the app. It seems like a nice little feature item that can really come in handy.","replies":[]}
