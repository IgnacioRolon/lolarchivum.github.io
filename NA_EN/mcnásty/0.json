Now when I restarted and attempted to log back in it timeouted, so I couldn't even log in at this point. Also, why would you make it so that the game exits after a timeout on the login screen? Super annoying.\r\nAnyway, I tried running the LoL client as admin and even restarted my computer and installed updates for windows and nvidia, but nothing worked. \r\nAfter another 15 minutes I finally got past the log in timeout and reconnected to the game. After another 10 minutes I was finally back into the game, only to lose that one (and get flamed because I \"went afk\"). Seriously, what the  hell are u doing with your servers? Test them properly before u release new patches.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T01:06:48.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that if this particular issue was on the Servers end, all 10 players of the game would have also experienced the same issue as none of them would be able to connect to it.  If you were indeed the only one experiencing this issue, then it seems that the root cause lies elsewhere.\n\nTo dig a little further into this issue, is this the only game where you experienced this issue?  Or has this been occurring game to game?  Feel free to reply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Mcnásty","date":"2016-05-11T01:12:27.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been occurring every game so far. The previous game was ok, but the login issue still exists. The game before that one wasn't without issues though - I reconnected six times before finally getting into the loading screen and into the game that had been going on for 4 minutes already. I dont have any issues with anything else on my home network / internet connection whatsoever and I've turned off my firewall and other programs that might interfere (web browsers, windows indexing services, spotify, skype, etc). I'm using windows 10 with the newest updates installed.\n\nAlso, I know for sure that the first game that I experienced this issue wasn't problem-free for three other players that also had the same issue and had to restart their client to be able to reconnect to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T21:22:23.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you are experiencing login issues as well as needing to consistently try to connect to the game, there seems to be an issue preventing your computer from connecting to our PvP.net Servers (logging in) and the individual Game Servers.  It's hard to know exactly what the root cause specifically is, so we need to start eliminating some of the most common root causes.  Make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are some steps there you have already tried (turning off Firewalls for example), but make sure to complete every single other step in there as they are all crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nLet me know if the issues still persist!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
