Now we'd been friends for a very long time, I thought he'd developed feelings for me, so yesterday I decided to try and confess and ask him out to a movie sometime or maybe a dinner since we both have jobs and are in high school. So after school while we were walking to the buses I went up to him and confessed, instantly regretted it and was MORTIFIED, I got rejected by him, he blocked me on all social media, won't talk to me today, and also blocked me on league. Anyway, just a little story for you guys. I hope your valentines day was better. \n\n\n\n{{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[]}
