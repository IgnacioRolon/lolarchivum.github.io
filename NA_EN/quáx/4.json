Our adc was a miss fortune who accidentally took press the attack. Throughout the whole game they were getting stomped, same with top lane, and our jungler, who was quite good couldn&#039;t do anything to help lanes out. SO naturally I was the only one who did semi-decent. At the 15 minute mark the team marks up to surrender, I vote no because it was my last game of the night and wanted to make it last as long as possible, even if we were getting stomped. The miss fortune rages and asks who voted no. I respond with &quot;Me&quot; and she immediately starts flaming me. I find it super funny when people flame for no reason. So naturally I said nothing. Until the miss fortune stepped up a notch and asked me &quot;whats your address?&quot; Now after we lost the game I reported that mf. But I really want to know if that falls under the &quot;threat&quot; category. If anyone can tell me I&#039;d like to know because this made me pretty damn unhappy.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 DRACOS","date":"2019-01-11T04:00:27.985+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really because thats just poking into personal life","replies":[{"poster":"Quáx","date":"2019-01-11T04:02:01.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea but in terms of context, that of being toxic to me.

Doesn't take much brain effort to put together, if someone is flaming you and asking for you're address. It's not to send you a pizza or give you flowers on your doorstep.

Told you it was my last game, of the night. I have a right to enjoy myself and play, I'm not gonna surrender when a bunch of people doing bad. Plus I'm sure that its not my teammates last games. Also, yes flaming and asking about personal life is pretty damn sketchy imo. Also(and this wasn't my reasoning) if a person was flaming me and I was doing BAD in the game. Id probably still say no. Because frankly, you don't flame me and get away with it. But like I said, not my primary reason for saying no. Why are you so angry at me?","replies":[]}]}]}
