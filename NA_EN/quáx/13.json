It uses ragged edging, multiple shading areas, and doesn't particularly lend itself to being easily replicated. It's an amateur logo, and while it has charms, it also screams of a dated era from long ago that evokes the images of game like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro. \n \nThe new logo is modern, cleaner, crisp, and while I personally don't like the font, it's smooth and easy to replicate. It also uses a lot less colors, which means it can be applied to many different backgrounds and such much easier than something with multiple shades. It fluidly fits into modern design standards, and is a little more timeless, so going forward it won't look like it's a relic from the 90s/00s so unabashedly as their old logo does.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2019-04-17T14:59:44.745+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree with you about their old logo... the big problem with their new logo: There's nothing INTERESTING about it.

These are all logos of MAJOR brands, and they all go for sweet, simple, and modern. Riot's new logo mimics most of them, actually, in that it's a pictographic paired with simple text.\n\nhttps://www.upr.org/sites/upr/files/styles/x_large/public/201808/McDonalds-Logo.jpg\nhttps://www.logolynx.com/images/logolynx/5b/5bc63fc882d3fa02619c0a702a96c820.png\nhttps://1gew6o3qn6vx9kp3s42ge0y1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/8867.Microsoft_5F00_Logo_2D00_for_2D00_screen.jpg\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Taco_Bell_2016.svg/1200px-Taco_Bell_2016.svg.png\nhttps://www.gap.com/Asset_Archive/search/logos/Old_Navy.jpg\nhttps://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Square-Enix-H1-2019-01-Square-Enix-Logo.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2019-04-17T15:16:46.784+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference in some of these cases is that they've changed their logos a few times, and now some part of their logo IS iconic enough to pop out on its own. \n\nThe Golden Arches, the bell, the apple logo, Microsoft's little squares.... those are all things that have such power on their own that they stand out.

It's still a fist, it still looks pretty much like the old version, and given that Riot isn't as big of a brand as any of the companies I've listed, obviously their fist won't have as much power on it's own until it establishes itself more. I personally recognize it as Riot's fist, as does the majority of players, I'd wager.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2019-04-17T15:32:36.758+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"*shrugs* Judging by the number of people who hate the logo, I think not.\n\nThe new logo is just boring. I see it and my eyes just pass over it, not even noticing it. It has no interest to it. The font is bland, the fist has no punch. There's no colour variation to catch the eye, nothing. There's literally nothing interesting about it.\n\nEvery one of those logos you put, except Old Navy, has SOMETHING about it that stands out. McDonald's has 3 colours and the giant golden arches, Apple's apple is like twice the size of the text, making it what you see immediately. Microsoft's logo has several colours, as well as an interesting font choice. Taco Bell has the unique black and purple aesthetic, as well as a giant emblem. Square Enix has the two red marks in the Es to create a visual focal point as well as an interesting font.(I still think Squenix Logo is bad, but it's better than Riot's)\n\nThe only thing that is distinctive about Riot's logo is the 'i' in Riot, and with the way the logo is printed it looks like a mistake/misprint to me(even though I know that's been a part of their logo forever)","replies":[{"poster":"Cotten Eyed Joe","date":"2019-04-18T04:13:49.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, with how much League changed since season 1, I kinda like the logo.
