At this point, I'm starting to just consider playing ranked or ARAM soley instead of normals. Over the past 3 days of playing norms, I have reported 7 players and gotten back 5 tickets saying I banned people, and it's not just norms it's ranked too. \r\n\r\nPreseason: \"Oh I don't need to try in ranked, its preseason and the ladder will be reset.\"\r\nIn regular season: \"Oh I don't need to try in ranked, I already got my dream rank and hit my point\"\r\nDuring placements: \"Oh I don't need to try, I know ill get a good rank no matter what\"\r\nDuring anything: \"Oh I don't need to try, its just a game LOL\"\r\n\r\nThese are all things I have come across in the past years that have either been verbatim or very close to/sent a similar message. Stop giving players excuses to not try and win the game, having fun **IS ALLOWED** it's why we all play, but if your version of fun is trolling and harassing others, then you need to reevaluate your priorities, because there are 9 other players who want to try and win and practice to the best of their ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2019-12-04T17:13:08.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"You were the biggest feeder or one of the bigger feeders in most of your recent losses.

None of your losses even have just a single player doing poorly.  Your whole team has done poorly in those losses, including you.\n\nHarassing teammates is already against the rules, and as you've pointed out, leads to penalties.\n\nIntentionally feeding is already against the rules, and leads to penalties.\n\nBut none of your games show anyone intentionally feeding.  They're just players doing poorly and trying to shrug it off.  You \"did bad\" in about 50% of your games. My point is that if everyone \"did bad\" at the rate that you \"did bad\" you'd have 2 people you consider feeders  on your team every single game.\n\nPeople know that they're doing badly.  They don't need you pointing it out, or telling them to \"try\".\n\nAs for my 1/7 game, yes I did poorly.  It was my second game ever playing in the new jungle, and I attempted an early gank that went poorly and caused on early death, which is extremely punishing now.  It was also my first time seeing Senna in play, so I didn't have a good handle on the interaction with her (and apparently neither did my botlane).  But I didn't do poorly enough to be the sole cause of the loss.  There were TWO players on my team with DOUBLE my deaths.  \n\nBut here's the difference between you and me.  I didn't come here to complain post about teammates doing poorly.","replies":[{"poster":"Quáx","date":"2019-12-04T18:04:38.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Again.

Someone doesn't say \"chill it's just preseason\" unless the statement was a response to \"stop sucking\".  That you keep having this conversation with people in game says more about you than it does about them.  You don't need to tell people they're doing poorly.  When someone does poorly, they know it.  \n\nAlso, the very first thing I said about my bad game was \"As for my 1/7 game, yes I did poorly.\" So, I don't know where you're going with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-05T00:57:13.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Subdue is 100% on point, bro!
