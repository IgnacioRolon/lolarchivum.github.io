I am a plat an while there were 1-2 plats in that game, most of them were golds and unranked accounts. I have almost 100 more wins than losses in normal games, so can someone explain to me why Im getting paired with players who tilt me off the face of the earth(sometimes) when Im clearly a better player and should be paired with plat players where I am. \r\n\r\nIn case you want proof. Here you go.\r\n\r\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Quáx","replies":[]}
