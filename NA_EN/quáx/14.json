This game sucks, it's so unbalanced and its been that way for ages. I don't want to rant about why this game is so shit, you've all heard it a billion times over so I won't waste my time and your time explaining. The fighting game they showcased looks amazing, as a person who mains Vi, I'm like 90% sure she'll be in the game, and I can't wait.
