As current I feel that getting to play ranked is fairly simple.  One could simply play bot matches until lvl 30 and then start playing (as long as they own the prereq number of champs).  To improve skill entrance into ranked matches I think that  it would be wonderful if you made there be a required number of normal games at level 30 be played before entering ranked.  Currently the state of Bronze is really bad, especially since experience to reach level 30 was halved.  I know that Elo hell doesnt exist, but honestly I feel that when I get Yasuo jg and Teemo mid it just makes it extremely difficult to enjoy this game and have hope of getting out of bronze","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-07-05T19:10:44.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure riot has confirmed what im saying below somewhere but I can't remember where.\n\nThey like ranked to be available to everyone at any skill level. The only requirement past leveling up to 30 is having enough champs to guarantee you can make it past champ select.  Thats the point of ranked.  That there is a representation for your skill level from bronze to challenger regardless of what it may be.","replies":[{"poster":"BurakkuHishou","date":"2016-07-05T19:55:45.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you get the boosted people who, after getting boosted up to Gold, will trickle all the way back down to bronze dragging down anyone unfortunate to meet them because they can't handle that higher ELO of play. \n\nThen you get the Toxic ones, who do deserve their ELO because of their skill, but if one thing goes wrong, you can kiss your rating good bye. I used to have a friend that was Toxic, and he was trained to be Toxic because \"if a teammate is doing bad, he doesn't deserve to win, even if it means a hit to your own rating.\" unfortunate for the other 3 people i know.\n\nThen you get the Trolls...and they are about as varied as you can get but all achieve the same goal: Making you rage quit harder than Trick2g getting camped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YouBelong2Disney","date":"2016-07-05T19:11:08.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no they dont need that. They do need to make it so that you have to have at least 5 S- normal games with a champion before you can play it in ranked tho.","replies":[]}]}
