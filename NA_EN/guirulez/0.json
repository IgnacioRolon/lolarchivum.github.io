It just means you're expecting something specific and unreliable to show up to confirm to you that someone was punished.\n\nBesides - even if it does show up, you'll never know who it's for. You could've reported 20 players who all got punished, and the pop up would probably only come up for one of them. And frankly, you shouldn't care if they got punished or not - if you reported them, and they did wrong, they will. You'll likely never see them again, so concerning yourself with their account status will do nothing for you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-30T02:03:49.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still toxic.

Furthermore as already mentioned, sharing your account is illegal and can get you banned.  Set him up a different account.\n\nAs for why it is usually fair, the system is based off of results on the tribunal.  Cases where players were shown to vote for punishment are punished, and games where this is not true they are not punished.  In other words punishments and validity of reports was voted on by the playerbase, aka your peers in LoL.
