What is loading indefinitely?  Do you have any screenshots?  Using third party programs are risky, and likely to cause you issues.  Before anything else, your best bet is to remove any third party programs for a fresh slate as the fastest way to rule out possibilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Unlucky47","date":"2016-12-30T17:32:09.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry don't know how to post screen shots here.

What happens if you try the legacy version:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nBlack screens usually indicate a connection problem because it can't download assets, but because of everything your client has gone through there could be other issues causing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Unlucky47","date":"2016-12-31T23:39:06.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I'm curious about your job.
