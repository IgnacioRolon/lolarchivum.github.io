I mainly keep the all chat option checked off, as do a lot of people i&#039;m sure but there&#039;s still a big portion of people who keep it on. I just find it annoying when teammates get into arguments with others on the opposing team when they should be cooperating with their own team. Obviously the issue goes far beyond just this game like there are immature people all over this world and we cant expect people to work together efficiently on a game if we cant do so in real life. Having said that, it&#039;d be really appreciated if all chat is just removed. It&#039;s very simple, and i&#039;m sure a lot of people don&#039;t even bother with all chat, but i still think it would be worth doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-10T17:37:13.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or just turn all chat off?

All chat used to be a tool to get an afk reported among other uses but the increase in toxic players has depreciated its uses.","replies":[]}]}
