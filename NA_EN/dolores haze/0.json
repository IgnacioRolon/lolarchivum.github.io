Just like if I had an actual 'lag', a sudden increase of my ms (that are, by the way, around 50 for me). Yet my ms do NOT increase but instead are still around 50. So I would really be delighted if one of you gentlemen and/or gentlewomen from Riot Games could check this, as this problems makes it really hard to play League of Legends without getting frustrated because of all the death and/or the loses one gets thanks to that 'bug' or what ever you want to call it. Before you might ask, I checked my internet  connection, my computer aswell as everything I can and could check on MY end. Seems kinda similar to the one that came with patch 6,1 last year. Am I like the only one with such problems or are there others out there too? :O (Sorry for my bad English aswell~).\nKind regards, Inorí Yuzuriha.","replies":[{"poster":"Ýetí","date":"2017-01-16T02:33:38.378+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having a similar issue over here. I'm room mates with my cousin and we both play League of Legends. Ever since the patch came out, for some reason he is having massive lag in the whole client and in game. The client loads and moves choppy and slow and he experiencing super low frame rates in game. I know it's not the Internet because we are both on the same Internet and we are both on Ethernet. Every thing else on the computer runs and plays just fine and it literally started after he patched 7.1\n\nAny ideas?","replies":[]},{"poster":"N4k4t4","date":"2017-03-06T00:22:39.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same problem here,but i only start having this problem after the last patch...before that i always played without lag spikes.\nits kinda anoying and already made me lost a couple of important fights. if someone gets a solution for this,let us know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T17:26:38.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be suffering from packet loss, which might not show up on your ping.

I have the same problem as the guy. Steady ping at 41 ms and no packet loss. Normally, I always have 80 FPS. Now, I get these drops anytime in game were I have 0 fps, 20 fps, 45 fps for like 3-4 seconds. When I join game, it s laggy as hell, but it gets better (why, i don t know) as the game goes on. And when there is this 'Victory/Defeat' message, I can click, but it take at least 4 minutes before I get to the 'score menu'. It never happened before.. I tried reinstalling and repairing.

I notice even more frequent lag spikes around MID for some reason. When I jg not as noticeable. It is completely frustrating to play champs like FIZZ, KAT, other where rotation timing is critical. It has gotten to the point, Im not even playing as much because I find myself getting angry and frustrated because the spikes seem to happen at the worse possible time. It has become vary discouraging. I hope LoL gets a grip on this issue. I Do not think its a computer or internet issue, as we all seem to be experiencing the same thing, and it started happening immediately after the patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZÜMÖ","date":"2018-01-16T21:11:44.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been experiencing the same issue as everyone here is saying. Since that patch I have been getting frozen or delayed actions upon trying to move or cancel movements as well as just overall game play. My ms does not spike and my fps drops but only a couple frames(from 140 to about 120/110). I have only experienced this since 7.24. I have not changed setup, settings, or connections. In fact I have a roommate who plays right next to me and he does not experience any of these issues. I am happy to see I am not the only one but sad to see no progress or tips on how to fix this. If anyone does know something, I would like to find some sort of solution. I have tried reinstalling, repairing, dropping settings and quality, as well as re installing my graphics drivers.
