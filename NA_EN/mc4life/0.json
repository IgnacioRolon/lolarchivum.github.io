Normal insults: \"Idiot\", \"R%%%%%\", \"Moron(yep)\" is all considered toxic and will get you banned if you keep on doing it.\n\n 2. Familly related insults: Calling someone idiot is one thing, but \"I fck ur mom\", \"Ask ur mom\", \"Ur mom told me\".  are much worse things to say! This is going to get you chat restrict pretty much after 1-2 games, and also can make IFS skip you the 2-weeks suspensions, and instantly give you permanent ban after 25 games chat restrict.\n\n 3. Skill related insults: \"Noob\", \"Bronze\", \"L2p\", \"Boosted\", \"How much you paid that acc?\", \"ebay\", \"go back to iron\" is considered very toxic and will get you banned after as far as i know 3 games at start, going down to 1 game after 2-3 punishments.\n\n 4. Golden one: \"Kys\" can get you banned very very easily beacuse it really provocates players a lot, trying to avoid it by typing \"Ky$\", typing it in 3 seperated messagse or so, will only make things worse. Avoid this at any costs.\n\n* Calling out reports:\n -Many of you probably didin't know this, but \"x9\", \"reported\", \"[All] Can you please report this guy?\" is considered toxic as well. Keep in mind to if your other players in your game think someone should be punished they will report him, you telling them to do so won't change anything expect status on you'r account from -not punished- to -punished-.\n\n* Arguing even if no toxic words are used is considered toxic and will get you banned, i know to muting them can be really hard, but if you see someone complaining even a bit at start of game, mute them right off, it's much easier to mute someone before you get tilted.\n\nNot just flame is considered toxic, every shape of unusefull, givin up, pointless and tilting behaivor is considered toxic, telling to riot support \"if i say someone fck ur m, it doesnt have to mean fck ur mom, it can mean fck ur maths and that kind of stuff you know?\" will cause riot not to give a single fck about ur ban appeal, we all know what you meant by that, even if you actually did not mean it(which never happend in history of planet Earth), typing this will get you banned, ANY kind of trying to avoid IFS will result in ban, this is unwanted as well, and IFS is made soo it detects when you attempt to avoid it.\n\n* How can i help myself?\n\n 1. Best way is to find some friends to play with VIA VOICE CHAT. Atmosphere is much brighter with constant jokes and conversations than without them. If you get tilted about something you can yell out in voice chat and your friend will most likely respond with smth that will make you feel better. Avoid playing alone, if none of your friends are there find something other to take your time while they come. I recommend trying out game \"Osu!\", i've seen very much ppl playing this and it srsly occupies your attention for a long time, i personally don't play it, but only cuz i have diffrent ways to consume my time, still osu! is very good at doing this. Ofc it doesn't have to to be any games, it can be anything that occupies you'r attention enough.\n\n 2. Listening to music helps some players, and some of them not, still give it a shot ^^\n\n  3. Most of ppl will tell you \"hit something to relifef you'r stress\" or that kind of stuff. This WILL NOT WORK, you don't want to relief ur stress, you want not to be stressed at all, this will only worsen things up.\n\n\nThat's all from me hope i helped someone, have a nice day ^^\n\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, being afflicted by chat restriction does NOT let you flame, if you use you message every 4mins to flame more you can get banned while being chat restricted. Note that this won't remove chat restriction, it will wait you after your ban passes.","replies":[{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-08-08T10:55:41.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">Arguing even if no toxic words are used is considered toxic and will get you banned, i know to muting them can be really hard, but if you see someone complaining even a bit at start of game, mute them right off, it's much easier to mute someone before you get tilted.\n\nVery much depends on what is being said.

They punish for all kinds of things, and thats one of them. A lot of arguing over past events, while not toxic, is derailing the task at hand (winning the game) and can result in a punishment.
