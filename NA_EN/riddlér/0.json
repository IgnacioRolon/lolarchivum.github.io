So i thought that maybe what I did could also work for you. I updated to the latest version of Windows 10 and turned off Windows Firewall as I was advised to. After that it still did the same, but then I just stopped trying to update it for at least an hour. When I tried it again now it began to actually scan files and update all the way (still going straight to 33% at first)  It actually patched faster than ever before! I hope this helps you as it did for me :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T23:54:02.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At 33%, your patcher is trying to maintain a connection to download updates.

I thought it was because I didn't have the latest version of Windows but I just updated it and its still the same way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Illidan93","date":"2016-08-13T03:52:12.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while updating it hits 99% and then says NOPE!!! and stops{{champion:115}}  is riots face","replies":[]},{"poster":"Just A Goddess","date":"2016-08-12T21:57:48.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having the same issue, and i have no idea what to do :/ Its been days now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T22:07:14.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just responded to your thread! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
