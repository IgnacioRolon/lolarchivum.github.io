By player's perspective I am referencing that it is my belief that Riot would rather spend time on reworks that make them more money.\n\n2.) By test of time I mean that Riot would never drop a champion like that in today's game.\n\n3.) By current state I mean his kit that has an extreme gap between learning curve/skill and impact on a game.","replies":[{"poster":"7000 Steps Troll","date":"2017-02-19T06:58:49.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologize I forgot one.\n\n4.) Being relevant does not mean that everything is fine. Hypothetically, if Riot uploaded a champion that automatically won you a game by picking it, it would be a relevant champion.
