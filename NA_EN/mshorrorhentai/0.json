I love my youth and beauty, I crave staying young.\nBut I too can grow old;these wrinkles will not do, to keep my beauty I must feed on the young and beautiful. At night draining their youth \nfor my own youth and beauty. The towns people was aware of my powers, they knew I practice magic, and we have \nan agreement to leave me be and I shall protect them from any unwanted harm, but it does get tiring defending this town. How it takes \na toll on my beauty. The town is enraged they are wanting justice for their young. I must keep my dirty little secret from them,\nthey cant ever know that it was me who turn their young old with one foot in the grave.\nAs I sit in front of my vanity mirror brushing my hair, I hear in the distance the towns people making such a racket \nI can hear them getting closer, they sound as if they are at my door....Then silence and a cool draft of air! \nHeh so I guess the towns people wasn&#039;t so stupid as I thought they were. \nThey discovered my secret and they sure did get their revenge.\nThey took everything from me, MY BEAUTY AND MY YOUTH! I too shall get my revenge!\n\n  I hate how the cold can make ones skin so pale and lifeless, I love the warmth how it can make\nmy cheeks rosey and the slight bronze color to my skin but they took that away from me. \nI hate the darkness more and this mask how I despise this mask,Now I have to hide my face. \nThey disfigured my beautiful face forced me into the shadows and for what just a few children that had to age way before their time?\nThey call it justice, well I will have my justice for what they&#039;ve done to me.\nAlas I see the dark night glowing bright orange, I stand in my window with a smirk on my face. \nThey may received their justice but little do they know their justice they had done wont last long.\nCause I too have a little trick up my sleeve, so I guess this means I&#039;m fired? \n\nAP/ mana user (Range).Role Mage.\n\nPassive: Reflects a basic auto attack every 2 minutes, max level every 1 minute.\n\nAuto Attacks: Throws a small vanity mirror (Range).\nSpell Q:Broken Mirror- Sends a shard of glass out hitting any minions/enemy champ.\nSpell W:Regain Youth- Links herself to a enemy champ draining their health as her own.\nSpell E:The reveal - Takes her mask off revealing her face any enemy champ facing her will be stun for 3 to 4 seconds.\nSpell R:Mirror Reflection- Pulls a mirror out stealing the enemy champs reflection that fights with her for 10 seconds.\n\n\nFaction(s) related to: The Noxus or Shadow Isle.\nRace: Human/witch (Undead).\nDescription: Dark eyes with a small detail in one eye, blood red lips wearing a porcelain mask, very white\npale cracked skin.\nConflicted with: Katarina, Leona, Ahri.\nAllied with: Cassiopeia, Morgana, Lissandra.\nLove Interest: None to be mention but been caught glancing at Talon.\nQuest in League: To get her revenge on the ones that took her beauty from and to show she is still powerful even beyond death.\n\n\n\nSayings:\nChampion Selection: I hope you ain&#039;t fragile Summoner.\n\nMoving: You&#039;re in control for now.\nI ain&#039;t as fragile as I look.\nBe still like my youth.\n\nAttacks: 7 years bad luck ain&#039;t so bad.\nThis is what revenge tastes like.\nLet me give you a makeover.\n\nJokes: So you&#039;re telling me beauty can be skin deep? ha don&#039;t make me laugh.\n[Pulls out a mirror] all this humanity will dry my skin out [flips her hair].\n[Pulls mirror out and it shatters on her when she looks in it then throws a fit, throwing the mirror down].\n\nTaunts: You only wish you can be me.\nDon&#039;t dare think you&#039;re in the same league as me.\nIs that the best you can do?\n\nInteractions: Katarina - Let me give you another scar on that pretty face.\nLeona - All that sun you should be burnt up by now.\nAhri laning against- Was that a charm or a fear? I couldn&#039;t tell.\nTalon- I put a spell on you.\nCassiopeia- I can&#039;t see how scales can be flattering.\nLissandra near- Is it me or did it just get cold?\nMorgana- How can you fall with having wings?\nDraven - You can&#039;t be serious [pauses] oh you are...(laughs evil)\n\n\n(As she dies she shatters like a mirror)\n\n\n\n\n(Personal note)\nAlot of thought did go into this champion idea so be kind with the comments and I would like any positive advice/opinion. The pictures I added was a ideal of what she might look like. Please also keep in mind that if Riot was to use this champ or anyone else's champ idea, they will change quite few things for their liking and what they know sells, so if this champ or any champ was used its not solid stone.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2015-06-27T02:15:40.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She should have a special interaction with the items.. {{item:3151}} {{item:3136}} ...

Maybe something like X% of spell damage is reflected back. All of her abilities are in and of themselves. Try making some of her abilities work together on their own. Like The W and the Q.. Let's say you're locked on an enemy with \"Regain Youth\"- you could activate \"Broken Mirror\" to do additional damage as long as you're using \"Regain Youth\". Plus you could add more effects and conditions to your abilities. Like \"Broken Mirror\" lowers MR on top of damage, or something like: 'if target is sunned, \"Regain Youth\" drains more health and slows enemy. Amp up your champ. The ultimate is vague.. is it like \"Children of the Grave\"-  {{champion:82}} - You should specify what the 'reflection' does.

Plus, you should have a spell that damages more than one enemy. I have an idea for \"Broken Mirror\"-  Beltane summons a large mirror over a crowd of enemies for a few seconds. While the mirror is up, enemies lose magic resistance, and spells against them gain spell vamp. Beltane can re-activate \"Broken Mirror\", before it dissolves, to shatter the mirror and deal damage to enemies in area.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MsHorrorHentai","date":"2015-06-27T01:55:07.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok how about passive, reflects a magic spell every 130seconds?","replies":[{"poster":"Ekko Loves Me","date":"2015-06-27T04:00:48.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FrostyJan,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Oxu7W2wi,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-06-27T01:55:07.759+0000)\n>\n> Ok how about passive, reflects a magic spell every 130seconds?\n\nHaving it as a passive and not an active is the worst part, takes away any power the player has over it.\n\nIf a reflection goes well it's because the enemy fucked up, not that you played well","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-06-27T02:31:33.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure where Ostarion came from or why they have decided to plague these boards the last week or so, but this person has been consistently negative, toxic and overbearingly harsh in at least half a dozen different concept threads that I've seen.

I suggested with a single basic attack other than a spell because of the fact that she would be able to reflect something like an auto attack after a spell like Lux does. But then I thought of the out put of an ADC bitching about like their auto attack being reflected back at them every 1 minute. So yes the 2 minute thing sounds kinda shitty but I think if you have a better suggestion for a passive write it down.
