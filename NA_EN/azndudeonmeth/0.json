Sadly, there is still one outstanding issue with her, she ults in place when below 50% hp, meaning that when she goes versus ranged units, she is unable to damage them. This is much more noticeable as of now because she is actually a decent mid game carry, who can carry items until you place them on a different unit in the late game. Sadly, her mechanic of ulting in place when below 50% hurts more than it helps usually. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying to remove this mechanic, but I would like to see at least 1 of 2 changes. \r\n1. Her ult only activates on herself if someone is within its range.\r\n2. She heals every ult activation while below 50%, regardless if it hits anyone or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-09-09T14:20:31.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, what i'd like is her loosing a bit damage on that ult, but therefor adding a heal to her selfult and mabye increaseing her basehelath by 50, allowing her to be some kind of frontline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-08T17:53:55.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea that she heals herself when she ults herself.  This is not only what happens in SR, but also makes sense from a damage perspective.  If she ults herself but doesn't heal herself, there is 1 less target she does damage to.  If instead she heals that same amount, she maintains the total amount of \"damage\" done.  It's not enough of a heal to break the bank, either, so I don't see it abusable.","replies":[]}]}
