I suggest reworking the buff entirely, or reducing the disable time to 5 seconds for the 2 hextech champion synergy. When one is in the mid game, and only has 2-4 items, the hextech disable makes fights nearly impossible when stacking items. At this point, it's very hard to make it to late game, where items are spread across more units due to a higher number of items. \r\n\r\nNobody utilizes the 4 champion synergy hextech combo because of the terrible synergy between hextech units; it's not worth the reward. Honestly, I believe that reworking the class to be a buff instead of a debuff for the enemy team to be a better choice. For example, the buff could be to give all items double or more of their base stats at full synergy, and at 2 champion synergy, to buff one random stat on the item. Making it a buff would be much more appealing to everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Brolando","date":"2019-10-01T20:46:26.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate this trait because it fucks me over consistently when I'm not getting a lot of items so the few items I do manage to make get disabled by someone who actually has good items. Like GG, that shit is completely anti-fun and should have never been added to the game, legit hate this more than glacials. \n\nIf items are too OP then fucking nerf the problem items rather than adding an unbalanced trait to the game in order to deal with a pre-existing problem, the fact that it's AoE is also just beyond ridiculous.

Dont get me wrong i feel like the time items are offline needs a bit of a nerf, but over all its fine.\n\nThe real issue that makes Hextech seem piss poor is the fact that items drops are RNG. One of the reasons Hextech was implemented was to counter the teams that would get all the high items drops vs those that didnt. Item drops are so RNG that most of the time there is at least one guy in the game who has 8-12 items and one who gets like 3. The Hex bonus is supposed to help the guy with 3 have a more even playing field by running Hex. \n\nYes running Hex into mid/late game can help with later fights but there are so many better comps out there, that its not really needed unless you still dont have the items when your opponents do. In all retrospect, however, i dont think they really needed a 4 piece bonus, just a three. You can make comps using three units that work and fit better that actually using all 4.","replies":[{"poster":"AznDudeOnMeth","date":"2019-09-08T17:13:01.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe you're wrong about the rng factor being frustrating at times, but I don't think that it's a bad thing either. Everyone has a chance at a high roll game, and also very terrible rng games. The rng adds a little fun factor to the game I believe. \n\nI will say that in the late game, unless you're using jinx as a hyper carry, there are few cases where running hextech is that great in comparison to other synergy. I believe that hextech is just a little too strong in the mid game just because it deletes all or most of the items that the opponent has.","replies":[]}]}]}
