Then after that the message in the title appeared and I couldnt log in anymore.\r\nI tried the solution fix where people were deleting a line of code in the game packages or something, but the code would revert back everytime i opened the client again. (Yes i even tried restarting the computer before deleting the line of code and restarting before opening the client).\r\nI tried to to a client repair, but that failed. \r\nI am trying to reinstall the whole game now but it won't even let me reinstall lol. Now im even further away from solving this issue\r\n\r\nWhat Should I do?\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T03:09:38.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm starting to notice these login issues are affecting a larger number of players.
