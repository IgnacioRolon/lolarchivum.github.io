I've heard from friends I've got a short fuse and I tried working on it for the past year. I think I've really changed over the past year. What I said in chat was very toxic and not the impression I want to make. I want to turn over a new leaf whilst keeping all my progress. I've spent time and made new friends so I want to reconnect to this game because it seems like it's changed a lot. Thank you for reading and I hope you can approve my request.","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-06-21T06:55:39.877+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it has been over a year, then you can try to write a very nice letter to support. An appeal, as you said. Maybe you'll say something that will allow them to reverse your ban.

And if you don't know it hear it now.\n\nNone has gotten unbanned except for cases that the ban was wrongfully issued in the first place.\nSuch as: \n1)Legit strategies that were wrongfully perceived as inting.\n2)a 5-man group were someone troll-reported their friend and all 4 other people came forward and said it was a joke.\n\nIf you are thinking of T1. His accounts were never unbanned. He was just allowed to create new accounts from scratch and not have them banned as soon as Riot found out they belonged to him.","replies":[]}]}]}
