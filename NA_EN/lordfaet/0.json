They changed the password and the verified e-mail address. Without knowing the current password, I can't change anything back. The only reason I can even do this is because my account is still logged in on my browser. I wasn't really sure what to do about this or where I should go, so I decided to just post something here and hope that I at least get some advice about where I should go next to get help with this. I'll happily provide all the proof I possibly can to prove to Riot that I'm the actual owner of this account, including e-mails dating back to 2013 at MY e-mail address which is not the current one on the account, and even the credit card information I use to purchase Riot Points.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I really need some help here. If I can't get Riot to help me out here, then please someone at least tell where I **should ** go to get their help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T23:56:10.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help out with your specific issue individually through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
