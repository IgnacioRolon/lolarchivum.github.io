Victim mentality in league of legends","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":26,"body":"I received a 14 day suspension on my account to today. I was told the following text is why I received this ban. To give background of myself I have been playing league since season 2 and have never gotten any type of ban. I firmly believe that staying forward thinking and focusing on your own play is how you win, and that fighting or flaming team mates only lowers your chance of winning and is a waste of your time. Yet in every single game players will flame eachother, especially if they are losing. 90% of the losing games I have had in the past 7 years of playing this game people flame each other. It will continue to be like this forever, because it is a competition and they want to win. There will always be tension in competition and that is honestly what makes it fun and worth it to play, because otherwise it feels meaningless. In the 2 games presented to me I was being flamed in both and defending myself. Both of these games are just me responding (very jokingly sarcastically) to flame being thrown at me. There is no hostile intent in anything I say. I believe the reason i got banned is because of a game that isn&#039;t shown here where I said &quot;KYS&quot; in all chat, and that&#039;s where I want other peoples opinions. Should saying 3 letters to someone be an auto 14 day suspension of perma ban?\r\n\r\nThere is always going to be negativity thrown at you in life, especially on the internet.  There is toxicity in the majority of league of legends games, that is a fact. Should there be governance to keep toxicity down so it doesn&#039;t get out of control? absolutely. But i believe the current direction creates victims instead of arming players against the inevitable. There is a responsibility to players that are being flamed, just the same as there is to players that WANT to flame. They need to mute them and continue to think forward and constructive, and should be encouraged to do so. I shouldn&#039;t type &quot;KYS&quot; in chat to someone, but I shouldn&#039;t get an auto 14 day ban for it. The player that reported me is not a victim, and I am not an offender. Because everyone who is a victim in this game is also an offender. It is the ones that flame more often that deserve an automatic ban. If players flame and ruin the game every time they play please ban them automatically. I don&#039;t ever talk negatively in chat and i said KYS one time to someone flaming me and get a 14 day ban for it. That isn&#039;t right. I don&#039;t want the person to kill himself obviously, I want him to realize I&#039;m not a punching bag and that I will defend myself. People are not going to end their lives because someone says &quot;KYS&quot; to them over a video game in response to banter. Honestly if it is going to be an autoban then it needs to be more clear and there needs to be a warning instead of 14 day suspension as the first offense.  \r\n\r\nThe point in all of this is that I believe there needs to be more attention raised about how players should react to toxicity and flame. It is inevitable that it will happen and instead of it being encouraged to be a victim (which breeds arguing and more toxicity), it should be encouraged to NOT react to it and mute the player instead. It is not a personal attack on people when you tell them they suck at a video game. The person just doesn&#039;t know how to win so the only action they know how to take is flaming their team mate. It is never a personal issue and therefore shouldn&#039;t be taken personally.  What are other peoples thoughts? Should saying KYS ban you from playing for 14 days and potentially perma ban you? Also please unban me so I can get my gold border ^.^\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nOvercastx: YOU stop feeding your lane\r\nOvercastx: game is unwinnable because YOU are feeding\r\nOvercastx: WAY TO GO\r\nOvercastx: rude toxic team\r\nOvercastx: zed no mom\r\nOvercastx: i think u mom gai\r\nOvercastx: ZED IS DOG\r\nOvercastx: ping me mao ne ze chu\r\nOvercastx: PING PING MAO ZE CHU\r\nOvercastx: why do you feed trist zed\r\nOvercastx: who\r\nOvercastx: U R NOOB\r\nOvercastx: D:\r\nOvercastx: WHAT U SAY TO ME\r\nOvercastx: BICC BOIIIII\r\nOvercastx: YOU MOM\r\nOvercastx: HAVE A BUTTHOLE\r\nOvercastx: MUTE ME LIKE YOU MOM\r\nOvercastx: U R FEEDING\r\nOvercastx: NOOB\r\nOvercastx: i can carry\r\nOvercastx: report my team for bully\r\nOvercastx: ty\r\nOvercastx: WHRE ARE YOU GUYS\r\nOvercastx: i try to carry gg\r\nPost-Game\r\nOvercastx: pls report brand for verbal abuse\r\nOvercastx: he really hurt my feelings\r\nOvercastx: ty\r\nOvercastx: you are a terrible person\r\nOvercastx: why do you say i int\r\nOvercastx: there you go again\r\nOvercastx: swearing at me\r\nOvercastx: i try to carry\r\nOvercastx: but noone follows up\r\nOvercastx: if you are good then you climb out of this elo easy\r\nOvercastx: so why be rude to me\r\nOvercastx: why flame me\r\nOvercastx: and say report me?\r\nOvercastx: i have bad game\r\nOvercastx: and almost carry\r\nOvercastx: you are a mean person\r\nOvercastx: i just hit level 30\r\nOvercastx: isnt this a &quot;fresh off the boat&quot; rank?\r\nOvercastx: i try to play game but everyone is so rude all the time\r\nOvercastx: i don&#039;t get it\r\nOvercastx: i just try to carry\r\nOvercastx: noone try in normals\r\nOvercastx: oh\r\nOvercastx: gank too much?\r\nOvercastx: ohhhhh\r\nOvercastx: ok i try that\r\nOvercastx: ok u 2\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nOvercastx: NASUS\r\nOvercastx: WOT R U DOING\r\nOvercastx: what did you call me you shit head?\r\nOvercastx: noob trundle\r\nOvercastx: what about master yi\r\nOvercastx: what about\r\nOvercastx: master yi\r\nOvercastx: where are my testicles summer\r\nOvercastx: wow i am fast as heck\r\nOvercastx: voli why you build so troll\r\nOvercastx: noob player\r\nOvercastx: anivia wall us in every fight\r\nOvercastx: i think he wants to lose\r\nOvercastx: STAY BACK IDIOT\r\nOvercastx: you did great cait but anivia is too heavy\r\nOvercastx: lets go next\r\nOvercastx: ur not my real dad\r\nPost-Game\r\nOvercastx: gj caitlyn\r\nOvercastx: better jg win","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-11-08T21:52:13.613+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"You go on about \"victim mentality\" criticizing a person's choice to report someone for poor behavior, but then you have this in your post game;\n\n>Overcastx: pls report brand for verbal abuse\nOvercastx: he really hurt my feelings\n\nAfter all-caps insulting in-game.\n\nI consider this ban deserved, but this bit of hypocrisy from this post was just icing on the cake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-11-08T21:48:49.492+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"“I firmly believe that staying forward thinking and focusing on your own play is how you win”\n\nI can’t reconcile this sentiment with these chat logs.","replies":[{"poster":"Overcastx","date":"2018-11-08T22:11:59.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"It seems most of you are missing the point of the post.
