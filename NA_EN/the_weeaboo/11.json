Then even if you send a couple to deal with him youre now at a numbers disadvantage. Try to deal with him alone and you will lose because he&#039;ll just dive you, and its pretty hard to win a fight where your enemy doesnt die and has free flashes. If you have him on your team he&#039;s always going to push meaning it&#039;s going to be a 4v5 the whole game which isn&#039;t fun if you&#039;re behind.

It's about how the game currently IS oriented.  Currently, league is very focused on securing objectives.  That means towers and especially dragons/baron.  This is why teamfight oriented tops like Maokai, Nautilus, and Poppy were so strong before they got nerfed.  \n\nHaving a Tryndamere top or a farm jungler like Yi / Shyvana is a big gamble because those champions exert no pressure elsewhere on the map unless they get fed.  So it's a gamble.  There are other champions (Vi, Hecarim, Lee Sin, etc.) or Fiora top who exert pressure even if they aren't fed because they bring utility in addition to damage.  Those are must safer gambles than picking a pure carry top or jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrNuclearPumpkin","date":"2017-04-01T16:04:13.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I 100% agree with this.
