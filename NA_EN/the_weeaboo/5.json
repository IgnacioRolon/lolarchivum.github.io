It goes like this:\r\n\r\n1. **Some Challenger player decides to keep up the climb with some off meta shit like Ziggs botlane or Singed with 4 Dark Seals**\r\n2. The new tactic diffuses into Diamond\r\n3. **Some Youtuber (Usually Redmercy) will make a video &quot;NEW ZIGGS BOTLANE OP?!?&quot; &quot;4 DARK SEALS ON SINGED IN CHALLENGER?!?&quot;**\r\n4. The new tactic suddenly becomes &quot;meta&quot;\r\n5.** This tactic diffuses into lower ELO all the way down to Bronze because Bronzies, attempting to climb, keep turning to Youtube. They will fail because they lack game knowledge and can&#039;t pull it off**\r\n6. Bronzies will now suffer further by all the &quot;Meta Huggers&quot; playing it incorrectly. A Meta Hugger is one who changes their champ pool to the champs that are considered OP at the time\r\n7. **There is now a massive rift where the new tactic is insanely weak and will fail in lower ELO and much too strong in higher ELO. **\r\n8. Rito sees the numbers and upon further inspection, Cthulhu swoops down from the heavens and replaces them with bonobos.\r\n9. **Rito says on boards they won&#039;t change it but it will somehow fall out of favor, and will be replaced with a new meta replacing the older one. **","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2017-01-04T21:15:01.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say it's closer to \"The Youtuber Effect\" since it's not like Redmercy is alone or seemingly more impactful than the other big hitters. Anklespankin, Phylol, Nightblue3, Brofresco, Magikarpusedfly, etc. can all have a huge influence on the meta. \n\nFor example, all of those guys made various videos detailing what \"hidden OP\" champs there were for URF. And then URF was absolutely flooded with those same champs.\n\nI'm not blaming those guys, but I am saying that a startlingly large amount of players get their information on the current meta of the game from them first. Whether that's a good or bad thing is a whole different argument entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"undesirable team","date":"2017-01-04T21:59:21.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"phylol told me to do it so it works\n\n{{champion:119}} \n{{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3094}}","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-01-04T22:15:09.887+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Gbay said Camille wasnt OP so she must be perfectly fine!
