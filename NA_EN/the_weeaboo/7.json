You know what Malz's kill pattern was? Q-W-E-R, and if you put that all on a person, they're going to get hit unless they have god-like reflexes, but even if they flash, R follows no matter the distance.\n\nAnd you talk about individual abilities functions and how to avoid them. That is true, but you are isolating them from how they are actually used in game. Malz never had to fear the jungler, because he could rather safely E a minion, clear wave, and then return to his turret waiting for the next wave, hence why he is rather low when it comes to being interactive. Malz was *The* Safest wave clearing mage once he backed. A Malz who used Q to poke is a moron, he doesn't need to poke, he just needs to get to Level 6. \n\nYou can't get close to your own minion wave while E is hoping around (it doesn't prioritize minions over champs), and if you're anyone who doesn't have the range of Lux, Xerath, Ziggs, than you're going to get completely fucked when trying to engage upon him unless the Malzahar is stupid. \"But what if i catch him with the CC for my one shot combo??\", well congrats, you're beating Malzahar the same way he'd beat you. \n\nAnd I don't know where you're getting Squishy from. Early game, maybe, but late game old Malz could get some pretty nice health from ROA, Rylais and Liandries, with a Zhonya's for Armor.

You either smash the thing to bits with a Wrecking ball from afar, or you get nowhere against him, for he is a wall. Teamfights aren't as simple as you think, as Malz isn't going to stupidly ult the first person he sees, rather using it as a safety measure if someone get's close to him/carry.

Her bases are too high and her scalings are too low. If I could make one change to Zyra I'd change her plants damage/level to 3 from 5 and the AP ratio from 0.15 to 0.27 (0.25 needed too much AP, 0.3 too little). This would reduce the base damage on her plants at 18 from 114 to 78, She'd need 16.67 AP/level to get her damage to the same level, at level 18 that's 300 ability power for the same damage. Support Zyra might reach this very late into the game, but for most of the game she'd take a damage loss.
