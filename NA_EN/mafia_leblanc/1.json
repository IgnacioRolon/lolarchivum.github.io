I mean what is the most borderline over the top thing you&#039;ve done in a game to win?\n\nFor example, in season 1, I played Eve exclusively.  I had her hovered in a lobby before a ranked, and somebody was spamming a ventrilo link.  Since Eve was notoriously unpopular at the time, I got queue dodged a lot, so I copied the link, and sure enough somebody said &#039;wtf eve gg&#039; and dodged.  The queue then immediately repopped, and on a whim, I used the guy&#039;s ventrilo link and listened to their champ picks, and sure enough, our enemy team was the same team as the one on Ventrilo.  Only 4 of their teammates connected, so they just assumed I was the fifth teammate, who happened to turn out to be their worst player.\n\nSo I then inform my team in chat of what happened and told them to listen to everything I say and we would automatically win.  Naturally they didn&#039;t believe me at first, but I was duo at the time and we proved it pretty quickly.  Their adc, the player who didn&#039;t connect to ventrilo, started feeding horrendously as I camped her.  The other guys in vent started being like &quot;Dude come on pls play safe&quot;, and I would just respond &quot;yeah sorry my bad&quot;.  They were mechanically really good, and it was definitely a change in the usual types of teams I faced.  I have no doubt we would have lost without our advantage.\n\nSo they started coordinating ganks through vent, and I would show up every time on my eve, and my team would always be around to follow up and counter gank.  They were all getting so pissed off in vent &quot;HOW ARE THEY ALWAYS THERE WHAT THE FK&quot;, until they finally lost after trying to sneak a baron.\n\nAfter we ended up in the end game lobby, they all talked shit to me in vent thinking I was the feeding ADC and blaming the loss on me, and I told them in vent what happened, and that I was the Eve on the enemy team, and the one guy who was hosting the channel just went silent.  After about 30 seconds he finally said &quot;You son of a fu--&quot; then I just disconnected.  I had never felt such a surge of guilt yet hilarity at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-31T00:37:25.869+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mained AP Teemo to Diamond","replies":[{"poster":"oOBestEveNAOo","date":"2018-07-31T01:55:16.543+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pgNEuwWH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-31T00:37:25.869+0000)\n>\n> Mained AP Teemo to Diamond\n\nThere is a special layer of hell reserved just for you now.
