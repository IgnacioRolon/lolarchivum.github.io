It's still there, I just clicked where it should be and it worked, but it seems to be invisible. Anybody else have this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-08T21:25:16.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that is rather weird. It might be happening because of the new animations in the background, so let's try turning on low spec mode in the client options to see if that helps. Hit me back and let me know if that works or not!","replies":[{"poster":"Moooose3","date":"2017-06-08T21:39:31.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was fixed after I restarted the client. Think it was just something buggy in the background not sure. All working now though.","replies":[]}]}]}
