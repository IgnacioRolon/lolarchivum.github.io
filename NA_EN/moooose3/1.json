Most cancerous support in the game. Way too much damage and zone control for the amount of cc she has.","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2017-02-19T06:27:31.857+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The amount of CC she has? aside from Rylai, a 2600 item that as support you struggle to get, she has a snare that's incredibly slow, a slow that depends on you hitting your snare basically and a knockup that has quite the window for you react...\n\nIf you wanna complain about CC, complain about Leona","replies":[]},{"poster":"Perma CC","date":"2017-02-19T18:59:04.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra isn't really op... The issue is that people don't respect her zone control in bot lane. Where as in mid lane she struggles because people respect it and she can get flanked hard and one shotted. She doesn't need any more nerfs or they will indirectly gut her mid lane even more. And for us Zyra MID lane mains we would not like to see that since the majority of the Zyra main playerbase prefer her mid over support. Support is where she was strong and she's been nerfed enough for how squishy she is as a champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Moooose3","date":"2017-02-20T03:09:18.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's a support now. Nobody plays her mid. That's like saying don't nerf support sona because mid sona might be hurt. Nobody plays her mid, don't worry about her mid lane power. There's like 2 zyra mid players in the world, she's a bad champ there because she has low health, low waveclear, and high mana costs, and is immobile. Idk what \"Zyra playerbase\" you're talking about here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2017-02-19T08:33:39.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She was literally just nerfed this patch.
