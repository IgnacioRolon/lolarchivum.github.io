Today, when I was in the middle of a rank game, I suddenly received message that my League of Legends client will close and that my account __ was permanently suspended for the use of malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to your League of Legends client. I have never received a warning, suspension, or even a chat restriction before. I certainly have never used any illegal programs/hacks before and am willing to do anything prove it.\n\nThe only software that I use are:\n1) Curse Voice (for communicating with friends for rank games) and I do not believe that would have caused the ban.\n2) Lolreplay through website na.op.gg for watching friend&#039;s games when I am too lazy to log into the client myself.\n3) VPN which I&#039;m not sure if allowed or not, but my work laptop uses a VPN to log in. Occasionally I will use my work laptop if I am too lazy to play on my personal computer. If this is the issue, please let me know what I can do to fix it.\n4) Razor Synapse (for my mouse) and Razor Game Booster (to disable antivirus and other CPU related programs that may slow down my computer whilst gaming)\n\nRiot, if you see this, can you please tell me exactly I am being accused of? I believe this ban was done in mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2016-02-24T20:43:55.188+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Bui, \n\nI've spent some time investigating your claims, and I believe I've identified a primary source of confusion:\n\nBack towards the end of last season, you allowed another player to utilize your account for exactly 9 ranked games and one promotional series (sometimes referred to as boosting).

Is it very unfortunate to hear that scripting was involved. As you mentioned above, this incident while on my account, was not directly my fault. I understand that being the owner, I am to be held accountable for my actions, but I beg of your to consider a different alternative. I know that the punishment for \"Boosting\" is the removal of skins + a warning; with the second time being a permanent ban. Would it be possible to reduce the sentence from a permanent ban to just regular suspension AND remove all my solo que rank rewards for that past season? I am willing to accept even a full year suspension if that is what RIOT feels is justified.\n\nAll I ask is that you please allow me to do something and earn my account back. I have been a long time supporter of RIOT, if you can do this favor for me, I make sure to never repeat this mistake again and let anyone on my account.\n\nSincerely,\nBui","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-02-26T00:12:26.545+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> As you mentioned above, this incident while on my account, was not directly my fault.

Rofl. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in this thread complaining about the same ban was banned for the same reason across the board, Riot doesn't often make mistakes and just lol to the guy who goes \" Why would I be idiot, I spent 700 euros on this acc \" \n\nWent over to the BOL forums today and seen a thread similar... \" What was I caught for while scripting? I'm not even silver i'm that bad, I spent alot of euros 500+ \" \n\nIt's ironic how many people on that BOL forums are complaining about the ban and blaming the script for being too obvious, nah it's just you're bad and even with scripts you can't climb and still get caught.

I like how people use programs that they don't even understand first of all, and then get banned for it. Beautiful.\n\nAlso, good way to compromise your security in general.
