I called rogers and they said it might be routing problems. However seems to always be some issue so if possible can i get some help.... I have no idea why im paying so much for net but can't play a simple game without experiencing very high ping fluctuation. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Deathsumm0ner","date":"2017-09-30T00:41:48.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here, with rogers used to have consist <30 ping but now have 50+ and sometimes 100+ for a couple weeks now. lots of jitter too\n\nTracing route to 104.160.131.1 over a maximum of 30 hops\n\n  1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  EA6900-7703 [192.168.1.1]\n  2    16 ms    13 ms    23 ms  99.241.96.1\n  3    15 ms    11 ms    31 ms  67.231.222.193\n  4    24 ms    16 ms    13 ms  24.156.146.33\n  5    14 ms    30 ms    33 ms  209.148.230.169\n  6    21 ms    15 ms    15 ms  69.63.248.6\n  7    14 ms    18 ms    24 ms  209.148.230.206\n  8    67 ms    54 ms    64 ms  209.148.230.134\n  9    40 ms    37 ms    38 ms  104.160.131.1\n\nTrace complete.\n\n50-60 ping is fine but i play with 10-20 ping difference everyday and occasional 100 ping spike so its quite noticeable and annoying","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T20:47:42.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the way our players speak, it doesn't sound too uncommon for Roger's to have these kinds of issue. If you want you could run a traceroute to our servers at 104.160.131.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/), and that data could help Rogers figure out what's going wrong with their routing.","replies":[]}]}
