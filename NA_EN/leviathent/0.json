If anything he'll be more of a drain tank. He currently gains self-heal with bonus health, so if you want to drain tank you no longer build AP on him. He has a passive that stacks up on himself when he attacks stuff and his self-heal also increases with those stacks, so he needs to be in combat for a while before his drain tanking really comes online.

Here's the exact passive (and remember this can change still; especially the numbers)\n\nDeals 2% of target maximum health as magic damage with each basic attack while healing for 5 (+XX) (half vs minions). \n\nEach attack builds one stack of Eternal Thirst, which increases the healing from this effect by 11%. \n\nMaximum stacks: 10\nDamage capped against monsters to: YY\n\nXX currently scales with level from 0.9% bonus health to 1.4% bonus health. Those numbers do look very low, but remember you have tools to multiproc the passive, you have the Eternal Thirst stacks that improve healing, and finally the Q itself has a multiplicative heal amp on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Firefang Warwick","date":"2014-04-08T15:35:05.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean he doesn't lose stacks when he switches targets (or it dies)?

One of the really cool things about laning with and against Warwick right now is trying to manage the stacks, for the enemy to make sure that they aren't letting Warwick get too many hits in a row off on them, and for Warwick to try to avoid switching targets. This is a constant struggle in the lane, and even if it doesn't really mean much in the long run, it is very satisfying to both sides.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the stacks have absolutely no effect on how Warwick damages the enemy is really unsatisfying. Passive healing effects are about the least interactive things that could ever exist. You might as well have it say \"sometimes, while in battle, faeries fly down from the sky and heal you for an unknown amount of health\", and Warwick would have exactly the same gameplay priorities.","replies":[{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-04-08T10:36:51.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, what it means is that he hasn't been balanced yet so numbers are here, there, everywhere which isn't the point, the point right now is to make sure he has a good gameplay pattern and then balance later in the development cycle closer to release. Stoic's been very nice to share this passive so early on in development so it would also be nice if you didn't bite his head off for it.\n\nAlso just so you know Stoic has said in another thread that basically if you stop fighting as WW your stacks will all be gone within 4 seconds so needing to manage and keep up your stacks is still very much there.","replies":[{"poster":"Tachi","date":"2014-04-08T17:50:11.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Four seconds per stack, falling off one-by-one I believe.

I'm all for Warwick being viable, but that is a humongous amount of power isn't it? I get he is supposed to be a bit of a counter against tanks, but this gives him a lot of power over anyone in general.
