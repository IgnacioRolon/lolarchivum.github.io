At best, the most I could muster up is &quot;really, really, really good synergy with Triforce&quot;\r\n\r\nLooking at the other two top-lane, melee-carry, bruiser-slayers; {{champion:24}} and {{champion:114}}, it&#039;s quite easy to say who they are and what they do. Jax is (stop me if you&#039;ve heard this before) a dark and mysterious individual with similarly unknown origins, but is known within Runeterra as the guy who can and will beat your ass with anything from a spiked mace to a fishing pole. His gameplay revolves around on-hit, mixed, sustained damage and hyperscaling into a raid boss that will either clean up and ace you ruthlessly, or backdoor all your inhibs and end the game. Fiora stands for honour, discipline, ~~and pretty pictures~~ and draws (at least part of her appeal) from being a no-nonsense matriarch of a noble household with immense pride, and who can best any man in a duel with little effort. Her gameplay revolves around manipulation of vital proccing, outplaying your opponent with good use of Riposte, and being a threat to absolutely everyone with her %health true damage.\r\n\r\nAnd they both have downtime. Fiora and Jax are both (relatively) vulnerable when their Riposte and Counterstrike respectively are down. Due to the nature of their kits being heavily based on auto-attacking, they&#039;re also weaker in 2v1&#039;s against them.\r\n\r\nIrelia is...really, really, really good at abusing Triforce. She also has innate sustain so it&#039;s harder than usual to push her out of lane. If you manage to keep her health low and harass her, you&#039;re giving her free access to her ~~completely fair and reasonable~~ stun which she _will_ use to win the trade or all-in. If she&#039;s caught low, she can just slurp up a tonne of health back by ulting the wave, whereas Jax and Fiora are either forced back or have to play a risky game in order to get their health back.\r\n\r\nI imagine a more dedicated Irelia player could come up with something better, and more flattering.\r\n\r\nBut my point is, Irelia is an incredibly generic AA-based Fighter-type with an overloaded kit that boasts unfair designs. You could call Fiora overloaded too, but her mechanical ceiling extends beyond **aggressively clicking on the enemy and pressing buttons**. I have yet to play a lane where Irelia gets her Triforce and I am still able to even match her, let alone beat her - something that doesnt happen with any other Champion in the game. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to say that she should be Old-Poppy&#039;d and put into such a trashheap state that playing her is a detriment to her team until full build, but I won&#039;t, because no Champion deserves that.\r\n\r\nI will say that I think she really needs changes, or at least needs to be looked at and should absolutely be one of the &quot;big 6 or 4&quot; that Riot tackles in the eventual Diver Update.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuiper Cliff","date":"2016-10-03T20:29:51.150+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her identity is as a comeback champion, even in her lore she only rose to her power after nearly suffering defeat. With her stun mechanic, reliable healing abilities, and incredible burst potential with sheen she is very capable of winning fights where the enemy champion is at an advantage. \n\nThat being said, she is closer to the feast/famine aspect of the game than some other champions so if she starts to snowball she snowballs hard and you lose that impression of her.

Her lore and stun reflect that very well.  She's also known as the destroyer of ranged laners which has been her \"theme\" since her release.  What I find very iconic about her is her Q and E because of the unique mechanics on both of them.  \n\nThe conditional stun on her E makes it so both her and her enemy need to make decisions for the most optimal outcome.  If Irelia wants to stun her opponent she needs to keep herself at lower health and risk being CCed and bursted down or she can use the slow instead to help chase down or run away from her opponent.  Likewise her enemies can risk all inning her and being stunned or timing their burst just right and giving her the slow instead of the crucial stun.  The reset mechanic on her Q is probably the most fun thing about her because it gives her the ability to lane against ranged champions as well as dash to minions to catch enemies out.\n\nI feel that what separates her from Jax and Fiora is that while they always want to have the upperhand in a fight she is the mobile fighter that always wants to be at a disadvantage to make the best use of her kit while manipulating her blades to get the job done.  Some people feel like the blades don't really fit into her theme with her kit, but in my opinion I think they do just fine.\n-Surfing on her blades to get from place to place\n-Activating her hidden power to give her blades energy to deal more damage and heal her\n-Using her blades to cripple her enemies\n-Flinging her blades at opponents to weaken them while gaining energy from their damage\n\nHer blades don't need to be flying all over the place to fit her theme.

This could be represented ingame through a variety of mechanics, but currently it's just ignored.\n\nIrelia just uses stuff that would fit on Warwick and be just as thematically fitting, if not more (except the ult).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-10-03T13:58:59.929+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Morello had stated in the past that she was designed before they had refined some of their \"guidelines\" to making champs.

Its hard to even say floating blade user is her theme because very very little in her kit reflects that. \n> \n> She needs a Sion level remake. Don&#x27;t even try to save her current kit. Throw it out and make a new champ out of the telekinetic blade concept because she&#x27;s wasting a cool design opportunity.\n\n\"Hmm. Melee seems to be outclassed by range in every way. What do you think we should do?\"\n\"Nerf ranged damage?\"\n\"Buff melee durability?\"\n\"Why not make a single champion who by design alone can win against ranged champions.

The discrepancy between ranged and melee champs in the laning phase has been the subject of contention for years now, and Riot has shown no initiative to tackle this problem.\n\nIt would require such a large scale reworking of so many champions that it would only be a preseason project so as to not completely screw over the pro scene. However, as we've seen so far, Riot is going to have their hands full this coming preseason with trying to make DQ work, the assassin class update, probable keystone tuning, and a few choice champion reworks (Warwick, maybe Galio). With all that on Riot's plate, I can't imagine they'd be able to fix ranged/melee interaction until at least next year's preseason.\n\nAnd let's be real, Riot probably won't be doing it then either.\n\nUntil the day comes when ranged champions get some early game damage nerfs or Doran's Shield is made into an item that melees can actually purchase with confidence to keep them safe, I'm completely fine with Irelia hard countering ranged champs in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-04T15:23:21.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly that's why I don't think they should have ever made her.

When he's strong, there's a distinct lack of an entire class in the top lane.\n\n>Granted this is a common design idea (Ivern as a support jungler for example) but it usually doesn't go well. \n\nThis is true. For as much crap as I give CertainlyT, his want of a melee champion in bot lane is something I support. However, the execution of this idea so far ({{champion:157}} {{champion:82}}) has been disastrous at best. All it demonstrates is that:\n\n1. In order to compete directly with ranged champions, a melee carry champion will require an overloaded kit just to survive the laning phase.\n2. If a champion with an overloaded kit designed for the bot lane isn't specifically forced into the bot lane, they will take their kit to mid or top and unfairly bully opponents there.\n\nUntil these two issues are taken care of, melee carries in the bot lane are going to remain a pipe dream unless the entire meta shifts.\n\n>I think it'll probably be around divers where Riot might try to fix the huge advantage ranged has against melee. \n\nWe can only hope. I wouldn't hold your breath though, Riot has been known to completely drop the ball. And then let it sit in the ground for months before maybe stooping to picking it back up. And then throwing the ball out because it was on the ground too long and buying a new ball to replace it.\n\n**To hell with efficiency!** - Riot Games Unofficial Motto\n\n>Or not because we can't push marksmen out of botlane viability.\n\nWe can! We just have to make marksmen viable in other roles outside of being babysat in bot lane (the marksman class update kinda did this with things like Quinn jungle and Corki mid), reduce the value of dragons so that control of the lower half of the map isn't as important early game, convince the pros to start running team comps that have marksmen in a non-bot lane role and the bot lane replaced with two bruisers or something, and finally have those pro teams do well enough against teams playing the current meta that people on the ladder will adopt the new formation as the meta!\n\nSimple!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2016-10-03T11:14:17.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"the only thing that makes me bothered is when irelia stuns me just because she has 1 or 2% less hp than me\n\ni don't know, maybe riot can do something for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-10-03T16:14:28.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I hope they don't.
