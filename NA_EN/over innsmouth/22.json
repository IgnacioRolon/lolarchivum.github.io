I'm not talking about the part where he builds what he shouldn't and stays even more viable than with his intended build. I'm talking about the part where no matter what Riot does to his damage, he is still getting picked because his kit provides much more utility that is useful to his team.\nIf he was like Aatrox, the moment his damage gets slightly nerfed and he doesn't have any reliable ways of dealing it, he is literally one of the worst champions in the game.\n\nRiot is trying to achieve precisely this - rework/update/make new champions that have something else to contribute to their teams besides their damage alone. Don't make super specialized champions because such champions when target nerfed fairly and appropriately, end up as one of the worst performers to date.\n**Binary champions are bad.
