I mean I don&#039;t want to sound like a broken record, but I&#039;m going to ignore that notion and power straight on through. \r\n\r\nWe get nothing on him during the Noxus/Swain Update other than a sparse, short bio that just asks more questions and answers next to nothing. Got a bunch of story-based lore that doesnt even mention him. We _finally_ get some info on blood magic as a whole and...it&#039;s through Varus&#039;s lore. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not going to use the word insulting, because I&#039;m not a whiny brat who expects something on my favourite champions every time there&#039;s a lore event, or that we&#039;re owed content by virtue of not having a skin for X amount of years. It&#039;s nice to get stuff sure, but it&#039;s not a _right_.\r\n\r\nGranted, it&#039;s also not nice to feel ignored. Even a little representation in a video like this would go a long way.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to think it&#039;s just an oversight, or that it was intentional and Vladimir players can have something to look forward to (yes, I know the skin is coming and we&#039;re all very grateful for that ~~pool party Vladimir please~~).\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s...frustrating, but thank you for your time. I hope this at least catches someone&#039;s eye. \r\n\r\n~~Honestly though the trailer is great and Irelia looks awesome, can&#039;t wait to see more details on her.~~\r\n\r\nFor reference:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fZiMNo5-uo&amp;feature=youtu.be","replies":[{"poster":"Riot EarthSlug","date":"2018-03-20T00:07:41.723+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tides of Blood,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=y8YZXvMu,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-03-19T15:26:07.871+0000)\n>\n> Where&amp;#039;s Vlad?\n> \n\nHi ToB,\n\nI love conspiracy theories, and would love to confirm yours, but sadly I cannot. \n\nWhen we make any video featuring gameplay, we make the video for a worldwide audience. This means we localize the video voice over into the appropriate language, and also have to make sure that we understand and respect each regions cultural sensitivities. \n\nVlad as an example is bloodred in the west, but in most eastern countries, his abilities are black. So when a discrepancy like this exists, we have to weigh a few things.\n\n* What does including the champion add to the video?\n* Could another champion fill the same spot?\n* Does including the champion add enough value to the story that it justifies creating additional versions for each region?\n\nWe seriously considered using Vlad, but ultimately we could tell the Irelia story without him. With that being the case, we made the decision that it would be better to spend our time leveling up the video, as opposed to having to do multiple versions to include him.\n\nAll of that said, should we ever decide to tell a story that Vlad would help make amazing, we'd 100% include him, and do the red version for regions where he's red, and black version for the regions he's black.\n\nHope that helps explain things a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2018-03-20T00:23:13.149+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaaaah, I see, I see.\n\nIt really does, and I'm incredibly grateful you took the time to come in here and alleviate my concerns. The reasons you've given add up and are more than fair in my mind. I can understand why these choices would add up in the final decision to include or not include Vladimir, I was probably a bit too emotionally charged when I made the post to think rationally and really try to dissect the reasoning from your end.\n\nAgain, thanks for your time and reassurance, it's nice to know we're not forgotten. Looking forward to whatever Riot might have planned for Vlad, hopefully that might even crossover with the darkin and blood magic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuyinTheX","date":"2018-03-20T03:12:10.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Vlad as an example is bloodred in the west, but in most eastern countries, his abilities are black.\n\nWait what?
