From memory that was originally added to limit his burst, if so we can probably find better ways of doing that while making other adjustments. Hadn't realized the Q return would fizzle if Vlad pooled immediately after casting it, if that's happening we'll likely fix that too. I'll check in with the folks working on Vlad, see where their current thinking's up to.\n\nShould note though that correcting those issues assumes both of those skills, or variants of them, are still on the kit in the update of course. We haven't figured out exact changes for Vlad, so can't say for certain just yet.","replies":[{"poster":"TNHA Baritone","date":"2016-02-13T17:23:11.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a serious insult-free question: Can you please address Karma in a separate post?

We know already that Repertoir is working on Cassio and/or Malzahar but who is working on Vladimir?

The ult change was for thematic reasons, since we felt that the 12% AoE damage amp is a little dull and doesnt scale as well as we would like in the lategame.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/9Us3EPJJ-vladimir-the-crimson-reaper-and-his-upcoming-rework\n\nAgain, thanks so much Meddler!

You finally made me want to play other games and give way less of shit about this one. If you are going to totally re-work/ruin a champ just make a new one. New vlad sucks my asshole. Sorry it didn't offer all the tournament play options you only care about now, but some people enjoyed playing a basic champ with a simple play style. I know you give little to no shits about what common players think but just wanted to let you all know that you finally pushed me to stop playing and watching anything to do with this game. Favorite champ turned into shit. I guess Blizzard thanks you because I'm off to sink all my time into Overwatch and never think about this game again.

The above adjustments would be nice, or even just always giving him a lower q cooldown would help, they could even nerf the early level damage to compensate for it being up more often.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2016-02-13T04:05:41.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"He's one of the worst designed champions in league at present, riot admitted regret that he was released as he was, he needs rework for the sake of game health no ifs and/or buts.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-02-13T07:11:15.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quinn of Yuri,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ei188IF6,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-13T04:05:41.132+0000)\n>\n> He's one of the worst designed champions in league at present, riot admitted regret that he was released as he was, he needs rework for the sake of game health no ifs and/or buts.\n\nWHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?\n\nI TOLD XYPHEROUS.
