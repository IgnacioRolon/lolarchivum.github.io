Since he's been slightly elevated into the spotlight thanks to his name coming up in the Mid-Year Mage Rework post, I felt it necessary to highlight this.\n\nOn a personal level, it reeeaaaally bothers me that people keep saying over and over that Vladimir is a vampire, or defined as being a vampire, or whatever variation on that phrasing exists.\n\nHe's a blood mage with vampire aesthetics sure, but no where is it ever stated that Vladimir's a vampire. There's no mention to an aversion to sunlight, there's nothing suggesting he drinks blood, and there's nothing implying that he's undead in any way.\n\nHe just really, really likes blood. That's it.\n\nEdit: Yes, he has a tremendous amount of vampire-related thematics and skins, and there's no reason he _shouldnt_ be a vampire, just so happens that he isnt for whatever reason. I'm not opposed to him being one, it's just that he's not, and I'm the type of person who likes the distinction to be clear.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-01-23T05:20:17.549+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":1,"body":"People are saying he's a vampire? \n\nHe's not.

The mage part of his identity is infinitely more valuable than the tank. But, the tank makes sense as a secondary, just not a primary. Focus on his mage-like qualities and his blood-stealing or whatever. Hell, I'd be okay if they turned him into a burst mage if it was between that and him becoming a tank (doesn't make sense thematically, but makes more sense than a mage being a tank. . .)\n\nAlso don't give him mana.

The thing that bothers me most about that though is that he's a blood mage. He should have at least one ability that drains his enemies' blood, and that's not something you aim for exactly, ya know? It's not shooting a blast of magic at someone; it's willing their blood to be ripped from their arteries and veins and taking it for yourself.\n\nThat isn't a skillshot thing, at least in my opinion.\n\nI understand what you're getting at though. And then a resource bar might be interesting, but I hope they keep elements of his current passive. It's really nice to be able to build straight AP (but mostly AP items with some defensive stats, such as Zhonya's, Abyssal, Liandry's, Rylai's, and WotA) and still get relatively tanky.

While so affected by this tether, that target takes somewhat more damage from Vlad's abilities and Vlad heals more from damaging them.
