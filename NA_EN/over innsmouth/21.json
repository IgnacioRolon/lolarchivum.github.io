Dr. Mundo&#039;s healing is gated around the CD of his ultimate, and is otherwise slow and trickling with his passive.

This \"burst\" of life steal is limited by auto attack speed (neglecting death's dance). In order to make use of this life steal, you need to build aditional AD to allow you to life steal more. \nAD{{item:1036}}  is one of the most expensive items per it's cost to actually build, at a cost of 35 gold per stat, only beat out by critical strike chance {{item:1051}} at 40 gold per stat, (which again, requires AD to make use of) and life steal {{item:1053}} which is 37.5 gold per percent of lifesteal. In order to make a very good use of this, we will say roughly half of life steal building ADs need to buy attack speed {{item:1042}} , which is the third most expensive stat per gold. \n\nHonorable mentions are flat magic pen{{item:3020}}  at 37.33 gold per stat, and % movement speed {{item:3113}} at 39.5 gold per stat. I discount these because % move speed and flat magic pen aren't super prevalent on a lot of items.\n\n\nSo now that we have spotted the expense of trying to make use of life steal, lets look at why it allows for \"burst\" that is actually sustained healing.\n\nIn order to make use of the life steal, like previously stated, we really need a combination of 4 stats, all of which are very expensive for what they give, but synergize extremely well together. We also need to be able to get into attack range of a target, and that healing is reduced by the target's armor{{item:1029}} which has a value of 20g per stat because if we do less damage, we will naturally heal for less, as life steal returns a % of the damage that you do after resistances. As we want to attack quickly, and not with slow heavy autos, the health comes in at a fairly steady rate, with the risk of being in range of many gap closers on a build that cannot really afford to build any kind of resistances itself as it needs {{item:1036}} {{item:1053}} {{item:1042}} {{item:1051}}  and we will include armor pen {{item:3134}} at a lower price of 22.5 per stat for good measure for dealing with tanks, despite flat armor pen being worse than % from last whisper, as the % from last whisper is harder to calculate efficiently for it's raw value.\n\nThere are a few who can cheese out this system, notably {{champion:11}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:23}}{{champion:81}}  as they have some way of abusing the synergy through free stats or on hit effects.\n\n\n\"But Swain has to get into melee in order to sustain, that puts him in range of gap closers and danger\" and you are absolutely correct. But swain is also able, and encouraged, to build defensive bruiser items, such as {{item:3027}} , {{item:3157}} , {{item:3001}}, {{item:3116}}, {{item:3151}},  and to a less bruiser degree and more tank degree {{item:3065}}. All of these give him naturally tankier stats which allow him to make use of the free healing in his kit, while making him harder him to kill. \n\n\"But healers have cooldowns\". Yes they do. But most healers have easy access to CDR such as {{item:3301}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3083}} , as well as ability power to strengthen what is actually burst healing, as it does not come in at a truly steady rate like life steal. It is also important to remember that healers like {{champion:16}}{{champion:37}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:40}} don't need to actually get into range of any enemy champions to be effective with their healing. Some have abilties that are more useful when being aggressive, but are also viable being used for entirely defensive purposes.\n\n\nFinally, if an adc is healing to full health with a blood thirster in 3-4 autos, they are likely full build at 40 minutes attacking someone with little to no defenses\n¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEdit: One final note I forgot, mages tend to be cooldown based and are able to play near the back line of a fight, weaving in and out based on cooldowns as their autos are usually fairly low impact on a team fight. Because of this, mages that are squishy in their builds would not need lifesteal because they should not be close enough to take damage if they do not have an adequate way to defend themselves.\n\nAlso same counter that you stated for mundo, fiddle sticks, and swain {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3033}}  counter life steal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2017-01-31T07:19:07.665+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Because a) Lifesteal comes as sustained healing, not burst healing and b) ADCs are designed around having a weakness to burst damage.  Lifesteal is an excellent mechanic  from a design standpoint to ensure that weakness to burst for sustained damage dealers.\n\nWeak to burst means that standing health pools and resistance values cannot be too high, but leaving a sustained damage dealer, who needs to stay close to the fight, with a low health pool without a chance to extend said pool leaves them too vulnerable to damage not specifically dedicated at taking them out.
