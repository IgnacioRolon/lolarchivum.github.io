He&#039;s still annoying with his poke range and safety, as well as all-in potential.\n\nBut good lord would I rather see him against me than fucking Talon.\n\nZed (in my eyes) falls into the class of Champion that I deem **Balanced, but Overloved**, which also includes such Champions as {{champion:103}} {{champion:64}} . Champions whose kits in my mind are balanced, but have just a one or two things too much that make them overbearing or have higher-than-reasonable numbers.\n\nFor all the bitching and moaning about Zed (and believe me, I&#039;ve done my fair share) he is one of the fairer assassins. You can actually dodge most of his kit without too much difficultly, it just takes good predictions and a bit of luck to do so. There are measures you can take against him when he ults you other than &quot;stick your thumb in your ass and die&quot;; such as group with your team so that he can&#039;t wail on you with impunity, or (if you have it) line up some cc since his ult is quite telegraphed by League standards and he _always_ appears behind you.\n\nI&#039;ll admit it helps being a Vladimir main and having a readily available tool to completely negate his ult while putting it on full CD whenever he uses it.\n\nBut Talon? Fuck Talon.\n\nFuck his point-click, instant blink that amps damage and slows. Fuck his Rake which although shorter than Zed&#039;s shuriken, is significantly wider and faster, _and slows_. Fuck his AA reset-bleeding Q.\nAnd fuck his &quot;dad-playing-peekaboo-with-his-baby&quot; ultimate, except here the dad&#039;s trying to shank his child with ~~a hidden blade~~ the edgiest, most twelve-year-old-iest cape I&#039;ve ever seen.\n\nSure he&#039;s not as safe as Zed, but safety doesnt matter when your enemy is watching you through a grey screen.\n\nI just...\n\nFuck Talon.\n\n**Babyrant over**\n\nEDIT: This wasnt meant to be a \"Talon is secretly more awful than Zed and everyone's been wrong all along\", it's an \"I personally hate Talon more than Zed\". Maybe it's because I lane against Zed much more often so I know how he functions and the speed at which Talon's stuff goes off is faster than I'm used to because I'm not mechanically great, maybe it's not.\n\nObviously Zed is stronger and better at more things, otherwise he wouldnt be borderline pick/ban.","replies":[{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-04-21T20:29:32.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:238}} :Get in, Kill carry, Get out.\n\n\n{{champion:91}} Get in, Kill carry,get collapsed upon by the enemy team,fk","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-04-21T20:33:30.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Man 1v5 is a mode in the new rotating queue?
