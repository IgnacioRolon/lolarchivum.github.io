You.**\r\n\r\nAfter playing around a couple of games, I can happily say that this is the best Vladimir has felt in a long time. I might be over exaggerating a bit, but watching my shitty little crimson blobs that we call auto attacks actually have some wiggle room with csing feels fantastic. No longer do I have to precisely time and judge the distance between me and the minion, and pray that it stays within the incredibly tiny margin of Vlad actually being able to last hit.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, the Q changes are equally welcome. Having a more consistent damage output at the cost of some power on the Crimson Rush (and it evens out once you get past rank 2-3 of Transfusion) is something I&#039;m massively grateful for. It all just feels great.\r\n\r\nChampagne and blood all around.","replies":[{"poster":"Cremepie","date":"2017-02-08T22:21:55.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey tides,\nUnrelated but I always wanted to ask what do you usually run for runes on vlad?\nI like MS quints and 10% CDR.\nThen my build usually turns into this:\n{{item:3158}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3285}} > {{item:3151}} /{{item:3135}} >{{item:3089}} \nI don't use {{item:3116}} anymore so I want to know what people do these days.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-02-08T22:38:23.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run MPen Reds, HP/level yellows, 15% scaling CDR blues, one 5% CDR scaling quint, and two MS quints.\n\nNo AR/MR means you have to play well early, really well, but the scaling is worth it.

I find that I rarely die to mages late game, it is AD carries and assassins that do me in.  With Lethality being as it is the armour on the item might as well not be there so I don't find myself appreciating that stats on it.\n\nI find that passive doesn't have the greatest synergy either because you generally aren't going to die with your ult up which means you probably wont get away anyways (And as Ahri I rarely find myself dying before my team so there isn't going to be backup in that regard) and even if your ult was up there is a decent chance it will time out during the GA anyways.\n\nThere are situations I will buy it, but in general I find that Rylais suits me better.  It helps keep my teamates alive through the soft CC, makes E easier to land, provides kite if I am jumped on after my hourglass, provides kite so I don't have to hourglass vs non assassins.\n\nIt is a decent item but I just don't like it in this meta on Ahri since you generally wont have the tools to escape on your own after it and Ahri is so safe that if you die you are generally going to be on your own because you were caught out or because the rest of your team is dead.\n\nIn regards to that I find the health on Rylais to be a better stat buy and the passive to have more synergy with Ahri's kite potential and turnaround potential than GA.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-02-10T07:16:34.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy it as it allows to to make much risker plays late game and can cover a mistake if you're with your team.

Damage is too high to make great use of it. Not only that, but the buildpath for Spirit Visage leaves you with horrible damage potential mid-game (or early if you're rushing). That, and its almost certain that you'll be getting tagged with GW throughout a fight.\n\nAlso, again because damage it too high, I'd say start running Abyssal.\n\n10% increased damage with masteries and your ult stacks up to 40% total (its all multiplicative). \n\nLearn to flank Eve style when Ghost or Flash are off CD and bomb the backline you can easily 100-0 them if you aren't far behind.\n\n___________\n\nAs far as runes, I've been using scaling CDR quints, and scaling HP yellows, filling the rest with scaling AP (helps fill the low AP period 6-11), unless I can punish or need to trade damage with someone early in lane, in which case I use magic pen reds.\n\nI haven't liked MS quints for quite a while; its rare that I find a circumstance I'd appreciate them in.

The reason I like getting Spirit Visage is just simply because of the 500 Health. When you compare stats you only get like 30 more AP for abyssal and I never notice the passive for damage, but it makes sense on paper I guess. With visage it feels much safer to survive that awful mid game. Besides with Ludens I can relatively land E rapidly and reliably with little issues. \n\nThat being said I never rush Full visage in lane. I just rush the CDR components {{item:3108}} {{item:3067}} {{item:3158}} Then build whatever makes me happy.\n\nI rarely take Ghost anymore simply because TP or Ignite is so necessary to survive lane depending on the match up. I understand the power of a midlane Vlad with ghost, but I primarily play Vlad top.  If I took Ghost every game I probably wouldn't run MS quints either. I also take Hp scaling yellows, praise it!\n\nWould share a nice penta kill with vlad I got last week but not sure how to share those files here.\n\nWhats you're opinion on Protobelt?

He takes Protobelt instead of Zhonya's, building Abyssal as the other CDR option; Mejai's is covering Protobelt's low AP in this case.\n\nAlmost no case of Protobelt+Spirit Visage has over a 45% winrate in high diamond-challenger last time I did research.\n\nOnes with full AP, or the challenger player with Protobelt+Mejai's->full AP have 50%+ generally.\n\nThat said, I don't like Protobelt all that much.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-08T22:20:45.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"5-25 additional base damage on every Q, depending on rank.\n\nLast hitting is better.\n\nAppreciated changes overall.\n___________________\n20-35 minute period still feels absolutely terrible, though, and despite being a hypercarry, his late game is not at all impressive. \n\nThere are many things that do more burst and more dps at the same time than Vlad, while having more CC and more mobility...and without relying on 'windows of power' like Vlad.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2017-02-09T04:32:58.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WoonStruck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nVwjhrJf,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-08T22:20:45.522+0000)\n>\n> 5-25 additional base damage on every Q, depending on rank.\n> \n> Last hitting is better.\n> \n> Appreciated changes overall.\n> ___________________\n> 20-35 minute period still feels absolutely terrible, though, and despite being a hypercarry, his late game is not at all impressive. \n> \n> There are many things that do more burst and more dps at the same time than Vlad, while having more CC and more mobility...and without relying on &#x27;windows of power&#x27; like Vlad.\n\nHis late game would be better if this piece of shit broken item didn't exist {{item:3033}} \n\nBack then ADs had to give up slot efficiency and buy an executioners which didnt upgrade into anything.
