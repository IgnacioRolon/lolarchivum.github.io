As he introduced a lot of new mechanics. (Semi-infinite dashes with no resource or trigger requirement, Windwall, massive crit chance, %bonus armor penetration.)\n\nLucian got buffs that made him OP(and others got nerfed). Then they changed him a little and made him even more OP. He wasn't played for a long time before he got popular. \n\nUrgot is still somewhat underpowered. You need a team built around him. It's just easier for him to function in that team now. \n\nBard has a weak early game. When you want your support strong. This makes it hard for him to gather Chimes as his lane is already in a bad spot. His main CC requires a strong setup, his heal requires time to be effective, his mobility works with everyone. His ult can easily hurt you just as much as it benefits you. If there are no walls around his mobility is useless. His CC has a ton of counterplay. \n\nNeither Lucian or Yasou had as low of a win rate as Bard has when they came out.","replies":[{"poster":"BranchofSin5580","date":"2015-03-27T23:24:07.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yes they fucking did.\n\nYasuo sat on 36% - 41% win rate for the very first 2-3 weeks he was released.\n\nLucian wasn't as bad, he hit 38% once, but that was the worst win rate he ever had.\n\nAlso, Kalista sat on some good 33% - 38% win rate before people started maxing E with a Hurricane.\n\nBard is no exception, he is going to get buffed and then people will learn how to play him and he will become broken and then get nerfed back again.\n\n---\n\nThere are very few champion who manage to get a good win rate the moment after their release.\nVi had 48% win rate on her release, which is already pretty good.\nAatrox had 52%, which is even more amazing considering new champions usually dont get a lot of win rate.\nReworked Sivir had 56% when her Ult was retarded.\nGraves sat on 58% on his very first day, I think.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2015-03-27T23:32:44.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my fear for him.
