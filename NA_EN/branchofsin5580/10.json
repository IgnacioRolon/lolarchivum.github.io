From the 4th century BC or earlier, some of the most prominent and wealthy Roman families, as identified by their gens name, were of plebeian status .Literary references to the plebs, however, usually mean the ordinary citizens of Rome as a whole, as distinguished from the elite—a sense retained by \"plebeian\" in English. In the very earliest days of Rome, plebeians were any tribe without advisers to the King.
