Thoughts?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":19,"down_votes":14,"body":">**Kaceytronâ€™s State of the Union Address**\n\n>Please stop acting like Sky is some sort of fucking revolutionary. All he did was circlejerk a bunch of brainless individuals with a poor perception of reality who are now flooding my twitter feed. Despite how many holes, double standards,  and fallacies exist in his argument it's going to hold true to so many people because it's what they WANT to believe. People want to believe that the reason they're unable to be successful streamers on twitch is because me and Kneecoleslaw wear tank tops. It's nothing to do with them as individual streamers, but it's everything to do with the fact that me and Kneecoleslaw have tits.\n>\n >Please stop telling me about \"the girls who actually deserve viewers\".... please. Anybody who believes that they should get something because they \"deserve it\" has been extremely sheltered from how the world really works. The world doesn't owe you shit, twitch doesn't owe you it's attention because you stream in a fucking sweatshirt.\n>\n>The truth is anybody with a reasonable amount of followers can get on a fucking soapbox and throw female streamers under a fucking bus and be APPLAUDED for it because that's the society we live in.\n>\n>If you want to be a successful streamer, or successful in ANYTHING you are going to succeed in despite of whatever obstacles are in the way, even if it's Kneecoleslaw's Double D's. Whenever you continue to blame your failures on other people, guess what? You're going to continue to fail.\nAnd now allow me to use Sky William's logic:\nSky is one of the most popular gay streamers, on stream I heard him talking about how he loves guzzling cocks and that he sucks dick really good. I went into another gay streamers stream and I held him to the same standard because of Sky. So Sky, you are condemning your sexual orientation to be subjected to the same torment you get... just like any of the female streamers you so easily threw out. Or are you an INDIVIDUAL? To me, what you are saying is that women in streaming aren't allowed to have an individual voice... and being hypocritical as fuck.\n>\n>Please make another video calling out the \"thirsty horny dudes who are giving these women a platform to stream on\".... since that makes just as much sense as your previous argument and is using the \"STOP LIKING WHAT I DON'T LIKE\" mentality. There's nobody to blame because there isn't a fucking issue.\n\nby Kaceytron.\n\n[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KaEXFYaX4CXYwRAQ46l57cgBkJudeYoR_z-n154Oucg/pub)\n\n\n","replies":[]}
