I don't believe that'll do much. I mean, I can understand your tankiness can help prevent the health costs from doing much, but early on, if you have no vamp in at least the form of a Revolver, I don't see you surviving the laning phase. Morde is simply too easy to kill prior to his spell vamp due to his health costs and his lack of mobility, which still hasn't been fixed. The W change was nice, but that's not going to help prevent you from being ganked while you're tossing out abilities and destroying your own health bar while they help destroy it.","replies":[{"poster":"LifeCyclesTWA","date":"2015-05-09T09:42:00.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Early game you allocate 1200 of your gold towards buying a Hextech Revolver and about 185 gold towards potions, or 435 gold for Doran's Shield + Health pot start, plus another 185 for 5 additional health pots.
