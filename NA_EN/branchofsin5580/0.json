Picking Lux against Zed because she can \"banish the shadows\" feels more like you're really pitting two champions against eachother - that Lux is here because she has a job to do against Zed using her character talents.

Here's why (again, only my personal view):\n\nBeing able to say \"hey, Lux counters Zed because light banishes shadows\" is really cool. But no matter what, we're also going to have the \"hey, Urgot counters Zed because he can suppress the all-in\" case.

Right now we might have a \"rule\" that Zed beats poke mages. But with the added complexity, we have that Zed beats poke mages, unless they use light magic. Then you add in skins (does Arclight Vel'Koz counter Zed too?), and suddenly it's a major can of worms.\n\nWhere I think these things can be really cool is when you have a game that relies more on strategy than mechanical play.

A good example of this would be the in-universe conflict between Warwick and Soraka which is reflected in-game via mechanics--Warwick likes going after low-health targets, Soraka can heal her allies from low health to make hunting them harder, but in doing so can open herself up to being hunted instead (since her heals are cast-from-health). \n\nSo I'd imagine the only scenario where this would actually be a thing and not either A) a forced interaction \"minigame\" like the Rengar/Kha'Zix thing, or B) a weird mechanical exception-to-the-rules resulting in a hard-counter, would be if Lux (as a light-themed mage) had abilities that revolved around revealing enemies or granting vision and so on but relied entirely on that vision for her safety (so no CC, weak to ambushes, etc.), and Zed (as a shadow-themed assassin) benefited more than other assassins from the Fog of War, had some sort of stealth mechanic, or so on. That way, there'd be some interesting and completely organic interaction between them (Lux can hamper Zed's effectiveness if she knows his general position and can reveal him, and Zed can snuff Lux out if he can bypass her vision and ambush her). \n\nOf course, I doubt Lux will change from being Utility Mage #8 (also kind-of-Morgana-but-not?) or that Zed will change from \"Healthy\" Assassin Who Can All-In With Zero Commitment just to create some interesting mechanical interaction between completely unrelated champions, at least not until some of the more problematic champions whose flaws actually hurt League as a game are addressed first.

Do you think adding interactions like this makes the game better, and if so, in what ways?\n\nI wouldn't suggest making these types of interactions mostly because it will just enforce meta and certain picks. \"Oh enemy team picked Zed, quick pick Lux she is super effective. Oh snap they have an ice team comp, pick Annie and Brand; gg\". Champions themselves have their weakness and some champs do better in certain match-ups than others. However in most cases it is a skill match-up. I don't want  the winner of a lane predetermined by what you pick. These types of interactions aren't bad but they just need to be well thought out in order to give both players options during the match up.\n\nThe one OP suggests isn't a bad idea because it does create options for both players. Zed would lose damage and possibly mobility if his shadow does get destroyed. Meanwhile the Lux player just lost a damage ability just to take away a shadow. When a spell is down it basically makes you vulnerable if it's not used effectively, so if her Q or E doesn't hit both the shadow and Zed, it might be a waste of mana and a good cc spell tbh. If her W got that ability then it would probably be ridiculously easy for Lux to win trades.","replies":[{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2015-05-10T00:54:58.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, your name and your icon...I like.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Volt Cruelerz","date":"2015-05-08T07:02:06.605+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, there's Sunglasses vs Leona...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2015-05-08T23:46:52.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this issue is pretty easy to address really.
