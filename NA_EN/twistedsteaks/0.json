I know this because off the store purchase history and the missing refund token that was used to bump up the Rp on my account to afford the skin he also purchased a icon with my rp points as well since i only had the default summoner icons except for the new project event that happened recently and the golden draven when there was the draven event . I know there is a queue for tickets but i would like to know if anything is happening since the status of my ticket has been open for the past 3 days. And if i could get a refund on  this skin and get my king of club mordekaiser skin back as well. i mentioned this in the ticket.

Response times can range depending on how many tickets are in that team's queue. I suggest continuing to be patient while someone gets back to you. Avoid \"bumping\" your ticket, as it actually puts your ticket in the back of the queue and lengthens the time it takes for someone to reach back out.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"TwistedSteaks","date":"2016-08-10T21:18:45.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love you guys thank you so much targon and the rest of riot employees for solving my problem{{item:3026}}  right there","replies":[]}]}]}
