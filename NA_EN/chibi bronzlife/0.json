Heck maybe even ionia will be damned by the void (we just don't know if it will happen/already happened in secret or for future content). I even have other theories like one continent in runetera larger than valoran was consumed by the void already which I named \"The Dark Continent\" and Cho'gath will be retconned there as the thing that ruled and conquered there (possibly being the king of that continent), continuing to conquer other continents possibly the whole runetera. I might even connect this to the Great Void War that has happend in the past(clue: read Edward Santangelo's Notes) and all people in runetera joined forces and witness the calamity of the void. Some continents survived(like chilling the frozen watchers,etc.), not harmed(ionia) and destroyed/conqured(The dark continent) but the whole runetera was disturbed by this catastrophe and it reshaped its surroundings/its balance.
