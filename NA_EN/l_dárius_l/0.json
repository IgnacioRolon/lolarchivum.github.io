I have seen people say you can spend rp on a new account after ban, but the terms of use says riot can ban any accounts you make after you have one terminated.

I was firing the \"N\" bomb left and right. I had 2 warnings and then a ban. Which is when I realized Riot doesn't screw around with offensive behavior. It took me a couple weeks to realize that I was the bad guy and that it's not okay to say words like that to other people. I made a ticket with a sincere apology. I had to do something, after all this was a $800+ account. I said to myself if I ever get my account back that I would be the one to tell other people to be kind to others, warn them of what happened to me. \n\n          I received a reply a few days later from what was far from a sympathetic response.

The terms of use says that riot can monitor chat for legal reasons (i would assume this means someone plotting murder or something on the league client) and monitoring player behavior, but i see nothing about you talking about previous bans.","replies":[{"poster":"SecondAirbane","date":"2017-04-24T04:22:12.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your ban will have nothing to do with your current account\n\nalso anything said in pm \nis UNPUNISHABLE","replies":[{"poster":"l Dárius l","date":"2017-04-24T04:23:10.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.
