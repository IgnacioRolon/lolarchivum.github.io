The game is open in the Task manager as \"LoL Pather (32 Bit)\". To begin with yesterday i closed LoL and Shutdown the PC today, i wanted to start it, and thats what happening now. After waiting like 30 mins W/O killing the LoL Pather in Task Manager BugSplatRC resource DLL not found pops up. I deinstalled all LoL content i have on this PC and wanted to DL a clean new LoL, but even the new DLed LoL client wont start up. Any Other Ideas? I am done reading LoL and other Forums now, nothing helped.\n\nPS:\nI did the steps shown here [](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq2) \"Change Your screen Freresh Rate, and Resetting \"Winsock\" \nI updated my Graphics Driver\nI Updated NetFrame\nand some other Stuff.\n\nEDIT1: Running it on Win10\nEDIT2: As i am not the only one getting Problems since the new Client came up \"live\" i opened a Support ticket with all the Logs i could get, seems like u guys should make it too, so riot can gather Files and find the Problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T17:15:03.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue you're experiencing may be caused by a change in your OS security settings that's now blocking the client from launching.
