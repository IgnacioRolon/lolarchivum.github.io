Even investing into her (rageblade/PD/Claw) she dies pretty quickly and doesn't really do much on her own, even after she shapeshifts.\n\nBut here's where you're right: In the *earliest* stages of the game, if you get ranger/demon comp (varus, elise, vayne) then when she summons her spiderlings, you're actually dealing more *player damage* in the early game. So...she could be seen as sort of a cheesy punish to people trying to econ or sandbag from the very beginning, or a \"noob killer\" who thrashes people that cant get anything going for them at the early stages of the game. But I wouldn't keep her past wolves for sure. I would say krugs, but if you have her upgraded to Lv2, you can keep her to wolves. Past then, even fully leveled, she's dead weight.","replies":[{"poster":"zepdrix","date":"2019-07-14T20:34:32.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, she's an early game character.\n\nWith her cost reduction I can see her becoming an extremely powerful early game champion due to the fact that her level 2 will sell for full value.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-07-14T22:01:09.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and I feel like that's a perfect place for her.

I have yet to lose to a Shyvana without Asol, while using an Elise. However, I also haven't tried Shyvana much because she dies quick in my opinion to, with weak damage.

That manaburn is just so devastateing for many setups.\nBut again, elise withotu demons is still shit tier, her base stats are so horrible that her lifesteal is pointless, she's just a meatshield that can easily proc the manaburn from demons.\n\nImo demons should get changed completely, manaburn should not be that broadly aviable, it just negates all cast dependent comps and feels shit to go up against, it's like glacial with more damage and a higher proc chance if you don't have AA only carries.\n","replies":[{"poster":"UnstoppableMaybe","date":"2019-07-14T03:25:34.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree that Demon can be difficult to counter, but Demon Class Comp Bonus is perfect doing Mana Burn, as it's a great counter Class Type.
