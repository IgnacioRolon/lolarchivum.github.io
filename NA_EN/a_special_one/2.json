The 10 MR/Armor reduction on the spell is just unnecessary power, and removing it would make room for other spells such as Ignite or Barrier. Exhaust has became a cookie-cutter spell in this damage-heavy meta because its really good in both offense and defense, and lowering  it&#039;s offensive capabilities would help a lot. The spell would certainly still be picked very often, probably in every game, but there would also be more spells, and wouldn't be 2+ exhausts every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-02-03T20:45:01.475+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> It is meant to be\n\nNo. Even if this was factually true, the initial design has absolutely no relevance to what is happening currently several years later. \n\nNor should the initial design be relevant now, for balance purposes.\n\n> not a spell for skirmishers and assassins to make them auto-win any \n\nI agree with you here.
