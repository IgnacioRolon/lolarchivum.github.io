It sounds like those config files keep reverting back to whatever weird settings are saved server side, so we might need to force those to reset as well. Follow these steps in a practice game, and let me know if those settings keep switching around.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Animaljdm","date":"2017-08-24T21:53:57.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey broporo  I was wondering if maybe you had anything else I could try your method does fix it but then it does come back a game or two later","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T00:03:02.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if that fix ever stops working!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GMOogway","date":"2017-08-06T23:56:06.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=WkKyH8aN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-06T20:43:33.683+0000)\n\n> - Log into the game client\n> - Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n> - Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n> - Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n> - Leave game to sync settings\n\nSo I tried these steps but it didn't solve the problem for me, though it does appear that my bug manifests differently than Animaljdm's does.
