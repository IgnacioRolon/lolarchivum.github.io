But all of them are actually in the club but when i'm on my account it shows that i'm not even in a club (But when they look at the club list it shows that I'm still the leader). Riot said they were having an issue with clubs a while back, and I'm wondering if anyone knows when they'll actually be fixed so I can manage my club and use it for its intentions?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T23:29:52.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We rolled out some fixes to clubs already, so we're dealing with any lingering issues on a case-by-case basis.
