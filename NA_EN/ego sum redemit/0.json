As soon as it comes time to load into the game, the loading screen never comes up, just a black screen, and after a short delay, an error message comes up saying \"Unable to connect to game server....\" yadda yadda yadda, then I get the game crash dialog with the orange 'Reconnect' button, which clicking it simply restarts the cycle of black screen, error message, game crash dialog. No matter how many times I try it, nor how long I wait, I can never actually get into the game, whether it be ranked, normals, ARAM, or even bot games or custom games. (Obviously after the second occurrence I quit trying to even play ranked until I can solve the problem.)\r\n\r\nBefore anyone hits me with the silly questions or the same ineffective solutions I have seen in all the other posts:\r\n-My computer is brand new, less than a month old, with completely up-to-date drivers on every front.\r\n-My internet connection is plenty strong enough and fast enough for League.\r\n-Since buying this new computer, I was able to play quite a bit for about 2 weeks with no issues, until this started about 3 days ago.\r\n\r\n-I have tried running as administrator.\r\n-I have tried all the RADS stuff, and the Logitech files, and my firewall is set up to allow League freely, and all the other solutions I have seen people suggest.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an actual working solution for this specific problem?\r\nIf not, or even if so, is Riot doing anything in any way to look into this issue, because it seems to be occurring more frequently and to more and more different players since 5.20 was released?\r\n\r\nThanks for anyone who can help!","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-21T23:43:59.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may want to get some personal help from them if you want to get the issue resolved.

This bug existed at least 2 years ago.

If you're having an issue like mine, I would definitely suggest submitting a ticket of your own, but if you don't want that, maybe just try disabling McAfee or anything else like that you have going and see if that fixes it.","replies":[]}]}
