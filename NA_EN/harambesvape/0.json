It takes about 3-4 minutes for it to load the ending stats, and by then the entire room has left the lobby and its too late to talk to others, or discuss honors, etc. Does anybody know a fix to this?? (My league runs smoothly, I can que fine, play fine, its only the after loading that is the problem) please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T23:40:01.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have \"close client during game\" turned on. If you check out the client options through the gear icon in the upper right of the client, you should see the feature there. Uncheck that and you should get into the after match lobby much faster!","replies":[{"poster":"HarambesVape","date":"2017-05-25T03:14:24.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
