I clicked the \"Upgrade Now\", confirmed it, then hit Launch. I got an error telling me to reinstall the Alpha client. So I uninstalled League, re-installed it, tried again, same error. Then I did it again. Uninstall, re-install, update, same error. I had to uninstall it again and reinstall again just to play the game at all.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening?\r\n\r\nWhen it originally came out, I was using the open beta client, but I hated the lack of a custom item build page, so I stopped using it (due to an issue a few weeks ago, I had to uninstall league and re-install it, so I no longer had the beta available).\r\n\r\nMy laptop is Windows 10, so it's not an issue of an old version of WIndows.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T05:38:34.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few workarounds for this specific error, but let's try the quickest one first. Go into your installation folder (should be C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and delete the file named **LeagueClient.exe**, making sure to empty your trash afterwards. Once you've done this, go back into your League install folder and launch League using the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (r-click, *run as administrator*). This should start the patching process, where you can try upgrading to the Beta Client again. You may want to ensure your Firewall or Antivirus program is disabled while this process finishes, in case they were blocking the initial upgrade and causing your errors.\n\nPlease let me know if this worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Zarvanis","date":"2017-02-14T12:45:21.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nIt seems to have worked.
