I has roughly 3000 BE before the update. Afterwards I was supposed to get  either the multiplier of 6.5 or 17.8. Plus the Extra 17,000 BE for Runes, etc. I should've been in the 40,000 Range but I wasn't If anyone can help me that would be very much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-14T05:41:46.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you may have been a little confused on how the refund worked. Your overall total wasn't multiplied by 6.5, only your current BE when the update happened. After that, your IP got added to your new BE total, and then your old runes would have been refunded if they qualified for full refunds depending on when they were bought. \n\nI did double check for you, and you did get the correct amount of 17,000 added already. 17,000 was the full refund you received.","replies":[{"poster":"TripleLyft","date":"2017-11-15T09:46:50.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, I see.\nThank you very much. I must've done something wrong. Another question that I would have is that there have been continuous notifications that I still haven't recieved my BE, but I have. I dunno if thats a bug or just a reminder for most people.\nThank you again!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-15T21:12:00.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm like the big window keeps popping up covering the client? Yea I don't think that should keep happening. Maybe try entering your loot a couple times to make sure the client knows you've checked it already?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
