Can you still equip the border if you aren&#039;t using a project skin?","replies":[{"poster":"SenpaiAzir","date":"2015-09-03T07:30:15.686+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, the border will only show up for the PROJECT skin that you have purchased. For example, if you bought PROJECT: Zed, you will get the red fancy border and it will only show up when you use that skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-03T17:27:22.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct. It only applies for the PROJECT skin you've purchased. Going off GameKingCaleb's example, if you use Shockblade Zed, you won't have the First Strike loading screen, even if you purchased PROJECT Zed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shmoox","date":"2015-09-03T18:53:08.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay thanks :)","replies":[]}]}]}
