After restarting the client i trying to get into queue and it wouldnt let me i checked on op.gg and i was ingame WTF my client didnt let me connect to the game and im sure the other 3 people got the same thing. Now, i can finnaly get back on queue for waiting 5 minutes because people were ingame so they decided to remake. I get back in queue and the same things happened to me AGAIN but then my team did a remake and i got leave buster for 5 games and loss lp 2 games in arow wtf RIOT i know the issue isnt my fault because the first time it happened to 3 members of my team and we were actually avaible to talk to each other at the 0 timer thing i wouldve like to take a screenshot but i didnt came to my mind so RIP.

I mentioned this to him and he told me he was in a game and was confused why this was happening. He told me he lost 30 lp and leaver penalty I can confirm this is true because I waited the 20 mins to play with him in a normal draft.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caster217","date":"2018-08-07T00:33:39.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I received a leave buster penalty of 20 minutes, counted as a lost on rank and made me lose my advancement game. please can you guys at riot fix this and at least remove the leave buster penalty from my account I just want to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"PLAT3 WIFI SMURF","date":"2018-08-07T00:36:26.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got 5x 20minutes penality for 5games lol you are not the only one i really hope they take it away from me and give me my lp backs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PLAT3 WIFI SMURF","date":"2018-08-07T00:22:54.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened to me 2 games in arow lol and they just disaible ranked games queue","replies":[{"poster":"PLAT3 WIFI SMURF","date":"2018-08-07T00:23:50.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try to upvote my post so it gets to them lol","replies":[]}]}]}
