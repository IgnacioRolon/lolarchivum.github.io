So i try talking to the &quot;players&quot; who would never reply and would do stupid things. One just int the entire game and the other 2 just jungle for a good 90% of the game and they never attack the other bots. Why are people so lazy that they cant even play a bot game. The name of these so called &quot;players&quot; are Victorhugo16, Rhyandus, and Allsquard14. You should take a look at the history and see how the so call &quot;play&quot; the game. We lost the game i wonder why tho.  If anyone riot employers see this please ban these accounts.
