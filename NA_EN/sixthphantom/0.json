If I remember correctly it will no longer be done with Adobe Air and will be coded using html5 that will give it a broader range of what it can do to interact with Riot servers as well as supposed improved functionality. In short coding a whole new game client from the ground up to replace the current one, so they have some people testing that as well to test for bugs and errors to fix before releasing it.\n\npbe and alpha client are, however, not the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"sixthphantom","date":"2016-10-17T20:13:49.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T15:32:52.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The information Wolfess provided is solid.  The Alpha client uses your live account, so anything that happens there would also be reflected if you returned to the live client.  The PBE is a seperate campaign that's used to help test out other new content and not specifically the alpha.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
