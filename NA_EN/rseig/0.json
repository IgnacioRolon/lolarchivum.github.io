I went back to play that night and it will match me with a game and let me choose a champion but once champion selection closes out, I only get a black screen but I can still see my mouse cursor. When I was playing in a party with my friend, he got into the game and it just said I wasn't connected to the game. I have tried deleting the program from my computer and reinstalling and had no luck with that. If anyone can help me that would be awesome. I have a MAC btw if that makes any difference.","replies":[{"poster":"inchesevan","date":"2016-05-12T19:34:44.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this exact same issue, and have done the exact same thing windows 7.

Once champ select ends, your connection to the client goes dormant and goes \"Sup server, rseig is ready for game now\".  When that doesn't happen, you get to look at that sick black screen.\n\nI'd go ahead and look at our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) article which goes over some of the common reason for various types of connection issues.  Lemme know if it helps :D","replies":[]}]}
