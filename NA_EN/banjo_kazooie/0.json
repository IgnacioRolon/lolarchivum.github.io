When i went to recall the voidling that appears when Malz  does his recall animation isnt detailed. It is just a solid blue voidling. Other players were able to see the voidling all blue as well so it wasnt just me. To test this i made a custom aram/summoners rift game to test it. The problem persisted in both custom games.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-12T18:22:34.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya! \n\nThanks so much for the report!
