They can be easily excused with \"bad day\" and there are no proves so they dont need to ban such players unless its borderline troll that is being famous on reddit for his constant trolling in high elo and few other exceptions of normal trolls that get punished once in ten thousand years. They can excuse trolls. Trolls see they run without a punishment so they are more likely to buy skins. It is all about the fact of the excuse.

But what im saying is you cant just drop them down and screw up us trying to climb as well they already try to keep people in low elo as it is.\n\n\nI hear that. At face value it seems simple, but its complicated.\n\nTo be clear, I do not care about chat behavior. Anything I say is ignoring that. Since we have a mute button, its completely irrelevant to address toxic chat as its a completely controllable issue. Toxic play is not.\n\nBanning is programmatic because of a few different things, like having paid for items on an account. You also want to have some sort of multi-step system, like is currently in place, to encourage recovery. But recovery operates under the assumption that a player is invested in the game. That they like it enough to keep playing and 'reform'.\n\n\nThese are good ideas, but they don't actually solve the main issue.\n\nThe main issue currently is player frustration. Obviously. Next question, what are they frustrated about?\n\nTrolls? Feeders? Smurfs... well yes- but there is a united deep root issue here.\n\n\nMatchmaking.\n\nWe're frustrated because we try so hard, we're farming better, our awareness is vastly improved. We're tracking the jungler better, warding better, controlling waves better. We know what all of the champs do, we know when to pressure and when we can't- where to be when. We're working hard and learning.\n\nThen here is my top and mid 0/6 in eight minutes, both of em. You're 2/0 as adc and wrecking this lane but you're in pretty deep shit. You know the 4 man bot is coming and your team can't do anything to stop it. Herald is about to drop top or bot, the game is fucked- and you can't do shit about it. All you can do is hope for a frustrating 40 minute game, or an early surrender that will NEVER happen with trolls. LOL RIOT, YOU FUNNY. Hopefully your teammates catch up, magically play better, the enemy team doesn't close, and you can pull something resembling a big W out of your asshole. Its not likely going to happen. \n\nI had this last game, and the game before that. In fact I've had that 6 games straight. Game quality is shit, super inconsistent. Certainly more consistantly bad than good.\n\nThink of it this way, when was the last time you had a close game. Where you knew if you didn't play your very best you'd lose the fight and the game. Both teams were equal, no one was doing anything stupid- it was even. You felt like your teammates were as good as you, and same on the enemy team. Like... once in 30 games maybe. Its NOT common. At all.\n\n\nGames simply aren't even. They aren't well matched. Game quality is poor. Damage is high right now, so its even worse than normal. The problem has been magnified.\n\n\nPlayers in many cases aren't trolling on purpose. They actually don't KNOW their play is fucking their team. Which means they don't belong in the elo. Its not good for them, or other players, to slowly fall down the ladder losing games.\n\nThe ladder needs to start reacting to actual play instead of wins/losses. I don't know exactly how to make that work, but that is how you balance the ladder and get quality games. To even do that you have to get rid of smurfing by iding accounts, and using master account setups.\n\nA lot of things need to be done in order to fix the system, but it can't be left to the wolves as it is currently.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2018-05-07T15:25:12.451+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ruining who knows how many games for their teammates while they fall to their elo.\n\nIf they are legit inting then they'll be inting in bronze too, ruining games for those players all the same.
