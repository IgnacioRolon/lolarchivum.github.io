The cooldown seems a bit long but it still looks like something ill take on Jayce. If you get ganked you can just R and run away very fast. I also wonder how this will work if you take Predator, Relentless Hunter, Nimbus Cloak, and Celerity. Seems pretty fun.\n\nEdit: Just tried it out on Jayce, its not that good. Its a decaying movement speed and you rarely even notice it","replies":[{"poster":"Mob Piru","date":"2018-05-07T20:54:38.076+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"lucian drive by confirmed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2018-05-07T22:10:26.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Who was even complaining about ultimate hat in the first place?","replies":[{"poster":"NewAtlantis","date":"2018-05-11T18:19:29.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my question, who asked for this?  \n\nmoving ult hat out of sorcery ruins it for a lot of mages.  \n\nPersonally i take ult hat and presence of mind.

In terms of the fantasy of the runes themselves, Ultimate Hat is represented by a witch's hat, and it modifies your spells, while Nimbus Cloak is represented by a cloak that makes you move faster. A witch's hat representation doesn't fit the aesthetic of Domination, which is geared towards assassins and rogues, while Nimbus Cloak doesn't fit Sorcery, which is geared towards mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Fishing Boat","date":"2018-05-09T15:01:44.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but this is still in testing, and thematics don't always mesh with gameplay quite that well.

Mages have bursty ultimates usually, and their ults are typically useful for securing a kill. You don't need to move faster as a mage after you ultimate because 9/10 times, the enemy will usually be dead.\nFor instance, Karthus ult. No point in him moving faster after he casts it. Same for Lux, Ziggs, Xerath, Lissanda, Zyra, Syndra, Malzahar, or Brand. This keystone favors bruisers and assassins, who typically have delays on their ults, or who's ultimates aren't part of their usual rotation for damage. This is a terrible rune for mages, because it's pointless for mages. It has no business being in the mage tree - it should be in Domination, as that's where it will find more use among the assassins who are already in that tree.","replies":[{"poster":"3TS Nighthawk","date":"2018-06-02T03:05:54.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin, Fiddlesticks, Morgana, Kennen, Ahri, Swain","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-04T14:33:03.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin, maybe, but he's getting it once, because it generally won't be off CD if he needs to jump again (plus, he's an assassin, not a mage). Fiddle already HAS this function in his kit. He's better off taking Manaflow Band. Kennen and Ahri are technically mages, though they tend to operate much differently, and are more in line with AP assassins than true mages. Swain is about the only one in this list who can use this, but again, he probably wants Manaflow Band to help solve his mana problems.\n\nMorgana, just no. She needs Manaflow, and Nimbus nothing but a gimmick on her. The meat and potatoes of her kit is through Q->W, with R as a bonus, because 9/10 times she's not tanky enough to be hounding people down with her ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fishing Boat","date":"2018-05-13T07:39:13.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those mages just don't take the rune. That's all there is to it. Other mages like Fiddlesticks or Swain or even Anivia or Veigar can make very good use of the movement speed. The burst can allow mages that have small cast times on their ults to make up for them in a chase scenario, or other things like that. Many mages have trouble following chasing; this is a buffer for that. I agree that this doesn't fit all mages, but that's exactly what runes are for. \n\nAlso, assassins have lots of access to move speed in things like predator and Youmuu's; some mages can use that spell orb thing but it's a big commitment, and their other movement options include exactly protobelt, which is more of a burst mage or assassin item.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2018-05-07T21:02:00.343+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:27}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2018-05-08T09:03:35.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i can imagine this being very useful to xerath and karthus\n\nxDDDDDDDDDD\n\nwho just stand still after casting their ult","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-05-08T21:37:57.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fantomumenasu,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pWFBynRP,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2018-05-08T09:03:35.959+0000)\n>\n> i can imagine this being very useful to xerath and karthus\n> \n> xDDDDDDDDDD\n> \n> who just stand still after casting their ult\n\nman you cant explain a joke.
