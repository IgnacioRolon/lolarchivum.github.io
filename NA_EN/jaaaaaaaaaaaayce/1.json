Do you wanna climb the ladder in becoming the best league player!? Do you want to be able to join an eSports team for league and compete!? Well too bad because everyone does insane damage level 1 and unless youre an ADC or Jungler, your role dont matter one bit. But remember to have fun on the rift and keep toxicity at a low even when youre getting stomped and cant do anything about it. Good luck out there summoner!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Ookej7I\nhttps://imgur.com/bHg3ep8\nhttps://imgur.com/vwmXKkO\n\nThe game is no longer about you as a player, but your team. Shorter games means damage is too high and is just reliant on who has the better team. Longer games means you can actually carry the game as a solo player due to damage being low. \"Solo\" queue isnt even revolved around skill that much anymore. Its just based off luck, did you get the team that knows not to overextend, ward and take obj? Grats you win. Did you get the team that overextends, 1v1s enemy champs when theyre 1/7, jungler afk farms while enemy jg constantly ganks, never wards? Welp gg you lose. \n\nCan we go back to the old days of league, this league is just boring and unfun. I see so many people post on the boards about that game being wack, I have never seen this many people complain about the game. Normally before season 7, people would only complain about 3 things (Duskblade, Ardent Censor, Lethality), and youd only see about 3 posts a day complaining about the game. Now its every day im seeing 20+ posts complaining about the games balance. Yet Riot still doesnt respond, Riot wont acknowledge us as a fan base wanting to enjoy their game. \n\nFix damage, fix power creep, fix catchup exp, balance the keystones (who even takes inspiration anymore besides Ezreal?), fix health regen (0 reason why I should be seeing ADC players build Dorans Shield in plat 3+). If Riot did all this, the game would be way more balanced than this mess we have now.","replies":[{"poster":"Celiorap","date":"2018-04-15T18:44:55.303+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":9,"body":"Riot needs to introduce a ff@5 for when its already 1vs6 in kills.

You can always comeback!\" mentality. \n\nI mean it is possible to comeback, I've done it before and I'm sure you guys have, but it's usually because the champion they feed scales badly into the late game.\n\nAccording to Riot giving criticism or telling them how to play better means it's being toxic which will result in a chat ban or a 14 day ban. Meanwhile in Korea you can say whatever you want and you wont even get punished.\n\nThere is a reason why NA teams try to get Korean Players but Korean teams don't have any NA players.\n\nBecause in Korea they get a lot of heavy criticism on their plays making them improve, they play more games so they can keep learning. Meanwhile in NA you're going to be spending 20 minutes or even more trapped in a game because your teammates keep thinking that it's possible for you to come back. \n\nDon't get me wrong, NA players too give criticism but reddit white knights make a forum thread complaining about them which results with them getting a ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-04-16T08:52:22.684+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot should introduce ff@champ select to be honest.

Unless you just start roaming looking for kills and stop csing you will still have a gold lead therefore you will still have item lead and still have a lead.\n\nYour reward for winning your solo lane is your cs lead while your opponent is respawning or backing to heal, getting damage to the turret or taking the turret, or as you say, catching the enemy jungler and setting him back. \n\nThis does not mean if you are heavily fed it should be a auto win for you. Actually having 1 person heavily fed is actually bad for the team. Look how many times you see someone with like 21 kills and still lose the game....because their team is weak. You see people heavily fed almost full build or already full build and start forcing fights while the rest of their team is too weak to fight.,......so what happens? Either they get focused and taken out then the rest of their team gets cleaned up or their team dies fast...the fed person gets a few kills but still eventually dies to the rest.\n\nHell I just had a game earlier where i was at 10 kills..... I just ran next to the enemy and pinged him letting the support know to auto him so they could get the kill shutdown gold.......it helped them more than it would help me at that point which helped the TEAM because they was able to finish their item faster.","replies":[{"poster":"DNFVixen","date":"2018-04-16T07:57:19.614+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2018-04-16T19:25:45.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what are we 9? or 12 BTW???  \n\nDo you really think i care about votes?

The game should always be which TEAM can out preform the other TEAM...not just which team has the better PLAYER.\n\nI agree with you...it feels like most games today people want to talk about how bad it is now compared to how it was before, like in WoW. I hate when people think they should solo carry each game and if that there teammates are doing bad that it is on purpose...not even giving the thought that they may be a newer player and may not have much experience against a certain laner. Or the thought that they may be bad at positioning and just get focused down first. Or try to do 1v1s in the hope that their team may notice they are at the least trying, but end up getting ganked, but that is okay because it is a team game and sadly it is so toxic and teams now don't even try to be good sports and offer advice. Even in normals people will flame you if you are doing bad, perhaps making that person feel worse (we are all human and susceptible to making mistakes and feeling bad), but when that person tries to back off to prevent further deaths and stops jumping in like before, they get spammed with \"?\" signals. \n\nAnd it really sucks for junglers who rely on level 6 to be able to duel well like Evelynn, like she gets stealth at 6 and because of her Allure mechanic is mostly required to flank, but then each laner pushes the enemy to their turret, and they get ganked, repeatedly, and blame poor Evelynn for not helping them out. They should really learn to help themselves out first before deciding to assign blame on someone else. And a jungler is just one person, they can't be at each lane at every single time so spamming for assistance is just going to add to pressure and lead to poor performance. And if the bottom lane has a better adc/supp combo, or say if your support is very good but the adc isn't, they do bad but WHY must people be rude about it. Advice is still a thing!\n\nPeople should really learn how to be a team in a team game like you won't do exceedingly well each match, it's so infuriating. \n\nI can already see this getting downvoted below the threshold because yknow, the people who play this game can't ever see to reason and want to shut it down without taking in a word of it.\n\nâ™¡â™¡â™¡ ~Love Alayna~ â™¡â™¡â™¡","replies":[{"poster":"ElTakoTeemo","date":"2018-04-16T14:58:36.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think all the complains are (me included)  because its not like in S4,5 or even 6or even 7 when a skill full player can have a very good impatc for their team, now doesnt matter if you crush your opponent  3/0,5/0 etc eventually he will catch up in xp and in items in past seasons you where 0/3 yep you where fckt, thats why people complain yes its a team game yes you need to cooperate to win but something its misssing and its the individual play that was rewarded this doesnt exist anymore thats why so much people complain beacuse this game drag us in because it was competitive you can show off your skills and be rewarded now you dont get that now its just a casual game is sad but its true thats the complain","replies":[{"poster":"EmpressOfBeauty","date":"2018-04-19T00:16:32.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ElTakoTeemo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5GyfKYze,comment-id=000100050000,timestamp=2018-04-16T14:58:36.124+0000)\n>\n> i think all the complains are (me included)  because its not like in S4,5 or even 6or even 7 when a skill full player can have a very good impatc for their team, now doesnt matter if you crush your opponent  3/0,5/0 etc eventually he will catch up in xp and in items in past seasons you where 0/3 yep you where fckt, thats why people complain yes its a team game yes you need to cooperate to win but something its misssing and its the individual play that was rewarded this doesnt exist anymore thats why so much people complain beacuse this game drag us in because it was competitive you can show off your skills and be rewarded now you dont get that now its just a casual game is sad but its true thats the complain\n\nOkay I see what you mean, but think about it this way...if you were to say play against someone newer, or counterpicked someone they chose and got a lead of 3/0, think of how much the other person will feel.

You literally had 3/4 concrete pages that min maxed every class. Sure, you could make gimmicky cheesy lvl 1 all in pages, but they were never meta for a reason. League was already forced roles before GC, they have been that since like s2 you mook. I agree with you that the games being decided by the adc(generally) is retarded. But to say there is less choice now is just wrong. The new 'rune' pages are the best thing that league has seen in a long time.

If one person besides maybe the support falls behind, or any person feeds 2 or more kills to a high priority champ, you lose. Outplays are hard to do anymore. Catching up is virtually impossible. Non-AP supports aren't as viable. Bruisers don't do as much, while juggernauts can 2-shot you and live with full or at least 3/4 HP. Damage on every champ is either too high or too low, with some exceptions. Healing does either too much or too little. Some items are almost mandatory, and some are almost unable to be purchased except on a select few champs (despite them being rather neat items). To top it all off, LCS is boring to me and all the friends that play league with me. I would hate to see this game die but currently that is the direction I see it heading. I hope riot will see this, or maybe some point similar, and correct their mistake. I don't see any further growth for this game currently.

However, I also don't believe one person should be able to lose the game for you either. I believe at least 3 people should have to do better than the other team to be able to win you the game.

Right Now it's kinda sad to see the state of this game is in for the past 2 seasons. As an ADC main you think I'll be enjoying myself since we are the most powerful class and busted class and I'm not. It doesn't feel like \"Oh I got this massive lead and I'm solo carrying this game to victory through good positioning, plays and made sure the other adc is useless!\" No, It feels like its on a coin flip rather or not if my jungler or their jungler comes to gank first bot and get first gold for killing the tower or if my mid or their or top or their top comes down bot and does the same thing. Now if neither comes from both sides (rare) (low elo) then it feels a bit better but then It feels like I'm dueling the support more so then the enemy adc because if the support is constantly healing or shielding or both while ccing me down so the enemy adc or me as an adc doesn't take damage then what is really the point in skill expression other than how well you play around people? Then once you are ahead you have either a so much Burst that aren't tanks die in 3 to 2 shots cause I most likely have 4 items while they are on 2 or 2 and half with the same amount of gold. It's like \"wow how is that fair? That doesn't feel like I out smarted the fed mid,top, jg player!\" It feels like I got handed free upgrades for no reason even though I got just as much gold earned as they do and those 2 to 2 and half items they have doesn't give as much useful stats as my items give. :| Like come on Riot if you want to people to watch and play like people watch and play football then fix the broken shit. You don't see a quarterback throwing TD's every time he has the ball because his back to base to get item that is so cheap to buy but gives him crap ton of good stats.
