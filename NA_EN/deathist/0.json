For example, Heimerdinger, while not having the highest winrate or strongest kit, was recently gutted with ultimate nerfs in order to stop is PvE gameplay that forces the enemy to simply follow whatever the Heimerdinger dictated. Other past examples include Pantheon and his &quot;Spam Spear&quot; gameplay that was nerfed; Gangplank with his incredibly safe early game, constant harass, and gold generation; and constant waveclear nerfs to mid laners that simply pushed and sat back like Azir, Viktor, Zoe, Galio.\r\nEvery single time I lane against an Illaoi however, it makes me want to shove a brick up my ass. No matter what champion I pick, the lane feels the exact same, which is indicative that Illaoi&#039;s gameplay is super uninteractive. Her main problem is her E, Test of Spirit. This single spell basically dictates how you lane against Illaoi, and because of it she will never get buffed or changed in other aspects, simply because her E is so strong. \r\nIn lane if you get hit by E, you&#039;re forced to walk out of the range and be a vessal for 12 seconds. Combined with its (relatively long) cooldown of 20 seconds, that&#039;s only 8 seconds of time when she can&#039;t fuck with you with E, assuming you leave the radius immediately. Most champions can&#039;t fight her while E&#039;d and simply have to resign themselves to sitting back and dodging tentacle spawns for the next few seconds. Honestly, this one spell turns every single lane I have against Illaoi into a passive clusterfuck of dodging her E, then trying to trade but it&#039;s too late since she already cleared the wave with Q, W, and tentacles, farming under tower while trying to dodge her Q and E. If you get hit by her E once you have to run far away from your tower and after 12 seconds just go back try to continue to farm under tower.\r\nI understand that Illaoi is not the strongest champion, or broken, and I know what to do with counterplay and how to fight against her mid-late game. However, all I&#039;m asking is how does Riot justify letting Illaoi simply turn the laning phase into &quot;dodging E&quot; every single time. The laning phase turns to shit, and after a few levels her trading pattern every wave is the same: try to hit E, if can&#039;t use Q to clear minions, then try to hit E again. This is nothing different than Pantheon or Gangpank spamming Q, except in their cases if you all in you might win a fight.\r\n\r\nSo again, what&#039;s your justification for why Illaoi gets to have this sort of playstyle, when it&#039;s clearly uninteractive and turns every lane into a scripted style of playing.","replies":[{"poster":"MetaVolca","date":"2018-03-14T22:22:31.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play behind your minions, wow now she can't hit you with her E.","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-03-14T22:31:56.509+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"but then she pokes you while shoving the lane.\n\nOr if you sidestep it to walk out of the minions then she E's you.\n\nOr if you try to kite it, she clears the wave and then goes after you. \n\n______\n\nthe counterplay to illaoi is there, the problem is you have to use that counter over 20 times during laning phase most likely, and if somebody tries to break that trend illaoi can potentially 2v1 at level 6. \n\nThere's nothing interactive about having to constantly dodge her, and being outtraded if you do decide to commit and fight her. \n\nNot saying she's OP because I don't play top and I still think she's managable, but laning against her is pretty annoying, especially for melees.
