(though i might make it more skill oriented add some skillshots or something)\r\n\r\nso that is my idea riot pls consider it you always say champion diversity is important pls prove it.","replies":[{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2015-02-12T15:35:34.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're suggesting Riot does to Kat what they did to Eve.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-12T17:04:13.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only that but saying Kat is not an assassin, and that she cannot assassinate is... well.. bullshit?","replies":[{"poster":"1ncite","date":"2015-02-19T05:56:02.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when she gets ahead she can 100 to 0 some champions but not as consistently or safely as other assassins i am saying intentionally nerf her damage so she CANT 100 to 0 champions but rather is better at executing champions at low health to get resets and clean up a team fight where everyone is low","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1ncite","date":"2015-02-19T05:53:39.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can u please elaborate evelyn does not clean up fights she has no resets","replies":[]}]}]}
