It appears that you have had a consistent pattern of leaving games in the past, causing your Leaver Level to be fairly high.  Given this, any leave will cause penalties to be levied on your account.  Your Leaver Level can be reduced even all the way back to zero as long as you consistently play without leaving any further games.\n\nI hope this info helps!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Vespy","date":"2016-05-17T01:27:17.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont purposly leave games. Yes it shows that ive left cuz thats what its supposed to do. The only reason why i leave game is because reasons i cant control such as random lag spikes, and wifi being shutoff. Those are the main reasons why i \"leave\". I never leave ranked becuz i always play with people i know and i want to climb. I never leave ranked but i explained to them that i got low priority becuz my wifi being updated and shut off. Ive never left a game on purpose. If im on low priority thats fine i guess but could you at least lower the time.Thanks for replying btw this is my first time actually speaking out about this","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T22:41:53.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this consistently happens due to Tech issues, we can definitely help you resolve and fix this so it doesn't happen again.  However, we can't reduce or get rid of the penalties because at the end of the day, you not being in game is ruining the experience of up to 9 other players.\n\nLet me know if there is an issue I can help directly troubleshoot with you! :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Fury","date":"2016-05-16T16:18:38.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did Leaver Buster send you to Low Priority Queue?  If so, that's from leaving a certain number of games within a given time.  If you didn't fix your Internet issues after the first few leaves, you will be in LPQ.","replies":[]}]}
