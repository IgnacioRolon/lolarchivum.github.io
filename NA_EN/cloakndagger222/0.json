Who&#039;s going to notice a small chime and a few small gold floating things around your character? \r\n\r\nSo, they keep running away...only to notice they&#039;re ulted. \r\n\r\nSo they turn around.\r\n\r\nRun into the battle.\r\n\r\nUlt drops off. They die.\r\n\r\nThis is the worst designed ult in the game imo. It requires headsets for each of your teammates to effectively let them know they&#039;re ulted.\r\n\r\nI want an alarm. I want a flash. I want something to pop the fuck up and say HEY I JUST USED MY CHARACTER&#039;S MARQUEE ABILITY ON YOU PLEASE DON&#039;T FUCKING WASTE IT.\r\n\r\nObligatory I hate you Rito.

It's not that they don't notice it per se, it's that their reaction times and decision making isn't quick enough to go back into the enemy team, and often times when they do that, the enemy team won't attack them because they'll proc the ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-06-01T03:39:45.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep, because seeing a tiny stop watch over your head that lasts for 5 seconds while you're in a bad situation and focused on surviving is going to make any impact\n\n\nif they gave Zilean a super saiyan particle effect that does the same to you and makes a pillar of light surround you, then you'd notice, but currently as zilean, you have to kite at your maximum range where your teammate can't tell if you're going to ult or not, or get close, and get instakilled","replies":[{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-06-01T04:07:34.571+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"a tiny stop watch\"\n\nDo you even know what his ultimate looks like??","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-06-01T04:45:12.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hardly, but it was barely noticeable even when I was the zilean that cast it","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-06-01T11:11:25.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth","replies":[]},{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2015-06-01T05:37:41.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW6M8D41ZWU I think I found your suggested change :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CloaknDagger222","date":"2015-06-01T04:06:50.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This ^^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Creamy Seaman","date":"2015-06-01T02:24:12.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NE!
