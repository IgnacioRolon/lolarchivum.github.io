It starts at champion select. Picking a vital role early and getting counterpicked, being so low on health that you cannot participate in a gank, laning against someone extremely safe (Kennen, Ahri, Leblanc, Fizz), not warding religiously (\"My trinket ran out so I overextended\" is as bad of logic as it sounds), shoving your opponent's lane to the tower, there are almost infinite reasons why the jungler would choose not to gank.\n\nHere's a dirty, dirty secret that high-elo guides preach: If a lane is losing hard, ignore that lane.\n\n\"BLASPHEMY! HE IS HERE TO BABYSIT ME!\"\n\nNot quite. Our job is to snowball lanes that have a realistic shot at becoming self sufficient. 0-2 in the first 8 minutes of the game, and behind 25 cs? Statistically, it's almost impossible for your jungler to help your lane. The other lanes that are even are the ones ripe with potential for snowball.\n\nIf you are losing your lane, it is your fault. No one is obligated to help you. The jungler is there as an enabler. He enables those who are capable of being enabled. If you cannot be helped because you refuse to ward (this includes buying wards when you back, not just relying on a level 1 trinket), or you're overextending/shoving lane, or you're just getting obliterated, I have to move on to someone who can be helped.\n\n2) **Hasn't gotten a Dragon before mid or late game.** (\"They have 3 Dragons and u got none worst jungler NA\")\n\nThe 2 major questions for determining if dragon can be taken are: Which team has more presence/power? (and) Is Dragon warded properly?\n\nIf your bot lane is losing and shoved up against tower, it is nearly impossible to dragon. If your jungler is taking dragon while you're shoved back, their jungler is going to ping dragon for an attempt...while your jungler is there. Now it becomes a 3-v-1. This is assuming they don't even have sight of it. \n\nAlso, all warding does is keep an eye on it. To actually take dragon safely and reliably, *it must be pink warded* (Even the red lens doesn't guarantee a full sweep, as enemies like to put wards in the far reaches of the pit). This means that you need to have enough strength to defend your pink ward when the enemy spots your team killing their trinkets at Dragon.\n\nIn short, if your team is losing, you cannot dragon most of the time. This is not your jungler's fault.\n\n3) **Farms more than he ganks** (\"They're camping my lane and ur just farming GG\")\n\nThis is highly dependent on the jungler. For the record, I play early gankers, and only early gankers, because of the snowball potential and morale boost among other broader considerations, but there are characters known as power-farmers (Shyvana, Dr. Mundo, Master Yi, as examples) whose sole strategy is to farm as efficiently as possible to emerge from the jungle a monster. These classes will typically take AOE items early (cinderhulk/Sunfire Cape), or a dead giveaway is the devourer (purple) enchantment on their jungle item, which they will rush immediately to begin stacking.\n\nRecognize their strength. Their strength is depending on your ability to stop feeding, play defensive if you're losing, and bide your time until they can hulk up and demolish team fights. \n\nTheir job is not to gank for you. Ever. But especially when they're a power-farmer.\n\n********\n\nThose are the major three examples, and the charges most commonly lobbed at junglers.\n\nTo end, here are tips for good interactions with your jungler:\n\n1) If you are not healthy enough to participate in a gank, don't.  Your goal is to have as much influence in the fight without dying as possible. This means if you're Nasus and you're at 20% health being dominated, and your jungler pings you for an incoming gank, cast your Wither on the opponent and **walk away.**  Giving your opponent a free kill because you got greedy and rushed in to try KS a successful gank only to be deleted in one hit served nobody and just gave your already-winning opponent another free kill.\n\n2) If you are losing - buy defensive items to stop the bleeding. Yes, this means you no longer are All Teh Dmgz. Swallow your pride and realize you're a huge liability to the team right now. I've jungled in so many games where the losing lane properly assesses their loss, turtles/buys defense/focuses on Csing under tower, and quickly comes back into dominance once teamfight starts because they didn't wig out and ping for ganks, scream in chat, or go on tilt and feed more. If you're that guy, stop it.\n\n3) Be ready to collapse on counter junglers. By definition enemy counter junglers are overextended, and if they get caught by your jungler, you can make it a quick 2-v-1 for an easy kill and probably his buffs. Your jungler **wants** you to have the kill to snowball, and wants you to have the enemy's buffs for the same reason. Defensive warding goes a long way to facilitate this kind of stuff.\n\n4) Upgrade your trinket. When you hit level 9 this should be on your mind. It fills the 1 minte gap of darkness when the first trinket goes down. Before level 9 you should consider purchasing at least 1 normal green ward when you back, just to fill said gap. Overextending because your trinket ward has expired and isn't off cooldown yet is not an excuse, it's lazy and selfish.","replies":[]}
