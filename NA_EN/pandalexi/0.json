A kernel error is very different from the connection failure you mentioned in the body of your post.  If this is the error you're having now, then your network might be failing to connect to our servers.  I recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get that fixed.  You can also download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to make sure your firewall settings are properly configured.\n\nThat should fix the connection error, but let me know if you're still having a kernel error.","replies":[{"poster":"pandalexi","date":"2016-11-01T00:32:12.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so I live in the dorms at my college. The University WiFi is what I thought didn't work with League because I could play on my laptop on any other WiFi network EXCEPT the University's WiFi. I've been using my phone's hotspot to play on my laptop, and that works fine, but I prefer to not use my data and hotspot. I talked to the IT people at my university and they said nothing's changed with their WiFi and so they told me to ask League Support if you guys blocked the university's public IP, which is 205.175.97.253","replies":[]}]}]}
