Can't play League on my wifi :(","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so I live in the dorms at my college. The University WiFi is what I thought didn't work with League because I could play on my laptop on any other WiFi network EXCEPT the University's WiFi. I've been using my phone's hotspot to play on my laptop, and that works fine, but I prefer to not use my data and hotspot. I talked to the IT people at my university and they said nothing's changed with their WiFi and so they told me to ask League Support if you guys blocked the university's public IP, which is 205.175.97.253","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T04:25:32.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of others players on your University's WiFi network that are experiencing this, as I've seen similar posts over the last week or so. \n\nWhile they may not be blocking this traffic intentionally, since it's local to that network, your network administrator will need to investigate further.
