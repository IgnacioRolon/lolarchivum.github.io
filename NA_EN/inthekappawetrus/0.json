I tried doing the repair thing and I&#039;m still having this bug happening. Now, this wouldn&#039;t be a problem if I played normals only, but this bug has caused me to lose a ranked game so if a rioter see&#039;s this could you please look into this. I already sent a bug report but, I kinda wanted to get more attention to this bug since I feel like I&#039;m not the only one experiencing this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"FairyUnicorn","date":"2018-03-02T01:33:23.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this bug too, i had to just accept the loss and restart my computer","replies":[{"poster":"InTheKappaWeTrus","date":"2018-03-02T01:46:49.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, I did restart my computer, hell I even shut off my computer and went on it the next day to still experience the same bug. {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2018-03-02T20:03:12.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard some programs that applies game overlays are causing issues with League.
