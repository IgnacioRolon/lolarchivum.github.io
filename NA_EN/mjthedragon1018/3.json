We do tend to look for really active players, though, and a lof of them are level 30. You don't need to resubmit your application since you can only do it once. \n\nWe outline everything about the PBE in [our FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top).
