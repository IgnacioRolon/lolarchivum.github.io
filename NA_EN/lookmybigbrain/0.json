We were doing our baron and someone on our team got executed and told our thresh to tank the baron next time. The thresh got mad and literally started walking down mid. We were winning but we couldn&#039;t win a 4 v 5 so we lost that game. After the game, I think most of my team reported him because they typed that in chat. I reported him too. Today I logged on and I still haven&#039;t gotten a message that action has been taken against that player. There is in chat proof and I have replays of him running down mid and feeding. There needs to be something for people who don&#039;t intentionally feed every game but when they do it, they do it hard enough to cost games. People are taking advantage of this system because an account needs a specific amount of reports to even get noticed by the automatic things that handles reports. They just &quot;reform&quot; for a couple of games and return to feeding. Hopefully they make something where we can report individual cases for people who do this.","replies":[{"poster":"Torpedosheep","date":"2017-05-08T19:33:34.689+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Today I logged on and I still haven't gotten a message that action has been taken against that player.\n\nIt's important to note that you don't always get Report Feedback when a player is punished. Riot intentionall tuned this down :)\n\n>There needs to be something for people who don't intentionally feed every game but when they do it, they do it hard enough to cost games. \n\nThe Feederbuster can't be tricked like that. Of course the system isn't perfect, no one claims that, but you cannot simply \"only feed in 1 out of X games\" to avoid a punishment.\n\nA single game of intentional feeding can be punished with a 14-day ban!\n\n>They just \"reform\" for a couple of games and return to feeding.\n\nAfter a 14-day ban, the reform period is _really_ long.\nWe don't have any data on this, and it depends on a player's behavior, but we can assume that it's at least somewhere are **a year**.\n\nI am basing this on the fact that I have never seen a player receive two 14-day bans.\nMost either get permabanned or reform.\n\n---\n**TL;DR:** Yes, the system works like it's intended, and while it's far from perfect, \nit can't be tricked easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-05-08T19:45:22.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> After a 14-day ban, the reform period is really long.\nWe don't have any data on this, and it depends on a player's behavior, but we can assume that it's at least somewhere are a year.\n\nThe average to drop a punishment tier is about 3 months. There's been no indication that it takes longer to decay from higher punishment tiers, but it also must be noted that you can't *wait it out*, so some people may come back 6+ months later and get permabanned for seemingly minor offenses, or they may have decayed tiers but their behavior was extreme and they got escalated multiple tiers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-08T20:03:04.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely works.
