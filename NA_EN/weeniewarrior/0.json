They just get me hyped to play this amazing game!\nAlso if you could pull up my logs and point out what bad words I might be potentially banned or punished for that would be fantasitc :D\n\n                           Thanks WeenieWarrior &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2020-01-03T16:27:49.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not bump old threads as doing so is necromancy which violates the [**Board Universal Rules**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE).

It is a dictionary-type ban bot, and it will recognize \"better jg wins\" and \"dog\" if you use the same phrases over and over. Mix it up a little and don't do it repeatedly in a single game and you'll be 100% fine.\n\nI can't encourage that you demean the enemy, but stuff like \"I'm just better!\" isn't a sign of rotten character. Restrain yourself properly and you'll show who's really mentally 12 years old (Not you.)","replies":[]}]}
