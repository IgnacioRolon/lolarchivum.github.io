My words are never directed towards a player. Or when I see someone that likes to chat while playing like me I like to make some jokes if they give the feeling they won't have a problem with it. I'm trying to be as clean as possible and started to think maybe I might be violating some of the rules with how I use wtf and etc. or with my jokes. I want to check my chat logs to see if I am really being offensive without realising it and also if a Rioter can please tell me if I have to be more careful or continue like this it would be really appreciated. Thank you for taking your time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-10-25T00:38:10.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would avoid saying anything.

Chances are they already know.  To tilt them?  They're on your team!  I just don't get it.  Toxic snowflakes can't keep their own emotions in check long enough to play out a game, even when their spewing of garbage only decreases their likelihood of winning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CominTowardsYa","date":"2019-10-25T05:22:27.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just ping, and say positive stuff. \nI will ask for help when I need it, stuff like that.
