Examples of these are Kitty Kat Katarina, or Poro Rider Sejuani. Limited skins are removed once the event is over, and there is no guarantee they'll return to the store/be made available again. These would include skins such as Rusty Blitzcrank, Championship Riven and Victorious skins (Jarvan, Janna, Elise, Morgana). \n\nYou can find the full list of both legacy and limited skins [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins).","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-19T19:13:59.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A year ago a Rioter said it might be possible for CS Riven to be re-released given the amount of time she wasn't available.\n\nIs it still being considered or shelved like everything ever?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-19T19:17:17.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!
