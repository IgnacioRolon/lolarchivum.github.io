But not at Riot though. I can tell about the cause. When they calculate the size of the windows they use the 100% size fonts as scale of the window. But they use the 125% font to print to the window. That is why so much of the text and graphical elements are coming outside of the window if you have 125% in the dpi settings.\n\nRiot games must change their algorithm in the program so they use the same algorithm to calculate size of the window and when they draw the elements.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-11-21T01:41:46.811+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to comment on this:\n\nThis is a bug we are aware of and are working on.  \n\nIn the meantime, these steps are straightforward and will resolve your issue! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Duddazz","date":"2014-11-25T07:16:03.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey can u show me how on mac i have the same problem","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Duddazz","date":"2014-11-25T07:15:27.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo can you teach me how to do that for mac","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Jacobus","date":"2014-11-21T22:18:46.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY :D it worked for me. {{summoner:10}} \nI was banned because my league wont always start after champion select still dont why :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NickAtKnight","date":"2014-11-21T20:11:32.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did that and its not working","replies":[{"poster":"deathlogic","date":"2014-11-23T05:46:26.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you log off and log back in to your windows profile? because it won't take effect until you do.","replies":[{"poster":"superfighteroe","date":"2014-11-25T18:38:16.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> did you log off and log back in to your windows profile? because it won't take effect until you do.\n\nYou have to log out and in again for the change in dpi to take effect.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"andy595","date":"2014-11-20T16:48:54.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for a short time solution, please try to fix it as soon as possible","replies":[{"poster":"MEGAMAN1","date":"2014-11-22T03:16:30.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea that would be nice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"3v3 Bailey Jay","date":"2014-11-20T04:05:38.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here how to fix this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WildCrow","date":"2014-12-01T11:29:11.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not a solution if u have to change your WHOLE OS settings to launch a game, having high resolution monitors, 100% dpi is pretty much killing my eyes, so i hope they revert whatever they did and leave that specific launcher setting where it was before the patch, it worked fine at custom dpi, if it works DON'T fix it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"superrobot1","date":"2014-11-29T13:59:29.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i could go into Appearance and Personalization but after that i don't have the Display option only Display Setting and when i do go into that i do not have the option to do the third step","replies":[{"poster":"Kovaxz","date":"2014-12-01T04:25:43.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try Appearance and Personalization > Personalization > Then on the side bar under tasks it select Adjust font size (DPI)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MEGAMAN1","date":"2014-11-22T03:16:01.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will this be fix because I cant stand it being small. thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"OppaiGuuk","date":"2014-11-20T04:11:58.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg same here\nposted my own thread about this","replies":[]},{"poster":"TigerQQ","date":"2014-11-20T03:54:31.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, doing it on mine too. is this another patch fail?","replies":[]}]}
