Like the wind, she is one gust away from terrible destruction.\"\n\nThis basically epitomizes the splash as it is now. And the warmer, fuzzier version isn't really representative of how they envisioned her. Just because she's the center of attention doesn't means she's not a menacing champion on the rift (she is). And simply because she has one soothing line in her VO doesn't reverse this fact, either.\n\nSo rather than pointing out only the things that support your argument, I'd look at the bigger picture and see where they got the inspiration for the current splash and why they'd prefer not to use the warmer version.","replies":[{"poster":"The Stoic Hero","date":"2014-11-15T13:51:42.920+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are being a bit selective with your information yourself.

She is social, gracious, and amiable, but quite powerful. Thats what makes her so iconic. At the same time, if you cross her, you will regret it, as she is no push over, but that does not mean she is cold or harsh.

That's Riot's artist's reasoning. I don't see how the final line in her lore does anything less to prove my point though? It mentions Janna's beauty and how it captivates people. If you're captivated by someone's beauty like that you're often putting them up on some sort of heavenly pedestal (that they probably don't belong on). \"As you wish\" \"with ease\" \"for tranquility\" \"by your command\" \"In harmony\" \"breathlessly\" that's *1/2 of her quotes* and they aren't menacing. Yes she does have a few 'threatening' VO lines and yes on the rift she's very scary (I'm a Janna main I don't doubt she's scary) but she's also a support. She's not an offensive support (although she can be used in that manner) she is the poster child for the defensive support, the role she plays on the Rift is focused on being a savior not on scaring others. In my post I didn't just selectively pick out a minority, I selectively rewrote over half of her lore.\n\nTo almost everybody she is seen as the type of character a warmer, fuzzier version supports. Out of the rift both other champions and fans, inside the rift her teammates, she's well favored by all of Piltover. people like Janna, she has mood swings, but people picture Janna as the support you play when you have a carry that needs to be nurtured and protected. You don't play Janna because 'lol I want to blow stuff up'.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Stoic Hero","date":"2014-11-19T19:36:37.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never did address this, but Janna use to look more blue and menacing.
