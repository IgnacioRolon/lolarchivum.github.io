The enemy team had a DarkCandy Fiddlesticks. He tried to gank me with his ult. As a Fiddle main i never saw the DC Fiddlesticks ult in game. (Only in SkinSpotlight) But when he ulted me the ult displayed was Surprise Party&#039;s? I thought it was a one time bug but it happend the entire game. His model didn&#039;t change the special running animation didn&#039;t change just the particles and sounds.\n\n{{champion:9}} : Fix this please :0\n\nEDIT 1: Im a dumb potatoe. Rito changed the old DC Fiddle ult into SP Fiddle ult      -Facepalm-{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nEDIT 2: Wait. Im confused. I need some solid proof because some people say that he still has the normal blizzard ult... Someone help?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-16T17:43:26.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FoxSpirituality - \n\nThanks for the report! We have seen issues of this occurring. Let me see what's going on here - seems like it may be a case of particle theft. You're correct in that Dark Candy Fiddlesticks should be using his own ult, not that of Surprise Party Fiddlesticks.","replies":[{"poster":"FoxSpirituality","date":"2016-05-16T18:07:11.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok Thank you for reading this :) .\nI hope this gets solved ^^","replies":[]}]}]}
