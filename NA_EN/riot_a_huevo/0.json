You can still modify your item sets by using the old client or a third party tool like Championify.\n\n1.\n\n> \n> Well, you can still customize them using third party tools like Championify—we just don't have any plans to implement the item set builder feature from the old client.\n> \n> If it turns out that there actually is real demand for that tool, we can reconsider it, of course. But on our great big list of client priorities (implement Replays, spectate, etc.), it would probably fall dead last right now.\n> \n> Just wanted to give y'all an honest heads up.\n> \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/xYiHismR?show=flat&comment=00010000\n\n2.\n\n> \n> If you used the item set maker, I feel your pain.\n> \n> But hear us out here: this is ultimately a dev priorities thing. When fewer than 1% of players use a thing, you can safely say it's a lower priority than other things. And there's a TON of features above it on our list—so many that we likely won't get around to it during Open Beta or possibly ever, if people are happy with our support of 3rd-party options.\n> \n> Again, we're listening to your feedback. We're gonna keep supporting third parties, but if that isn't enough, we'll reconsider.\n> \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/xYiHismR?show=flat&comment=0001000000000000\n\n3.\n\n> \n> For those of you who rely on 3rd party tools, like Championify or LSI, to add your item sets... these will still work!\n> \n> There is actually a difference, on a technological level, between the Custom Items that are created using the client UI elements, and the custom items that are created by 3rd party tools. The technical underpinnings for those tools will remain (they are related to the core game, not the client) when the client side stuff is phased out.\n> \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/xYiHismR?show=flat&comment=00010002\n\n4.\n\n> \n> Unfortunately that lies outside my scope. Personally I was not part of the decision making process to have to cut this feature for the reasons they outlined, no the discussions around the solution focusing on 3rd parties.\n> \n> That said, I personal rely heavily on Champion.gg myself, and have solid confidence in it's reliability given how closely my team has worked in the past with it's creator. (It also helps all his code is open and public on git hub for security review)\n> \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/xYiHismR?show=flat&comment=0001000200030000","replies":[{"poster":"Aqamdax","date":"2016-11-11T00:53:15.231+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use Item sets.

I started doing item sets because I couldn't remember what items were best for each champion, and in cases of champions like Warwick, the recommended item set was terrible, and other cases my play style for a champion didn't fit any item set I could find. \n\nAnyways unless you're using a completely new programming language, it shouldn't be too hard to implement the old item set maker in the new client, it shouldn't be any harder than runes or masteries.
