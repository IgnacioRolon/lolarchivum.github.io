If Lee misses, for example, his Sonic Wave, is just enough that there are a pair of jungle monster around to quickly regain energy (especially true when Lee players try to gank on mid lane from raptors camp). And he can basically cast abilities for free if he can sneak the pair of AA to regain energy in between of the second cast of his abilities and unleash the full combo which energy cost is really manageable if you can even sneak 1 AA after every ability\nAkali has 0 energy problems too unless you are turrible with her\nZed, well at least you got to hit twice the enemies with your shadow, so if you miss him or the enemy is capable to kite you you could get in some light trouble from time to time, but really he is forgiving too as his full rotation cost is kinda low and allow him to cast another Shadow and use another ability to regain energy before running out of energy(and really, you are missing almost 2 rotations to go out of energy)\n\nKennen...well, I disagree, he is energy gated some, imho . Given that his CD are very low, he can't afford to use his abilities all day long as Akali/Lee can if he don't proc his passive and/or he got to use Lightning Rush defensively to escape instead of using offensively(and here, look at a lee that can jump with his Q on a jungle camp and restore energy while escaping with a pair of AA), and he needs to hit enemies 3 times to do that, so even with the low CD if he miss some ability or waste Lightning Rush(for energy restoration purposes, of course) he run out of energy and has to wait some(and his QWE combo has higher cost than Akali/Zed, as a matter of the fact). \nHe is least forgiving of all the three champs mentioned above, really(another of the reason why he is maybe the only example of energy/no resource balanced champ, he is not THAT forgiving if failing to regen energy)\n\nShen yeah, we all agree on him, even riot agreed and hlped him a bit in the last patch. i think the core problem is the fact that, aside from hitting or not his taunt the energy regain is tied more to Feint and aa instead than to Vorpal Blade, which is non sense. If Shen is using Feint he is probably in a situation when he has trouble autoattacking because he has to survive first, and he can't even use Vorpal Strike often to regain health if the battle extends,  so he can't effectively recover enough energy through Ki Strike\n\nIf Shen uses the taunt towards 2/3 enemies, but only hit 1, and has to Feint, 110 energy is yet gone, he can use 1 Vorpal Strike to sustain a bit longer, and then he can only use after a pair of second either 1 of Feint/Vorpal Strike until Ki Strike goes off CD(and if enemies caught Shen while he was splitpushing when he just AA a minion with Ki Strike up and apply some form to CC that impede him from AA he would need to wait for a lot of seconds)\nKi Strike Cd reduction should be tied to Vorpal Blade too, not only to Feint, if they want to put Shen on par with the other energy champs. Like, if Shen hit with an AA an enemy marked with Vorpal Blade Ki Strike is reduced by an additional 0.5 seconds(stacking with Feint Ki strike CDR","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minrog","date":"2014-12-12T22:55:34.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> And then there´s Shen - his only contribution to a fight is his taunt, and he doesn´t catch several people in it he runs around crying to the gods to give him a little more energy so he can at least keep up the little power he offers with his other spells...\n\nI bought Shen the week he came out.

Tryn, Renekton, Riven, Katarina, and now Rek'Sai, seem to be the ones either doing really well, or terribly.

If I am to understand what you are saying here is that NRG champions are supposed to be stronger early on in the game but fall off later as they have zero reason to back unless low on HP, so they are supposed to have a gradual curve in power instead of spikes in power for mana champions when they get regen. The problem with this is that **almost** all NRG champions have some form of built in sustain be it from shields to lifesteal while most mana based champions do not, This also has the problem of allowing champions extra slots overall to build either a offensive or defensive item. Most NRG champions also have lower CDs for their abilities compared to their mana counterparts which allows them to either burst faster or clear waves faster than mana champions of equal burst or clear power. If they don't kill their opponent they are put in a weak state due to having to wait for energy/cool off(heat) while their mana (unless near OOM) or manaless counterparts only would have to wait for CDs. \n\n> * Removing mana from a champion opens up some potential for interesting team comps.

Most mana regen items are terrible for stats with a few exceptions compared to the items that a manaless champion would buy as they don't need regen. Manaless champions also wouldn't benefit from the bonus effects of these items as they are very selfish in nature kit wise. Some of these items (Tear and to a lesser extent Chalice) are built for the sake of having late game power at the expense of immediate power (Ryze being the exception), the problem here is that a player who builds Tear is put at a huge disadvantage due to not having the boost a equally farmed manaless champion would have from buying damage as they needed in lane regen to stay in lane. \n\n> There are certainly costs as well of course.

Darius can front-load his trading damage in Decimate, exposing himself to danger for a very minimal amount of time and even getting some no-risk DPS via his passive.

That bottom row is burst central. And most of the tops (zac/tryn/gnar/aatrox/kennen/vlad) can build to be pretty damn bursty too. But, with the exception of Lee and Riven, most mana-less champs are weak early game in exchange for being able to stay in lane longer, level to midgame sooner, and then turn the lane around and wreck mid-late game. For the most part, I feel like they require a little higher mechanical skill to compensate for lack of mana management.\n> {{champion:266}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:23}}  {{champion:154}} {{champion:85}}  {{champion:8}} \n> {{champion:55}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:64}}\n\nTrynd requires mechanical skill?

The usual counter is that these entry level champs are supposed to be generally weaker to push players to learn the harder champs, but many of these NRG champs are actually very viable; actually Reketon was set as the top lane balance bar in S4.
