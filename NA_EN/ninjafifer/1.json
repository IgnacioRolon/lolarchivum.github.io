A company can work on multiple things at once, but labor allocations can change. The question I'm posing is where we, the community, feel Riot's primary focus should be.\n\nI'm trolling around on the forums, and coming upon all these suggestions with what Riot should do next. A skin for this champ! Remake that  champ! Undo your item changes! Give us more item changes! I'm looking for a community consensus on what we feel should happen to this game as soon as possible.\n\nExplained:\n\n*  `1. **Server/security fixes: **Muster the manpower or tech help to get Riot's servers to either perform better, or be better secured against these software attacks, to help alleviate the growing AFK/DC problem. \n* `2. **Full champion reworks**: Things like Sion, Urgot, Teemo, etc... The characters who are so out of place, or so unanimously hated by the community, that they need a total overhaul.\n* `3. **Partial champion reworks**: Those champs like Kayle, Darius, Fiora, etc... that need/are getting some power redistribution or slight ability changes, keeping them in their roles and flavor, but still changing them. \n* `6. **Item reworks: **Total reworks of items that no one seems to use, such as Frozen Mallet, Zeke's Herald, Executioner's Calling, etc... \n* `10 **Jungle Changes:** Things like changing the jungle meta through jungle camp changes (health, damage, etc...) or jungle items.","replies":[{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-06-30T06:41:09.370+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are these mutually exclusive?

Their group is a mix of people with generally the same skills, split into a couple different major groups, such as Art, Management, Coding, etc... Many things can happen at once, but there is definitely a priority for them, and more labor can be allocated to focus areas. For instance, we haven't had a new champion for one month and eighteen days. They've clearly taken labor away from new champ design and placed it somewhere else. The question I'm posing is where Riot's primary focus should be, as judged by the community.\n\nOP edited for clarification.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowNinetails","date":"2014-06-30T11:48:42.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True a lot of champ designers are working on old champs instead of new ones, but none of them are working on servers nor would be if they weren't busy working on old champs.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaFifer","date":"2014-06-30T17:11:28.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough. That would be pretty much the only mutually exclusive one. Ideally, a \"pick 3\" poll would have been better, but this forum doesn't support it.

Game Designers can't fix server issues, and Animators typically don't draw concept art for what the new champion might look like.\n\nTo my knowledge, we're hiring pretty much everywhere, and everyone's doing jobs in their areas of expertise. It's not like we're like, \"You know what? Let's not hire any more network engineers, the internet is perfect.\" So while the effort is certainly nice here, I'm not sure it'll mean much.

It's good to know that you guys do have experts working on every aspect. I frequent the forums a lot, and get the feeling there's a lot of general dissatisfaction amongst the community, at least the ones who visit here. With this post, I was more so hoping to get the community to voice specifically where they feel their frustration is emanating from.\n\nI'll accept that labor allocations can't change as much as I though,  but regardless, I know that clear feedback of any kind is welcome to a company such as yours. Maybe one group or another might get that passion reignited if they see that the community thinks it's their department that's leaving slack. \n\nWe (at least I) do really love the game you have created, and I, by no means, intend to tell you that you guys aren't doing a good enough job. I may not be playing currently because I can't handle the abundance of AFK's I've had to deal with, but I do know you are working on it. As soon as it does get fixed, though, I will return. In the meantime, I hope you can take this poll with a grain of salt and see where it is that your community feels most frustration coming from.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2014-06-30T10:28:35.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outside of actually keeping the servers running and secure I feel reworks and remakes should be the top priority.\n\nThough I to this day don't understand why everyone hates teemo.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaFifer","date":"2014-06-30T17:21:32.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright guys, he \"doesn't understand why everyone hates Teemo.\" Get your pitchforks and torches out.
