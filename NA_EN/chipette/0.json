Lately I've been facing a weird lag in commands were they seem to come out a little later than usual (with no ms or FPS spike at all). I'm always sitting at 155 FPS and 55 ms during high pressure sitautions. The best way I could describe this lag is when a slight delay always occurs when I hover my cursor over a hostile target (it usually takes a second for the cursor to turn into the sword). Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T21:11:27.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you still encounter this delay if you undo the changes that *GeForce Experience* made to your League settings? If so, there may be some issues with your system's disk drive or League may be missing or full of corrupted files. I strongly recommend working through the steps in [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) if making those changes in GeForce Experience caused no change.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your delay.","replies":[]}]}
