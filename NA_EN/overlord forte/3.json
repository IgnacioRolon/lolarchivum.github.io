While it may not be a 'direct theft', as we see with Vladimir, she is nonetheless 'incidentally' draining magic around her to fuel her own power. This is theft-by-proxy at the very least, if not a more grandiose, abstract version of magic stealing.\n\nSpecifically,\n\n>This powerful ability had been dormant until now. It flared with volatile strength, the orbs like pearls of negativity that leached the spirit magic from the world around her, draining the ghost-willow of its life essence. Evard and his friends backed away in horror as the ancient tree twisted, its bark withering to a tarry black.\n\nand\n\n>The ceiling gave way, rubble raining down, burying the sacred gardens in dust. Syndra turned her powers against what was left of the temple, sending shockwaves throughout Fae’lor, and draining raw magic from the island itself. \n\n--\n\nI would like to dissect the rest of her lore, but this is a champion-breaking problem in my mind, and all other details following are hard to address. The fact she was thrown into Time Prison by the 'will of Ionia' is itself a separate, equally immense character problem.\n\nThis is **NOT** Syndra, the Dark Sovereign. This is some kind of shadow magic mage based on Zed's principles. Her fantasy of her own personal power and potential is not being upheld in a way that validates it as her own power. She simply turns on and sucks away/drains/diminishes/kills all other spiritual magic around her, like a great gaping hole in the universe.\n\nWhat is transcendent about that?\n\nWhere is the promise of her own potential, mired by the world around her? This makes her out NOT TO BE someone of presumably \"infinite potential\", she's a vampiric leech that literally everyone is justified in hating because *the world dies around her*.\n\nIf this is not your, Riot's writers, intention, then it is not being demonstrated clearly in the writing at all. In fact, it is actively harming the fantasy and ideas she was based upon, and is in dire need of re-assessment. What you have written is effectively a new, different premise that does not suggest anything about what she used to be about. Whatever new strength and power Syndra obtains in this version of your lore, it will only be stained by the fact she actively harms the flow of magic around her.\n\nPerhaps you might say \"well, this is how it behaved when she was immature or young\", to which I ask:\n\nWhere is the evidence that this effect is gone?\nWhere is the story that tells us of her dealing with this horrible effect she has on her own homeland/the world around her?\nWhy is it necessary to make her drain magic around her for her power to operate?\n\nI don't understand why this direction was taken.\n\nNone of it is the transcendent promise of the Syndra we had before.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-06T16:49:43.692+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":7,"body":"This is apparently a common misconception. We even reworded the bio to make it clearer, based on concerns that were voiced to the writer by (a VERY SMALL number of) players when the draft story was leaked...\n\nSyndra is not \"stealing\" magic. She is not pulling magic from other people, or the land, to fuel herself. The difference is in he term _leach_ (which is used in the lore) and _leech_ (which is not). They are very different in meaning.\n\nHer power is unique. It comes from within her. She doesn't fully understand it, because no one ever taught her how it works... but it seems to get stronger when she is in a \"negative\" state of mind. And when it is at its strongest, and she uses it and walks away, the residual effects on the magic of the land around her are quite disturbing. Without understanding how or why, she is creating \"magical fallout\" that permanently (?) sours the spiritual energies of the environment nearby. This is why, presumably, the Spirit of Ionia itself seems to have tried to imprison her.\n\nIMO, Syndra is now a character with a thematic conflict, where before she was rather lacking. She is a personification of not being aware of the consequences of your own actions, but also of the dangers of marginalising people who don't fit into the dominant worldview - can you imagine if she'd been born in Noxus with this power?

It was a very “our way or the highway.”  I can see her family making her feel as if she’s not part of Ionia’s “balance.” Her brother and other kids likely picked up on their parents’ apathy and bullied her - cause that’s what’s kids do.  In the flashback we see her trying to center herself and calm down before her brother hits her in the back of the head (hard enough to draw blood, i might add) - to me that implies a lot of the friction came from bad timing on both sides.  Yes, she destroys the sacred tree that protects the village but they make it clear she doesn’t mean to - you can’t make a judgment on someone’s moral character in that situation.  By that point, you can tell she’s just fucking done with everyone’s nonsense and the power just erupts.\n\nAs for when she wakes up, hey, I’d be pissed as hell too.  Surrounded by people who either want to kill you or use you - who wouldn’t lash out? Then again, I’ve always been partial to the “outsiders” in any given situation.\n\n*Edit* Hadn’t realized they’d updated her bio too - just read it.  And it confirms what I thought.  Yes, I understand her village being afraid but she’s a kid, for crying out loud.  Apparently her family left something to be desired even before then - and while I may be reading too much into it, I feel like there was a bit do abuse going on there from her mother, not just her brother.  Who blames their daughter when the milk sours?  That kind of irrational treatment raises a red flag, especially in combination with Evard’s treatment of his sister.  Like I said, most often it’s kids who pick what they see from their parents in how they treat people.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2018-08-06T17:02:25.761+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=R5N1EWq1,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-08-06T16:49:43.692+0000)\n>\n> This is apparently a common misconception.

You have to look at this from a player-facing view. The lore as released, honestly doesn't feel like the same Syndra that I had envisisioned from her previous story. I will be happy to come back to this thread after work and explain some of those reasonings, but if this is all players get to see of a character some of us love I am really disappointed with some major shifts in her back story. Knowing the cadence you guys take with releasing new material further fleshing out characters, there is no guarantee that there will be more released anytime soon that might better enlighten us to Syndra's character. So all we have as players, is what you have shown us, not the other stories written but not published that might better explain all the problems, speaking for myself, that I truly have with this redesigned story.\n\nHonestly though, try and look at this with some ignorance to all the extra information you have here that we don't.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-06T17:06:15.190+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"That is actually a great point, and it's one that I know I don't always follow instinctively.\n\nGood advice for all Rioters, in these sorts of situations!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-08-06T19:59:07.913+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Starlighte (NA) nailed it pretty well, i having read it all just kinda feel like this Syndra is sorta forced into a position where she has to be \"evil\" from everyone elses perspective just because she as a child was abused, neglected and eventually sort of betrayed by her teacher, the only one who had promised to try and help her when everyone else abandoned her.\n\nAnd on that, constantly berated and neglected by her mother while her brother and his friends actually bullied her to the point of throwing rocks? This is a thing in the \"peaceful&friendly\" Ionia? \n\nI thought demacia was the place that did that sorta stuff...and the small freljordian tribes. \n\n....Then this entire thing that resembles a \"deus ex machina\" plot in which the land itself wakes up and decides to imprison her in a magic statis with the added bonus for being forced to relive her bleakest moments?\n\nLike.....how is this Ionia again? Land of seeking balance,peace and enlightenment?\n\nSpirit of the land itself trapping a abused child in a never ending nightmare on loop?\n\nHer old lore was kinda empty but it had more potential for interactions and growth as a character, that was one of it´s virtues.\n\nShe could have left her floating rock to go on a journey which would shape her character, maybe she´d see something terrible done by people causing her to greatly mistrust them or something.\n\n\nBut now? She was pretty much abused nonstop as a child, was exiled and forced to go with a family that hated her, given over to a person who promised to help her but whom from her perspective grew to neglect her more and more and then that fellow goes as far as to cast magic on her without saying anything.\n\nLike......from a readers perspective this all just seems like a script to make her as mentally damaged as possible, unable to trust people or the very land itself, it limits her character and potential for interactions and growth so much.\n\nShe only has like ....three or four realistic outcomes from this point, two being that she becomes a true villain and either wins or dies trying.\n\nOr she has some kinda encounter or makes a friend and this event finally breaks her never ending cycle of despair and negativity.\n\nIts really so limited and the entire story feels so forced to make her as suffer as much as possible.\n\nI think i liked it more when she was just a power happy sorceress with lacking morality looking to realize her potential rather than now when she is this murderous witch looking to just destroy her entire homeland as vengeance for her suffering <,<\n\nSo.....if possible could you guys write something up to show us she isnt just this mage with a tragic childhood looking to burn her homeland to avenge herself?","replies":[{"poster":"NotaRobot1006","date":"2018-08-06T23:58:41.978+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Spirit of the land itself trapping a abused child in a never ending nightmare on loop?\n\nYou know, when you put it like that...the spirit of Ionia's kind of a jerk.

We disagree. If Taliyah was permanently consuming the rocks and making them into dust whenever she used magic, she wouldn't be looked at the same way. (Again, not saying that Syndra is consuming, and as you said, not relevant.)\n\nFor the second part, the issue is not that tweaking is bad. It's fine to change and alter a character, but you said you didn't see any significant change. Well, that is one. Maybe it's \"better mining\", but it is a significant change. Reacting to a threat and getting angry is not the same thing, and it doesn't say the same thing at all about the character involved.\n\nI also totes agree about comic books, but I'd argue that LoL case is slightly different. With rare exceptions, this isn't a second new look at already established old characters, this isn't a new reboot or a new alternate universe. They're still expanding the first look ever, 'cause let's be honest, even the pre-retcon JoJ-era lore was never a fully fleshed world, and a large part of the current 140 champions were never included in it.\nFor the case at hand specifically, Syndra had no major story in the JoJ, I don't think she had a Judgment, maybe a couple mentions in passing, that's all. So this is really the first detailed look we have, not \"taking a new look at old characters\", so authors have much less liberty to tweak the **few** things that *have* been established.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-08-06T19:36:27.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO that's the sort of thing that's often subjective.

If its for a good reason... sorry I disagree they should absolutely change her lore, especially if it better fits her fantasy and her in game character. And in game she isn't a misunderstood little girl, she's power hungry and reckless. She's not the good guy. The lore doesn't have to make her evil but she can't be completely the victim either. \n\nSo her moment of violence, the catalyst for when she really becomes syndra by murdering her master, it has to be understandable but she also has to be making that choice to be syndra- her choice has to be selfish and we have to understand that it is on some level wrong. At her core, Syndra is power hungry, not just defending herself.\n\n\nI also say this about when they updated Leona's lore. A lot of people were mad that she was no longer a pacifist, but that never made any sense for who Leona is in the first place.

And she still flies around in a castle after murdering her master.\n\nLet's start with the original bio linked in full so its visible at least somewhere in this thread\n\n>Born with immense magical potential, Syndra loves nothing more than exercising the incredible power at her command. With each passing day, her mastery of magical force grows more potent and devastating. Refusing any notion of balance or restraint, Syndra wants only to retain control of her power, even if it means annihilating the authorities that seek to stop her.\n\n>Throughout her youth in Ionia, Syndra's reckless use of magic terrified the elders of her village. They took her to a remote temple, leaving her in the care of an old mage. To Syndra's delight, the mage explained that the temple was a school - a place where she could develop her talents under his guidance. Though she learned much during her time there, Syndra no longer felt her power growing as it had in her youth. Her frustration grew, and she finally confronted her mentor, demanding an explanation. He revealed that he had dampened Syndra's magic, hoping to help her learn control and restraint. Accusing him of betrayal, she advanced on the mage, commanding him to lift the spell that was holding her back. He backed away, telling her that if she couldn't control herself, he would be forced to nullify Syndra's magic completely. Furious, she summoned her power and dashed the old man against the walls. With her mentor dead, Syndra felt the rush of her unbounded potential for the first time in years. Though she had won her freedom, she refused to return to the society that had tried to steal her gift. Instead, Syndra decided to claim her former prison as a stronghold. Pushing the boundaries of her magic, she tore the structure from its foundations and raised it into the sky. Free to delve further into her art, Syndra now aims to grow powerful enough to destroy the weak, foolish leaders of Ionia - and anyone else who would dare to shackle her greatness.\n\nIntrinsically, I think we see a shift in Syndra's source of power (her emotions). Previously her power was innate, and she was born into this power, not necessarily stumbling into it from an emotional outburst. Think like the baby in The Incredibles, born with immense power, discovering it and the joy of each passing day finding out how vast their powers are. THAT was our previous Syndra, now she is a bundle of raging hormones and emotions, almost as if she never grew to be an adult, lashing out at people with anger and vitriol.\n\nPreviously, Syndra's lashing out was only at an incredible betrayal. Betrayed by her village elders, betrayed by the only person who seemingly understood and was \"helping\" her with her gift, she lashed out in one singular fit of rage, killing somebody who not only betrayed her, but threatened to take away the one thing that makes her special.\n\nOn a side note, she ripped an entire temple from the ground in the old lore, in the new one it was but a mere tower (think princess locked in a tower trope, doesn't really fit with her character even if this wasn't an intended trope)\n\nBut these are just the most glaring changes to her character. I agree, for the most part she is the same, but there were a lot of liberties taken to flesh out details that, granted, needed to be fleshed out, but it felt like it was done in a manner that did not really do a good job of exploring who we, the audience, already know Syndra to be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-08-06T19:27:41.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest,how does old Syndra not feel evil to you?\n\nShe murdered her mentor in the old lore as well,granted in the old lore he threatened to seal her power permanently,but given what she did next it felt like he was justified in his threat and at the end she sets out to destroy the \"weak and foolish leaders of ionia and anyone else who would dare to shackle her greatness.\" even though the only one who tried to shackle her was her old master.\n\nNot to mention her voicelines like \"Run, playthings.\" \"A whole world to toy with.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2018-08-06T20:26:12.173+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=R5N1EWq1,comment-id=000500010002,timestamp=2018-08-06T19:27:41.306+0000)\n>\n> To be honest,how does old Syndra not feel evil to you?\n> \n> She murdered her mentor in the old lore as well,granted in the old lore he threatened to seal her power permanently,but given what she did next it felt like he was justified in his threat and at the end she sets out to destroy the &quot;weak and foolish leaders of ionia and anyone else who would dare to shackle her greatness.&quot; even though the only one who tried to shackle her was her old master.\n> \n> Not to mention her voicelines like &quot;Run, playthings.&quot; &quot;A whole world to toy with.&quot;\n\nPiggybacking on my previous post, if you look at Syndra's old character, she was betrayed by everyone around her to the point of breaking, and with a final threat of having her gift sealed, she snapped. Just like in the new background, but without the petulance of a child who is being bullied. Instead, it is with somebody threatening to imprison her powers within her own body, she would be helpless then.\n\nHer griped with Ionia is that of how the elders ran the state (at least in the old lore) The center path, balance and harmony, restraining powers and growth so that everything stays in equilibrium. The exact culture of Ionia, is what made Syndra's mentor to suppress her powers, thinking he could teach her control while keeping her powers under his control, until she was mentally mature enough to use them without excess.\n\nAs to her quotes, think of the joy and elation she must felt finally breaking her chains, of which she didn't even know she was a victim of until recently. She is jubilant in her freedom, free to do what she wants, and she KNOWS she is powerful enough to do it. She never achieved that mental maturity while she studied with her mentor, so she regressed after she killed him, to a child learning to ride a bike for the first time.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-08-06T22:24:11.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Betrayed by everyone beyond the point of breaking?\n\nThe only one who \"betrayed\" her in the old lore was her teacher.\n\nAnyway to me old Syndra always came off as someone who lashes out against others,someone who is angry with the world and leaves out her anger at others.\nShe killed her teacher in anger and didn't show a shred of remorse for killing him,instead she projected her anger onto the other elders and saw them just as guilty as her teacher.\n\nAnd given her voice lines she clearly has no respect for the lifes of others,she sees them nothing as toys for her to play with.\n\nOverall she went through a lot of trouble and her anger is understandable,but it does not justify the way she handles this anger, even under these circumstances.","replies":[{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2018-08-07T00:21:15.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=R5N1EWq1,comment-id=00050001000200000000,timestamp=2018-08-06T22:24:11.862+0000)\n>\n> Betrayed by everyone beyond the point of breaking?\n> \n> The only one who &quot;betrayed&quot; her in the old lore was her teacher.\n> \n> Anyway to me old Syndra always came off as someone who lashes out against others,someone who is angry with the world and leaves out her anger at others.\n> She killed her teacher in anger and didn&#x27;t show a shred of remorse for killing him,instead she projected her anger onto the other elders and saw them just as guilty as her teacher.\n> \n> And given her voice lines she clearly has no respect for the lifes of others,she sees them nothing as toys for her to play with.\n> \n> Overall she went through a lot of trouble and her anger is understandable,but it does not justify the way she handles this anger, even under these circumstances.\n\nPresumably her family (giving her up to the judgement of the village elders)\nThe Village Elders (her magic is too wild and untamed, she must be sent away)\nHer Mentor (suppressing her powers, denying her her birthright, threatening to take it all away if she rebels)\nSociety (creating the paradigm that developed this sort of culture, that would bridle a prodigy's talent for the sake of \"Balance, in all things\")\n\nOld Syndra only lashed out at one person directly, and she was honing her skill to lash out at the culture that created that person's mindset.

If that is your goal, there is definite room to clarify it. Perhaps a bit more 'telling', in nature, but we're dealing with such vague impressions it's hard to form concrete bases on it. If the magic is her own, and the land is dying because her magic is \"too great\", then stating it directly and combining with colorful imagery can definitively land that idea.\n\nI will say I'm very confused by the statement she lacks thematic conflict. Her society is a very traditional one, with rigid thinking and behaviors toward magic. In her old lore, the fact she was so capable (and perhaps, as a woman nonetheless) but 'unguided', they tried to train her. Her mentor eventually betrayed her with a horrible ultimatum: submit to his view or be magically lobotomized out of her magic. Syndra wanted to fit in, but when her efforts failed, and she was threatened in this way, her conflict became \"my personal freedom\" versus \"the demands of my culture\". Syndra's limitless potential is what simply enabled her to make this conflict a very personal one.\n\nIs it truly a useful thematic conflict to simply her make her dangerously ignorant of what she can do? Is that not what someone like Annie, who is literally a child of great power, would be better suited for? It leaves a taste of utter incompetence to Syndra's character she didn't have before.\n\nIt also does indicate that her power is--in an objective sense--such a problem that much of the moral nuance of her magic is stripped away. She is now more like an X-Men who has constant gamma radiation emission: no matter who she is as a person, her inherent nature is immensely dangerous and deadly. Transcendence, and her own personal growth, are now greatly in conflict with how she works.\n\nTrue, you could make a story about overcoming that, but it would resolve the conflict you seemingly want to perpetuate, which deadlocks her into this problem.\n\nIs the theme of \"woman versus culture, with great personal power and responsibility\" not sufficient?\n\n\nEdit: As an aside, some of these posters saying \"Konigen did nothing wrong\" essentially illuminates my point. Syndra is painted, objectively, to be a bad person/character, and no matter how wrongly treated she actually is, she's still in the wrong.
