Putting trundle or shyv into this classification doesn't mean they would get a rework or even a buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Kampsycho","date":"2015-08-13T00:47:44.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They mentioned Shyv adn Olaf though :o, I use Olaf often and used 2 Main Shyv Jg Alot so would be nice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kampsycho","date":"2015-08-12T20:54:25.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:48}} \nhttps://gyazo.com/1accb1022d7b60e323de0581a1d9c7a6\nAs a Trundle Main since I bought with 194.9k Score on him Ik most his Flaws and Weaknesses and Strengths...\nRange being one but since he can out right 1v1 anyone and win if not kited to death.(Like Vayne does) I find it only fair, But absurd since his Club is so Long compared to others with similiar weapons, yet they have longer ranges on him...\n\nIf it is ever decided to buff his AA Range I say it's buffed only when his Q is active, You know? When his Club starts to Glow, or in his W.\nHis only CC is only Slows, which any dash , which most champs have, can easily get away from. I would say buff his Q slow for longer seconds or harder slow, But It's cdr is so low it would be a bit too much, and I'll hate it for his 2nd only Dmg Spell(other then Ult if even counts) Has a long cdr.\n\nIf he's gunna get a Stun or a Root. It should be in interaction with his W. Where each spell in it is more powerfull in his W (Maybe it's W range should be bigger or last longer then or has a brief slow in it on the cast so people just don't walk out casually with dashes etc like now.)\nBUt what I'm getting at is so in his W Maybe now his range is increased like some people suggest.\nHis E would snare anyone near it after a couple seconds and maybe Stun if it's right ontop. and his Q Snare's people in his W since the name is \"Frost Bite\" Cause IMO a stun with his Q would be too much, Then again Skarner can land E and Stun with his next AA so idk.\n\nHis weakness is being immobile with cc that are just slows, that each can either Hinder him aswell as can Help(Like his E if someone just dashes through it.) Or his W where you want to use it to get close and E but people get out so easily and you won't have a chance to fight people in it unless they want to or till you catch them again.\n\nMost Champions with just slows or MS as buffs Opt for Ghost,{{summoner:6}}  and It's good on him. But creep block is mostly the reason why actually since even if you're that fast, If you have no Dash(which goes through people and walls) You'll be stopped by just body blocks.\n\nSo he has the tools to not be a easily kited Tank, But are easily counter'd Too easily that is. Rather then having an actual counter play or something.\n\nHe's a monster late but early, anyone who is a Caster AD or AP, will just bully while he has to walk up and AA, which can be counter'd too easily, Since short W Range since people can just dash, and short range so takes alot more and you lose Trade till you get some Lifesteal to sustain up.\nNote: W range is fine imo, Since would make it easy to counter jg or find out where he is in Jungle imo. But just needs something more then just MS buffs and AS, which are both great imo, Maybe a built in Passive with some ideas?\n\nAnd so I don't leave his passive alone, It's Great imo but only in Team Fights or when tons of minions die in a siege or defend.\n3% of a Minion's HP, even with W is really underwhelming once you try to rely on it for some sustain compared to people like Mundo,Garen,Mao and Cho'Gath. I wouldn't say buff it to 10 but Maybe 5 or 7 or some tweaks too it.\n\nBut in All honestly I love Trundle He's My Boo, and is fine as he is but needs some tweaks cause as a Tank sometimes in Team Fights it's Hard as hell to engage without murdering yourself, and using both your W and E to then just suffer and die or have to wait to do anything else...\n( Can't wait for Poppy used to main her alot aswell, I play most underrated champs so yeah..)","replies":[]},{"poster":"F03","date":"2015-08-11T18:24:02.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because a 20% movement speed at rank 1 for 8 seconds is being immobile","replies":[{"poster":"Kampsycho","date":"2015-08-12T20:21:11.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can walk out of it so quickly..., you have a choice of being in it or not, Even if you both are melee his W cast time is reactable and he can only get a couple of autos in then you're out and that's it.
