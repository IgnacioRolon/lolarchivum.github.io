Have it only affect his natural health regen and not his ult, else he could regenerate 100% of his max health. \n\nAnd I don't believe this would be overpowered even if he reached 100 health per second. ADCs easily deal upward of 1500 DPS.\n\nMaybe move his passive to a passive on his ult if he needs that health regen too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-08-10T19:03:13.146+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Increasing his in-combat sustain would make sense thematically.\nIt's called \"adrenalin rush,\" so why not make the health regen be stronger when in combat?","replies":[{"poster":"FlashBash21","date":"2015-08-10T20:38:28.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well then it would be a better Garen passive.
