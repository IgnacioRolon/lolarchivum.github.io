Think of Urf Nunu as an outsustainer. Nunu can clear jungle fine and well, Nunu can duel fine and well, but they cannot outrange at all. Consider the pick for peel and having a good soloist in top or bottom (Malzahar, Ezreal, anyone with a distance poke longer than 600 and can't be hit, or can push hard should work).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valhalla Rising","date":"2015-04-06T08:36:28.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or u could not let your top laner 1v2 and feed 5 kills in 5 min. costing the game as you pve.\n\njs","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2015-04-06T19:14:13.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR you can have a smart toplaner who outlevels the opponents and is smart about their poke.\n\njs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-06T13:32:09.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I HATE NUNURF.\n\nI played a match and he stacked cinderhulk and a ton of HP and he had over 10 million HP (because everything x1000 in URF) we couldn't even tickle him and he melted everyone who looked at him because of gromp buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2015-04-06T07:05:04.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically you want smite so you can dumpster the drake real fast at the moment he spawns then go back to lane your xp will be the same.","replies":[]}]}
