Unfortunately, when reconnecting I get a disconnection notice or I'm loading with 999 ping and have a 5 second delay in response if any, and thats if I even get to reconnect to the game.  Frequently lag out in lane or on my way to lane auto walking from home base, when going to attack enemy or clicking to get position on a trade.  This is only in ranked que, normals and arams have flawless connection.  I've received leaverbuster lower priority que twice due to this.  Forcing me to have a 10 min leaverbuster que before joining que for the next 5 games, and it refreshes if you cancel at any point once you restart the que, even in party's everyone must wait this timer, while not being able to use anything in the background of league(chat, store, etc).\n\nABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING WHEN I ONLY PRACTICE AND DOMINATE IN NORMALS AND ARAMS IN PREPARATION FOR RANKED! \n\nRITO WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU TO DESERVE SUCH CRUEL AND UNFAIR TREATMENT? :'(\n\nKeeping people down, afraid, and intimidated by ranked lag is not encouraging to one who only wants to get better and climb, doing whatever it takes to win.. is this ELO hell? Or is riot putting limits on my potential *SIGH*\n\nAnd by lag, i mean the LoL client instantly closes and bugsplat pops up.. or it will freeze forcing me to force quit, either way I end up needing to reconnect to game.","replies":[]}]}
