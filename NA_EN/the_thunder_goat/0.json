On the new client, however, when I DC there's this countdown and after the countdown is done the only option I have is to press the \"Exit Now\" button.\r\n\r\nIs there any possible way that this can be changed to how it works on the old client? Or an option to do so? I really like the look and feel of the new client, but I am basically forced to use the old one because of this small issue/annoyance.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this!\r\n\r\n                                   - The Thunder Goat {{champion:240}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T00:52:33.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the core issue here is that your connection is dropping out for a second.

Thanks for taking the time to reply to me!\n\nSo over the past couple days I've tried to go through the connection guide and here are my findings.\n\n-**Firewall Troubleshooting**: I've changed this, and it seems to have helped a bit, the problem still happens but not as much so this was really nice.\n\n-**Configuring My DNS**: When I did this change it actually made it worse, and the client disconnected even more than before.\n\n-**Port Forwarding**: This didn't seem to have any effect.\n\n-**RELEASE/RENEW IP AND FLUSH DNS**: This step is similar as the firewall fix, where it seemed to have helped, but not fix the problem 100%\n\nOverall, going through the guide has helped me a bit and I disconnect from the client less often now, where it only happens a few times a day (where it used to happen a few times every 15 or so minutes).\n\nThank you for suggesting that I go through the connection guide!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-19T22:34:01.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're still experiencing some issues after taking those connection steps, I'd like you to run a traceroute during a time you experience symptoms so we can ensure your route to the server isn't an issue.

I used it when I was experiencing problems and it seemed to have gotten rid of the problem. I did, however, experience higher ping in game (going from my usual 39 to ~130). I couldn't change the server hotspot from the Southern US to southern Ontario where I currently reside.\n* I had the same result and issue with Hotspot Shield.\n\nI guess I'm starting to get a little anxious now as Riot has announced that soon they will be moving everyone to the new client, and if I still experience this problem it's going to be really frustrating dealing with it :/\nAnyways, hopefully with the results from using a VPN lead to a solution that'll fix the problem!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T22:07:06.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you didn't experience the same issues while using a VPN, it means the issue resides in your standard network routing with your ISP.

I thought I'd update you on what happened after I called my ISP.\nThey started off by letting me know that on the LTE network we are on we have a dynamic IP address and is most likely the reason why I am experience the quick disconnects from the client. They said there was nothing they could do about it at this current time.\n\nThere is light at the end of the tunnel, though. They told me that at some point this year they will be adding a static IP address on the network because it has been requested a lot (probably a lot of people calling in with the same problem). This seems to be the fix that I cannot wait to be released so I can enjoy this game and the new client fully!\n\nWhen I get this new static IP and I still encounter issues I'll run through all the tests again and let you know my findings and then let my ISP know what is going on.\n\nThanks again for all your help!\n\nChris \"The Thunder Goat\" {{champion:240}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
