I heard that i might get it later on but still it has passed almost 2 days and didn't get anything. Is that a bug, because i heard people on other servers had the same issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T22:26:20.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully these capsules will start getting added correctly again soon, but in the meantime the poro's got you fam! I could line up where you leveled up, and that you didn't get the capsule anywhere around that time, so it's added for you now ^_^! \n\nBe sure to refresh your client if you don't see it yet!","replies":[{"poster":"Ineba RHZ","date":"2018-01-18T11:38:23.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, great.
