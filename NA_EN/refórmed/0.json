I was basically getting harassed by this group of people and they were also saying rude things and they didn't get banned. How is that fair riot??? Please unban me I want to play league. I got banned for no reason. And the group I was playing against was a group of 5, so they literally told them to report me and a 5 player report seems to hit pretty hard. I don't understand why it was with this game only. Is there any way I can get the ban remove? Please take a look at the chat history because the enemy team was very rude and after the game, they all reported me because they had a 5 man. And it seems that this was the ONLY game where I got banned for what I said in chat. The chat pop up that display my ban only showed that game, which isn't very fair or makes sense. The stuff I said wasn't even bad : \r\nRefórmed: ill smash you \r\nRefórmed: lol \r\nRefórmed: riven killed you \r\nRefórmed: hes mentally r%%%%%ed aswell \r\nRefórmed: with one auto lol \r\nRefórmed: 1v1 me full health \r\nRefórmed: anyone that says kid is a kid \r\nRefórmed: no \r\nRefórmed: cait run lol \r\nRefórmed: idiot \r\nRefórmed: this cait is SO bad \r\nRefórmed: this cait is SO bad \r\nRefórmed: im 2 in 8 though \r\nDISCLAIMER: THE RIVEN IN THIS GAME WAS MY IN REAL LIFE FRIEND!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T22:39:22.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At a glance, I'm assuming the punishment had something to do with calling someone retarded. Regardless of whether you were saying it to a friend, things like this can be pretty insensitive and offensive to others. Your punishment doesn't have anything to do with whether or not other people said something worse or who started what, it's based purely off what you said and nothing else. Your actions are your own, and sometimes the best retaliation is to keep your cool and report them in post-game.","replies":[]}]}
