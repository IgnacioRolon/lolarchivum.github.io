I admit I&#039;m an asshole, I&#039;m toxic and I bitch A LOT at the game. \n\nHowever I&#039;m not the only person to go crazy in a game like that. I&#039;m playing my ranked to climb and when I get stupid people it bothers me, people make death threats and don&#039;t get banned. I would have been fine with long ban but they didn&#039;t put me on chat restriction, or any punishment thus far aside from some low piroirty ques from dcing this season. But just instant perma ban? Well riot I&#039;ve been reported and lost 1 account because I got reported by the same 5 man team for playing them twice in a row, guess toxicity got me this time.  The around $500 if not easily more spent on skins because I supported your game since the begining? Nah suck a perma ban. Because on a game you should be able to call someone a dumbass for being a dumbass they got the handy mute button RIGHT THERE.\n\nBut hey, instant perma ban. Alright I guess it&#039;s settled I am a toxic asshole. I was on like 500 games on chat restriction last season. Spent all of season 2-3 not talking because I refused to use chat. Lost one account for literally doing nothing but playing against a premade and 10 reports = instant ban.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-07-30T00:37:50.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"_ I was on like 500 games on chat restriction last season._  = Your warning. a HUGE warning.\n\nYou got exactly what you deserved and nothing of value was lost, maybe you will learn from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2016-07-30T00:30:59.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It puzzles me why Riot doesn't punish instalocking and obvious trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-07-30T00:38:46.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because blind picks.
