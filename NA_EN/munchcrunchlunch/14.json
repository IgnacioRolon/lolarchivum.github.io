Most mages had their playstyle barely altered. Meanwhile new assassins got shifted 180% from their point-click-burst pattern. Some pretty straightforward champions got turned into actual mechanical nightmares. It is obvious that assassin playerbase needs more time to adjust. New Malz playes pretty much like the old one, new Kat is very different from the old. Itemization changes were also much more pronounced in the assassin rework.\n\nIf there is anything concerning about well being of the assassins, it's not _their_ state, IMO it's state of new support itemization.

Good to see that's not the case.\n\nAs for the rest, this update is a rework, not a rebalance. If assassins are weak, which was also the feedback on PBE, they can be buffed, and the point of their update is that they can be buffed more easily without going nuts. This is also ignoring the initial learning curve that comes with every champion release or rework. Remember when Gnar was thought to be hopelessly weak on release? What about Tahm Kench, or Bard, or new Sion? All of these were champions who were thought to be weak and therefore irredeemable forever, yet eventually found their way into the game once people became accustomed to their quirks. Assassins are different now, and play a bit differently, and just because they aren't dominating the game now doesn't mean their update failed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoXNidalee","date":"2016-11-13T16:24:22.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes Shaco isn't as bad as I thought after playing him a few times.

Maxing cdr with morello -> nashor's is a must then swarm the map with boxes for control, rylai is good as boxes apply it.
