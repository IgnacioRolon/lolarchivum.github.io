Azir has 41% win-rate with soloqueu, his average damage dealt is one of the worse among other mid-laners.\n\nJust making sure; do you people know he was nerfed in this patch? (6.14)? because sometimes I don't think the Anti-Azir circlejerk actually keeps up with patchnotes (similar to the old Zed circlejerk when he was nerfed and became healthy but his ban-rates maintained rofl, now they're falling down that people are slowly realizing he's actually not satan)","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-07-21T12:16:01.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not forget that Azir is a late game powerhouse.

I'm generally fine as Xerath, and ok with Vel'koz; however, you seem to be forgetting that the Azir player picks after I do 1/2 the time.\n\nSure, Morgana can still cs against him well enough, but it's not like his pushing ability is worse than hers.  He also outscales her unless my adc is actually good enough that a Black Shield is appropriately useful.\n\nEven then, Azir is such a god in the late game, and doesn't suffer for it at any point in the game.  In the super early laning phase, he can easily push the lane with his soldiers from a decent range, keeping him from being killed at the very least.  After the first couple levels, he gains massive harass, an easy escape, and a somewhat easy gank tool at 6.\n\nYou don't have to be a pro to W->auto->Q->auto for a thunderlord's proc with Azir.  You could argue that I could retaliate with an all in during that, but I'll probably take at least one extra auto for my trouble.  If I use my mobility to go in on him, the enemy jungler could easily show up to kill me as well.  It's just a difficult situation where all answers seem wrong.\n\nThis is not to say that I always lose to Azir (I really don't know my win-rate against him, so I could even be >50%), but he is a frustrating champion to go against with his general strength throughout the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-07-20T20:39:39.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think OP was focused more on the viewer aspect of the champion as opposed go the actual play as/against stuff.
