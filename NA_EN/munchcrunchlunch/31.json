The AD Carry isn't happy because he died obviously, but that's unavoidable. The assassin isn't happy because he just instantly exploded and there was nothing he could do to save himself even though he did his job correctly. The AD Carry's team isn't happy because they just lost their biggest damage source and used a bunch of cooldowns to kill the assassin but didn't have enough time to use them earlier to save their carry. The assassin's tema isn't happy because to them they lost a player to Bronze level stupid aggro even though he killed his target because the lead gained was mostly lost giving the entire enemy team gold and losing the 5v4 advantage to make it 4v4.*\n\nThe ideal is to make assassins have a way to get OUT of fights safely but only if they did their job. This makes assassin feel better to play and reduces the frustration of having one of your own team as they aren't going to feed the enemy just for doing their job. **There was seriously a time (around Season 2 and part of Season 3 if I recall) that teams hated having an assassin as they were seen as useless and taking the place of a far more valuable mage with range and utility.**\n\nThe other ideal is to make assassins have to take a little bit of time to kill their targets. This has failed horribly for the entire duration of the game because Lifesteal + Crit can negate half an assassin's combo in one auto-attack, plus assassins tend to be melee and get instantly CC'd and exploded by Tanks and Supports the second they try to do anything. \n\n***Riot is trying to reduce frustration for the enemy team with the class update - now that players don't rage at having an assassin on their own team anymore - but this is unlikely to happen as long as assassins can be instantly deleted if they take longer than a second to kill targets.***","replies":[{"poster":"Mercuteio","date":"2016-08-05T20:25:51.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"kha is a good example of the \"The ideal is to make assassins have a way to get OUT of fights safely but only if they did their job.\" because his E (jump) only resets its cooldown if he gets the kill or assist he was jumping in to get and if he doesn't well then you die","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2016-08-05T09:11:45.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"What counterplay do marksman have compared to assassins?

I play this game for the assassin role and would quit if it was changed for the worse. I have played every assassin in the game and I believe all assassins can be cancer, but they all have there weakness. I started in season 2 and was a mage main to start but fell in love with the deletion process.  Started as Akali went to Kat and finally Evolved into Diana who I spend 90 percent of my time playing.  I honestly love this game, I have never played another game as much as I have league of legends.\n\nAkali- levels 1-5 is hell on earth, she is not at all easy to cs with if the person has some kind of poke. \n\nKat- very weak at the start of the game, Poke her down, force her to not be able to engage. CC her ult.. COMMUNICATE WITH TEAM  and Don't Let Her Roam for free. Pantheon went mid and ate my lunch one game so bad I will never forget that game.\n\nFizz- Has a hard time clearing CS imo, watch for his level advantages and power spikes.  Dodge (if you can) the drop on playful trickster.   \n\nZed- Can be hard countered by Zil, Aniva, kayle, kindered.  I feel zed is much more balanced after the nerfs recently. Give him nothing, back when you think you are low.  Still hate his kit and I still hate dealing with that champ. \n\nLB- hard time with wave clear and against a lane pusher will be forced to use abilities to cs. She will almost always be aggressive. Play safe until you can grab a negatron cloak. \n\nDiana- Missed Q pretty much equals no engage.  Especially if they dive in thinking the Q will hit and it misses then its death...\n\nTalon- can engage hard but has no way of getting back out. If he thinks he can all in you then maybe you have stayed to long..\n\n\nI could do this all day, if you get tilted go watch some videos on how to improve against a certain champ, go play that champ. Learn there cooldowns, learn the damage spikes so you know when to watch out for there engage. \n  \nCommunicate with team, CC,dodge skill shots or find a way to survive the burst normally will send assassin's packing every time. Another idea is counter build them right out of the gates.. two rings into Seekers arm guard hurts zed bad. Summoner spells!!!! Take barrier, heal, teleport and exhaust is like the bane of a burst character. Crowd Control...Crowd Control... Crowd Control...\n\nEvery champ has the potential to deal insane damage in the hands of the right person. Every champ can be cancer.. You guys that hate assassin's with a passion, well I hate tanks with tons off CC that make my life hell. \n\nI honestly have no sympathy for ADC's at all... The buffs to ADC's this season was out of control. I love eating your souls and I never feel remorse. \n\nMages I understand your pain, I personally thought the mage update and the itemization they came out with was not satisfying at all. Slapping CDR on everything felt extremely lazy to me.  It lacked the WOW factor of the ADC changes and Juggernaut changes.\n\nSupports, the day will come where they hopefully won't just band-aid your class. \n\nGood luck in the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2016-08-05T19:04:48.076+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A. I think I can speak for everyone on the boards when I say thank you for the tips on how to deal with assassins.\n\nB. Just from my inexperienced bronzie perspective, the mage update went fairly well-ish except for Vladimir. He's stuck in this really awkward position of being **completely awful** or being slightly less awful and driving people fucking insane. Even with his current abysmal state, he's still regularly banned.
