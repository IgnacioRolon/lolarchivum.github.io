Armor and MR are the only things that reduce damage unless there is a champion specific ability (like if Garen activates his W for temporary damage reduction). If one champion is taking less damage than another, it's all due to resistances.\n\nTanks aren't getting any kind of extra stat bonus over other champions. They take damage according to the armor/MR formula just like everyone else. The only difference is that a tank might have the 4% damage resistance mastery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-11-18T21:14:21.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks do have more armor and they have more health. Individually those two difference may not seem much, but the two stats interact making the result more noticeable. \n\nAlso the difference between 20 and 25 armor is bigger than the difference between 120 and 125, so a little difference in base values actually means a lot.\n\nAlso a lot of tanks (Garen being one) have abbilities that increase defense or reduce damage.
