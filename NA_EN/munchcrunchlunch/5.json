I have been experiencing some heavy drops on the fps for a couple of weeks and then today the game just won't start.

Just grabbing a single file from somewhere would be both unsafe and ineffective.  Your error is a strange one, and I would have suggested a reinstall.  Since you've already tried that, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can work on this individually with you.  The HRT should have also grabbed some logs too, attach that to your ticket for more context.  We'll see you there!","replies":[]}]}
