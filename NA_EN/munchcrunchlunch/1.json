Yesterday Evening i had a Queue Position of 4500+ never happend with the Legacy Client in 2 years!\n\nThis Client has so many Bugs and Problems that you should have considered to switch all to the Legacy Client instead of this new one. \n\n#OffTopic\nOn this Acc i can choose where i want to launch the skills, but on my second even with using the same options down to the same volume its casting instantly.\n\nIts beyond messed up and theres no fixing it. Still you bring out Pay 2 Play as if that would make anything better .. if you cant hire technicans who know what they are doing, just quit doing it","replies":[{"poster":"SuckHerWee","date":"2017-06-20T22:23:35.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"excuse my french but bitching about it won't make either of your problems with the game better. trust me, just have patience with our lovely rito employees and your problems can be fixed. just submit a support ticket if none of the troubleshooting steps help.\n\nyou might need to copy some of your logs from the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and then put them into your [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) along with a detailed description of your problem. it will take more or less than a day for you to get a reply, and if you just have patience (like i did when i needed a client problem fixed) then your problem can be solved.\n\nsincerely \n\nyour average league player","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Surelock Holmes","date":"2017-07-08T17:39:38.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=uFkYfriI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-20T20:35:59.147+0000)\n>\n> Hey dude, sorry for the shitty situation you&#x27;ve been through.  :(  An AFK Warning exists just to let players know about [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), it doesn&#x27;t actually penalize you unless you have a history of leaves.

If this is the case do you know of a fix for this? Other than alt tabbing during select (which I like to do for matchup questions and such).","replies":[]}]}]}
