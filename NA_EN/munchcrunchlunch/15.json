That is a solution to a symptom.\n\nThe PROBLEM is the reason why you are having to ban all these champs......because of balance issues. If you guys were to keep asking more for balancing of those champs rather than bans that you wouldn't even use on champs you WANT to ban but instead HAVE to ban, then it would be a lot easier.\n\nBut no, for some reason everyone thinks if you just ban all the champs then the problem will go away......it wont. Because there will be troll bans and bans on champs that people are just tired of playing against that are NOT OP.\n\nThe solution is not more bans, its balancing the champs that everyone wants 10+ bans for.\n\nThe problem isn't how often you are having to ban these champs and its not how many bans we have, the REAL problem is WHY we have to constantly ban them.

Everything can be solved with balancing so the matter of how many champs there are is irrelevant.\n\nBans should be used for banning the champs that counter your team comp or for banning you intended champs counter in lane/jg.

Say you were to get more bans even though the balancing is the problem. Getting more bans would force people to play more champs and that is fine, HOWEVER, what about the people who don't have the points to get more champs? You cant force them to spend money on RP and it wouldn't be fair to force people to buy certain champs they don't want for their role.\n\nBesides, I even mentioned this somewhere else, the more bans you have, the more people can target ban a specific role and by doing that, it gives that team an advantage by banning 5 champs in that role and then building a team comp around that. Grant it, the other team can do that too, but the odds of the other team doing that in the same match are slim.\n\nAnd my other point is still the fact that getting more bans doesn't solve the issue, only delays it. There are still going to be OP champs if the balancing is not there which no one seems to want considering I hardly see any threads on that but see more on wanting bans.
