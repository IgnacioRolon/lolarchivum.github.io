You have two grievous wound items {{item:3123}} and {{item:3165}}. One only work if you AA, not many champs aa often, melees usually are more ability dependant and just have a few aa between their abilities (you have exceptions like yi, jax, etc) so they can't apply the grievous wound so effective   plus the item it build into {{item:3033}} is sub-optimal so you are just getting it for the grivious wound. Mages have it easier since morelicom is more versatile, however it onlu works on targets below 40% HP and well, mages rely on burst so by the time they finally reach that low HP they are probably out of damage. (exception to battle mages like ryze, swain, cass)\n\nLife steal on melees are again only usable if you aa often, and the few that aa often usually have some built in lifesteal so adding extra lifesteal proves counterproductive since you need the resistances to get close to your targets. Mages, I did said spell vamp was removed.\n\n{{item:3140}} again, pretty specific stats so it makes it really hard to get it on other role than adc or very specific cases. The mage equivalent is {{item:3157}} but the difference is that this item doesn't just remove the position mistake just like QSS does but instead gives a chance for your own team to fix it for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-06T20:38:16.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Executioner's Calling will apply GW to all physical damage, including abilities.
