physically react and press buttons as fast dont make me less educated about the game and how its played. and due to the physical disability i have with my left arm i dont play overly mechanically intense champs due to that. but the champs i do play i play very well and i normally play with/against gold and plat players and the if i make the match making gods mad the occasional diamond rank
