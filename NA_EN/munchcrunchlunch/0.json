It could be a packet loss issue or some other reason entirely.

Even just running a [traceroute ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)could get more information of your routing, and an idea of what's going on.  The reason we need this is to rule out possibilities and analyse the situation.
