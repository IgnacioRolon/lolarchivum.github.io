The key is to move around a lot. Yasuo will really give him a hard time. Think of it this way, seain has healing, good damage, and good cc. The one thing that people overlook is that he loses access to almost all of that if he misses an e. If swain misses an e he misses out on: a root, a pull, a pull + q combo, healing, and a soul fragment, which will really weaken his ultimate in the long run. Speaking of which, it’s obvious swains ult improves with soul fragments, but did you know he can’t even cast it if he has none? So if you consistently dodge his e he will literally be unable to use his ultimate (granted he doesn’t hit anyone else or you don’t walk into a w, which has an abysmally high mana cost early on so forcing him to rely on w for fragments is a good strategy). In addition, his ultimate is horrible at rank one save for the burst, with only a base damage and healing of 30 and 15 per second, respectively. Don’t be afraid to dive in 1v1 if he’s ulting, because it’s weak early on and it takes a while to charge the Burst in early 1v1’s. Also, Everyone avoids swain’s w like the fucking plague. In Reality, this thing is weak as all hell early on and is likely the last thing he’ll max. Don’t let the eye spook you. If you are about to get a kill, or he tries to zone you into his other skill shots with his w, it’s better to take the hit and continue what you’re doing. Until he actually starts leveling it, it only has a base damage of a hundred and a 25% slow so don’t let it scare you during the mid game. if I’m not mistaken, it starts off with a mana cost of either 75 or 90 so missing one will really fuck with swains mana pool early on. People could be at full health about tonget a kill and run in the other direction when they see this no matter what, every single time. Also, he is very weak to ganks in top lane if you spread out. At best, he will root one of you and then get dicked down since he has no escape and he probably doesn’t have any good items built yet. Evelyn was the bane of my existence while I played swain. If it or your jg have stealth or solid cc it shouldn’t be hard. So to recap, dodge his e, don’t be afraid of his w until late game (but dodge it when you can, obviously), dive his weak ass ult early on in the game, gank the shit out of him, and force him to waste his mana by using w nonstop early in the game to get fragments for his ult. Hope this helps. These were just some of the things that I felt were important to mention after spending a whole day of grinding with him.","replies":[{"poster":"I Am Stephan","date":"2018-02-20T07:13:18.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before y’all call me out on my fucked grammar I just wanna say I wrote this as fast as possible in between loading times.

The ideal place to be at all times is between your melee minions and caster minions. His q early on won’t kill melee minions very easily so you won’t have to worry about his piercing (unless they’re very low health) and the casters begins you will almost always block the root on his e is you stand in the right spots. Save dashes/shields/jumps etc for when he throws out an e and then punish him for missing it. Either he’ll panic throw out a q and w or flash away (granted you do enough damage).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DaishinkanSama","date":"2018-02-16T19:13:25.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:50}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Smell Kids","date":"2017-09-01T17:36:52.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is old af, but i actually won my lane quite easily with quasus. Sure it might not be the best way and you will not be dominating the guy, but you also wont be feeding. If you dont know what quasus is, it's basically nasus but you max e first and dont stack that much. Also you wont be buying sheen items, atleast i didn't really need them. First back i bought aons and from there on the lane was quite easy, whenever jungle ganks just w him and ghost yourself and you can kite him out very easily and should be a kill. Specially if your jungler ganks you at early.
