A Vlad can beat a fiddlesticks if the fiddle absolutely sucks ass. The whole point of this thread is why is Lux so frustrating to play against. And the answer is because statistically speaking there are not many mid lane match ups that even prove problematic for her. Out side of Talon I can't think of one match up your average Lux player should even be worried about, some one else mentioned Galio but how often will you ever even see that match up.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2016-02-04T01:00:10.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"I didn't say \"if the other guy is bad\". I said \"if you are good\". Big difference. For example, at the pro level, Corki is seen to beat lux in lane, because any time she walks up to proc her E-passive, they would place a phosphorous bomb in between, meaning they win the trade in mana and potentially in health. \n\nXerath imo would shit on Lux normally, because he can outrange her and pokes her out of lane. Pretty much any assassin can beat her post 6, but if the lux knows wave control that isn't definite (and that includes talon). I don't see how Talon would have any better chance against Lux than a Zed or a Fizz would, especially a fizz. Imo if it's against Fizz you have to keep poking with E+Passive, because if you Q too early they can all in you and you will lose that trade 90% of the time. Same with the TF matchup though (can poke with Q and auto, should never waste gold card), and Fizz is considered a hard counter to Twisted Fate. And Yasuo is almost a hard counter to lux, his wind wall negates everything but her ult, his E means you shouldn't be hitting ANY Q's, and you have no mobility to dodge his own Q. \n\nHow about we talk about the actual matchups here instead of going off of completely skewed statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-02-04T01:16:04.884+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"How about we talk about the actual matchups here instead of going off of completely skewed statistics.\"\n\nBecause stats tell a better story than made up scenarios.

Its hard for Zed and Fizz to just out right assassinate a Lux because of how telegraphed their engages are on top of how safe she already is by default. The only reason Talon does better than most assassins against her is because he has a much better surprise factor.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2016-02-04T01:36:24.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"If you're using shitty stats then no, they don't tell a better story.

Heimer and Udyr have pretty high winrates too, guess we should start nerfing them because they must be absolutely broken!!\n\nNo, it doesn't matter how predictable the assassination is if her Q is down or if she is oom. And just surviving lane with most of those champs means you now have the advantage.  That is the whole point. Her E is reliable poke but with high mana cost, and her Q is very unreliable and also very easy to dodge, especially if you use any of the above mentioned champions. \n\nA good lux will fuck talon just as much as she would fuck Zed im pretty sure.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-02-04T01:47:18.421+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimer and Udyr aren't some of the most picked champions in the game.

Lux is strong right now, but the idea that she wins every matchup is just stupid, especially when you're going off of things like win rates. \n\nUdyr and Lux and Heimer are high because they are easy as fuck to play. Talon is similar, but he is also played mostly by hardcore mains. You're either extremely biased or have never taken a statistics course, because only going off of one stat, one that has proven to be unreliable innumerable times, is at best misleading and at worst pure idiocy. \n\nYea, her Q as a low CD and a high range, but if you get hit by a max range Q in lane you're fucking up big time. But her cooldown is ample time for a fizz or Zed or even kassadin to 100-0 her. I love how this sub goes from complaining about how hard it is to hit a cassio ult to thinking Q is basically point and click. And how winrates are a VERY important until we start talking about the board's most hated champions, then they are back to being the extremely unreliable stats they are. \n\nBut of course, the only reason I don't use those stats is because apparently because they don't agree with me. No other reason. Can't have anything to do with the actual legitimacy of the statistic. That's like using CSPM to rate a support player. \n\nI realized win rates were shit when i looked at Zyra's mid win rates and saw Fizz as her best matchup. I was like level 12 at that point.
