I am able to connect 100% of the time and the issue is not with my internet. the game however won't connect unless I exit and reconnect and the \"please wait\" thing does not connect it keeps going infinitely. why does this happen in the first place anyway My internet seems fine \n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T04:40:09.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While your connection may be fine to some sites and services, each site or game you access online resides in a different geolocation, meaning your network routing to each server looks different. This means that you could have issues accessing or staying connected to League while having no issues accessing Google or YouTube. These issues are usually caused by certain local network settings that don't play well with League, so I strongly recommend going through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure this isn't the case.\n\nLet me know if those steps ended up resolving your issues.","replies":[]}]}
