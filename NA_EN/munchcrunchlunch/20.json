One AD item? Garbage. You're not a tank, you need to make use of your AD scaling.\n\nOnly his E scales off of bonus AD. His Q? Total AD. His W? AP, so doesn't matter. His ult? His ult is 440% TOTAL AD scaling. This is the most of any ult in the game  save the theoretical damage of an Illaoi ult in a team fight.

His E gives him an AS steroid, and his Q acts as an AA reset and shreds armor. That combined with Thunderlord's Decree allows Wukong to dish out some damage early.\nWukong can easily sneak in a few extra AAs in his combo and a Tiamat proc if he has the item. None of his abilities (except his ultimate) deal a ton of damage alone. However, he can use them in quick succession and weave AAs between them to increase his damage output in a small time frame.\n\nIt is the same reason why Fiora and Riven can deal so much damage early. Their AD ratio and base are actually pretty bad, but they can hit a target for like 3 times per second with all their animation canceling. \nThis is also why it feels like that some tanks deal less damage despite having good base on their abilities. Their abilities are a lot slower, and they cannot combo them quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PePsiLemoNN","date":"2016-04-12T18:33:00.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The better question is why  he , as a fighter/bruiser , has invisibility :\\","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2016-04-12T21:01:13.969+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PePsiLemoNN,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gAmfwnzc,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-04-12T18:33:00.781+0000)\n>\n> The better question is why  he , as a fighter/bruiser , has invisibility :\\\n\nbecause its his only real escape?","replies":[{"poster":"PePsiLemoNN","date":"2016-04-13T11:52:14.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Then why doesn't {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:80}} etc have an escape?","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2016-04-14T15:01:16.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PePsiLemoNN,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gAmfwnzc,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2016-04-13T11:52:14.688+0000)\n>\n> Then why doesn&#x27;t {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:80}} etc have an escape?\n\nThey are different champions.\n\nAlso, his W is barely an escape.

I tried to think of any \"duelists\" you would win in a 1v1 late game unless massively ahead and to be honest I can't think of any.  Hell even Aatrox will shit on him once he has BotRK.

You do realize he has like four match ups in the top lane where he's not at least at a minor disadvantage or very quickly outscaled.  The only point he's typically stronger is level 1 or level 2, although low elo loves to throw every skill shot at the clone once he has it.  He doesn't have the single target damage of most assassins, and he does have a bit more health, but not enough to be an issue.  Hell his underpowered W is literally countered by a 75 gold ward.  I think his current win rate right now is right at 50% or just under.  Sterak's/Maw counter his burst fairly decently and any decent support should be able to peel him as once his E is down he has no engage without flash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-04-13T01:53:48.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"30% armor penetration, that's where.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sisters10086","date":"2016-04-13T00:53:47.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"early game decent damage, late game{{item:2043}} then no damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-04-12T18:56:55.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Instead of asking why Wukong has burst of an assassin, I'd love to know:\n\n1.

It has to be weak since caitlyn is one of, if not the most oppressive early game ADC in the game. Her range is topped only by a tristana that's really high leveled. Once you get some armor pen though, her ult isn't too bad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-04-12T16:28:08.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AA-reset, and a powerfull armorshred.\nAA-resets are just very bursty.
