Pros find the small handful of champs that are strong and have the least amount of counterplay, and spam them to hell and back. I'm not doubting them for doing that, the whole point for them is to win. But it does get boring quickly watching the same section of champs over and over and over and over again.\n\nThere was actually a discussion here with a Rioter last year about this very topic. He seemed to be interested in the suggestion that in a pro tourney, once a champion was picked a certain number of times, it would be disabled for the rest of the tourney. That would essentially force diversity on the pros and open up a large section of the roster as possible picks.\n\nOf course there are many negatives to that as well, and as we see nothing came of that discussion. But it is telling that Riot knows watching the same champions in the same matchups constantly isn't doing them any favors.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2016-03-06T17:59:54.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"IN S5 the situation about pro pick diversity was decent though, at S5 Worlds you had like 55+ champs played/banned throughout the entire tournament, this season is actually worse than usual\n","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-03-08T15:51:08.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"S5 is the exception rather than the usual.

However, there is always weeks where there are the most contested picks (i.e. Alistar or Braum in support).\n\nThis season specifically has a meta where teams ALWAYS lane swap, top laners usually double jungle, and supports may late invade to disrupt the first jungle clear. There are a handful of reasons but basically...\n1. ADC and support take jungle camp to get the unfair level 2 spike (usually this would be the side of double golems.\n2. This causes the jungle to start on the opposite side (very predictable)\n3. This causes top laner to stay w/ their jungler for protection AND because top laner will get zoned out of CS/XP in the 2v1 against the ADC/Support\n4. Turrets are so easy to take early game which leads to maybe a 3 or 4 man push. This also leads to a game of chicken where basically the first team to stop pushing loses out on more turrets/xp/CS\n5. Dragon isn't as important so there aren't fights for it unless it's easy to take\n\nEvery season (or parts of the season) have specific metas that the pros will follow (because it's the 'best/efficient' way to play). We've had some metas where you have 50+ minute games regularly. Some seasons have games that are decided during the first 15 minutes and end by 25-30 minutes. Some seasons where there are 6 junglers banned every game (a bit of hyperbole). \n\nThis season is definitely boring for the first 15 minutes unless you're interested in the mind games and strategies of working the map and lanes. This season ALSO has the most interesting since you could see 3 markmen on 1 team, lots of assassins, or lots of tanks (long intricate teamfights).
