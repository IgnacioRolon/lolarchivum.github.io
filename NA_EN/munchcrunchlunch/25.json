Note that the minion changes only affect minion damage dealt and damage received against other minions- _they are just as easy to waveclear/push out as they were before_. What's changed is that the creeps will naturally fight closer to the losing team's towers.\n\nAs a result, the team that's behind get's to farm up harder to make a comeback.\n\nand the winning team get's the opportunity to siege more often, or otherwise risk the enemy team catching up.\n\nInterestingly enough, in Dota 2, when the **Barracks** (the Dota 2 equivalent of an inhibitor) **are destroyed**, all the minions in that specific lane _get stronger and **they give less gold/exp on kill**_. This is because the lane autopushing is actually a huge advantage for the team getting pushed into as it allows them to farm up in the safety of their base. Dota 2 acknowledges this by decreasing the gold and exp values so that the losing team doesn't gain an advantage for losing an objective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-11-30T21:44:46.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jeddy017,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kc3EEQEJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-30T02:11:40.187+0000)\n>\n> You know,I honestly can't tell the difference.I truly can't see how much of an impact these new minion changes had on my games.\n\nYou are full of it since your match hostory shows you havent even PLAYED on this patch to know.

I would also like to say I haven't played many games since they turned the new minion thing on (if they have). I also realize that it's purpose is to let the losing team farm easier. However, I honestly feel like it makes it really hard to make comebacks in teamfights because it is much harder for the losing team to set up a slowpush in order to give themselves the time needed to fight against the 5 man enemy group. I was trying it earlier and even without the enemy clearign it when I attempted to start a slowpush the enemy minion wave just grouped up and ended up as a mob of 3-4 full waves bashing our inhibitor tower leaving us no time to dedicate 5 people to take any objectives or win any teamfights. Whenever we left to clear waves and potentially get some gold/xp we just ended up getting 3-5 man ganked and we were right back where we started if not worse. This specific case is probably only an issue in lower elo though, because we seem to have no concept of split pushing down here. I am usually on board for whatever changes Riot wants to make, but I can't say that about this one. At the least I can't say it yet, because I haven't really learned how to play around it yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nunya Bezwacks","date":"2015-11-30T05:15:48.398+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLED IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT \n\nI FUCKING TOLD YOU SO!!!!!\n\nSorry had to get that out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MindWaves","date":"2015-11-30T22:00:51.496+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"@OP What you also did not touch on was the fact that this completely kills any attempt at wave management.
