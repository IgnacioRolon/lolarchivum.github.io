I get locked out of controls for about 30 seconds. in this time the game did not dissconect. am simply watching the match going on still and I end up getting killed most of the time because of this. how the fuck do I fix this. I cleanley reinstalled the game. how???. I suddently can't move or do anything in lane or team fights. I can't ping I cant chat. but the game did not disconnect because I can still see that it didn't dc. when it dced enemies usually keep moving and collide with a wall. but here it just happens that am the only one that stops doing anything and everyone else is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"ShogunTrance","date":"2017-01-29T04:20:28.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im getting the same issue constantly dropping out, Im playing on a mac if that matters.
