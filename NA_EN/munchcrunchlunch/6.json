I have this one issue that really affects the gameplay and often just ruins my chances of winning\n\nsometimes I'd say about 1/2 the time. when I drop to really low hp in the middle of the fight. right before I die (in which I have not died yet or not like I am getting froze as I get damaged). the game freezes at the exact moment before I die. for about 1. 1.5 seconds. skips all those frames and then shows me that Am dead. this leaves me with no chance to outplay at low hp and often I die with my summoners up\n\nthis happens idk 40-50% of the time on all of my compuers. one of them is new. I have no fucking clue why this happens but its stupid. \n\nthis has been happening for months. i disregarded it because it doesn't seem like anyone else is having that issue so i have no idea whats the cause or how to fix it\n\njust to be clear my framrate does not drop. my game drops frames for a second or so. so the visible framerate does not drop its just that those frames do not show up at all it just skips to the moment after I die. \n\nits fraustrating. I lost count at how many times I could have outplayed a situation usually a 1v1 at low hp but fuck I couldn't do anything because I didn't get the chance  to.\n\ntldr: game frameskips when am really low hp in combat. happens on multiple computers\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-21T03:10:47.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are all of these computers you're seeing this happen on all on the same network? If so, this could be caused by an unstable connection that just so happens to only show up whenever your champion dies =\\ . Let's try going through the [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to rule out that possibility first.\n\nHit me back up and let me know how that works!","replies":[]}]}
