He seems like a decent skin for me.\n\nIn all seriousness now (that's hard for me) I think that dark star will be a good one. But you know. They can't make crossovers in the skin lines so as far as I would like Dark Star and Star Gurdian mash up it won't happen. So I guess we have to stick with the unique skins for him. Back to bloodborne I guess (See! I told you I cannot be serious)","replies":[]}]}
