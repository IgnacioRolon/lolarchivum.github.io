So just get a pile of AP and a Void Staff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-04-16T21:49:30.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of how Liandry's works, it can be used because of the MPen, but the proc doesn't work well because it doesn't deal damage until after .25s and each ability refreshes it rather than causing it to proc damage instantly, so all you'd be doing is keeping the tiny ticks going.\n\nKnowing that little fact, we can move on to how Cass does damage. Most of it is spontaneous burst, mostly done by her E which has a .5 ratio. If we go ahead and go with Liandry's max damage, 2% every half sec (The item reads it does 2% every 1s, so doubled would be 4% every 1s, easier noted as 2% per .5s since Cass's E has a .5s CD) and compare it to another item, like, say... Zhonya's or Luden's. To make it easy, we'll go with the flat AP of Zhonya's.\n\nNormally by end game, you'll have Rabs and your 500 passive, plus Dragon and the 5% from masteries. This totals 30+30+6+5 (We know it's plus because they mentioned in the previous patch notes of changing it to be additive rather than multiplicative) which makes 71% bonus AP. Zhonya's would, with the 71%, total 205.2. On Cass's E, that's 102.6 damage per hit. \n\nNow let's go with a tank's health. At end game, it's not uncommon to see them around 4500 health. 2% of 4.5k is 90. If we up their health to 5k, that's 100 damage per .5s. So logically speaking, a Luden's or Zhonya's would be much better than the ticks given by Liandry's because it ticks off of current health, so that 100 damage will quickly decline. \n\nI shall also note that an average DPS build Cass will have {{item:3255}} {{item:3048}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}}, with the last item depending on if they need the Rylai's slow and defense, a GA for the passive revive, an Athene's/Nomicon for the max CDR, WotA for insane regen off the E, or any number of other items that synergize ungodly well with her kit, like a Luden's. If you go with a Liandry's, you have to take into consideration that it does half the damage mentioned if they're not CC'd, usually kept up by a Rylai's. Honestly, I like to have an Athene's, Luden's, or WotA for that last slot for maximum damage output rather than relying on an item that's better off on Singed. \n\nLiandry's is simply just bad right now. It's MPen is the best stat on it. The health is okay, the AP is decent, and the passive is pretty crappy. If it did 4% base instead of 2%, that way it totaled 8%, putting it on par with BotRK, it could do some real tank shredding on champions who DPS well like a tankier build Cass, Singed, Mundo, Cho, and the like. I could see a LB, Liss, and even Syndra or Ziggs picking it up as well since they'd need the tank shredding and their CDs are low enough to keep it up, but currently, it's a waste of a slot item on anyone who's got good ratios.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-04-16T22:56:54.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember seeing a thread a while ago that did math showing that Liandry's was even better in a burst rotation on most champs, but that was before the Cass rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-04-16T20:23:31.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just fine.\n\n{{item:3020}}  / {{item:3040}} / {{item:3157}}  or {{item:3089}}  / {{item:3116}}  / {{item:3151}}  / {{item:3135}}  or {{item:3001}}\n\nSo if you are good and confident enough:\n\n{{item:3020}} , {{item:3040}} , {{item:3089}} , {{item:3116}} , {{item:3151}} , {{item:3135}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-16T19:43:25.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably just a core, simple AP build with {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3020}}","replies":[]}]}
