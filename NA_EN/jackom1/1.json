I submitted a ticket, along with other people, and yesterday it was working way better. \r\nBut today it's back at a very low frame rate. I can't click anything that the game starts freezing. I'll submit another ticket tomorrow along with the repair tool log, but it's getting annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-21T18:58:20.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be some bad game files, see if a force repatch through our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) can help.  In the meantime, toss me your ticket number and I'd be happy to check the status for you.  I wouldn't recommend creating another duplicate ticket, it could end up causing delay or confusion.","replies":[{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2017-11-22T16:26:41.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"32550565\n\nThe force repatch didn't help. \nShould i try a clean re-installation of the game?
