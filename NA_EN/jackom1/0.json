One time, I wanted to try xin zhao, but the frame rate was really low right from the start of the game. \r\nI tried using the repair tool, but it had no effect. \r\n\r\nBefore 7.19 I had no problem whatsoever, as long as I was sticking to the medium settings. Now the frame is awful even with the lowest settings. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone else is having the same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Syrp","date":"2017-10-07T01:06:11.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this problem since 7.19. I've tried the repair tool and it didn't do anything. FPS is just going from 120 to 60 to 90 to 50, to stupid shit and the game is literally unplayable. This has happened in 7.16 for a week and then randomly fixed itself. I don't know what the **** the deal is but riot: patch this, fix, ur, game.\n\n   Also fix Mordekaiser","replies":[{"poster":"Syrp","date":"2017-10-07T20:54:33.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've even uninstalled league ENTIRELY and the problem presists.

Unfortunately, the game still performs noticeably worse than it did before the patch even at low settings, but at least it's somewhat playable now. I'll try the repair tool and see what happens.\nThanks for the support! :D\n\nEDIT: The repair tool didn't help, only thing I guess I should try is to completely re-install the game.
