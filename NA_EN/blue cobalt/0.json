But this dynamic que is literally ruining league. All you get being a solo q player in sliver/gold is 3 man ques who think they are best of the best and if you don&#039;t what they do or say they literally sit there and bully you then get the enemy team to report me because I refuse to have teamwork with people who are being toxic because they believe they are above everyone else because they have a numbers advantage because they are all friends and playing together. Then you get people trolling because of this new dynamic que you get people putting their role to support then trolling and picking another jungler that goes around and feeds all game. You need to have a better way of punishing troll picks in ranked its very f***** annoying when you lose games because you have someone on the team trolling and that has 10 deaths pre 20mins in the game. I don&#039;t care what you say about there is some way to win the game at all times but not when you have troll that went around the map and fed every member of the enemy team. in general your matching and draft phases of the game since dynamic q has come out. The in game rage has gone because you have friends raging together now and they think its okay because they are doing it. There is no way that a 5 man premade should ever be playing against 5 solo q players that is not fair in anyway of the game. the voice coms trumps anyway the solo q players coms when looking at the salt levels of solo q players when other players say what to do. You guys should now this if you read chat logs of games but you don&#039;t and it seems like you don&#039;t about the fanbase anymore. because you guys are spending time reworking assassins instead of fixing a more pressing issue being your rank matching making. get your shit together riot\n\nI was trying to talk about both in this post. But I was also trying to point out from the video that riot made called the round table on dynamic que. They said that they think it is fair that a 5 man premade could play against 5 solo q players not party uped from DQ. I which imo is not fair looking back at past year because solo q players get butt hurt when another solo q player says anything to them about how they playing the game.\n\nI also wanted to add that if you DQ so ppl playing with their friends in rank. You happen to be a solo q player on the team with a premade party. You have a bad start to a game or something goes wrong that they don't like or whatever (there is many situations for this to occur in game) the premade group tend to group up with each other and bully the solo q players in game because they have a numbers advantage. If you are solo q player and the DQ group is making bad calls in game and you are simply trying to voice your opinion on what your team should to try win the game or stall the game or whatever situations. It makes it really hard to climb being a solo q player.\n\nI think riot has pretty shitty priority when it comes to fixing the game because they said they are reworking assassins which is very time consuming but imo they should be spending that time fixing their match making for ranked before they start reworking a large group of champions for the game when they pretty balanced at this time more or less.\n\nRIP\n\nAlso no matter what happens on this forum post its very unlikely that any riot member will see this and even if they do see it they will not comment on it because its a topic on the hot spot right now. that needs to be fixed before its late to save this game from becoming nothing but a memory\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4sg2jc/dq_and_new_champion_select/","replies":[{"poster":"Cookimonster316","date":"2016-07-10T22:38:34.982+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just one comment\n> Then you get people trolling because of this new dynamic que you get people putting their role to support then trolling and picking another jungler that goes around and feeds all game.\n\nThat is not Dynamic Queue that is new champ select","replies":[{"poster":"sir d wreck","date":"2016-07-10T23:42:41.593+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are forever cursed with people mixing the two up because Riot thought it would be a good idea to release them and then mix them together.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-11T03:59:47.833+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did it on purpose, so achievements of new champ select could be used for their dynamiq.","replies":[{"poster":"PUS5Y DE5TROYER","date":"2016-07-11T22:19:32.819+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah they even hired lyte to help them lie with statistics and confusion. they literally budgeted for getting better at lying to the players with the money you spent on skins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-07-11T05:00:05.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Wrong.

I've just played 10 ranked matches and went from Plat V to Gold II in 24-48 hours. That is totally unrealistic and I don't understand how that is even possible. The game is supposed to match you based off of 3 variables is kinda crap already since the Rioters on talking league stated they \"fucked up\" I don't even think they solved their own issues. First of all they try to get you the roles that you want when you are dynamic queing which has a delay because everyone wants to play certain roles and not explore others resulting in extremely lengthy times. Second you have that = skill level portion of the system that isn't registering right in my opinion because I have players who don't have the similar mindset or even responding to ideas correctly in fact I think they are flat out \"In it for themselves\" mentality which severely hurts not only themselves but also their teammates. Finally the third is that they wanted to make sure that players are having shorter que times. I would prefer to have the second 2 rather than the first because\nA. it's rather difficult to adjust that formula\nB. Getting into games now is like I could cook an entire dinner by the time the que finished now.\n\nTotally a frustrating concepts that Riot is working on but I don't think they are listening to the lower elo populace the entire conversation revolved around Scarra talking about Master Tier and higher.......So the other 5 divisions don't matter. Totally realistic. \nSorry I don't intentionally mean to make this a huge rant but you have to understand that I loved how satisfying the game was before dynamic que was put into circulation but now it's a rather frustrating system. I'm competing against a system rather than other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Goatfish","date":"2016-07-10T23:40:16.740+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Koriinn","date":"2016-07-10T23:45:01.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is highly unlikely but I'm currently experiencing this and we lose due to decisions or trolls that just keep showing up.
