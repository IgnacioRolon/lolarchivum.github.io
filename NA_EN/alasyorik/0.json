By looking at the network traffic of the matchhistory site you can see, that the game data comes from [https://acs.leagueoflegends.com/v1/stats/game/TRLH3/1001380191?gameHash=43a46f49938bacca](https://acs.leagueoflegends.com/v1/stats/game/TRLH3/1001380191?gameHash=43a46f49938bacca)\nHowever you will always need the gameHash to access the JSON. You get it by retrieving it manually from the lolesports.com site (View stats link)\n\nHope you can still use this information.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mind Control","date":"2016-11-13T00:13:01.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotTiza,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=ErieQbgU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-11T23:18:26.404+0000)\n>\n> Hey AlasYorik,\n> \n> The offline tournament realms are _literally_ offline - they&#x27;re not connected to the internet at all.
