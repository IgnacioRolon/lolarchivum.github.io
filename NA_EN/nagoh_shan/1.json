Riot only wanted flashier visuals and once those were complete, the balance and skins teams have both abandoned her.  She was a niche pick that whilst being slightly less flexible than Nami, still could find a place in the meta and even got some playtime in LCS.  Contrarily, after the nerfs not a single serious pro team was even willing to consider her at worlds due to the poor state Riot has forced her into where she's now just a 3rd-rate version of Nami in every regard.\n\n> (e.g. lack of counterplay or insufficient distinguishing features from other champions of the the same role)\n\nSona was super squishy and team-reliant, inherent counterplay.  Adding more has crippled her.  She was a songstress and only one of two stance champions, very distinguishing.  She no longer plays songs and does not use the stance mechanic, you've homogenized her into another cookie-cutter mage.  Even worse, she's a 3rd rate cookie-cutter Nami.  With this one rework, you've essentially **given **her two of the fundamental problems you claim are reason for a rework in the first-place.  Riot worked backwards on Sona instead of forwards.\n\n> That's not indicative of the rework failing though.\n\nHer individual damage is lower, her team-donated damage is weaker at ranks 2+.  Her sustain is unreasonably low and stiflingly expensive at ranks 1-2 during lane where it's most important and her damage mitigation at all times is poorer.  Celerity has become a complete mess and to top everything off her abilities are now melee range and all of her CD's have been screwed up.  Not to mention, Crescendo still isn't 100 mana at ranks 2-3.  There wasn't a single improvement made to her kit in the entire rework, just blatant nerfs across the board.  If this isn't evident of a failed rework, I don't know what is.  Riot needs to sincerely consider hiring some mathematicians to their balance team, cause their work over the past half season has been shoddy at best.  I'm referring to every blunder: the Cass and Soraka nerfs; the Lucian fiasco; Essence Reaver; the list goes on.\n\n> Power by contrast's adjustable with simpler numbers changes\n\nYou've had 20 weeks to make number changes, actions speak louder than words and the only action we've seen is inaction.","replies":[{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2014-11-20T16:09:42.697+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't agree more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2014-11-18T13:46:48.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The changes weren't implemented properly on the PBE.

It's now 40/80/120/160/200 when it used to be 50/100/150/200/250.  On top of this, it granted herself bonus AP to do even more damage, so her bolts already do over 20% less than before.  Despite this, nobody ever complained about Sona being the least bit stifling to play against, even after noting she had lower CD's, higher healing, lower mana costs, etc.  Contrarily, regardless of having better numbers she was still just an off-pick.\n\n> Sona's power level is felt more by enemies\n\nIn actuality, Sona's power isn't felt playing as, with, or against her.  Enemies complaining aren't really complaining about Sona, they're complaining about all enemies doing damage.  These are the people that believe all matches should be 1-sided in their favor, they'd be as likely to complain about any opponent doing damage. Comparitively: Nami's 3 spells each do more damage than Sona's 1 spell; Morgana's Q and W both do more individually; Alistar; Annie; Blitz; Braum; Janna; Karma; Kayle; Leona; Lulu; Nunu; Soraka; Thresh; Zilean; and Zyra all have higher base damage on their spells.  **Hymn of Valor has the lowest base damage amongst the entire support class.  It is Sona's one and only damage spell, yet is only tied by Leona's Q (E still does more) and Taric's TWO damage spells.**  Number's don't lie, Sona has the lowest damage output amongst the entire support class, even outclassed by every tank support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zeracanule","date":"2014-11-19T05:19:31.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler-a day ago 11/18/14\n>  (it's possible to have a really unhealthy champion that has well balanced numbers or a very healthy champion with unbalanced numbers).\n\nXelnath-5/8/13\n> The data indicates Xerath is actually balanced in terms of total impact on the game. \n\nThis is just my constant annoyance, but I'll never forget the fact that Xerath was considered balanced, not just in numbers apparently, but also total impact on the game.

I also considered how sitting back in lane and mindlessly spamming heal (a la pre-rework Soraka) to undo all the interaction from trades was pretty boring for me, and probably pretty lame for the enemy. This idea, if implemented, would probably cause the name of the power chord to be changed and its current effect of shredding damage to either be moved or removed.

I've got quite a bit of food for thought now.\n\nYou know, there are things that I didn't like about the Fearless rework.\nFor example, when I use my W, I understand that its effectiveness varies depending on the situation, but I'm confused as to its optimal usage. Whether it be team fights or in lane, is it better to mitigate the damage of a full health ally or heal it after it's dealt? If one is better than the other, does the other option count as superfluous design? It seems like the ideal use of the ability is to shield 4 full HP targets and heal+shield one injured target, but this scenario isn't in my control.\n\nThe new E is now supposed to serve as another method of engagement for ult follow-ups. I don't see how it's more effective than her pre-rework E + ult engage. Wouldn't a stronger, decaying MS buff accomplish this better? On another note, wouldn't this make it easier to tag allies with her \"cuddle zone\", especially when allies are moving away from you?\n\nSpeaking of \"cuddle zones\", correct me if I'm wrong but:\nWouldn't the gameplay for them be deeper if the effectiveness of the buffs increased proportionately to how close you are to your ally and/or if the duration increased based on how long the ally was in the zone?\n\nFor example, if I'm trying to \"cuddle\" an Ezreal against a Draven, wouldn't this make Ezreal think about where to Arcane Shift? In this case, if Ezreal has to Shift to avoid a skillshot, it becomes most effective if he Shifts somewhere inside the zone, which means that he's relying on me to have good spacing so that both of us can simultaneously avoid the skillshot and retain maximum benefit of my ability.\nOn Draven's side, wouldn't this create gameplay if he knew he could alter the effectiveness of my abilities by using Stand Aside to push Ezreal out of my zone and force him to either Shift back in to gain the benefit, or do not and lose out on the buff? \nIn this case, you'd have to stick to your partner like glue while your abilities are up, the ADC would have to make good plays for you to follow, and the benefit of the duo being most effective when the two have good coordination.\n\nBut no. I give Ezreal a variety of buffs and he can Shift away with them all willy-nilly. Draven can push Ezreal away but he can just walk back in to a zone for a buff that's equally as effective(the only exception being the heal). ZZZZ\n\nI'll give this some more thought though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AsolDiana","date":"2014-11-19T02:25:12.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They want him to have a 0% pick/ban rate, there's no other explanation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"551202","date":"2014-11-18T22:16:54.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}} Is so broken, \n\n- He counter any top laner, ANY!His Q (his poke) has no Cooldown and no mana cost (so forget about farming against {{champion:150}} ) So with his Q that slow +  his E, he can easily chase and kill ANY1.\n\n- He DO NOT NEED AD ITEMS TO CARRY OR DO DMG!
