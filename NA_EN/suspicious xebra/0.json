It had the same issue when I had just a little over what I needed so I restarted the client, did not help, so I played a few more games thinking it would register then and it has not.

However its giving me IP after games then adds but when i go into the shop to get something it tells me not enough IP. its been happening for a week or so now. after i restart the game it recalculates my IP down rough 100-200 IP this is really annoying as i dont play super often. so having to play at least two more games specifically for IP isn't fun. also this problem makes it annoying in shop when i can get some runes takes away IP and then problem ensues. please fix please. ... ps also waiting for galio to be balanced :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"LumberjackingOff","date":"2017-03-13T18:12:02.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A similar problem in the new client; where the IP gains from games would add correctly, but the store wouldn't recognize it as enough. Logging out and back in would decrease the IP by about 100 IP, and after another game the exact same thing happened.
