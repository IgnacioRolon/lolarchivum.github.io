Like I don't deserve to do that much damage as a full tank. But her old W I actually really liked because it let you get Rylais and Sunfire to spec into this soft CC AOE tank that would wade through a fight and just chase people down. \n\nI think an option to look at would be to remove a large part of her passive damage, and instead do something like this.\n\nW works as is\n\nE, allies no longer stack it, however E active now works like old W, and at max stacks enemies are slowed for a large amount for 1 second or so, say 50% slow. This would make her more about staying on enemies to apply her stacks and turning a soft slown of say 10% into 50%, which makes her play more as the CC tank she should be rather than the tank that waits for her passive, nukes someone, then runs to wait for passive. I understand her old pattern felt a bit uninteresting but a lot of Sejuani players seemed to like it and other Rioters have said that in cases like Malphite sometimes simple champions with not much depth are okay for the game.

Unable to sustain through enemy poke which is nigh constant vs a ranged support. Fewer opportunities to engage vs an enemy melee. If anything, remove her passive and give her a better one. Removing her ability to engage in lane - especially pre lvl-6 just makes her far too easily abused; that's exactly what you would be doing by nerfing her e or increasing it's cd. If she can't engage, she has nothing. No q or w buff aside from a drastic change (which would probably need to be at broken level to make up for the e nerf) is going to make up for that. She wouldn't be able to USE any of those buffs except when she already got off her engage via her e.\n\nSo either you are increasing the window of safety for her opponents between her e's but hella buffing her q or w to give her more burst or nigh invulnerability (via q or w buff) when she does get off her e engage; or... you are leaving her with a buff she cannot use basically at all in lane which will leave her too far behind and abused from laning phase to make use of it later in the game... and consequently her adc as well.\n\nIf you are going to nerf anything (and honestly look at the stupidity of taric's damage and cc plus his much better scaling both as an individual and for teamfights before you make changes and consider that among other things), then nerf/change her passive. Replace it with something that would make her more durable/extend the duration of her durability (like some minor %hp shielding for landing w damage onto enemy champ) or give her some kind of movespeed bonus in certain situations from her passive (instead of the damage it does) to allow her potential to engage with her q even if e is on cd.\n\nThere are champs far more \"busted\" than leona - even when she was \"broken\" earlier this season. And many of those have gone untouched or even buffed because they are countered hard in high elo. If leona is \"broken\" in low elo, so what - there's a million other champs that are too. People have a \"ban\" button for it if they can't play against it. No different than me having to ban a singed or a master yi some games just because my teammates cannot handle playing against it. And those champs can be far more oppressive than leona ever has been.\n\nStop punishing early game champs for doing their job properly. I don't see you nerfing yi, fiora, soraka, or tahm for how oppressive they can be outside of lane or even in lane. Yet they're allowed to compete on near equal footing with early game champs unless the early game champ outplays them and snowballs lane - note I said OUTPLAY. Because if they don't, the scaling champ goes even in lane and just far outpaces. Let the early game champs do their job and be BULLIES in the early game like they're supposed to be. Or else, stop giving scaling champs such a strong scaling advantage; make THEM have to outplay mid/late to be better than the early game champ... not someone who can just rely on better item synergy, better scaling kit, or pure out-stat to demolish an opponent mid/late. There's too damn much of this going on... across the roles of league - not just support, and not just toplane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swiftstrike4","date":"2018-04-12T22:38:06.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZJq5fuas,comment-id=000c0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-12T00:00:01.263+0000)\n>\n> One of the directions we were looking to pull back on was her single target lockdown (E into Ult or Ult into E) with the changes in 8.7.

I believe that her passive is the most problematic aspect of her kit. She can't use the passive herself and is one of the few champions in the game that doesn't have a passive unless her teammates damage the same target she is attacking. Even braum can proc his own passive as a support. \n\nIf you do reduce her ability to lock down a target by raising cooldowns her passive should be examined or her durability should be assessed. Leona always tips from being overbearing when she is too strong to largely irrelevant because she has no way out after a fight. \n\nI think Riot should ask this question when trying to balance Leona: **\"Why would a player pick Leona if they can just play Braum?\"\n**\nThey have pretty similar kits but Braum has an escape and Leona doesn't. So her CC needs to be much stronger than Braum's or her durability needs to be much higher than Braum's.  I like playing Leona sometimes at support because she is simple, but it is hard to justify the pick over other champions at this point that are more effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2018-04-12T09:19:49.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZJq5fuas,comment-id=000c0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-12T00:00:01.263+0000)\n>\n> One of the directions we were looking to pull back on was her single target lockdown (E into Ult or Ult into E) with the changes in 8.7.

They've generally done a pretty good job of this and I've been one of the biggest defenders of Riot's reworks for that reason. Riot only changed the core gameplay/playstyle of a champion when the old way was unsustainable, i.e. Poppy, Sion, Yorick, etc. Riot apparently considered Sejuani to be one of the champions needing a drastic change, but I just don't see it. Old Sej had some problems but new Sej has been an even bigger problem while being less fun.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2018-04-12T01:23:01.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">They've generally done a pretty good job of this and I've been one of the biggest defenders of Riot's reworks for that reason.\n\nThere's a duality you're missing here. Riot's focused, single champion small reworks and VGUs have generally been very good, especially over the last few years. Their multi-champion class updates have been overwhelmingly terrible.

I think the adc update is among the best work Riot has ever done and I think that every champ that was part of it is better now than they were before. The only question mark among them for me is Graves, but I think that new Graves is interesting and fun enough to justify the changes he was given. I do understand why old Graves players are salty about it though. I also consider the juggernaut rework a huge success, with Darius being the clear winner, Morde a bit behind him, and then Garen and Skarner taking up the rear. I still consider Garen better than before; my only problem with new Garen is how his E damage early game is pathetically low for absolutely no reason. I also consider the new items as part of these class updates, and both the juggernaut and adc updates changed items in a very positive way. \n\nThe mage updates are a bit messier, but I'm generally positive about them. I like how Malzahar. Brand, Vlad, Cass, and Vel'koz turned out; Zyra seems more or less the same and I was a fan of all the smaller changes to some champs, such as Xerath's new ult, Zigg's W tower destruction, Annie's new Tibbers, and Anivia's new ult. \n\nThe assassin update is where I start to agree. 100% on board with Talon and Katarina who are both far better than they were before. The Leblanc and Rengar updates were both garbage, but so were their original designs. Akali got a lot more agency, but this just made her incredibly obnoxious to lane against as a melee champ, so I call that one neutral. \n\nThe tank updates were definitely the most questionable ones. I still think that no champion should have as much CC as Zac does, and I don't even understand what the point of the Maokai rework was. Sejuani got the worst of it though. The tank update was supposed to be about differentiating tanks, but not only did they fail at that, but they actually homogenized her while making her less fun to play. One of their stated goals was to distribute power more evenly across her kit rather than concentrating it in her ult. They just put all the power in E instead, and made it highly conditional power. How exactly is that better? To note, I consider her passive burst as part of her E given that she needs to proc E to get that damage. Sej's Q, W, and ult all had to lose power for that stupid E which isn't even satisfying to use.

If the enemy is smart enough to stand and trade with you, you definitely lose out on the trade no matter how well you landed and layered your cc. Also, tahm has more sustain vs harass.\nBraum - again, similar to tahm; either the enemy adc is forced to run away, or you severely lose the trade thanks to braum q slow and passive... not to mention his shield. Furthermore, braum has no NEED to win lane compared to leona's need to snowball.  Also, braum is arguably tankier. Finally, he has ranged harass via his q and ability to stack passive off that while leona has... none.\nKarma - similar level of damage to leona combo, none of the risk of that kind of engage.

Heals teammate too which gives them more sustain and means they have 0 pressure/need to win lane. Can screw up enemy engages easily via her q slow/heal and her silence which turns the engage back around on the aggressor.

Better sustain. Tankier level 6+. No need to play agro and get ahead; can just scale.\nBlitz - no need to put one's self at risk to engage; just bring enemy to you. This makes you far safer to enemy jg ganks and have less to worry about when considering an \"engage\".

Leona is the vision of a warrior, but her dueling is piss poor, and not just because of how her passive works. A complete lack of sustain, anti-tank damage, ranged farming, and a damage steroid make her a terrible 1v1 champ despite carrying around a sword that should be able to kill motherfuckers. I want Leona to be a team oriented fighter that can hold her own 1v1 instead of a tank that needs to be on her teams hip to do anything. Might seem impossible, but Riot has shown that it can be done multiple times already.\n\nI also would very much enjoy if Leona was reworked into the carry of bot lane instead of the support. Putting Leona bot as the \"adc\" with an AP support has already shown some promise in my testing and I would love for Leona to be the first tank botlane carry.
