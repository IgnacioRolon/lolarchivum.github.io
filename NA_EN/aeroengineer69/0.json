This single-handedly makes the game unplayable. I cannot move, use abilities, purchase objects, etc... I  tried several things because I had had issues with my right shift in the past (key stuck even not playing, due to fluid being spilled on the keyboard).\r\n\r\n* First, I deactivated the key using a program (sharpkeys). In fact, I deactivated BOTH shifts, and afterwards I changed the windows key to play the role of the now useless buttons. It works fine, just the same as the others before.\r\n* After that, I completely removed the shift key from the keybindings in the in-game menu, it does not appear even once now.\r\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, These approaches have not fixed my problem, I continue having the issue, which disappears for a while if I switch to desktop while playing. At first, it happened to me also while using my pc out of lol. But now it cant be replicated if I am not playing, so sharpkeys must have done its job, even if the game is still unaware of the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR Shift stuck in game, even with the key being useless after manual deactivation via third party program. Makes game unplayable, need help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-25T18:04:18.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some keys in league are reserved, and can't be disabled.  The best case for this would be to physically alter your keyboard, have it repaired, or replace it with another to make sure that's the cause of the issue.  I wouldn't recommend using any third parties as that could end up causing you more trouble.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
