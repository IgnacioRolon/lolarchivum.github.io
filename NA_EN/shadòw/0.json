I don't personally use the chat system to talk much, but I imagine for people who use it almost exclusively to chat with their friends, it helps keep the clutter down. In the old client, you'd just have a row of boxes on the bottom and you have to search through it to find who you want to talk to. And I'm not sure what happened if you had to many convos going, but it looks like it would just continue of the side of the client or into the infinite where you can't see it. With this new system, it's all centralized in one spot and you can just scroll through your convos.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-21T20:29:42.536+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Citrus,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=YHYBY8fi,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-21T19:19:41.595+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;ll take some getting used to, but I think it&#x27;s for the better.\n\nI wasn't sure about it either, but as I started to use it more I realized how much better it is. In my case it was a matter of getting used to the new UI, of course that is very personal and it doesn't have to be like that for everyone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SnakeG","date":"2016-10-21T20:13:33.949+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember back in the original client when you could popout chat windows?
