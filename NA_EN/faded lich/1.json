I don&#039;t expect many to anyone to read or care but I&#039;m doing it for the few that actually care and for myself as well. This will be my last year and last day playing league of legends. Although I had plans for 2016, this wasn&#039;t a spur of the moment choice as I&#039;ve been considering this possibility for a long time now. Honestly things have just gotten to hard to really deal with both in life and in terms of the direction this game has taken. It&#039;s no longer fun, I find no enjoyment out of it and any enjoyment I do have is generally found in conversing with friends and the good people of the boards while the game itself was merely a back drop.\r\n\r\nAdd in some life problems, one of the few people I care for dying along with just general depression and honestly I just don&#039;t feel like being here is the best thing for anyone at this point. So, as stated. This&#039;ll be my last year and last day. I&#039;ll miss you all although i suspect very few or anyone really will miss me. Not because anyone here is particularly, it&#039;s just simply the way of the internet honestly. To all of you that I&#039;m leaving behind, I hope the game gets better and that Riot remembers the roots they came from, I hope you all have a Merry Christmas or whatever holiday it is you might choose to celebrate and I mean that to everyone here..even the people I honestly just don&#039;t like.\r\n\r\nI know many of the post will be of &quot;See you next week&quot; and the like, along with some downvote spam so I don&#039;t expect this to really stay visible for long. But, just know. I&#039;ll miss you guys. From the few friends I had to the enemies, rivals and ants. But, this is the end in my case. So I wish you the best. Happy holidays.","replies":[]}
