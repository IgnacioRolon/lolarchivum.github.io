The jungler does not have *just one job.* Depending on both their pick and their opponent's pick they may have to look for ganks to get their lanes ahead, look for ganks to get *themselves* ahead, just farm up to carry themselves, hunt down and shutdown the enemy jungler, focus on controlling objectives like dragons and Rift Herald in the early game, ward the enemy jungle and the river to keep track of enemy movements, track the enemy jungler until they try and gank to set up counterganks, or just show up in lanes to provide enough pressure to force down a turret before the enemy can rotate to stop you.\n2. Assuming the jungler can affect lanes significantly (i.e they didn't pick jungle Tryndamere) they should be looking to reinforce a lane that isn't losing while the rest of the team tries to cut their losses and stabilise. Since solo queue is crap, that won't happen and they'll start feeding out of control while loudly crying that it's the jungler's fault for not stopping them from feeding.\n3. When *all 3* lanes lose the jungler is wasting his fucking time and should just wait for the /ff at 20. Seriously, there's no way THAT can be the jungler's fault unless they explicitly visit all 3 lanes and feed the opponents there.\n4. There is no \"average\".\n5. Ganking is looking for an opportunity and seizing it to secure an advantage. It may be as small as blowing an enemy laner's Flash or forcing them to recall, or it may be a kill. There's a lot more to it than just \"oh look, the enemy are far up the lane, I can walk in there and kill them\"- you have to know that you can *actually threaten the opponent-* for example, don't gank the enemy Illaoi top when she's level 6 with her ult up and your own top laner is still level 5 and on 20% HP with only enough mana for one skill unless you think she'd look really good with a double kill on her score.\n6. Giving the jungler a head-start on their level 1 jungle route. \"Leashing\" as the term originally meant no longer exists since Riot changed jungle monster aggro behavior. The only thing that is technically \"leashing\" now is kiting back to pull a dragon away from its spawn point in the dragon pit to prevent the enemy jungler from just Flashing or jumping over the back wall of the pit and Smiting it instantly. In pro games with lane swaps, the \"leashing\" may extend to \"double jungling\" to help give the top laner a headstart instead as well as make the jungler's first clear even easier, instead of throwing them into a 1v2 lane where they'd immediately get zoned out.\n7. Again, there is no \"average\". The jungler buys as many wards as they need, and probably a few more to be on the safe side, or else they're bad. *Everyone* should buy wards.\n8. Personally, no. I will pick up any stray CS that the laner isn't going to take, or if we have an opportunity to take the turret I'll kill minions to push our wave in faster, but I don't feel I'm \"owed\" a set payment for my efforts. If I ganked, it was because it was a smart thing to do, not for a paycheck.","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-07-04T18:32:28.506+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thank you for the effort in answering everything point by point, there was a catch though as you might have realized from the start, most of the answers to these questions were aimed at one and only one answer.\n\n**The jungler is part of the team.**\n\n1. The job of the jungler is to scale accordingly in order to take objectives just like anyone else on the team, there are many ways of scaling, the least effective is farming jungle. The jungler's role is map control, NOT carry, the support's role in other hand is vision control, there's differences between controlling the map and controlling vision of said map, you said it yourself, you need to track the enemy jungler and know where and when to strike, that's map control.\n2. A lost lane will affect everyone's outcome in the game because it increases your chances of loosing, for the jungler specifically a lost lane makes map control harder, the enemy has more area to roam and tracking anyone is harder, you'd rather avoid making your job harder so assist the loosing lane AFTER scaling up on another lane, timing is crucial though, if the enemy takes a second turret on the same lane you loose even more control.\n3. When all lanes loose it doesn't mean that the game is lost, in this case, the jungler must become a support type of champion since you can barely control the map anymore, vision is key now so ward intensively and steal objectives if possible. Afk farming jungle doesn't benefits anyone since it's the slowest way of gaining exp and gold, as a matter of fact, you're better off protecting a lane and ensuring that everyone reaches their quota of power while possibly taking some kills in the process. The jungler is NOT a carry position.\n4. This is something not all jungle main understands, in a lane you face off your opponent almost 100% of the time. The jungle is the most passive farming you can have in the game, you're all alone and all you need to worry about is possible invades, in lane you gotta farm, trade, ward, position and react to ganks accordingly, the quota of focus it takes to jungle is WAY lower, so I'd advice any and all jungler to use this clearance of mind in order to become experts at map control.\n5. Ganking is not a service, ganking is a mean to tip the balance towards your team, that said, yes, you're right in this one, you gotta know how and when to gank.\n6. While leashing has been removed per se, at the start of the game the side of the jungle you decide to start in WILL help you kill that first monster, this is not a service either, lanes do this in order to help the team as a whole, I couldn't care less if you die in the jungle but it affects MY game outcome so I help you. Take it as the \"gank\" from a laner to the jungle.\n7. Everyone should buy wards indeed, even though, the average jungler buys less wards than everyone else because their income is \"limited\" and while it is, map control benefits from vision, so... also, the support can't ward top side and deep jungles, the jungler has FREE roam so not warding there is simply negligence.\n8. Lane taxing is not that bad, again, the benefit of the whole team is paramount, if you spend more than 5 minutes on my lane and there hasn't been any benefits, I wouldn't mind leaving some minions to you, if you end up being way weaker than me, that means the chances of loosing this game increases, so yeah, take some, it's not a paycheck is allocation of resources, something only the support is expected to do apparently but it's benefits are huge.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nami in Bush","date":"2016-07-04T12:19:04.242+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I am standing at my tower and enemy jungler is sitting in the bottom lane bush for 4 consecutive minutes then I can complain to my trash jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2016-07-04T10:07:03.498+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A. you lost lane when you die when the other jungler ganks you because you don&amp;#039;t ward (wards aren&amp;#039;t optional in case you somehow > didn&amp;#039;t know)\n\n**Even with good ward placement, some junglers will still successfully gank your lane - people get caught and die - it happens to the very best of us.

It gets a lot murkier once you really consider how the different roles all interact though.  Maybe their jungle makes a really good play to get the enemy mid ahead early.  This mid then presses up mid (a rather safe lane to do so in), and ganks top.

They especially don't owe you as many ganks as the enemy jungler. If the enemy jungler ganks a lot, that probly means the circumstances were right for him, which almost always mean the circumstances were bad for your own jungler, because you were pushing, etc., and that he was right to not gank you.

His one job is to babysit the lanes and provide map control as this is the role with the greatest flexibility and map influence over the course of the game.\n\nIf a jungler ganks your laner and that laner dies and all your jg did was farm in this time frame, guess what. Its you JGs fault for making a strategic misplay. He should have either been prepared to countergank or have ganked another lane at the exact same time to force an objective trade.\n\nA laner who plays aggressively and always pushes, well, that's his own damn fault for making a tactical misplay. However, a good jungler recognizes this and is prepared to correct his laner's mistakes the instant the opposing team tries to punish him for it. A jungler who is unprepared to do this makes a strategic misplay.\n\nIf a jungler fails a gank because the laner lacked CC its the fault of both parties for failing the gank and making a tactical misplay. It could also be the laners fault for making a strategic misplay in champion select, but both players are at fault here.\n\nIf you have a laner who outright feeds his lane and dies non stop, you, as a jungler, made a strategic misplay in allowing him to feed uncontrollably without accomplishing anything else on the map. Either be aware of what the matchup is and why it is going south for that laner and be in a position to reset his lane after his first death or accomplish taking an objective somewhere else so that his poor play is less meaningful in a strategic sense. Again, fault is on both parties, but particularly the jungler for failing to be aware of the game state in a role that prioritized being aware of the game state.\n\nA laner who throws away a lead after he was gifted one by the jungler has no one to blame but himself. This is the only correct portion of your OP so far. Laners, don't piss away leads you are gifted by a talented JG.\n\n1v1 losses happen in lanes that get countered more often than anything. A good jg knows what the matchups are and which lanes require the most help the soonest. A jungler who allows a lane that is countered to suffer and does nothing to impact that lane in the first 5 minutes to 10 minutes of the game is a bad jungler who consistently makes strategic misplays and costs his teams games.\n\nYou seeing the big picture yet? You see the common theme in all this?\n\nIt's a team game that requires teamwork and guess who the most influential team member in a game is and has been for 6 straight seasons... Yah, you guessed it. The jungler. He has the most map influence and the greatest flexibility and needs to be aware of who to help when, why, where, and how. Bad junglers use the reasons you give as a crutch for their poor strategic choices. You should not reinforce the idea that this crutch is a good thing, jungling is already the most complicated and difficult role to play in the game without you offering very poor and fundamentally unsound advice.\n\nNo, its not the junglers fault for every last little thing. But it is the junglers fault for basically everything that happens in a game because he is the person who controls the pace of the game by default. Learn to jungle properly, learn to control the map properly, learn to make the proper strategic decisions, and learn to understand the matchups of your laners properly so that you are better able to make good strategic decisions.\n\nEdit: Additionally, watch any high level player play jungle who is a jungle main. We will all do the same exact thing, we will all tell you the exact same thing. Gank, non stop, 24/7. That's how you are supposed to do it. Get your laners a lead so they are free in a strategic sense to apply their advantages elsewhere on the map. That is jungling in high elo 101. And yet you say its the wrong mindset... No. What you present as your argument is the wrong mindset. 100% of high level junglers will all say the same thing as I have said here. 100%. We all will say it. Because that's how to play the role in a fundamentally sound fashion. Pay attention to the map, go help the lanes, get them a lead, and then focus on controlling the map.","replies":[]}]}
