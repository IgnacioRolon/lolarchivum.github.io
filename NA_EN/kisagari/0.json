But her w.. it&#039;s just been gutted. Having grievous wounds was what actually made her strong. Mundo, no problem. Draven stacking lifesteal, got it, now.. okay we get stacking magic damage that scales with ad. Okay.. not all bad and the active gives us attack speed and activates strut. But the fact that our ult does damage based on AP and then how many stacks we have on them from w means it does ass for damage unless we&#039;re fed. I mean cant it at least have a little ad scaling so we do physical damage as an adc. And the e.. make it rain.. also only has ap scaling. It&#039;s an aoe slow.. cool. As an adc that doesn&#039;t really do much. I mean atleast Graves gets a smoke screen that slows AND blinds those inside it. Plus he has a dash on top of the slow. Couldn&#039;t her e be a bit more fitting for someone like her. Reading the lore and seeing Gangplanks ult with the deaths daughter upgrade gave me a thought. What if instead of just this slow she takes both guns and shoots the ground in an aoe circle that causes those walking on the terrain to be slowed for 1.2 to 2 seconds scaling with level and it could apply between 1 and 3 stacks of her w depending on how close the enemy is to the center of the ability. It&#039;s just a thought but I&#039;d love to see her come back into the spotlight again atleast somewhat.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-31T08:20:12.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually what I think she needs is her E to not have a cast time so you don't stop doing it, and her ult should do more damage, I mean, if you compare it to other zone control aoe damage ults like Rumble's, Oriana's, Zigg's and even Viktor's, her ult is really  bad and frustrating because it is not rewarding at all even you manage to do a perfect one, it does not do enough damage, if Rumble's gets the team or someone with a nice ult it will shred everyone, I'm not saying MF ult should be extremely buff, but give it a bit more damage so it would be more rewarding and worth the risk.","replies":[]}]}
