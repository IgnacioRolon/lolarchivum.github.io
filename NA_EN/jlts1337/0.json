First, ensure your [display resolution](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4910-screen-resolution-display-change-windows-10-a.html) is set to your *native resolution* by making sure it's set to what Windows recommends. Next, log into League, then hop into your League installation directory (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and **delete** the folder named **CONFIG**. After you've deleted that folder, hop into a custom match to confirm this has gone through.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.\n\nP.S.
