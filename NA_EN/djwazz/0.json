I mean, I played a lot with some friends. Got S a few times with several champions which got a yellow frame. Which means that I didn't earn any chest with those. I checked if I had any chest available, and I've got three or four. Yet still I cannot get any chest, and I have a key and another couple of key fragments at the moment and I'm quite pissed off cause it's been a while since I received my last chest\r\nAnd I've also got some decent stats as well as my team, yet I've no chest still. Can you please fix this? I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. It'd be nice if you guys'll do something about this. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-06T17:38:20.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are quite a few requirements needed to earn a chest.  For example, you need to own the champion and get at least an S in your match.  If someone else on your team earns an S, they need to be in your premade team.  You need to not have already earned a chest for that champion this season as well.  More info is also available at our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.  There isn't necessarily anything that needs fixing, but just a set of requirements that must be met.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"DjWaZz","date":"2017-04-06T18:21:30.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know all the requirements..but the fact is that even if i meet all the requirements, i still don't get any hextech chest..

I'm not seeing any issues here that would prevent you from earning them.  If you need anymore context on the chests you've received, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can go over that with you individually.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"DjWaZz","date":"2017-04-06T18:59:50.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you..","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
