I'd like to think that punishments for toxicity are given out based off of overwhelming reports of harassment and things like that. If someone ends up getting reported 10-12 times in a day, I think it's fair to say getting reported that often is enough evidence to render a verdict. I honestly think Voice Chat won't be used as much as people seem to think. Look at fairly popular games like COD on Xbox Live or PSN, Usually, you get 1-3 people with mics out of 12 people in the lobby, That's fairly low considering Consoles typically come with a free headset/mic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrryZ","date":"2017-05-30T20:45:59.200+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I think it will help lower toxicity.\n\nNo.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zeskgames","date":"2017-05-30T19:02:39.971+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"This all looks fun-tastic, but coming from my COD days, I'm a little nervous about the voice chat (those were dark times).","replies":[{"poster":"Syve","date":"2017-05-30T19:07:07.736+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I believe you will be able to disable it.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-05-30T19:14:33.450+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"How are you going to be able to disable it without completely shooting yourself in the foot?
