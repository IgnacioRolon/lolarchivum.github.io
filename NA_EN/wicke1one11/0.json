(Non-comcast user)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys, I know there's already a bunch of threads on this, but I can't log in for some reason! Everytime I do it immediately says cannot connect to server, retries the three times, then errors out on me. It started roughly around 2 last night (Client froze after I finished a game and was forced to close out), and started that afterwards. Now, I read that a lot of comcast users were having issues, but I don't have comcast, I have a local internet provider called Charter.\r\n\r\nNow the really wierd thing? On my laptops connected to the wifi, I can connect and get into the server, but not on my computer directly plugged into the router.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed everytime I boot up league it now causes my entire computer to lag some as if it's loading a lot at once or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Wicke1One11","date":"2016-10-11T23:01:52.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I just had to set my internet explorer to a Lan proxy and now it works! If anyone else runs into this problem, just go to internet settings in you IE, connections, then Lan Settings and click the button for allow proxy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T20:29:29.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something might be blocking your network from reaching the login server.  I appreciate the troubleshooting you've done so far, which makes me thing that there might be some setting enabled that's blocking the connection.  To rule out any network possibilities, though, I suggest going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for the fix.  Specifically when you get to the part about firewall settings, download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically configure it.  Hopefully, that will do the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"Wicke1One11","date":"2016-10-11T22:39:00.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I just tested my firewall and even when turning both the main computer, as well as the antivirus one off, league still couldn't connect.\n\nI did find out, however, that oddly enough my internet explorer can't connect to the internet either, despite both Chrome and Firefox being able to do so. Would that be affecting it at all?\n\nEDIT : Even wierder, I went to update java, but it is telling me it cannot update with my current internet settings...I'm so confused, other games connect online fine, and I'm clearly able to browse the internet, plus download things/use youtube/etc.","replies":[]}]}]}
