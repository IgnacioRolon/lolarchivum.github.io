I agree the intent is only viable to a certain point. \nHowever you also have to make the disctinction that smurfs that like I said are doing it for a challenge, will quickly climb back up to their original rank or even higher than their main account.\nI'm not talking about smurfs like NB3 who smurf in plat or whatnot to noob stomp. Obviously if someone would do that, I'd agree with you.\nI'm simply talking about the smurfs that are doing it to rank up again and/or test themselves. Sure they will noob stomp while getting to a certain level, but trust me if someone is good it will take them no time and very little games.\n\nSure, they can most definitely ruin games of the \"newbies\" getting there, so I do see your point. But the impact is minimal compared to smurfs who smurf in lower divisions to noob stomp. There is a difference.\n\nAnd to be honest, resetting an account by starting fresh does actually work. \nMaybe it's just a psychological effect but when I made a new account I found i could climb and win more games once I reached the same elo on my initial account.\nThis was ages ago by the way, but I had an account stuck around low Plat.\nMade a fresh account and climbed all the way to Plat 1-2 in very little time and with less effort. Weird huh? I can't explain it either. \nBut it's true, it happened and shortly after I hit Diamond.\nStarting fresh somehow helps if you've ruined your MMR and/or winrate in the past.\n\nEven if you focus on the lower leagues, if you were Silver in Season 5 for example, you would very likely be placed in Bronze in Season 6 after your placement games depending on how many you win and lose.\nIf you however made a new account, chances are you are placed in Silver or maybe even Gold from the start, making it easier to climb from the get-go. \nAnd it's the same if you were in Gold placed in Silver, etc. See what I mean?\n\n5. Fair I apologise for assuming or interpreting your words the wrong way in more than one occasion. I'm sorry for that.\nBut to be honest I still stand by my reasons and see them as valid. It's just a difference in opinion, you may not accept it but you cannot say they are not valid. Because the same way they are not valid for yourself, they are valid for many other players like myself. Just opinions, both are fair. Agree to disagree.\n\n6. My bad there but you mentioned cheating and followed that up saying that a Smurf would get his friends to a higher rank and watch them be deranked after they stop playing together. So you were talking about Ranked weren't you?\nAnd if you were talking Normals, that wouldn't be cheating anyway since I could be playing on my high elo account with a bronze in a normal and \"noob stomp\" the other bronze and silvers I am matched against anyway. So I don't really see your point regarding this issue (though I do understand what you mean by \"cheating\" in normals as well. I understand it, I just don't see it as such though sorry because of what I explained in the previous sentence).\n\nI might have left something out or forgot to address some things you said as I'm posting on this thread instead but feel free to bring something up if I \"ignored\" it.","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2016-09-07T03:14:24.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've reduced that first point to the debate between intentions vs actions, which is its own base concept.\nAlthough we both appear inclined towards intention, you appear farther in that direction than I. That, and you probably have a more optimistic outlook on people and their intentions than I do in the first place.\n\nI won't argue with placebo. 'Tis a thing.\n\nThe \"boosting\" effect I mentioned was on the friends' mmr and elo, not rank.\nSo they'd end up against people better than them, and have a losing streak when they played without you.\n\nIf you party up with your low elo friend on your real account, matchmaking has a chance to balance the team's by giving the opponents a high elo person to match you. Therefore, that's not cheating or any such notion.\n If you play with your friend on a smurf account you kept at his/her mmr/elo, matchmaking can't account for you, thus you cause unbalanced teams. You've given your team an advantage, which comes with the premise if unfairness\n\nSome games actually forbid and prevent people from grouping up if their elo/mmr/rank is too far apart. Not sure how I feel about that, because it blocks some friends from playing together.\n\nAs for stuff you didn't respond to......:\nI'd say we settled the point of reacquiring stuff....\nYou didn't respond to my notion of being gone too long to jump in where you left off, but that's sorta outside the debate and presumably not in disagreement with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2016-09-08T18:18:44.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah. Yeah I'm not disagreeing with you on being gone long, etc. Makes pefect sense.\n\nAh I see, yeah that's true I guess, but normal MMR doesn't increase/decrease like a ranked MMR. \nThe impact I'd have on their MMR would be minimal (I think, obviously don't know for sure).\n\nAnd I guess I obviously understand your stance on not having the game accounting for me if I'm on a lower rank. That's true.\nBut I do try my best to just have fun when playing with my lower elo friends, I just not put as much effort, and focus more on trying to take big risks, etc.\nI guess like you said in your previous reply, not everyone is able to do it once the game starts (and surely not even I am able to do it every single game ofc), but I try.\n\nI mean, at the end of the day, you find better players than yourself in almost every game, whether he's a smurf or not, he's better than you (general speaking btw, not YOU specifically), and he's effectively noob stomping. \nJust because their rank doesn't show them as higher than you, they might already be skill wise?\nA future Gold player ranking up through bronze and silver, is effectively the same as a gold player going back down on a new account to rank up again. I see no difference there.\n\nSo to me, unless you are smurfing in a particular elo to \"noob stomp\" smurfing to level up is a thing that passes by, it's no where near the same level of what a noob stomper does.\n\nAnd yeah some games do that, but like you said you might be blocked from playing with friends depending on the difference in level.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-09-06T18:29:48.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres lots of reasons.\n\nSome want to play with legitimately new friends and don't want to have their main accounts MMR result in completely unfair matches for their new friend. If they exclusively play with their new friend(s) then their new account(s) won't get particularly high MMRs. (Plus they don't always try very hard to win, it's more they won't feed and will only get fed enough to ensure they can pull their friend out of a bad spot as they focus on their friends laning/csing/etc instead of really paying attention to their own game.)\n\nPlaying things other than their main can be super tricky, as many people play their main/role champ at a much higher level than champs/roles they're learning early on. Diving into a role you haven't played since you were bronze when you're matched with plat/diamonds is going to be an ugly stomp. And even if you get stomped enough to drop your mmr down to a level you can play your off-role at, then it turns into a stomp when you do play your main role.\n\nSome people insist ELO hell exists, and occasionally more experienced people want to confirm that that's just a thing bronze level players say due to denial. So higher ranking players make new accounts, intentionally get placed bronze, and then climb out. Similarly theres lots of bronze->diamond video series that youtubers will do, generally taking less than a month.\n\nOthers still like to do hard main accounts, where they only play 1 champion and that it. If that champs main role is taken, then they'll still use it in unconventional roles, so you might e.g. have janna adc.\n\nSome people do just want to stomp new players. Their accounts will get high mmr's relatively quickly, but then they'll just make another one.\n\nHaving secondary account(s) to keep private can also be appealing to some people who may want to just play on their own without a bunch of their friends bugging them to play. They might legitimately be friends, but sometimes people aren't in the mood but don't want to hurt feelings. This is also relevant for internet personalities who might have a certain persona they prefer to maintain officially, but might conduct themselves a bit differently when just doing their own thing.\n\nTheres also aram only accounts, where they'll only buy champs that are strong in ARAM in order to bias their chances of getting relatively OP aram champs.\n\nI'm sure theres more reasons I can't think of right now, but theres certainly some legitimate reasons why people would want multiple accounts that aren't at the expense of others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-09-06T17:45:21.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people want to experience a \"different environment\" as they play, even if all of their accounts are in the same elo.\n\nBecause of how easily people can look up names or even judge how a person plays based on their IGNs, having multiple accounts and different names can create very different environments.\n\nSo for example, if I'm playing Lulu support on a fresh new account that has a super generic IGN no one would suspect that I'm a diehard Lulu support main that actually has a good deal of experience (but not skills), as compared to playing on my main which has *all* of my ~~get carried~~ supporting records in the past 3 years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-09-04T20:48:00.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two accounts, one in plat and one in silver so I can play with my friends.
