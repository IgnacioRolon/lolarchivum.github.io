(His Passive)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":":: From Wiki ::\n\t\nEvery Moment Matters: Jhin&#039;s  Critical strike icon.png critical strikes grant him 10% (+ 4% per 10% bonus attack speed) bonus movement speed for 2 seconds, but his total critical damage is reduced by 25%.\n\nAdditionally, he gains 2% - 40% (based on level) (+ 4% per 10% critical strike chance) (+ 2.5% per 10% bonus attack speed) AD as bonus attack damage.\n::\n\nBetween that and Google I&#039;ve found conflicting information.\nI&#039;m trying to compare the AD effectiveness of building AD vs AS &amp; Crit-Chance. Obviously Straightforward AD will give more AD and a good build will have both options, but I&#039;d like to know just how well the passive&#039;s scaling works.\n\nSome pages/posts have said his final AD is\n{Base + Bonus} + [Level Scaling] PLUS (40%Crit-Chance) PLUS (25%AS).\nOther pages/posts said his final AD is\n{Base + Bonus} + [Level Scaling] MULTIPLIED BY (40%Crit-Chance) MULTIPLIED BY (25%AS).\n\nThose are very different equations with rather different results.\nSo, which of those is accurate? (Or if neither is that how does it work?)\nAnd ultimately how effective us building AS and Crit-Chance over AD on Jhin?\n\nEdit::\n\nOh wait, I just noticed the source of the confusion. The author of the Wiki Page put the \"+\" signs inside the parenthesis.\nHe/She was using parenthesis as a function of grammar, but some people, myself included, read them as a function of math.\n\nThe Wiki page says \n\"Additionally, he gains 2% - 40% (based on level) (+ 4% per 10% critical strike chance) (+ 2.5% per 10% bonus attack speed) AD as bonus attack damage.\"\nWhen it should say\n\"Additionally, he gains 2% - 40% (based on level) + (4% per 10% critical strike chance) + (2.5% per 10% bonus attack speed) AD as bonus attack damage.\"\n\nSo those numbers are _not_ multiplied by each-other, they are added.\n\nSomebody correct me if I'm wrong in my interpretation of the typo, although \nI deem the alternative option that the \"+\" signs weren't supposed to be there at all much less likely.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Zudane","date":"2016-08-12T07:48:32.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would love to know the answer to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2016-08-13T04:34:13.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi person.

I wouldn't have seen it otherwise.\n\nI think the Wiki copies from the game, and I've wondered if it was additive or multiplicative before and never felt comfortable with a build on him knowing for sure (was it worth losing a little AD to gain the Crit or Speed bonus or not).  But nice to know!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2016-08-13T04:33:01.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wait, I just noticed the source of the confusion.
