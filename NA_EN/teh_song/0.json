I have been walking in the Paragon jungle to randomly encounter bots that were doing their own thing in there, and I&#039;ve had bots come in to get me when I was near an entrance/objective (bot not visible from lane), implying that they had a ward there so they knew I was there to be attacked.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s actually kind of funny when I play too many bot matches in LoL then play one in Paragon, because I&#039;ll actually forget bots go in jungle and they&#039;ll catch and kill me when I&#039;m at low health from fighting jungle camps.\r\n\r\nNot only has Paragon proven it&#039;s possible to have bots use the jungle, but given the differences between the games I have to imagine Paragon is harder to code than LoL.\r\n\r\nTime to get your bots jungling Riot.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who might say to me &quot;then go play Paragon&quot;: I do. I play both games. LoL is isometric whereas Paragon is third-person, which alone makes them very different games, so I play them both at different times based on what I want.","replies":[{"poster":"LordofEntropy","date":"2016-12-04T22:22:07.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course it's possible, it always has been. It's just a matter of allocating the resources to do so. PvE has never been a priority for Riot, minimal effort has ever been put in over the years into PvE whatsoever. It's pretty unlikely they'll ever do so, especially given that giving the ability to jungle isn't trivial, but is completely possible, it would take significant thought and hours and Riot isn't going to spend that kind of effort on PvE. I mean the tutorial still has Ashe building Thornmail.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2016-12-04T22:12:31.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it's less about making bots jungle than making them be actually good junglers. They would need to make sure that jungle bots not constantly die to jungle monsters, not have them back as often and not have extremely predictable paths that anyone can take advantage of. Until the actual bots stop being braindead morons they can't really program jungle bots since then they will be walking bags of gold waiting to be farmed by anyone on your team","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-04T20:52:43.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot could easily implement jungle bots, but they would not be good enough to provide any more of a challenge than bots do already (ie, none).\n\nNot enough people play bots for it to be a priority, and the ones that do mostly dont care.","replies":[{"poster":"Im a Brush","date":"2016-12-04T21:45:05.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they gave intermediate bots keystone masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"G4LLOWSC4L1BR4TR","date":"2016-12-04T21:49:10.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's probably extremely easy in comparison to doing entirely new behaviors. I've only done a bit of coding myself, but given that they already had them using summoner spells, just adding masteries onto their stat blocks would probably only take one or two programmers a couple of days, a little longer if they also trained them to use them with any efficacy (I don't know if they altered the bots behavior to use masteries properly or not).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
