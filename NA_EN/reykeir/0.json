Before i was even mastery 5 with Jinx, there was a time that i got 3 S grades in a row from KDA ratios that aren't getting me anywhere anymore. Before i was even mastery 5 with Jinx, i  had a game that gave me an  S+ from 5-0-11. Now that im mastery 6 and only need 2 more S classes to get to mastery 7, the S grades seem impossible to get. Even with a perfect game having 0 deaths. Was there an intentional change in mastery requirements Riot? My last game was 9-0-7 with 173 CS and it wasn't even close to an S. No! it was a f*****g B+! So someone please tell me how the hell the grading system works?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-01T03:49:15.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just it though, mastery scores don't have any set requirements. They work as a percentile and getting a S+ means you performed in the top percentage of players using the same champ in the same role. Playing Jinx mid would, therefore, be scored differently than Jinx bot. \n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/0925766924a811f9df8995f51de76fb7.png","replies":[]}]}
