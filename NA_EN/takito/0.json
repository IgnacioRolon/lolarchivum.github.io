It's been a little over a year since his launch skin, which means he could definitely use a new skin. We keep track of last release dates of skins and keep them in mind when we're deciding on what's coming down the pipeline in terms of new skins. \n\nTo speak to some of the other champions/skins you've mentioned - they received skins because we felt they fit in well with the thematics we created. For example, Championship Kalista was an easy pick because she was a pretty impactful champion this season. While Ekko was a newer champion, we thought his personality and model leant itself to a cool school-themed skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Takito","date":"2015-10-21T22:24:27.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\n\nDear new pref rioter ever,\n\nI know that, i just wanted some love for Azir :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smelp","date":"2015-10-14T22:19:50.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have them both, they don't do anything special for me, just another eh skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smelp","date":"2015-10-14T22:07:23.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree on Azir, but karthus has 1 crappy legacy skin, a skin from winning worlds, and 3 boring skins for a champion with so much skin potential","replies":[{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2015-10-14T22:08:38.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This guy doesn't like Pentakill Karthus and Grim Reaper\n>PENTAKILL\n>KARTHUS\n\nDo you even TOWERDIVAAAAAAAAAAAH, bro?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Takito","date":"2015-10-16T02:33:46.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takito","date":"2015-10-15T15:57:12.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takito","date":"2015-10-15T01:41:19.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"May i add a little bump? :)","replies":[]}]}
