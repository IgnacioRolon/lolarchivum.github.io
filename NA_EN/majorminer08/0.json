I like playing mages also and sometimes ADC. The champs I have in the 4800 ip group our Orianna,MF,Lee Sin,Wukong,Vladmir,Talon,Nocturn,Malz,Kennen,Fizz and Ezreal. I don't mind jungling either.\n\nI'm looking for a champ that is fun to play not op. I am thinking of buying Brand,Cassiopeia or caitlyn (maybe vayne).
