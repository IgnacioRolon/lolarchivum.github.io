Please help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! I need some help! I was playing League totally fine Monday night and such, but the next morning my PC was acting all funky. Whatever. Turned it in to a friend and he fixed it (something wrong with a RAM stick, I believe). Anyway, when I got it back from him, my League client repeatedly sends me these messages when I attempt to log in....I have tried every mentioned method out there to fix this. Coding, deleting cache and history, adjusting Internet settings. Nothing works. I even uninstalled/reinstalled League, but to no avail. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2016-02-19T01:49:44.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NJDUNKIN1, \n\nIf you have tried repairing and your client still isn't working, I think it's time for you to have Riot's tech team look into the matter for you. Don't need anything else messed up :) https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThat will get you where you need to go\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"njdunkin1","date":"2016-02-19T03:34:13.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good man, I filed a help ticket a few hours ago.
