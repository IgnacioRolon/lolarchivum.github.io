Oftentimes, they will not show you who did the most damage to you. For example, if minions did 200 to you, Alistar did the 200 that killed you, Leona did 300 and Vayne did 1400, it would show you minions, Alistar and Leona in the 3 spaces in your death recap. No mention of Vayne. It WILL say you lost X amount of life in Y amount of seconds, and that number's correct. But as far as the reflections of damage you took, it often leaves out what did the most damage to you, if you have more than 3 sources of damage upon your death. It always has your killer correct. But if the person that did the most damage to you wasn't your killer, then odds are, they aren't there. This has happened to me dozens of times over the past few weeks, and I don't think it's been ever present in the game. I'm sure it wasn't always like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Gourmet Tea","date":"2014-12-07T20:33:37.528+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"The death recaps in my knowledge have never been correct.

I remember reading a similar topic to this one, and it brought quite a lot of evidence to show how messed up the death recaps are.\n\nTruth is, I'm afraid that people don't entirely care that much about the death recaps. If we were to raise awareness (not like a facebook post about breast cancer awareness, I mean actually bringing more discussions like these online) then we could get Riot to change how it's calculated and there could be a fix for it.\n\nRight now, though, preseason is pretty hectic for them, and we're probably not going to see progress for a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-12-08T23:26:56.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for this report.\n\nWe are aware that often death recap does not give all the desired information (and sometimes incorrect information).
