PEOPLE PICK YUUMI ON THE DAY OF FUCKING RELEASE, AS THEIR FIRST FUCKING GAME, IN THE FUCKING RANKED QUEUE, THAT'S MADE FOR FUCKING CLIMBING A FUCKING LADDER, FUCK. WHY IS SHE STILL BEING PLAYED IN RANKED, WITH A SUB 40% WINRATE? WHO KNOWS.. CAUSE FUCK IT\r\n\r\n\r\n_**I am not suggesting that match making is by any means UNFAIR**_\r\n\r\nthe ladder system does the best it can right now, and it's a really fair system over 100~ games, if you improve, you will climb, (depending on how much you improve, and how much impact you choose to have on the game)  and anybody who decides to main a few champions and learn the game will climb.\r\n\r\n\r\nbut for the love of fucking god, how frustrating is it to get into promo's and have your top laner pick the flavor of the week meta pick that they've never played before, and you're not even allowed to complain, because UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO FLAME OUR TEAM MATES, FOR FIRST TIMING SOMETHING IN **_RANKED_**, OR WE'LL GET BANNED, SO WE HAVE TO BOTTLE UP OUR EMOTIONS, UNTIL THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS JUST FUCKING TOXIC, SOFT INTING HERE, TROLL PICK THERE, LITTLE FLAME HERE, (not enough to get banned) PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE, DONE WITH LEAGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Solution would be to make it so you need mastery 7 or 10k points on a champion to play them in ranked.. but then we wouldn't see champs like yuumi until 3 weeks after release in ranked :( sad day. we wouldn't get the joy of being trolled by players who don't know how to play a champion that has a 29% win rate in plat.\r\n\r\nI see people blame the matchmaking, but the real problem is the players fucking it up with their 40+ champions in ranked, and having your top 2 champions be zed and lee sin with 19 games max...  or having your most played champion only have 10 games..\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like if riot actually cared about improving the ranked match making, or the ranked experience, they wouldn't let people just first time champions in ranked\r\n\r\n\r\nand I know I'm excluding legitimately over 70% of the community, cause I god damn well know almost everyone below platinum for some god forsaken reason has played 30+ champions this season\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a one trick myself, I don't really want to have to play 10 games on 20 champions, just to be able to play ranked, since I only play one champion.\r\n\r\nbut you know what? it's **_RANKED_** for a reason, If I have to sacrifice a bunch of time in normal's, then so be it, this mode is supposed to be serious, you aren't supposed to see new champions played on the first day by players who don't have a PBE account, you aren't supposed to see 40+ champions on one account in ranked, and their most played champ only have 20 games.. because this just fucks the match making\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know riot won't be implementing shit like this any time soon, so as a final statement I just want to say\r\n\r\nRanked is not a place for you to _practice_ your champion, it is a place for you to** perfect** your champion.\r\nthere is LP on the line, do not come into ranked with your 49% winrate over 300 games having ass, and play a champion you've never played before or only have 3 games on.\r\n\r\nif we want 100% as close to fair match making as possible, we have to hold our community to a standard, and I'm willing to have to get level w/e on 20 champions before I can enter ranked if it means everyone can take ranked seriously and enjoy the fairness\r\n\r\nanother way to get more fair match making would be to get rid of auto fill... which a lot of people do want","replies":[{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-05-23T14:02:59.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you truly know how match making works for League?\n\nbecause it sounds like you don't\n\nop.gg is not 100% accurate\n\nsee League has a double system for match making in ranked\n\nthe base system that all matches (save but co-op vs ai) use, and the hidden mmr system\n\nthe hidden mmr system is what actually matches you up, the base system is there just to run the process\n\nI *think* it works similarly to how Hi-Rez does Smite's ranked match making\n\n1) Queue up for a match\n2) System will search for players in your mmr bracket, with minor variance [1-2 rank difference tops on each end; i.e. Gold 2 can see Gold 4 and Plat 4 at the most]\n3) X amount of time passes without finding enough people for said match\n4) System broadens search range, allowing for greater difference in mmr [Now that Gold 2 can see  High/Mid Silver players and High Plat/Low Diamond players]\n5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until match is found\n\nhonestly I feel that what you are requiring is too minimal to play in ranked\n\nI would rather it be any champion needs to have a Mastery Rank of 4 or higher to be played in a ranked game, MR 3 or lower can't be played (greyed out as if they were banned) and you actually have to own the champion","replies":[]}]}
