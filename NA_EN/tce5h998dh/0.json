I was super toxic, this was quite awhile ago so if it's a no. I get it. I mean we are talking 3,4, maybe 5 years ago now? I've since have had a kid, gotten married. And I wish I could say so many whimsical things to win you over. But the fact is, I failed to uphold my part of the ToS. So if it's a no, it's no harm. I just have been kinda wanting to play again. Been trying it out on my brothers account because I don't really have the time to level to 30 anymore with the kid and all, and I had quite a bit of money tied into that account.\n\nSo if it's any possibility to blow into this candle and make a wish on my 32nd birthday and it come true. That'd be pretty neat, if not. Again I get it. Most wishes don't work anyways, right?\n\nDid a 32 year old really just use his wish for a video game? My god.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T02:37:33.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah man, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we can't lift bans like this for birthdays =( .

I'll make sure to refrain from further using it. Not that I have in the past few days anyways. And it's no hard feelings you aren't bearing any bad news. It's pretty much what I expected the result to be. Not a big deal.\n\nI appreciate the offer you have given me, and don't take it as I don't appreciate it. But honestly if I cant' get the old account back no reason for you to delve into making something work for me. If I had to repurchase runes, champions, and all that jazz all over again I'd rather just devote that into something else.\n\nI appreciate the help, and the response though.\nBest wishes.","replies":[]}]}]}
