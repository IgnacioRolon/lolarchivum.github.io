That seems to be what is said.  \n\nMost people btw understand a troll vs a \"bad game\".  0-10 at 8 min mark with no masteries is not a bad game.  Going duo mid because you didn't get it when you queued in lane is \"not a bad game\".  1 cs mid Sona 0-8 at 10 min is not a bad game.  All these things happen, people laugh when you ask your team to report them \"nothing will happen to me\".  Team may or may not report, we don't know because don't see it.  \n\nThere is NO FEAR OF BEING BANNED to the trolls so they continue is the point.

Or in fact, a handful of bad games. I mean, if you're talking 0-20-0, that's one thing. But 1-8-3, won't send up red flags, though it will give you rage.\n\nAs I said, even though it always gets the down vote rage, the automated system only seems to bad for racist/rage remarks.
