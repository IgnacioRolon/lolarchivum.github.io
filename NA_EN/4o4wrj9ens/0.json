Read below: \r\nWith the issues with Camille, Rengar, and leathality right now, why is Corki getting nerfed? While Corki is a AD caster, he doesnt use leathality. Mid he has a win rate of 53% and is 10th in win rate. Bot Corki is at 50% and is #10 in win rate. To me when i see corki&#039;s stats on champion.gg I see a mostly balanced champ.\r\n\r\n&quot;IMO even a slight nerf will put corki into the 20s in win rate. Worst part is when i look at the context link on the PBE, and i go thru Medler&#039;s posts i do not see any reasoning for the Corki nerfs.\r\n\r\nHere is the nerf in question:\r\n\r\nMissile Barrage (R):\r\nBase damage lowered from 100/130/160 to 60/80/100.\r\nAP scaling on missiles lowered from 30% to 18%\r\nTotal AD scaling on missiles lowered from 20/60/100% to 10/35/60%.\r\nBig One damage increased from 50% to 150% increased damage.\r\n\r\nI mean why is Corki getting a 50% damage nerf on his Ult? Missile Barrage is a ultimate skill, these skills are suppose to be strong. This gutting makes Corki&#039;s ult just another useless skill that he uses repeatedly to clear waves. IMO Corki using R to clear waves is the behavior RIot should be trying to STOP. I can only guess this is the behavior issue Riot has, since i can not see any reason why Corki should be nerfed. For example I have never seen any LCS games where Corki snowballed into a overpowered state, and carried the game.\r\n\r\nIMO if riot really wanted to fix the using R to wave clear behavior, they should just raise his mana costs on r. The fact they didnt first touch his mana costs shows who ever did this doesent really play Corki enough.\r\n\r\nIMO this is a gutting and a reprisal. I bet some rioter fought a corki and got poked to hell because he never bought mr and decided &quot;this is too stronk&quot;..... Corki does mostly magic damage, thats why he is a ADC that wears sorc shoes. &quot;","replies":[{"poster":"4o4wRJ9eNS","date":"2017-06-09T00:47:29.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What country do you live in?

It was patch 7.4, and that one went live back in February.\nIt was also quite warranted that they nerfed him, he had a quite high winrate in Solo-Q whilst also beeing one of the most played midlaners in Pro-Play.\n\nIt was a bit of an overnerf though, and he actually has some buffs that are getting tested on the PBE right now.\n\n \n>    Base attack increased from 56 to 60\n> \n>     Base attack speed increased from 0.625 to 0.638\n> \n>     Hextech Shrapnel Shells (Passive) % of basic attacks converted to magic damage increased from 50% to 75%\n\nAs with all PBE-content subject to change of course. But Riot atleast seems to acknowledge that he is too weak right now and are looking to give him some power back..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-06-04T21:37:07.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Apparently, there was a Rioter that got owned by Corki - therefore the state of this \"champion\" now haha\n\nYou want to post proof?
