If you build Yommu&#039;s, Warrior, Death&#039;s Dance, and Swiftie&#039;s, Hecarim can completely destroy squishies, while still holding his own in a teamfight. Basically, if Hecarim pops his Yommu&#039;s for the extra passive AD and movespeed, and manages to deal 30% of an enemies health in the large window of 2.5 seconds, he gets a huge chunk of AD from the 40% MS buff, as well as getting 100% slow from the Swifties + Stormraider&#039;s. Combine that with a distortion ghost, and Hecarim can completely destroy just about anything completely out of nowhere. He even has a great escape/engage/cc with his ult. The problem is, everyone thinks that Hecarim Assassin is stupid. Can someone explain why Hecarim Assassin wouldn&#039;t work?","replies":[{"poster":"N3mO06","date":"2016-01-15T17:16:34.082+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Lucian Ap works, Then Even assassin Hecarim is a thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rozair","date":"2016-01-15T17:15:56.603+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you have to tell everyone my secret weapon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"www  GOHAM  org","date":"2016-01-15T17:46:25.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"BRO FUCK YOU.

Hes always been weak to slows so naturally this storm raiders buff really helps him plus his passive will just be going off with it too. I think it's totally viable. In fact I think you are on to something here. Basically if you get {{item:3139}} nothing is going to stop you from killing your target or escaping a bad situation when you dive into a fight now. This is even a buff to tank Hecarim. Hell still be building swifties anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"SkyBlade79","date":"2016-01-15T19:19:42.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea with the scimitar!

I forgot to put ghost on, and I was still annihilating squishies.\n\nThe only downfall I can see is that Hecarim transitions from being an initiator to being a follow up. So just be careful about when you pick off a squishy. He has always been a backline threat even with the tankier build, but you trade off tank stats for deleting squishy.
