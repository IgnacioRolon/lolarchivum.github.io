Actually I don't think I've left a game in months, and only then it was for something very urgent in real life.\r\nI'm just a guy that loves playing support for the most part. I'm not that good or anything, but I do enjoy playing the game.\r\n\r\nRecently, I've been having a series of events where my game crashes and \"bugsplat\" pops up demanding that I repair the game.\r\nSo I sit and wait to repair the game, and long behold, when I log back in I get punished by low priority que.\r\n\r\nThis happened to me once before, I got put into the 5min que.\r\n\r\nNow I'm getting put into the 10min que.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I'll get any help here, but this is really unfair and I wouldn't mind some help trying to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading\r\n-Aqua","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T01:10:13.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your game assets are continuously becoming corrupted, I recommend ensuring you've configured League to operate with the right administrative privileges.
