Is there any way that if I gave their account name I could maybe find out their Summoner name so I can add them?\r\n\r\nOnly reason I ask this is because it's unlikely that I'll run into the person again for quite a while. And if it helps they told me they were on NA servers as well, so I know that's not an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T05:05:07.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, this isn't something we'd be able to help with. If we confirmed what you have is an account name, or gave you the summoner name associated with that account, we would be providing a disservice to that player and potentially risking their account for compromise.\n\nI'm sorry I can't assist you with your request, but please let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
