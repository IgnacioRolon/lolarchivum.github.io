You can't just nullify someone's damage when they're 36 and 4 and 4 levels over everyone on the team except one person that they're 1 level over while also being full build. You know everyone on the enemy team was also likely not even close to full build considering how far they let that Pyke take over the game. That's now something you should be balancing around at all. Context is important.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2018-05-23T02:48:03.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this guy is painfully unfunny.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-22T20:44:27.178+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"u gonna post a vid? a gif? anything other than a pic that doesn't show anything other than that he has over 1k AD","replies":[{"poster":"Lolman978","date":"2018-05-22T20:53:26.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Too Unlucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EdWhx3vN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-22T20:44:27.178+0000)\n>\n> u gonna post a vid? a gif? anything other than a pic that doesn&#x27;t show anything other than that he has over 1k AD\n\nWhoops","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-05-22T21:00:56.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Support\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-05-22T22:57:57.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt that build would ever be viable in a real game.\n\nAnd, anyways, once you hit 1k AD you're going to kill people pretty damn fast on anyone.

Armor will make no difference to Pyke since once they hit the threshold its a true damage execute and that threshold is determined by PYKE'S AD\nb. Pyke can continuously blink from target to target\nc. With Pyke's invisibility he can essentially flank the enemy team\nd. The ult is an AoE, so clumped teams are screwed","replies":[]}]}]}
