I absolutely will reiterate my calls for a League movie or cartoon series.\n\nhttps://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/lux/issue-4/0/?utm_source=LeagueClient&amp;utm_medium=OverviewTier1","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2019-08-16T07:00:58.279+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif\n\nI'll +1 that.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2019-08-17T03:48:29.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you no longer the Featured Game Mode Lead?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2019-08-16T09:42:11.948+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can I ask what you find particularly well done and/or interesting in that series?

I'd nominate the 9 of 11 two-page sequence where {{champion:517}} deposes {{champion:59}} on the dais of Demacia as the main thing that brought me here yesterday to say this, particularly the little details like some in the crowd calling to kill the prince and others to save him - clearly Demacia is always not the united, principled nation it often believes itself to be, but a deeply divided country with deep scars and wounds in need of healing.\n\nI can relate to that.\n\nThe art is clean and appealing in my eyes, but even better - it has to do with the notion that I find one of League's basic writing principles to be incredibly interesting - *all* the characters are written as incredibly human.  That is of course, unless they're not, word to the vast non-human League roster - but still, no matter the faction and race, Runeterra's heroes are flawed and vulnerable and frequently fail and/or are injured or lose their power, and the villains have committed the darkest and most terrifying sins to acquire power.\n\nGoing further might break the Boards policies against political/non-League-related discussion.  I will only say that I have some small experience in politics - and this kind of writing is in my opinion so much more deep and effective in helping art become a mirror to reality that deepens us and helps us relate to our world better than more immature characterizations of simple \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\".\n\nI find myself in some ways compelled to root for League's antiheroes and villains in the lore even more so than the heroes - something I certainly try never to do in reality - because they are so well-written and relatable.  Despite the notion that {{champion:517}} is by this point an embittered, revenge-obsessed violent mage-supremacist radical who wants to bring about the fall of Demacia - I still find myself sympathizing with his pain.  Who couldn't relate to being imprisoned for an event that happened only because he didn't understand his powers in a country where magic is a crime?  Yes, he killed three people - but how many people have died because of the Lightshield family's wars and draconian anti-magic regime?\n\nThese questions aren't easy to answer, and they make for good writing in my eyes.  Your experience may vary, but this story really appealed to me.  I'm glad some of the others appealed to you!  I don't think I've read a bad League comic yet;  and I feel it's important to put energy into supporting Runeterra's lore - I have many friends who just say they can't play League anymore, they have too many toxic experiences and the game isn't casual-friendly anymore - but to a person they all still love the lore!","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2019-08-19T06:40:18.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for clarifying!\n\nNow I better understand what you liked, and I agree on most of your points: I too appreciate how Riot's been trying to have less b/w, more nuanced characters and situations (it's one of the things I liked most of Ashe's story, Grena is full of contradictions, she has tons of charisma but also makes terrible mistakes because of her nearsightedness). The world is nuanced and noone is the villain in their own story, and that's definitely something Riot's been working towards in their lore.\n\nBUUUUUT, I think that these points are true for LoL's lore in general, in Lux' comic in particular the ideas are there, but for me the execution didn't satisfy my expectations. But from your and the other comments, it could be a matter of where one sets the bar, while this comic isn't *bad*, I think it isn't particularly outstanding either. There are good ideas but I think they could have been brought into play better, the writing and art are a bit lacking imo. I see the effort to make the characters sympathetic and less flat, but I don't think the result is as good as it could have been, the dialogues are simple and sometimes stupid and the choices characters make are naive and/or predictable.\n\nI hope Riot continues to put out lore, in the form of written stories (Silence for the Damned was SO GOOD!), comics and maybe even other media, and that they push the quality higher and higher. I still think this comic in particular isn't one of Riot's best lore outputs, but I better understand what you and other players/readers liked. Thanks for taking the time to write your reply :)","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2019-08-19T06:48:51.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and another thing that I read in the other comments: the fact that the comics gives us more information about the setting/magic/story, and that it pushes (or might push) characters further and develop them from how we know them isn't a merit of the comic itself as a comic, it's kinda like a side-effect of the story. I.e. I definitely appreciate worldbuilding, but it's not one of the main aspects of the comics. I definitely appreciate character developement, but it's not enough for me in and of itself, it has to be well done, and in this comic...eeeeh :/\n\nSo yeah, there are good ideas and good things, but what I mostly judge in this comic are the writing, the dialogue, the story itself and the art. Worldbuilding is appreciated but doedn't make the comic a good comic itself. I definitely want character developement, but it must be good character development (think Grena and Ashe in their comic, think Udyr in the short story, or the story with Yasuo and Riven). Development for development's sake isn't enough for me :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2019-08-16T17:06:09.541+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the series is interesting simply from all the new information or confirmation we're getting in terms of the fact that Sylas can't detect all forms of magic, that Garen's weapon is blessed by Kayle, Kayle and Morg fought in the halls of Demacia, it's implied that Jarvan loves Shyvana and that she left, the potential of yet another party involved that has yet to be identified etc. Granted this is kind of a low bar set by years of next to no development.\n\nWhile I think it's a decent comic, it fails as a Lux comic. She only appears on 5/20 of the pages of the latest issue and we've still yet to learn anything new or interesting about her, so I've actually been calling it a Sylas comic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Haering","date":"2019-08-16T16:14:12.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree it lacks something, but I still find it fairly enjoyable.
