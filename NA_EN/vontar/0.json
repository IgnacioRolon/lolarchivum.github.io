Zilean!\r\n\r\nLooking t zileans lore, his people were wiped out during the rune wars, what if zilean was messing around with his time magic this whole time trying to prevent the rune war that destroyed his civilization? After years which passed like days to him he finally perfected his methods and rewrote time so that the runewar never happened, and his people never died, and hence, our current lore.\r\n\r\nSee?
