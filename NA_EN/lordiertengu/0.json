I have spent countless hours and real life money on this game only for some sensitive kid behind his keyboard to have the power to prevent me from playing or typing because he hits the report button in attempt at revenge.

Sometimes it escalates into spam and sometimes two people are more interested in typing than paying attention to the game. But often the argumentation starts getting messy - insulting the other player or mocking them - therefore breaking the rules.\n\n> Riot feels their moral standards are absolute and if you type in anything remotely human  you get hit with chat restrictions or bans.\n\nYou get hit with a punishment when you break the rules - that's it. A videogame first purpose is providing fun and securing this entertainment is needed. Taking into account that the system orientates itself on past given data (e.g. tribunal-time), the beliefs of Riot and is constantly learning you have to acknowledge that a majority of players seem to have a problem with it - otherwise the system wouldn't look like it does now. As far as I know different regions even have different \"standards\" what triggers the system.\n\n\n> I've gotten penalties many times because I don't just hold my thoughts back when someone is 1/9 criticizing my game play. Why do I not have the right to speak my mind?\n\nOh, you have every right to voice your opinions - but this has to hit a decent level. A lot of people complain that they can't defend themselves or argue or speak their mind and I have to disagree. The only thing Riot expects you to do is not start breaking the rules with it.\n\nFor example - when someone starts attacking me for unjustified my lane (insults and pointing out stuff) and I start getting annoyed my answers often look like this: \n _\"Dude, pay attention to your lane and I pay attention to mine. Everyone makes mistakes, calm down.\"_  and then I shrugg it off. This won't get punished.\nBut looking at some punished chat-logs the tone is rather like that: _\"idiot. 1/6 and talking?? we got camped and you had a free lane and still sucked.\" _\n\n\n>  I have spent countless hours and real life money on this game only for some sensitive kid behind his keyboard to have the power to prevent me from playing or typing because he hits the report button in attempt at revenge. \n\nUnreluctantly investing your time and earned money in a free game doesn't and shouldn't give you more freedom. Over 100 people could report you and nothing will happen when you sticked to the rules - feel free to take a look at threads where people requested their account-data and were surprised how often they actually got reported.\n\n> Why have the ability to chat at all, if everything is monitored and judged in a dystopian manner. \n\nFirst of all: it's a useful tool which expands the possibility of communicating with your team massively (tactical). Second of all talking can be entertaining - making new friends, lighten up the mood and so much more. \n\n>  if someone can't handle what is literally not only normal on the internet but in real life why are they playing a game where socializing is one of its greatest merits.\n\nI always see this argumentation on threads like that - portraying people who report for mild toxicity as crybabys. Let me tell you: a lot of people can handle it but still prefer seeing the game without it. Just because I can handle my ADC who stands every 1-2 minutes still and raging in chat - but should I? I can handle pretty well when someone insults me (personally I barely mute someone) but should I? Even when people don't take a personal offence with that being-said it still leads to other things which could ruin the gameplay - spaming the chat and distracting your teammates, not participating in the game and so much more. Some things can be prevented when we mute other players - but this can be hard when the person overall does decent calls.\n\n> With that being said, I'm considering quitting this game due to these foolish standards and will explain why to the literal 100s of friends I have that play this game.

It's when you start using chat to consistently insult, rage at and/or harass others that it will get you punished. Even consistent amounts of low-grade insults/harassment can eventually lead to a punishment since the IFS punishes based on consistency and severity. Besides, if someone is only interested in using the chat to insult, rage at and/or harass others rather than play the actual game itself then why shouldn't they be hit with a punishment and held accountable for their actions?\n\n> I now see that Riot is only acting in response to their community.. which is vastly composed of sensitive people.

This (imo stupid and dumb) argument is used allot, most commonly by people who are mad that they can't get away with behaving poorly in a video game (not saying you're one of them necessarily). Let me ask you this: is it really the community that's sensitive for simply not being willing to put up with other peoples poor behavior even in a game? Or is it actually the people complaining about not being able to abuse and harass others and get away with it that are the sensitive ones? In my experience the answer to that question is often the latter since they often don't realize and/or want to admit that \"you should be able to handle it\" is just a poor excuse to be a bully or a jerk (again, not saying you're one of them necessarily). From [Ulanopo’s Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&amp;page=1#post43465401):): \n\n>**People who report are simply being oversensitive. The mute button exists for a reason.**\n\n>Let’s start with the Riot quote on this (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=30696571#post30696571)):\n\n>**_Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?_**\n_Players shouldn’t need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player._\n\n>Simply put, Riot says no. You can scream and cry all you want, but it is their house and their rules.\n\n>With that out of the way, I think the topic deserves some further discussion. The theory is that, if people resolved to care less, then they would be happier. I often refer to this as ”Argument from Stoicism” and I think it is a fairly weak philosophy because it places the burden on the person being expected to endure the behavior rather than the person exhibiting the behavior. “You should be able to handle it” is just a flimsy excuse for being a bully or a jerk. I have to be the bigger man so that you can do whatever you want? That hardly seems fair.\n\n>There is also the issue of how I spend my limited free time. Like most people, I am constantly required to make value judgments between the different forms of entertainment that are available to me and, let's be honest, we live in an age of nearly limitless entertainment options. If I'm having a bad day in League, I can just fire up Steam and play a whole bunch of games that don't require me to put up with someone's BS.\n\n>This is not an issue of weakness or thin-skin; it's a question of choosing activities that don't leave me feeling frustrated and angry. Too many of those experiences and I'll just find something else to do.

I think it's more-so that people expect each other to be able to control themselves when interacting with others and not fly off the handle when things don't go their way if you know what I mean. The IFS even has built-in leniency for the occasional outburst assuming the behavior is not the norm, only issuing a punishment when the occasional outburst becomes a trend over multiple games.

You are talking about an \"annoyance\" what i simply can not understand, because for me it does not exist.\n\nI usually only mute at as a last resort myself, but that doesn't mean I don't get slightly annoyed sometimes when someone decides that acting up in chat is more important than focusing on the actual game itself.\n \n> But i'm honsetly interested. Do you start missing CS when somebody wrote a \"fck you\" in chat and you muted them? Or do you completely stop play the game and cry in the corner of your room? Do you start diving tower? Or what?\n\nI fail to see how this is relevant to the discussion at hand.\n \n> I hope you realize that what you are saying now, is a gameplay offense and not a chat offense. And i'm all for punishing people who afk and just write in chat. If they write a beautiful poem, LoL lore, or just flame somebody, if he is not playing the game, get punished. So i totally agree with you on the last part, gameplay offenses should be punished.\n\nThat's a good point, but I'd say it's often both actually. While they're busy typing up chat offenses they're also technically committing gameplay offenses as well. Yes gameplay offenses should be punished more frequently than they are now, but that doesn't mean chat related offenses should be ignored either since both are misusing features of the game often to try to hinder their team (champ abilities for trolls, chat for verbal abusers/ragers).","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2019-06-06T19:12:20.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> that sometimes we can misread things\n\nIt's not even about misreading.

O.o\n\nI don't use the mute feature often because I'm usually able to just actually ignore it and filter it out without muting them, plus there's always the chance that they'll straighten up naturally over time and things will be fine for the rest of the game. That said if the player in question is doing nothing but sending annoying, pointless and problematic messages then that's when I'll use the mute button, so I don't get further distracted from the game. In other words it's more of a last resort for me than anything else.\n\n> The difference is that your team has all the tools to stop you from misusing these features if we are talking about chat, but they have no way to prevent you from gameplay offenses. That's why I think one should be punished and not the other.\n\nWhile I agree that it's allot more difficult dealing with gameplay trolls in the moment compared to chat offenders, I disagree that only one should be punished and not the other. Many people are able to use chat just fine without insulting, berating or harassing others, and if those misusers refuse to stop misusing it despite being given multiple warnings to do so then I see no reason why they shouldn't be held accountable for their continued misbehavior.\n\nAnd before you say \"just permamute them\", Riot's already tried that in the form of infinitely scaling CRs and found those with that penalty either used their limited messages to continue their poor behavior or just switched to committing gameplay offenses or both. This means that it's the player acting up that's the main problem and not the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2019-06-06T22:05:21.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Mind providing some examples?

You have freedom of restrictions on speech from your government, not a private business or individual.

It's not hard.\n\n>it feels really bad to have it taken from you because of some petty social standard decided upon by other humans.\n\nI suggest you follow the rules of a community you decide to be a part of then.\n\n>but in all honesty if someone can't handle what is literally not only normal on the internet but in real life why are they playing a game where socializing is one of its greatest merits\n\nBeing an asshole in real life is not \"normal\". You are free to socialize in League. I suspect highly that your form of \"socializing\" is something **you** consider normal but the rest of society in real life would consider vile, disturbing, and/or plain disruptive.\n\n>We're not all going to be these weird robots only promoting positive remarks like \"gg! Well played! Good job!\".\n\nNobody expects you to. It takes a hell of a lot to get punished. I've had my moments in games where I say something that isn't really very nice. I have not gotten a single chat restriction ever across multiple accounts. You're allowed to screw up. But when your screw ups are either severe, consistent, or *per*sistent, it becomes a problem.\n\n>There has to be some level of criticism allowed\n\nThere is. In fact, you will **never** be punished for **constructively** criticizing others in moderation and when it is merited.\n\n>and if argument will always result in penalty the initiator should be the one punished.\n\nBoth players are participating in toxic behavior. Both players are at fault. Your lack of self control and your retaliatory nature are not other players' problems and other players should not have to suffer because of it.\n\n>With that being said, I'm considering quitting this game due to these foolish standards\n\nYou are free to do so.

Insulting/Target someone because of their race/gender/sexuality - threatening them with murder or encouraging them to selfharm crosses the line massively as those are sensitive topics and should be treated as such [personally I would make an exception (not in-game related but generally speaking] for black-humor or jokes). \n\n\n> p.s. i hope you also take into consideration the fact that \"kys\" is a fairly common phrase to be told to someone youre mad at in video games such as this one. most people saying \"kys\" to other people dont actually mean it, it is only a way that they can vent their frustrations, on a certain player.\n\nAlthough I see were you are comming from I would like to ask you: \"Why do they word it this way?\".

Shortly after our meetings I got introduced to some buddies of them (luckily termination of contact was the case soon) and things were okayish at the start and got worse when we started playing together. Let me tell you: they were real crybabies in LoL, raging at the littlest things and throwing insults around. But their most favourite insult was and will ever be: jew - in all variations.\nThey never met a jew in their life (as far as we know). They could not point out one thing they disliked about jews. They didn't even know what it means being jewish and not had a single clue about Judaism. But do you know were they took this insult? From World War II and for them, due to this historic past, it was the perfect symbolization of people who were in their eyes subhumans. \n\nI broke up the contact a few days after and from this day till today stumbled across this insult more and more.

O.o How much damage does a \"kys\" deal to your team? If you do not like something, mute it.\n\n> Being an asshole in real life is not \"normal\".\n\nYou are totally right. If i play a sport, and one of my teammates intentionally get points for the enemy, that's asshole. And no sane person would call me an asshole for telling them to \"fck off\". Yet in LoL this whole thing is the other way around...\n\n> I encourage you to reflect on this because society's standards are no different.

If you murder someone, you get to be arrested and face the consequences of your actions. Just like being toxic in chat will make you face the consequences, a ban or chat restriction.\nYou do technically have the \"right\" to do anything you can physically do, because humans have free will...but there's consequences to anything you do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2019-06-03T11:57:46.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> This is such a ...weird analogy.\n\nThanks, that was my goal :D\n\n> You do technically have the \"right\" to do anything you can physically do\n\nAnd this is what i wanted to point out.

My time spent on this mode does have more value to me than if I were playing norms. I don't want to have a guy on my team that just got home from work and is looking to have a good time.

I won't always get players that I want or champions I'd love to snowball to a simple victory. That's the name of the game, the risk, and the challenge. I am also the guy who comes home from work from a long day that either choose 2 things when I get home. I smoke one and do anything from just relaxing, doing art, read a book, or watch movies. Or I play League of Legends. But I always play to win and I always do my best. \n\nI play this game to have a good time. Because after all, this is a video game. This game was made to have fun. But players like you take it far too serious and treat thing game as if it's a job trial. Which beats the purpose of the game. So yes, you should stop considering quitting and just do it.

They believe that you should be able to understand what is right and wrong to say in chat just as if you were at work, or any other place. If there are no rules in place then people would just stop playing the game and argue in chat all the time.\n\nAll in all you are there to play a game.
