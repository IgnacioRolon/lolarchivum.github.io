I'll be playing the game fine, and play several matches just to queue up for one and the whole game either freezes or fails to load past the load screen. Normally when this happens, which isn't often, I will force quit the program and reopen to hop right back in. But today, the game decided to \"revert my version to a prior one and attempt an update.\" I'm going to apologize here to the team-mates who had me, cause after about 10 minutes of closing and reopening the program I cannot login. The game is rejecting my password, and even after changing it, is still refusing to accept the new one. Time to reinstall league of legends again. \r\n\r\nRant aside, has anyone run into this issue? Is there any way to avoid it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-25T20:53:56.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you had a combination of some kind of crash on the loading screen, and then got affected by that [**login issue**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Oe3XBf34-incorrect-username-or-password) we were having. If the patcher is still saying your username or password is incorrect, let's try switching the region to something different and switching back to see if that gets you back in.\n\nThat loading screen freeze needs to be tackled a little differently, however. Your network might be hitting some weird kind of hiccup while it's trying to load the game. Run through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if updating some of your network settings gets you loading a little smoother.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowfang TC ","date":"2017-05-27T04:22:15.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did manage to fix the problem by uninstalling and reinstalling the game. The client was attempting an update but wasn't actually reaching the point of starting it, which I believe is what kept causing the password reject. I'd have to experience it again to know for sure. But that was a bizarre coincidence I suppose.\n\nThank you for getting back with me though :)","replies":[]}]}]}
