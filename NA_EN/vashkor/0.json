He was my first main, and even to this day {{champion:11}}  and {{champion:62}}  are my top two favorites. I also love how the two Wuju Style warriors are connected in lore. I was aiming for something like their training grounds - the master and pupil battling it out.\n\nI started this as a doodle in class, so I drew from memory and totally didn&#039;t get their armors and weapons right. Later when I brought it in Photoshop I decided to stick to my own designs. As long as they are recognizable I will be happy.\n\nI hope you all like it.\n\nUpdate: As promised, [here](http://i.imgur.com/rFxRSsi.jpg) is a high-res version.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-03-30T12:11:05.024+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well done!\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/d27d1dcbd192d0dd6d5c2f4c672b3fb3.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmknWdl","date":"2015-03-30T14:15:47.527+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wuju do some more?","replies":[{"poster":"Vashkor","date":"2015-03-30T18:02:01.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nataliebai","date":"2015-03-30T01:50:25.794+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahah, cool!
