Or more specifically a Co-op. On your website you said that you only do summer internships so that you can have all of the interns together at one time, which is understandable. My question is basically would there be a possibility of a Co-op. I go to Kettering University which is structured differently from most other colleges. It does three (3) months of school, and then three (3) months of what we call a \"work term\". This is where we go work for a company for those three months. We repeat this twice a year so total it is 6 months of school and 6 months of work a year. That being said, we don't really have a \"Summer Vacation\" so there is no way for me to apply for the internship in the summer since my school term starts up in July (I realize that all summer positions are currently filled for this year). Is there any possibility that a co-op position would be considered?","replies":[]}
