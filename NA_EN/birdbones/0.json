When I logged in today I got the \"leave buster\" message... tried playing the game and it still froze. Spent the entire game trying to figure it out and fix it. When the match ended, I got the message again. I'm also pretty sure it wasn't on my end either because every other part of my system worked... game music played, mouse moved, and I was able to log out/in on my computer to reset it, etc. What gives?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T18:45:58.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be caused by the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) game bar which has been known to freeze games like this.  Disabling it should do the trick.\n\nThere might be driver failure issues as well if you can still hear sounds.  The steps in our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide can help with this, but I recommend sticking to custom games now to prevent anymore leaves.","replies":[]}]}
