When I first got into LoL, I spend around 2-3 years only playing bots, because I was afraid of the toxicity everyone kept talking about. The first week in PvP I learned so much more than 3 years of playing bots. I regret not starting to PvP sooner.\n\nThe AI of bots isn't really that good. You can easily bait them into overextending and subsequently kill them. It will lead to learning the game wrong, because things like that don't happen in PvP, so it gives a false sense of how good you are. This also means you will develop a relatively aggressive playstay, which is generally not so good when you're new to PvP. I'd suggest to play safe during your first few games, and then you can become increasingly more aggressive, until you have found yourself a good balance. That said, bots are great to try out different champions, so you can get a feel for their abilities and general power curve.\n\nAlso, people just love to talk about how toxic the community is, but don't let this bother you! It was the reason I refrained from playing PvP for so long. Once I start PvP'ing, I barely noticed any of the toxicity that everyone kept complaining about. It's mostly just a hyperbole.\n\nFinal note, if you have a friend to play with you can try to form a botlane ADC/support duo. It may make the game a lot more fun.\n\nAnd remember, most important of all is to have fun!","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf247151246","date":"2018-04-30T03:57:49.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice!

As several people have said you will be with people who are toxic, so at the beginning of the game type something on the lines of \"new to the game so sorry if I feed.\" in my experience most people will then respond with something like \"np it's only normals\" and you've set their expectations for the game so they have no reason to complain (this won't stop some of them but that's what mute is for :P).\nYou WILL feed. This is not a question of if, its a question of when. You're new to a game that has a lot of combining factors to it, the biggest of which is mentality. I've had an open nexus before and still won because my enemy team were toxic to each other. Set your aim for the game at something like \"I will get a kill/assist for every 2 times i die\" and you should be ok. Then you can aim to improve on it.\nWatch some videos of players playing your champ and look at where they ward. There's no doubt some kind of adc's guide to warding on youtube and trust me when I say it'll save your life more often than your random support.\nGood luck and don't let the tilt get to you.

It's completed normal, even when you've been playing PvP for years, to feed when playing something new; whether it be a champion you aren't used to, a lane you don't know, or even a matchup you've never come across before. It's why when a new champion comes out everyone cries they're OP. It's not that they're OP, it's just they have no idea how to fight them.

You can seriously just play LoL PvE for fun, and being unskilled isn't illegal if you go PvP the moment it's possible but have 0 skills.
