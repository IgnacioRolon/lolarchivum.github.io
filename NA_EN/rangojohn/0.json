Now at first I wanted to go top, but you know in Normal, it&#039;s first called first served. And someone already called it before me! Ugh. I also got the new Gnar skin, Snow Day Gnar, which I totally think is both cool and cute at the same time, so I really wanted to play Gnar! So instead I decided to try Gnar at adc? He is ranged, until he goes mega, and he has stuns and jumps. And His Q has good range to poke other champs, so I thought it could possibly work.  So I entered Summoner&#039;s Rift with my support, Battle Boss Blitzcrank, (which I got from Snowdown Shop, #70%Off!!!) and I went 6-0-0, 12 minutes in the game!!! Since I was doing so good throughout the game, I decided to build a Ruunan&#039;s Hurricane, (Trust me it was a crazy idea.) But it ended up working good, in a sense. It made it soooooo easy to build up rage while farming and then going mega. So it was pretty cool! Our team did really good this game, we ended up winning. This were my final scores: Minions: 176, 16k Gold, 10/6/14, Build: {{item:3072}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3022}} {{item:1011}} \nSo I thought I did pretty good, maybe there are some changes to my build that I could&#039;ve made. But, anyway, that is why I am posting this blog, I would like to see what other people think of Gnar adc, should it be a thing, or not. I would love to hear your comments bellow!

Just a bruiser you brought bot lane. Not that you need an adc to win in league but he doesn't work very well as a true adc.","replies":[{"poster":"RangoJohn","date":"2016-01-01T22:25:26.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that could be true.

That way it shouldn't bother anyone if you were to play in a normals or ranked. If it works, awesome, if it doesn't, well, at least he can go top.","replies":[{"poster":"RangoJohn","date":"2016-01-01T19:12:36.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may do that!

It has decent synergy with some supports, but some adc's like vayne lategame will just kite you and destroy you. This is the ranged cheese build for top, not really an adc build imo. Probably like, Trinity -> IE -> PD -> BT -> GA or a defense item, or maybe just another zeal item for 100% crit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kyrrion","date":"2016-01-01T19:09:08.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mega Gnar is now Mega Useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yaksha","date":"2016-01-01T19:08:55.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2016-01-01T19:06:54.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just dont","replies":[]}]}
