Therefore, I tried playing a few. And I fed horribly. Perhaps it&#039;s just the completely different playstyle from my mains (tank main here), but I cannot seem to win a game or even put up a fight when playing as an assassin champion. Can anyone help me figure out what I&#039;m doing wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-15T03:35:11.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins take LOTS of practice.

You let the tanks do the initiating and after a few seconds you run up into the fight and scan out the carry you want to assasinate. Never initiate unless you have 100% chance you'll make it out alive or kill 2 of their squishies. That's the simple part. It may sound selfish but it's better than having a dead assassin in 1 second.\n\nFor example, Twitch may not be an assassin but to be a good Twitch you have to act like one. When the tank initiates, that is when you start stealthing (note: sometimes you shouldn't start stealthing before the fight), and after a few seconds people don't really notice or care about Twitch because they are too busy fighting your tanks/fighters/adcs. That's when Twitch (and assassins) strike.","replies":[{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2015-07-14T21:26:30.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gwellaouen","date":"2015-07-16T14:25:26.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I like this topic. \n\nI have the same problem. I can play Malzahar and surprise them with my ult. But ... He is more a mage than an assassin. Yep, I will try those things: wait for the initiation than engage on the right carry.\n\nOn early game, when in lane, I found it quite difficult to disengage without getting hit tough. I think it's my bigest problem right now. It's weakened my early game.\n\nP.S.: Sorry about mistakes, english is not my first language.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kãtãrinã","date":"2015-07-14T21:24:23.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main assassins and yes they are like polar opposite of tanks lol.

Usually after a good amount of harass. You gotta trust yourself and your champions strengths.
