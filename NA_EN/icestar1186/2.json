I like your idea a lot, but I think adding both changes would probably make his Q too good at farming.","replies":[{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2016-05-17T04:50:32.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, having both of those changes would be a bit much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J Eevo","date":"2016-05-16T22:52:12.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt it considering how bad it is at farming a wave alone. It doesn't synergize well with W or R when trying to waveclear, and when used as a single spell it just kills two minions...","replies":[{"poster":"Zantumall","date":"2016-05-16T23:42:05.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, if it executed low HP minions AND targeted the lowest minions first, you could just drop it on the wave and never miss a CS again.  It wouldn't full clear the wave on its own, sure, but every minion that got low enough to last-hit would get instantly killed by it.  That would be too strong, it would take literally all skill out of last-hitting with Swain.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"charcharmunro","date":"2016-05-16T17:02:26.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the priority would be E-affected units, lowest-health champions, champions in general, lowest-health minions, closest minion? Because that's the general priority you'd have as Swain, I think, but if he wants to fry a full-health squishy with his full-combo over a half-health tank, he'll be more than capable of that.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2016-05-16T22:39:31.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2016-05-16T17:37:52.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty much the idea, I guess.

The W is actually a pretty good damage source if you max it 2nd(it also gets a 2sec root at max), I rarely ever see late game anymore and if I do it's super one sided so I'm not sure if this is still the case. It used to half health ADCs and squishy mages if you hit em with E first though. If they had no MR sometimes it'd even drop their health by 2/3rds with an E before it. But if I get super ahead in lane now I can still do good burst damage with the W if I hit someone, people don't expect it to hit hard so sometimes I can bait them into thinking getting hit by it is better than getting hit by something else. Then they lose a lot of health and I can usually finish them off. So the W is (or at least was, it hasn't changed in the last patch so it should still be) a great source of damage mid-late game if combo'd with the E.\n\n-Vaz","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"UPfreely","date":"2016-05-17T03:08:11.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like it should be multi-target or aoe..","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThunderSqueak","date":"2016-05-16T22:37:40.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain main agrees","replies":[]}]}
