However, I help out my team immediately after, by usually ganking mid/top right after using my pillar.\n\nAfterwards, I have unsealed spellbook, so if possible, I immediately turn one of my available summoners (smite/flash) into teleport to help out my adc, and buy relic shield to lane with him. I usually keep my smite to help secure objectives including scuttle crab and dragon, but my build is entirely support (and focuses on peeling for my adc).\n\nI do admit, I do &#039;fail to communicate&#039;, but the only odd part about this strategy is level 1, in which I go to take enemy jungle instead of laning. But I fail to see anywhere stated that as a support you have to lane with your ad carry at the start of the game immediately to be considered not trolling.\n\nIt is also mentioned that my account got suspended for roaming a lot. I literally have this playstyle on my other supports such as bard, but have not got suspended for the same playstyle.\n\nThe reason I do this strategy is because trundle&#039;s early game laning as a support is completely abysmal, and you are basically soaking up xp without any tools to trade back to the enemy.\n\nTicket:\n\n\n\"Hey fingolfin14,\n\nI see that you recently started this Trundle trend, I and yea i wouldn't say its the most meta of roles or play atm which is fine and completley viable, I remember when supports actually did go roam for a bit ie; roaming Ali with boots 5.\n\nI feel like if you did indeed want to be successful when pulling out this secret strat and thats completley fine, but i also see that you failed to communicate these sick plays with your team in the pre-game chats. This lack of communication is huge and can be pretty tilting in a sense especially since you are playing a ranked game and allot can be on the line for anyone whether it be your teammates or your opponents.\n\nI also see that you are currently in Plat which is awesome kudo to you~ On the other hand if you knew you were going to go support trundle which is completley fine i wouldve preferred you take a support summoner skill at least to put your adc's mind at ease. Plat is a pretty high rank for most people and at that level of competetion any small gap that your opponent can snatch from you and they will as the hunger in competetive ranked is very high. I have recieved several reports from teammates and opponents agreeing that this type of behavior, lack of communication and lack of co-operation can be seen as griefing or assissting the enemy team in a ranked environement.\n\nIv'e reviewed your recent games and the logs definitley let me know that you don't coordinate with your team properly at all, i have read several instances where you leave your bottom lane partner high and dry and when they get crushed you just proceed to say don't blame me.\n\nBelow are a few examples of how this can be percieved as griefing, sure you probably didn't have an awful time but that one teammate facing a 2v1 can be decimimating when it comes to team morale. In most of these instances even your teammates agree with your adc that you do leave them high and dry:\n\n[6:16] Jax: lucian can't even 1v2\n[6:26] fingolfin14 (Trundle): all he needed was stay under tower\n\n[2018-04-23 03:20:18 PDT] Cootins: gg\n[2018-04-23 03:20:23 PDT] Orianna BÃ´t: you guys left your ad alone\n[2018-04-23 03:20:59 PDT] MingUhLing: yeah\n[2018-04-23 03:21:02 PDT] MingUhLing: pretty weird\n\n[8:42] Twitch: I'm about to afk\n[8:55] Twitch: trundle\n[8:55] Twitch: come\n[8:56] Twitch: to lane\n[8:57] Twitch: pls\n[8:59] Twitch: I'm so far behind\n\n14:07] Caitlyn: ive been 1v2ing for half the game\n[14:12] Caitlyn: trundle is level 65\n[14:14] Caitlyn: 6*\n[14:26] Caitlyn: but he keeps roaming\n[15:20] fingolfin14 (Trundle): well no wards\n\nI will not post anymore evidence as it is apparent that you were griefing whether it was intentional or not, your lack of communication and co-ordination with your team only served to penalize you and your teammates in your ranked games. I would consider moving forward that you better communicate with your teammates what and how you want to pull of certain plays. As they can be super powerful and odd as most players wouldnt know how to deal with certain situations ie; lane swapping early support roaming etc. and to avoid any possible reports that may come off as you trolling in game, when really you just want to try out different opening techniques.\n\nWith all of this being said i cannot lift this 2-week suspension on your account as it was warranted and will stand by this decision. It wasn't just one game you decided to bust out the sick plays but several, i do agree your winrate is actually really good having it around 50% but that doesn't justify the lack of communication and cooperation exhibited by you throughout the 18 games you played. If you have any other further questions or conerns regarding this 2-week suspenion or any other at all please feel free to contact me at player support i'll be here to help out in anyway that i can.\n\nRaz\nRiot Games Player Support\nRengars Fluffy\"","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-04-24T03:50:37.393+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":"I have to say I'm a little disappointed in Riot right now.

It's hard enough to win bot lane in a 2v2, but if the support roams/has smite I know (if I'm playing adc, which I basically never do) that I'm at a disadvantage.  In Plat, there is less skill disparity than there is in Bronze or Silver, games are generally a bit more evenly matched (albeit still not ideal), therefore, this type of strategy almost guarantees bot lane loses and in the current state of League, if bot loses, you lose.  \n\nSo, no, I'm not okay with this, I'd report you for it and hope you would get punished.

It's fine to do this strat as a solo laner because you are gambling yourself and yourself alone. Sure, it will lead to a loss if it fails, but if you tried your best to win your own lane, it's fine. A bad game, if you will. If you are doing this as a support, you directly punish a teammate who plays in your lane. When you queue for support, you should realize that your job is different from others: you don't farm minions or jungle camps. The reason Riot gave support better gold income than other MOBA games like DoTA is so that you can sacrifice farm for your carry, die for your carry, and still make an impact in a game.

Even though I don't agree with a suspension ( a warning would at least be better), a punishment is justified.\n\nPeople need to realize something. The things you do have different consequences, based on the context. This generally means that pulling off a \"weird\" strategy, like what you do here, will have different results if you are in bronze and if you are in platinum. In bronze, you are probably gonna get away with it, in fact it might actually be better than the traditional 2v2 bottom lane. The enemy jungler will tilt because his buff was stolen, and the enemy bot lane won't take advantage of the 1v2 situation.\n\nIn Platinum though, this is different. For one, they will recognize there are two smites on the enemy team, so you are probably gonna get denied, or at least be warded, when you try to go for a camp steal, so it's not safe in general. Secondly, most important, the enemy bot lane will take advantage of you missing, resulting in your ADC being zoned out of XP and farm, which is not ideal. It leaves him being vulnerable in-game and frustrated in real life. This is created by you, which can be said to be griefing, even though you have no plan of doing so. It also gives the enemy bot lane a big advantage, so it is essentially feeding (even though not the intent).\n\nSince this is an unconventional strategy you are trying to pull off, you need to at least let your team know. Since there are general lines that people play accordingly (top - jungle - mid - duo bot), that's what people expect without communicating it in the champion select chat. That's the general plan everyone goes by, so there is no need to mention it, and it's generally the plan that's working the best, since everyone, from bronzies, to challengers, to pro players - teams follow it. IF something wants to try something new, which would probably be not ideal, they need to mention it in the chat, so that the players know what your new strategy is and how they should play this out, even what champions they can pick. If you don't do that, then you are running the risk of unintentional griefing and feeding.\n\nFor example, in this situation, if you explained to your team that you want to pull of support Trundle with Smite, for one if they didn't agree with it, or thought it was risky, or saw your op.gg and only saw defeats with horrible KDAs, then it's justified that they won't want you to play it. But if they actually agreed to it, then you could explain to them how you are gonna play out level 1, so maybe the Twitch could have picked a safer ADC, like Caitlyn, to deal with the early 1v2.\n\n\nNow, the thing is that in almost all games you tried this strategy, you fed your ass off. You lost most of your games, and most of those you won, you had a horrible KDA, meaning most probably that your strategy was not good. It was probably toxic to play with, and you kept trying to pull it off, even though you kept seeing no results.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonMastaWolfy","date":"2018-04-24T04:59:26.344+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":">It is also mentioned that my account got suspended for roaming a lot.

It's fine for the support to roam a bit, but when they're off roaming for extended periods of time, laning becomes VERY hard for us since it's essentially a 1v2 situation (of course there are a few exceptions where we can manage.) If the enemy is smart, they're going to severely punish the ADC for even stepping close to the farm and will apply some harsh pressure EVEN BELOW THE TOWER.

Any kind of analysis will show you that leaving your ADC to fend for himself is extremely detrimental to that player's ability to have any kind of impact on the game and as such the chances of winning the game are heavily decreased.

A bad game, if you will. If you are doing this as a support, you directly punish a teammate who plays in your lane. When you queue for support, you should realize that your job is different from others: you don't farm minions or jungle camps. The reason Riot gave support better gold income than other MOBA games like DoTA is so that you can sacrifice farm for your carry, die for your carry, and still make an impact in a game. This cheese goes against the definition of a support. It's a situation where you set up a player to be in a lose-lose situation.

In almost all games, people play with the same mindset - strategy. They pick a top laner, a mid laner, a jungler and two players go to the bottom lane. Also, the roles are mostly the same. An ADC and a support in the bottom lane, for example. So, almost all players pretty much embrace this strategy to begin with. How you play out your top lane is different for everyone and that's because there is the human variable in it. The singlest misstep can lead to a whole different laning phase in any particular match up.\n\nWith all these in mind, anything that steps out of the commonly-accepted strategy should at least be mentioned. If, for example, you think that a duo top lane without a jungler would be good for some weird reason, you at least need to tell that to your team, because it's something different from what everyone expects.

Does this mean I can report my lux support for taking teleport in lane because I think Lux should be a mid laner and that teleport is for top laners?

I think someone who is being negative and reporting you for something as trivial as going into the jungle for a minute or two and then teleporting to bot lane is actually more in the wrong than said player. Also you can't say \"I'm wrong\", because it's my opinion. There is no right or wrong in this case, it's whether you believe they should be punished or not.  Riot is the only one enforcing the meta. In other mobas you can roam around with support or go to different lanes. You can play a mage bot, or you can go into jungle as a support. You say almost all players embrace the strategy. In real life, do we punish people for not conforming to what most people do? No. I don't think it should be any different in a video game. This is my opinion and you're welcome to disagree... I think Riot is contradicting themselves by giving out these sort of punishments. No where in the Summoner's Code does it directly say \"You cannot take smite when you queue for support\", \"You cannot go into the jungle when you queue for support\", \"You are not allowed to leave your adc alone in lane\". It says be adaptive, but that really isn't specific enough. Anyway, I doubt they ban people for picking an ad mid when we already have a full AD comp. You see what I'm saying? They really aren't consistent at all and I haven't heard of other cases where people who didn't \"Adapt\" with a regular pick got banned.  They're specifically targeting these picks only because people reported them more, rather than keeping an open mind.

For all I care, you can play duo jungle Soraka - Janna. I wouldn't give a fuck.\n\nWhen I play ranked games though, I want everyone in my team to try their best to win. This means that I want them to put 100% of their effort into the game, and also pick things and play the game in a way that's most effective and efficient. It's not my rules, it's the nature of ranked - competitive gameplay. You MUST try to win with all your effort. \n\nWith that said, then no, I won't accept Lux with Teleport in the support role, except if there is a reason you do that. For example, if this is the first time you want to try that, and you play horribly with it and are the reason why we got stomped in lane, then sorry, but I will report you. Why? Because you tried to play something without knowing if it's good or not, not having tested it in any other game, and just THOUGHT it was good. I remember playing with a Zilean support recently, who had Teleport and Flash, and I believe he has Unsealed Spellbook as well.
