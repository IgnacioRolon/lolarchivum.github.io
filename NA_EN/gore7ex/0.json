Also if i could get my refunds back that would be awesome because i never got to use them and there are some things i'd love to refund from the past year of playing more often.\r\n{{champion:164}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T03:32:08.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) by picking the \"I need help recovering my account\".
