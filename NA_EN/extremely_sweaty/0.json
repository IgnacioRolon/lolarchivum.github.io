All he has to do is get the shit kicked out of him, then turn and press W for massive and potential true damage, with the only counter play being flash, and half the time it'll hit you anyway regardless because the hitbox on this is also disgustingly large.\r\n\r\nNone the less Sett is pretty garbage out of lane, gets kited easily, and with movement speed acquisitions it is slightly easier to dodge these abilities. But this champ is pretty braindead and his laning is very strong due to how easy and forgiving he is. But this post will go nowhere because Riot is busy making another Lux or Akali skin, oh well!","replies":[{"poster":"DarwinTheory","date":"2020-02-04T06:01:26.827+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait a little. There needs to be a few more champ and skin sales before the nerf comes.

Not with his big fat outplay button that riot gave him.\nKite him with auto attacks? He'll just ult you. Poking him down with long ranged abilities takes forever due to his hp regen and wall of health.\nHe's just a huge pain in the ass to deal with. Luckly he's normally banned.","replies":[]}]}
