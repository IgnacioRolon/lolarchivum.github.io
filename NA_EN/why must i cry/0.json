Levels will come over time, but if you rush your way to level 30 then you will find yourself suddenly thrust into matches against people with far more knowledge and skill than yourself.\n\nSummoner's Rift is generally the most popular and well balanced game mode, so it is probably the one most worth learning, but any of them are valid ways to play.\n\nI would suggest finding a role you like, getting a few characters that will allow you to play any role on a team in case the need arises, and then saving IP until you get to level 20 to buy runes (unless the rune rework comes out before then but don't get confused by worrying about that).","replies":[{"poster":"Why must I cry","date":"2017-08-25T19:19:02.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i already have a main, opening a new account i was at gold 3 last season so i just want the fastest combination.\nwhat boosters should i use and which game mode for the fastest way?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-26T15:07:09.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, get the timed xp boost so that you can play as many games as you need to, blow through bot games until it starts lowering the xp you get for it, then play normals (idk what queue does the best for xp).","replies":[{"poster":"Why must I cry","date":"2017-08-26T15:31:06.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean until it starts lowering the xp. when is that? and which bot games should i play, summoners rift?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-26T15:53:11.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know for 100% optimization, and the game tells you when it starts lowering the exp.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Why must I cry","date":"2017-08-26T00:58:40.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
