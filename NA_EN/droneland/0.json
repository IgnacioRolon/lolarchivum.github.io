It lacks in excitement much more than power. As much as you guys don't like true damage, I'd think we should just do something like \"Fiddlesticks' spells deal true damage to feared enemies\" or something else that gives instant, clear feedback as to the power his passive has. Do note that's probably not a balanced idea and not something I've fully thought through, but something that either has more gameplay or more visceral impact would definitely serve him well.","replies":[{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-08-10T21:26:54.679+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think Fiddles as a whole needs reworked. He has gotten every ability nerfed multiple times. He is in a current state where he has the highest average games played by his playerbase, yet still is in the lower part of junglers. Not too mention his laning was completely rekt. But he can't be strong because people that don't ward complain about him. I'd rather have him reworked than in a perpetual state of low tier just because the vast majority of players are low elo, myself included, and don't know how to play against him. Just my two cents worth.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-08-11T02:01:35.858+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone who has been playing Fiddle since Season 1, the idea of him getting reworked by the current update staff is absolutely terrifying.

What if the point of the passive was so that it WASN'T clear?  What if the passive prevented the enemy from seeing Fiddle's health?

I love CC-focused mages, always drawn to things like cryomancers and mezzers, and drain tanking is a super cool playstyle that isn't always well-balanced. So, being able to heavily disrupt the enemy team while keeping myself alive through careful in-fight decisions just felt awesome.\n\nTo put it in easier terms: situational disruption, situational survivability, situational damage, some ability to create/exploit opportunities to use his tools.\n\nThematically, he's just *weird*. Like, a goofy scarecrow that lives in a closet and might be the harbinger of a witch army? Bonkers. Doesn't fit in the more grimdark/straightforward narrative environment Riot has chosen, though, but I'm confident he can and should remain unsettling and difficult to understand.\n\nThings I'd like to see him keep in a rework: Some option to cause fear as CC, a presence that causes tension when he's not visible, built-in drain/spellvamp, focus on engaging and managing fights. I like him as a mix of \"tank\" and \"assassin\" design qualities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-08-11T18:40:49.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZV139XsK,comment-id=00000001000000000001,timestamp=2015-08-11T18:13:19.667+0000)\n>\n> First off, there aren't any plans that I'm aware of to do a big update to Fiddlesticks, so you don't have to worry about that :)\n> \n> The only real spell he has that is unsatisfying to Fiddle and/or unclear to the enemy is his Passive, so if anything, we may just try to take small wins we could get on that front to make it more interesting/satisfying for all parties.\n> \n> Since you mentioned it a bit, though...

While I do buy 2 health pots at the start of the game, I tend to not need any more pots for the rest. His drain skill is fun to use but using it at the right timing in a fight is always critical especially if they have CC. \n\nSince fiddlesticks is so fragile to CC maybe we can make a passive that reacts to CC in a way? Just a thought, but maybe if he is CC'ed his damage output is increased by X percent. Or if he is CC'ed then he gains X amount of magic resist and armor. I know this doesn't add to his kit in a whole, especially his jungling but it could add interesting team-fights. I do like the true damage idea while they are feared but of course tests will have to be done to see how that works out.\n\nHis ult is also a huge game changer mid/end game and if he snow balls it is fun to ult + Zhonyas into their team. \n\nHowever, right now he is a lower tier jungler and I believe a passive update might help bring more players to pick him up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-08-11T13:35:35.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest, it's not like he can really get worse from where he stands now.
