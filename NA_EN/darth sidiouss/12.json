Despite what you see on the boards the players in the elo are suffering and complaining they just have no knowledge these boards even exist they just simply play the game and never get to give you the feedback you really need to hear. Just about  EVERY single match is one sided , comebacks are a mere dream or fantasy to keep players in my elo from tilting and once they tilt they give up completely. I shouldn&#039;t have to give my nexus at 16 min !! I did do the liberty of checking everyone&#039;s stats off of OP.GG and my team wasn&#039;t terrible as far the stats go it was actually quite normal so i am deeply confused as to why it was so one sided and overwhelming..\n\nI am not stating i deserve higher elo no im not saying that. Im saying i should have a better chance to climb than this, this is a joke of ranked play. I hate to say this i really do but if these one sided uncontrollable matches continue i will be quitting the game permanently or at least untill low elo is not this cancerous. It is not healthy to be stressed out for playing safe for other people to come and feed and then suddenly your opponent cant be dealt with because you weren&#039;t even in the game long enough to acquire some type of fucking lead to match your opponents. Season 7 is by far the WORST season ive ever experienced thus far.\n\n#**ATROCIOUS  ** &lt;--------- SEE THIS WORD??\nLet that word melt in your brain, let it fester and grow as it becomes the word that sadly best describes low elo.\nSome neighboring synonyms ; appalling, dreadful, terrible, very bad, unpleasant and miserable.\n\nBut no no this isn&#039;t done yet ill continue this thread to talk about **Youtube ** how it has seemingly brain washed the league community essentially. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebkEzSZ6Rco\nThis video here. Im pretty sure there are people who know who this guy is or even subscribed to him etc . So basically he has made challenger and makes videos to help people and then out of it he makes money from subscribers, donations etc the basic youtube marketing shit. Im not saying hes bad at what he does i believe he can actually make videos that can legitimately help people where they are struggling with. Now in that video link he talks about &quot;How to carry your team when feeding&quot; and he makes some valid points you know ? but where this begins to fall off the cliff is where he talks about the leads saying basically oh if your enemy jungle is 5 0 etc etc you must also acquire a lead yourself to match that lead etc etc. This right here is laughably **inconclusive ** in low elo. In fact stating that is pretty much telling me to hold a pistol with a blank round in it and try to seem intimidating towards someone about to cut me with a knife.. because you see in low elo once someone has a lead its already decided. You or me might walk in with the mind set of oh you know we can shut this guy down yeah yeah ! shut down gold ! then we can make picks and come back ! FALSE. As soon as a lead happens on the enemy team a overwhelming domino like effect begins to happen everyone around you begins to tilt. Playing off with no confidence or will towards the game they give up completely.\n\nI have played thousands of matches around this elo you cant tell me otherwise. It DOES happen and as soon as that first domino falls the match is most likely decided as i said so maybe this video would apply in a higher elo setting where performance doesn&#039;t slip off when things look to go bad. Therefore it is inconclusive towards low elo. \n\nSo what happens is people watch these videos they find other youtubers who are abusing the same marketing strategy off there well earned current ranked placement usually a high diamond or masters, challenger player like in the video above. But people don&#039;t read between the lines they watch like sheep never realizing the videos aren&#039;t as informative as they should be. \n\nThe other problem with these youtubers is that they unintentionally conspire to the birth of trolls in our matches and at the end of the day this does infulence how our matches go. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK78h0_jXgQ\nNow that&#039;s what the video would look like, a marketing display or rather attractive display of what would be considered OP or Broken to fish in viewers for subscribers. I AM NOT saying &quot;RED {{champion:81}}  build&quot; is the fundamental problem like oh red ezeal build players are trolling my matches insisting he is over powered going that build. NO i am NOT saying that, i am saying that this video above is a perfect example of how marketing in youtube leads to these trolls we get in our matches and idk if this is a touchy subject for some people or people just don&#039;t have their eyes open enough to see the infulence youtube has on ranked queue, especially low elo and how in one way or another influences our own matches. So people watch these videos they usually have from 75k views to over a million.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvXZfaBctGU\nHeres another yet PERFECT example \n#&quot; TEEMO SUPPORT IS BROKEN &quot;\nOH                 MY              GOD                 SO            BROKEN \nI must try this in ranked \nthe freelo this is\noh boy !\nSo then you queue up for ranked and boy guess what ? you got a {{champion:17}}  support on your team ! who would of thought man ? Then unsurprisingly feeds. You wonder to yourself man all these trolls lately wtf is going on ? where do these trolls come from ? why do they insist on picking these champions in abnormal positions? and insist its new meta or actually freelo ? So when you wonder what neck of the woods these people come from remember this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-13T08:32:51.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is your post about Riot's matchmaking or about clickbait videos influencing people? You have two separate issues there, so you should make two topics for each. Nobody wants to read a huge wall of text, let alone one that doesn't even know what to focus on. \n\nI'm not even bitching, just giving you some advice for if you actually want to be heard.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Sidiouss","date":"2017-01-13T09:07:04.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason why i have almost two separate topics is because generally if your in low elo and complain about match making people assume right away oh you need to get good like \"Oh shut the fuck up honestly its just YOU.\" So that follow up topic is simply to prevent any opinionated hatred towards the beginning paragraph. This was intended to be shorter but i wanted to open some eyes here. So i just kept going. Overall its all towards match making. At least thats what i intended it too be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-01-13T12:15:02.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"five oh tree ","date":"2017-01-13T09:15:04.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is because no one knows how to play safely in low elo. Probably not even you. If the enemy is 2/0 on you and 30 cs up, 99% of the time you should not fight him. But 95% of bronze players keep fighting. it makes their snowball even bigger and the loss inevitable. \n\nThat's the entire reason. Snowball meta. So the team that snowballs first is going to win in the lowest elo where no one knows how to turtle or just safe farm. \n\nJust learn to accept missing some cs and sitting under tower during lane phase and you'll climb lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TS Media","date":"2017-01-13T08:48:58.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a pretty long complaint thread. ;p\n\nI think the lower Elo matchmaking is just fine. I'm sorry, but I just can't even see the struggles of Bronze/Silver anymore. I was once there too, but I improved and always asked intuitive questions to get out instead of bitching about how bad my teammates are.\n\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Ts+Media\n\nNot the greatest winstreaks in the world. But I manage to keep a fairly decent winrate. Some games are uncarriable. So just carry the ones you can. And once you stay consistent, every now and then you'll have teammates that even carry you.","replies":[]}]}
