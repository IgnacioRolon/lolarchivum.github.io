He is OP because of how healthy he is in the JG and that his ult is a free kill in any 2v1 situation. To properly nerf Lee they need to remove his spell vamp...but keep the lifesteal on W. Inscrease ult cd so he cant come mid everytime the laner gets back and ult them.\n\nLee is strong for the same oppressive reason kindred was strong. THE HEALS!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-01-12T17:11:16.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sooooo lets just remove one of the biggest parts of his kit......... yea no. there are other changes that need to be made, but killing his identity is not one of them\n\nLee sin's identity is built around the ward hop. He basically invented it as a strat. to take that away from Lee is to take the main community staple away from him\n\nLee Sin's main problem is his base damages, but this can be said for nearly every champion in the game. Base damages are so high right now on \"fighters\" that they are able to build a fair amount of tank items and still do a lot of damage. and Lee is no exception to this rule.\n\nIts for this reason when i play lee i go full AD assassin and use my mobility to dance around. I feel in this state he is very balanced, but the problem is that with current itemization and the level that his base damages are at, there is no incentive to play this style of lee sin outside of having fun one-shotting people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-12T16:45:42.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. Let's cut out a good chunk of his mobility. The thing he has more of then assassins and us apparently balanced around it. \n\nIf you're confused on my stance towards Lee, it's that I don't like him but stopped caring that he doesn't get nerfed. Lee being meta is like water making things wet. It's natural.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2017-01-12T16:43:13.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the Ult nerf is going to affect him and make him fall off even harder tbh","replies":[{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2017-01-12T16:50:21.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing about champions that \"fall off\" is they still have the ability to make plays, especially Lee Sin.
