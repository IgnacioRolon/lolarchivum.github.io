Greed and arrogance have corrupted them and as a result, have ruined this game.  It's only now after years of this garbage that they're finally starting to see the damage they've caused. _Starting_...they haven't _fully_ grasped all that  they've done yet.\n\nIf I were a Rioter, particularly one who deals with gameplay, I would much rather hear and read about criticisms than praise. It should be no secret by now that I hate white knights with a passion, and if I had the power, though it would be very unethical and unreasonable, I would want to see them banned from media outlets for constantly spouting useless information for me to parse though.  Anything at all that I would decide, they would hold  it up to the world as God's gift to Man. I could make a champion with thirteen passives, five forms of mobility, and an ult that instantly kills anything it touches, and I would be showered with adoration because of how \"cool, fun, and unique\" that design is.  Fuck that.  That's a broken mistake of a champion and anyone with half a brain could see that.  \n\nI'd want to see what people like about my creation sure, but I _really_ want to see what people don't like about it. Is it too obnoxious? Is it too strong? Does it fit into too many team comps? What is it abusing? Is it weak enough for it to be a reportable offense for picking it? Is it just a bad design? Tell me what I did wrong so I can fix it, and use what I learned to make a better champion next time!

Think about this, there's a ton of people who started in Season 5, where the game, in my eyes, took a massive nosedive toward the end and has not recovered since. If that's the only League they know, naturally,  they'd think it's fine now. \n\nSecondly, I'd look up their profile out of curiosity to see how often and _what_ they defend.  If they're capable of noticing something incredibly stupid like...I don't know, let's say Riot closes ranked down for the rest of the season because ranked is toxic, they're probably just optimistic, but this is a line they crossed. The minute they defend them, is when they _should_ be attacked. That's an extreme case, but  there are people deluded enough to say \"it's Riot's will, and it's their game.  If you don't like it, make your own game\" whenever any criticism whatsoever arises against the benevolent rulers.\n\nThirdly, it's possible they do think on their own, have a point, and it's just something I disagree with, some things more than others. The thing is, this is as close to politics as we're going to get in the sense that everyone has a philosophy on how things should run, those people mostly agree with like-minded players, they think they should be the ones in charge so they can fix the problems they're seeing, they tend to despise the other \"parties,\" there are players with moderate or extreme views, but we're all in one ~~country~~ game.

They get offended and then they and all their friends downvote you just because the one guy got upset. It is all emotional with many people and logic has no place sadly. \n\nEx: I tried explaining to someone just how ahri is more difficult to play and 1-shot/combo anyone without a lead than many other top tier mids like syndra. Had a guy argue with me to no end and call me all sorts of kindergarten stuff just because he disagreed. I asked for even one high rank vid/clip of an ahri who wasn't given a massive lead by ganks and ward control manage to 1-combo/shot the enemy mid from full hp. You can find plenty of syndra vids out there, but you can't say the same for ahri. Well he gets upvotes and I get negative votes even though I use logic, am not rude about my argument (while he is). That's what happens when the other guy/girl has more friends who want to waste time upvote/downvote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-03-01T07:34:08.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's simple actually. By using friends or smurfs to upvote it nearly instantaneously upon release all the eyes that see it come up on the recent list will hive mind upvote it.\n\nThe problem is smart people review it and either upvote or downvote but generally cancel each other out. Meanwhile stupid people don't read context and just upvote upvotes and downvote downvotes. So by appealing to the script encoded in the heads of the less mentally proficient you can boost any topic to the top of the boards.","replies":[]}]}
