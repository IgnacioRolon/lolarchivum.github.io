Sustain and peel and cc its too much for this champion to have overall with his current map pressure. In the heat of things he is capable of turning a good situation into a completely bad one , he needs movement speed nerfs and less pressure overall on the map no problem with his dmg or anything its just he does not need to be everywhere at the right moment in time for picks its broken as hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-02-07T00:04:19.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's only got too good early ganks, as in wards literally don't do shit top lane, he will still catch you and kill you.\n\nHis W also shouldn't be an escape, like what happened to hunting champions?

To top things off, people constantly build him wrong. The attack-speed HP% build is the wrong build to go on him. It makes him to squishy to ever matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Solaris Ventara","date":"2017-02-07T15:35:41.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personaly find building a bloodrazor and guinsoos give enough damage while i build a titanic and tankage to be a relyable build","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rucu","date":"2017-02-07T00:24:33.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at his base MS.

Here, I'll provide some statistics for you then.\n\nhttps://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/\n\nAt NO elo in the game, not even bronze or silver, is Warwick doing particularly well.  So on what actual basis beyond your own anecdotes are you basing the claim that Warwick is overpowered? If anything the data points to him possibly needing some buffs.\n\nEdit- Also your assertion that people stick to their mains in higher elo is false. Not only do higher ELO players have a larger champion pool on average than low ELO players (they understand that playing a champion is the best way to learn how to play against them), but Warwick has the second highest playrate in diamond+.

All it takes is the time of mastering the champion to reveal new ways to abuse the champion which is why {{champion:268}} 's win rate scales over time of the player playing games with him.
