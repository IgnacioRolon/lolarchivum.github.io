You literally solved nothing you created a over tuned AP {{champion:105}} why? \n\n{{item:1082}} &lt;---- This item is the SOLE reason fizz is successful going tank since his E is so bullshit and versatile it allows him to sneak stacks sorta speak since he snow balls hard already due to keeping and building stacks with executing his E properly it currently rewards him too much power in the case his &quot;E&quot;. You nerfed extended duels and buffed EVERYTHING else INCLUDING investment in dark seal since he gets more dmg out of AP now he gets more value in example {{item:3078}} {{item:3041}} (rest full tank) \n\nImagine those two items ^^ or tri substituting for {{item:3100}}  followed by FULL tank items.. hes allowed to deal even more frustrating damage since your buffing the ratios its that simple really..","replies":[{"poster":"Thebiggestpanda","date":"2017-05-17T02:11:44.702+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He will need 375 AP to break even with his pre-nerf W. The build you're suggesting will have him dealing strictly less damage than before the changes. Again, the buffed ap ratio will only compensate for his loss in base damage past 375 AP. Mejais only gives like 150 fully stacked?? That's not 375.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-05-17T02:17:19.116+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahh, the irony of a player named \"Dry Your Tears\" creating a post that is basically crying over a champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-05-17T02:15:00.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes. he needs nerf and MORE NERF. lets make sushi","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joxcab","date":"2017-05-17T03:09:06.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"What is this shitpost?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gl√Ætchy","date":"2017-05-17T03:04:05.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cause you know Riot logic \"We need to make an already bullshit champ EVEN MORE bullshit!\"","replies":[]}]}
