This lock prevents others on your team to ban your _Pre-locked champion_. **NOTE**: **THIS OPTION IS FOR PLAYERS WHO FEEL ADAMANT ON THEY&#039;RE CHAMPION CHOICE.** Once you pre-lock you cannot change your choice unless the other team bans or picks your champion. \n**\nWHY ONLY 1ST AND 2ND PICKS ONLY GET TO PRE-LOCK???**\n\n1. The 3 other players have the benefit of banning 1 champion while the first 2 do not, this gives a unification of benefits to all players on the team.\n2. If all players were given this option it would create this mayhem of choosing and raging over picks v.v\n\nPlayer 1 {{champion:24}} \n\nPlayer 2 {{champion:24}} \n\nPlayer 3 {{champion:24}} \n\nPlayer 4 {{champion:24}} \n\nPlayer 5 {{champion:24}} \n\nUR WELCOME RIOT &lt;3 \nPlease up-vote if you think this is a good idea\n\nEDIT: By some your opinions it seems as though you guys want to strip the freedom of a players champion choice ? its league of legends not league of who YOU want me to pick.","replies":[{"poster":"MotrColt","date":"2016-04-26T17:54:57.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strongly against this idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Sidiouss","date":"2016-04-26T17:57:22.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not if ur choosing as first or 2nd pick why not have some insurance to prevent some asshole from banning the champion YOU wanna pick? and its optional.","replies":[{"poster":"MotrColt","date":"2016-04-26T18:12:25.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because if everyone on a team shows their pre-game preference and the team has a clearly defined strength and flow to it except for 1 person who only plays jax, the team should have the ability to say no, you don't get to be selfish and pick for yourself and not the teams good. \n\nOf course often times when I see this happens it results in that player trolling, but if they troll every time they do this they will slowly but eventually drop divisions. \n\nThe current system works better than I think your idea would cause it to.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Sidiouss","date":"2016-04-26T18:21:19.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the problem of the current system. 3 players after 1st and 2nd are given the option to ban champions, giving them more power over the overall team comp outcome. Wouldn't it be nice to know u CAN go who YOU wanna go. If your going to be 1st or 2nd your getting that champion either way this system just prevents a ban from your team, on the champion YOU wish to play, thats it.","replies":[{"poster":"MotrColt","date":"2016-04-26T18:27:27.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like i said, you are only focused on the individual when you should be focused on the team. It is a team game after all, If you only want to play 1 champion every game in the same role no matter what, make a custom game with some friends. Its a team game and thus it should be looked at as what benefits the team the most, not a single player.\n\nIf your pick is such that it truly helps your team, this should rarely be a problem. If it is often a problem for you odds are you deserve it, in my mind at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Sidiouss","date":"2016-04-26T18:34:37.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play more than 1 champion but some people feel like going someone sometimes and feel adamant about they're choice.

Perhaps showing champion mastery over your intended pick in champ select could help?  I dont think preventing bans could ever be helpfull to team moral, particularly if you dont get that pick and then have to play with 1-4 salty teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dim2a","date":"2016-04-26T19:30:24.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend to use this to my advantage though: \n\nWhen I learn new champion I play normals until I stomp those, then take them into ranked. But ranked is harder, first few games with new champ are likely losses. Before new queue I'd feel bad about having my team suffer through it. Now, there is a simple solution I follow -- someone bans someone I pre-pick = I get to bring out a new champ, and don't feel bad at all for the team since they banned a champ I'm good at.  I get to learn the champion, \"normal\" teams don't get penalized for it, and those who banned my pick get what they deserved. Those ban happen about as often as I am learning new champions, everyone wins :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kãtãrinã","date":"2016-04-26T17:55:47.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or just dont hover the champion if you think people will troll you.
