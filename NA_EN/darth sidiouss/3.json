Bronze players are terrible. Think like a baddie and identify their weaknesses (laning, teamwork). Get a champion that can function well without relying on a team (jungle bruisers, nasus, assassins with good escapes like LB, ahri, ekko, ect..). Roam, get fed, ward, try to carry. Your job is to become unstoppable, not babysit whoever is feeding.\n\nAFKs, feeders, awe-inspiringly bad players, ect are incredibly annoying but no disadvantage to you - the other team gets them more often then yours does (assuming you are not one of them yourself, right?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"tidegate","date":"2016-05-14T03:48:55.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really is that easy, there's a difference between knowing a champ and mastering them. If you can even come close to mastering an easy or overpowered champ it becomes extremely easy to win games over and over. Don't feel ashamed about playing Darius every game because, this just in, a lot of people have done it with others like yi and xin when they were broken.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-05-14T00:20:28.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In you last 20 Games you bought a total 4 Pinks.  \n6 Games as ADC went 40 + mins and you had the same ward instead try to get this ward at level 9 or whenever you get the bot lane tower {{item:3462}} \nPlaying as jungle try to get {{item:3341}}  on your first back with also {{item:2043}}.
