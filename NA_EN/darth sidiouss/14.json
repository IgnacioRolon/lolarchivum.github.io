Malzahar and Brand are examples of champions who are exceedingly strong in bot lane, despite being okay to underwhelming in mid lane, and before that there was the case of support Annie and Fiddlesticks in Season 4, both of whom had to receive balance changes due to their bot lane shenanigans. On the flipside, we also have Lulu, who's suffered tremendously for her presence in top lane, and beyond that there are many more champions who could almost be viable in another role, namely Taric top, Leona jungle, Blitzcrank in both those positions (he used to be a good top/jungle fighter in Seasons 2-3), etc., but who aren't because support balance prevents them from going anywhere else.\n\nConnecting the support class more to the rest of balance should prevent abuse cases like Brand and Malzahar from happening as severely, but if nothing else it should give supports a place to go if they ever get shoved out of bot lane. In fact, it might be useful as a general rule to give every champion at least two positions they can thrive in, so that they can never be completely pushed out of the game by competing picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ADepressedLeona","date":"2017-02-06T04:45:38.818+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I believe that mage supports are a bit overtuned, I think a large reason people pick mage supports is simply because true supports just can't carry the game by themselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2017-02-06T06:08:19.989+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.playPercent&order=descend\n\nDoubt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luminier","date":"2017-02-06T05:23:05.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also because they have some influence over being able to carry a game if their adc fucks up.
