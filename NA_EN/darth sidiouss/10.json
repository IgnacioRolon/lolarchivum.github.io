This guy legit told us in lobby to report him if he didn&#039;t carry us and claimed to be Korean challenger. Then he picks {{champion:67}} and goes jungle. Its one thing to call yourself a smurf and feed but this ? Thank god i had a brain and managed to end the game. From the champion select to the game i was already shaking my head. Its not acceptable to lie about something like that and give your team a false hope only to feed its tilting af.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-01-07T13:48:10.365+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me, this seems like an odd thing to be hung up about.
