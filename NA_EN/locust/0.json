I experiencing the issue where the launcher will sit at 1 file scanned, 0%, and after a few moments the \"Unspecified error\" message will pop up.\r\n\r\nI have researched extensively to try and find a solution. I have been through every suggestion on the help forums, I have disabled any firewall/antivirus I have, reset my ISP/DNS/modem, disabled UAC, tried the repair option, the Hextech repair tool, clean installation, heck, I have even messed around with my Windows updates to see if that was causing the issue. From what I have been able to research, something with the latest Windows 10 update seems to be interfering? I have tried countless things to try and fix this issue, or even make some headway, but no matter what I attempt, I'm always left with my launcher displaying the \"Unspecified Error\" message, usually followed not long after by a bugsplat error.\r\n\r\nI opened a ticket over two ago, and have heard no response or anything on the matter, and I'm rather frustrated. If there is an issue, I can understand, but being left in the dark is what is infuriating. Not to mention a different post claimed that this issue was 100% resolved in NA, yet I continue to experience the issue. I have no idea what to do or what to try anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T23:11:07.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been pretty slammed with tickets lately, so there's a bit of a delay in us getting back to you.
