On your previous punishment, which should be in your email, you were told it was your final warning and the next punishment would result in a permanent account suspension.\n\nThis perma-ban was issued based upon a long history of verbal harassment, not from a single game. This can be a little confusing when looking at the chat log of a single game, but I hope this helps add some clarity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2016-02-25T17:27:29.832+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"Rightfully banned","replies":[{"poster":"Krypton Gorilla","date":"2016-02-25T17:32:27.833+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":16,"body":"You've apparently never stepped foot outside.","replies":[{"poster":"Presently Absent","date":"2016-02-26T03:15:21.303+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's amusing when penalized players try to use this as an excuse for their behavior. League of Legends is a private, moderated environment owned and maintained by Riot.

If you were at the store and you were harassing dozens of other shoppers, you'd expect to be kicked out.

The only reason for you to go straight to permaban and not get any restrictions beforehand is if you use nonaprroved 3rd party software. It clearly states it's because of your behaviour so you are either a repeated offender ( and if so then you deserved it ) or it's a one in a million fluke.
