It started on fb about 2 months ago when reporters proved that some people see shades of colors differently compared to others. Just like scientists have also proved that men see color different compared to women, but then i guess it's for everybody. And it's not just shades obviously, it could be this and you could see a completely different color.\n\nAnd a shout out for all those colorblind out there. I somehow have a bunch of them on my friends list, makes me feel like shit ;l being an artist 'n all, i feel they're srsly missin' out on a bunch of potential.\n\nAn example:\n\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/art/Vocaloid-Duke-of-Purple-178088138\n\nThis is either,\nMagenta,\nviolet,\npink,\nblue, \nor just plain.. Well, purple \n(Or neon purple, if you notice the contrast.)\nAnd in rare cases, gold.\n\nTo me it simply looks like a neon purple.\nWhat do you see?\n\n(Not sure why people down voted this..)","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-07T02:50:01.884+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see a damn good art piece.\n\nLooks like purple with a shade of pink... is that magenta?
