Pretty sure it shouldn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-03T06:12:57.518+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Master Yi's Alpha Strike makes him untargetable for a brief period of time. That allows him to dodge missiles in flight, such as Lulu's W. Missile spells go on CD when the missile launches, hence a situation like that can happen where the spell's on CD but the target isn't affected.","replies":[{"poster":"MungoGeri","date":"2015-03-03T15:51:04.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.  It's also why Lulu's W goes on cooldown when it's blocked by Yasuo's windwall.  It's quite annoying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lwnt","date":"2015-03-03T23:28:38.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel it happen to me so many time. Its the only cc you have in ur kit that can stop him because his ult makes him immune to slow which is the only other form of cc you have. The goal is you dont want that skill go on cooldown or else ur completely useless. The trick is you have to let him alpha strike first then polymorph him so that he cant get any auto attack on you for 2.25s. And make sure your under a  turret or hope your ally can kill him before the duration is done. You should keep in mind the slow on polymorph is useless on him so you will see a fast snowman or cupcake staying right behind you.  Also have a buddy beside you because no way ur weak damage can kill a yi. Also, 2.25s wont be enough because after the duration he only needs to 3 autoattack you and ur dead. So if you have exhaust use it after polymorph and hopefully if ur still alive use polymorph after. But be careful his q is spam-able as he keeps auto attacking. So wait for him to q before ur 2nd polymorph.
