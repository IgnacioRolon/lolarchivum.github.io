I mean I have it because I wanted it, but after playing it, I don&#039;t like it, it needs a rework in my opinion. I find his Arcade Ez one is more of a $30 skin than the actual $30 skin itself. What does the community think?\r\n\r\nPosted from deleted thread.\r\n\r\n&quot;Dunkin Darius (NA) - 35 minutes ago\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not as good because it&#039;s old, like the older legendary skins that are basically just remodels:\r\n\r\nThe Magnificent Twisted Fate\r\nRed Baron Corki\r\nIce Toboggan Corki\r\nAnnie in Wonderland\r\n\r\nI agree, but I believe it&#039;s time for Ez Pulse fire to get an update, Riot actually might lose money (Doubt it) if they don&#039;t update him because of the people who are &quot;new&quot; and buying skins, will see &quot;Pulse fire ez&quot; in game and be like &quot;Ew thats an ugly skin&quot; and they might refrain from buying it, unless you&#039;re like me and buy it because it&#039;s the only skin you&#039;re missing from his set.. I hope they can re-model/rework his pulse fire ez skin to make it feel like it&#039;s more in todays graphics of League of Legends, that would be amazing!&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-05T20:46:26.771+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it looks like you answered it yourself tbh. Pulsefire Ezreal was the first of the ultimate skins, and at it's release it was far outclassing other skins beyond it's league, allthough i do believe there needs to be some for of revision for it, but that's about it... it's an OG skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2016-09-06T02:20:26.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're going to update Pulsefire when they update Ezreal.\nYou'll have to wait for a looooong time.","replies":[]}]}
