I don`t understand what happened to the connection between me and the server. It has made League unplayable for me and sadness ensues D: . Really want to get back with my clan and play more ranked but this ping would have me Bronze 5 in no time.  Hope to get some help ASAP on how to fix it  so i can play again. Please, if anyone has any insight on this issues please respond.","replies":[{"poster":"StevetheSummoner","date":"2017-03-12T06:58:36.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue.
