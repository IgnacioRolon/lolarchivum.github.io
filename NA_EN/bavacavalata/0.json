Victorious comment was in regards to discussing the difference between the two lines and how you can obtain them. \n\nAs mentioned by Mannysmoker, Championship Shyvana and Championship Thresh are legacy, which means it's likely they'll be returning to the store. Championship Riven is limited, and Hippalus [mentioned](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/H004gAPw-ecommerce-qa?comment=00350002), \"Yes I think Championship Riven will come back someday. Most limited edition skins took four years to come back after release, and it's been two years for Riven so far.\" (We're nearing three this season.)","replies":[{"poster":"Archmare","date":"2015-09-02T21:33:34.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"So is it possible for Judgement Kayle to come back?

Limited Edition skins are skins that were temporarily available  during seasonal or special events (either in store or at an event)  then removed once the event was over. \n\nFor example, PAX Sivir is Limited - it was for a special event (PAX), and we don't have plans to bring her back. Victorious skins would also be considered Limited skins because they were handed out for an event, and aren't available again once the season is over\n\nHowever, as mentioned above there is a possibility of bringing Championship Riven back.","replies":[{"poster":"Bavacavalata","date":"2015-09-03T18:01:06.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess i didn't word my question correctly, the Championship skins were first released during their own Worlds patch, just like Kalista in 5.18. So if skins for events are marked as \"Limited\", why is Championship Riven the only \"limited\" and Thresh's and Shyvana's marked at \"Legacy\"? \n\nPlease don't take any offence to this, I really do look up to you guys and all that, but still there are inconsistencies like this that don't make much sense.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-03T18:47:13.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have the answer as to why Championship Riven was Limited (this was way before my time at Riot), but I can give a bit of context into why we've moved to Legacy skins. \n\nThe [big shift](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/plan-vintage-limited-edition-skins) was when we moved from some of the holiday skins over from Limited to Legacy. We felt that generally speaking, skins are about peersonalization and fun, not exclusivity. Making skins Legacy meant that they'd be available for a while, go into the Legacy Vault, and then be brought back periodically. \n\nIf a skin such as Championship Riven was brought back, we'd likely treat it similarly to the Limited -> Legacy switch I'd mentioned above.","replies":[{"poster":"Bavacavalata","date":"2015-09-03T18:50:24.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, that's starting to make a bit more sense!
