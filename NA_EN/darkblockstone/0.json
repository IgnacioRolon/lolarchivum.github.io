This also has made me wonder if because of the client crashing just at the end of the game, does this mean that the points that I would have gained from that match be lost? I have had this problem happen to be quite a few times, and it's starting to get quite frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-20T01:19:58.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll still get the LP after those matches even if the client crashes. I'd first try running a quick repair through the client options, and if you have \"close client during game\" try turning that *off* and test it in a custom game.","replies":[]}]}
