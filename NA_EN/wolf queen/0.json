It sounds like you were faced with a network issue that's preventing a connection to your game server specifically.  If this is continues to happen, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to help get that fixed up.  \n\nIt also sounds like you couldn't communicate the end of the match to the server, which would result in you seeing the reconnect screen even though it was finished.  This is sometimes known as a ghost game.  For this, relogging can force that communication.  Otherwise, you may need to wait it out.  Hopefully, everything is okay now!","replies":[{"poster":"Wolf Queen","date":"2016-08-31T17:46:07.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has gone away now, and im able to play again.

The last match I see for you is yesterday with Riven.  Once the ghost game has been updated by the server to end, we'll know for sure if it saves or not.  If relogging doesn't work, the only other step is to wait it out until that communication is sent.  Ghost games can happen very rarely, but if it does I know it's not fun for anyone.

Will it count as a loss forgiven after the communication is sent? I would hate to lose a promo match because I ended up logging off of that account while the match is \"still reconnecting\".","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T16:13:45.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it does end up as a true ghost game, then the match wouldn't have been recorded to the server.  Meaning, it shouldn't count towards your series.  \n\nRegarding loss prevention in general, this is something that's only usually turned on for widespread issues that effect many players.  In this case, the incident looks isolated.  \n\nHope that helps offer some relief!","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Flowers","date":"2016-08-31T16:15:23.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ÉŽ  CLAP","date":"2016-08-31T14:18:08.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just messing around in a norm I don't care about the loss.
