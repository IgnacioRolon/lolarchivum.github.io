Not only is his ult a useless ult, its like a tibbers but without annies passive, the enemy literally has to sit there afk for the stun to happen. His jg clear is also the worst design i have ever seen. He has to right click a camp then leave the camp and come back to it before he can kill it. I can literally walk up on any jungler and just steal it after he leaves. He is the worst jungler ever made, and here i thought that a rammus/amumu was easy to counter jg...dam Invern is a whole new tier of just god awfully bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Joseph Gladstone","date":"2016-09-22T02:46:48.758+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was born with glass bones and paper skin.
