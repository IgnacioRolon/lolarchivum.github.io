All 3 have a singular lined type of skill shot, and while interesting to know about the damage mitigation, in the mean time unless you were exhausting them to save an ally, or try to, for yourself simply Flashing out of position to avoid the ult completely is better.\n\nFlash out of ult during cast animation, *then* exhaust the caster to help your ally under CC. Now that info would come in handy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"freeformline","date":"2015-02-28T21:28:48.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would guess that it would reduce the damage if applied before the damage is dealt, but I actually do not know.
