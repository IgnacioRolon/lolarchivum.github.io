However, Riot did not mention anything about the particles on Emerald or AotFA Taric actually changing. I know they&#039;re not expensive skins, but since they&#039;re getting visually updated, you might as well give them the appropriate colours for their effects. \r\n\r\nFor Emerald Taric, I know green probably wouldn&#039;t work for clarity purposes (healing spells are usually green) but I think they should be a somewhat lime/yellow colour. It would fit the skin perfectly. \r\n\r\nFor AotFA Taric, just purple/pink. There&#039;s no reason not to have this. \r\n\r\nWe&#039;re not asking for anything  flashy. Just simple recolours of the spells.

Bloodstone Taric should probably get more particles than it has, given that it's a 975 RP skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-04-07T00:18:05.392+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bloodstone Taric actually does have recolored particles.

Because having it remain blue and white, in skins that have their primary colors as pink, green and gold, and black and red, it doesn't make any sense that all the Bastion particles are standard Taric's. And I don't believe you when you say they are changed. The stuns have different particles, but the art team seems to have dropped the ball on everything else.\n\nLet me put it another way: You *know* you did something wrong when you changed something and people tell you they can't see the change. It feels so strange to play Emo Taric when my gem shields aren't any different from the base skin, and it feels even stranger when I'm told that they're *supposed* to be different.","replies":[{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2016-04-07T01:13:56.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably for the same reason that they left the speed gate blue on Forsaken Jayce. \n\nRed Particles = Enemy\n\nBlue Particles = Ally","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2016-04-07T01:16:04.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except the gem shroud has absolutely no clarity issues at all.
