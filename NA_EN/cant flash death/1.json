I recently traveled to China so i downloaded the Chinese LOL client to play league there. Now i am back in NA and i want to play league  on NA. Yesterday my NA client worked perfectly fine, but today, whenever i load a game from the regular client, the Tencent logo pops up and the Chinese client loads. This wouldnt be a problem but I cant read Chinese! Thank you for your help.\r\n\r\n(I dont want to uninstall the Chinese Client but if thats the case then so be it. Any help is appreciated)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T16:17:04.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client you are using now is a totally different from the NA client.  You'll have to[ re-download](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload) league to gain access to the NA region.  I'm not sure if your current client would be overwritten, but I'm assuming not since they are independent clients.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
