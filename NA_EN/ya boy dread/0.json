Then press restore.\nThe old Launcher should appear on your desktop, and you might have to delete the beta launcher icon if you want to. If the old launcher still does not work, then try running it as admin. I did it and it worked. I hope it works for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ya Boy Dread","date":"2017-01-23T03:19:24.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And when I log into the Alpha Client, my PLAY button in the corner, the client is scanning, what appears to be every file in the game, why?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T05:30:29.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a background update. I'd recommend letting that run if you've already got it up and running. In order to get your legacy client working again, I'd recommend launching League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (right-click, *run as administrator*) to ensure League has the right operating permissions.\n\nIf you see further issues after taking those steps, let me know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HÃ­tlerDidNtWrong","date":"2017-01-23T23:54:27.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried to launch legacy client after playing a game and it seemed to update the legacy client of all things and now it doesn't work.\nSome people actually like to use item sets riot, fix your damn game.","replies":[]}]}
