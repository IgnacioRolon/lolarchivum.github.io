Please, for the love of god and all things holy please, please, PLEASE don&#039;t. I want to be able to play Talon after the rework without being called a meta slave, or people saying the only reason I did well is because Talon is broken. I want to actually make it through a champion select without him being banned or taken. \r\n\r\nPlease just remember the people who played the champion PRE rework when you rework the champ; keep them in mind because we all play our mains for a reason, and it would suck if that was taken away. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Rivini","date":"2016-08-07T06:48:06.036+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{champion:90}} FEEL OUR _**PAIN!**_","replies":[{"poster":"japan hate acc","date":"2016-08-07T07:44:07.220+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, I felt SO bad for the Malzahar mains after the rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-08-07T10:49:32.170+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"He was so much more healthy as a permapush bot.
