Her FPS, which usually is 100-200, dropped to 20 and stayed there. Also, her client has been extremely laggy since her FPS was stuck at 20 for multiple games. \n\nShe tried almost everything, but it only fixed her issue a tiny bit. It's gotten better she says, but it's still an issue and her client is still extremely laggy. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T22:31:16.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has your friend recently updated Windows?  Her drivers may be out of date and her may PC may just need a general tune-up.  I'd suggest she goes over our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to get things fixed up.\n\nIf she still continues to lag, running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for those specific games can help figure out what's going wrong, in addition to troubleshooting steps for it.
