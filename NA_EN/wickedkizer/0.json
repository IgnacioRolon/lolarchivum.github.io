HEXAKILL PERMANENTLY!","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"Hello to the team at Riot Games. \r\n\r\nJust wanted to say you guys are Awesome and LoL is Awesome. However, Hexakill is a Loved game mode by many of the player base and I think everyone would Love LoL even more if Hexakill was Permanently a playable game mode. I primarily play the 5v5 Summoner&#039;s rift because its Awesome and has a good amount of people.  Twisted treeline is an Awesome map but the 3v3 just isn&#039;t as Fun as 6v6 Hexakill and should either be replaced or just add Hexakill Permanently with it. I bet if the 3v3 was replaced with 6v6 (if that would make it an easy change) no one would be mad. I say make a Vote on making Hexakill Permanent and let the players decide, even give us the choice to Vote if we&#039;d rather have 3v3 or 6v6 Hexakill if that makes the Update Patch easier for you. So please team at Riot Games listen to us, your fateful players of LoL, and make the Awesomeness of Hexakill Permanent!\r\n\r\nWickedKizer signing off.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-09-20T06:26:04.484+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I think everyone would Love LoL even more if Hexakill was Permanently a playable game mode. \n\nWhy don't people ever learn from Dominion's removal ffs.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T06:22:43.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'ma be honest... you are the first person i've seen say they enjoy hexakill mainly on Twisted Treeline.
