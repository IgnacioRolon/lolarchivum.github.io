I am Poppy. Welcome to my office.\n{{champion:78}} As I grow bored this day, I shall assist the champions that frequent the bottom lane.\n{{champion:78}} This will amuse me.\n{{champion:78}} Next.\n{{champion:22}} Poppy.\n{{champion:37}} ...\n{{champion:78}} What is your grievance?\n{{champion:22}} She won&#039;t communicate with me Poppy. Not one word.\n{{champion:78}} And why is this?\n{{champion:22}} She is a mute. She has no voice. This is the problem.\n{{champion:78}} Is this true, girl?\n{{champion:37}} ...\n{{champion:78}} Girl. When I speak to you, you will answer me.\n{{champion:37}} ...\n{{champion:78}} You dare disobey me? Perhaps I shall become Lollipoppy this day. Do you wish to gaze into the eyes of pure malice?!\n{{champion:37}} No Poppy! Don&#039;t-! Wait... my voice... I can speak!\n{{champion:78}} Fear can move mountains, girl.\n{{champion:78}} I see no further issue here.

He&#039;s a cute doggy, but he eats so much.\n{{champion:96}} Feast!\n{{champion:16}} He&#039;s eating my bananas almost as quickly as I throw them! And he just goes crazy when he&#039;s around his favorite treat. Yordles...\n{{champion:96}} YUM.\n{{champion:78}} Turn your gaze away from me, stray.\n{{champion:78}} _Or you will hunger no more._\n{{champion:96}} FEAST! GAHH!\n{{champion:16}} No! Down Koggles! Down boy! Don&#039;t bite!\n{{champion:16}} Don&#039;t bit- Wait. Please no. Don&#039;t do this...\n{{champion:16}} I BEG YOU! DON&#039;T!\n{{champion:16}} You... you bit off the head. You&#039;ve consumed the body whole. I see the darkness here!\n{{champion:16}} You&#039;re a creature! A monster from the void! You&#039;re going to consume us all! I see it all, now!\n{{champion:78}} You flatter me, my dear.\n{{champion:78}} Now, you&#039;re going to need a new marksman. Sivir, come.\n{{champion:15}} I heard my name.\n{{champion:15}} What happened here?! Soraka is sobbing uncontrollably and you&#039;re covered in blood! Poppy, are you injured?\n{{champion:78}} Ha.\n{{champion:78}} Haha.\n{{champion:78}} GAHAHAHA.\n{{champion:78}} There is only one weapon on this realm that may harm me...\n{{champion:78}} _And I use it as my toothpick._\n{{champion:78}} But on topic, this goat needs a new partner. Are you allergic to bananas?\n{{champion:15}} No...\n{{champion:78}} I see no further issue here. Leave me.\n{{champion:15}} Come Soraka, you can tell me about why you&#039;re crying.\n{{champion:16}} I have witnessed the darkness... the darkness...\n{{champion:78}} Next.\n{{champion:81}} Poppy.\n{{champion:78}} What is your grievance?\n{{champion:81}} It&#039;s my support. He won&#039;t... LEAVE me alone.\n{{champion:81}} Ever.\n{{champion:81}} Not even when I bathe.\n{{champion:81}} In fact, he&#039;s here right now. But hidden.\n{{champion:78}} None may hide from me. What use is concealing your physical body...\n{{champion:78}} _When I can see into your soul?_\n{{champion:78}} Come out, Taric.\n{{champion:44}} Forgive my rudeness, Poppy.\n{{champion:81}} There!

Poppy! Do not let him take me! Do you know mercy?!\n{{champion:78}} No.\n{{champion:78}} I see no further issue here. Leave me.\n{{champion:81}} Help me! Someone!\n{{champion:44}} Oh Ezreal.
