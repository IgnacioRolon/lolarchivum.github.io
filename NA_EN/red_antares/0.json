I just recently wanted to play a game on dynamic queue but after champ select the game crashed and had to close it, while trying to rejoin, the game seem to have crashed again, and opened a new client but it didn't sent me to the rejoin page, and when I wanted to play again I got this error, after a few client restarts I got something called leave buster asking to type that I wont leave games again, am I going to get banned or something? I couldn't even join the game so I was wondering what can I do to prevent this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T21:24:27.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The warning message you got is not meant to threaten you with a ban. It's simply a message to let you know that disconnections affect everyone in the match, and a trend of disconnections can result in low priority queues on your account.\n\nThe \"Oof!\" error is often a result of your client not being able to maintain a stable connection to the server. As a first step, I recommend working through the steps outlined in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). \n\nLet me know if you continue to have issues after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
