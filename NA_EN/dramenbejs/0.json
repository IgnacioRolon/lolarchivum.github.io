I mean, they will lose a lot more money in the long run, but nice try guys, keep it up.\n\nThis same copy pasta conspiracy needs to stop. Internet cafe industry died in China a few years back, because contrary to what everyone likes to believe that China somehow has no personal computers or something, people indeed were playing games at home which caused the collapse of the local internet cafe industry.\n\nIts resurgence the last couple years were however, less about people wanting to game at the internet cafes, but more about people trying to watch video game tournaments live with other gamers.\n\nNot to mention, Dota/Dota2 is and has always been super popular in China more than anywhere else in the world. Dota's longer game length never bothered Chinese players, why would League's already faster pacing since its dawn remotely bother them? This constantly thrown around claim that Chinese players want shorter games is utter nonsense, because it does not add up to what's actually happening at all.\n\nThis kind of \"let's blame China just because it's easy, and we'll make up bullshit to rationalise it\" needs to end.\n\nIf anything, it is more likely that Riot is led by the Korean's habit of playing than Chinese players. Because it is very true that Korean players rarely ever touch Dota and similar games with longer game sessions, as well as use internet cafes more routinely than Chinese players for whatever reason. So if you have to blame someone, at least start with the more likely candidate.\n\nBut whatever you want to speculate, this game's current state is simply due to Riot turning it into a TV show and a serious hard on for esports. Esports is what killed this game, as it has done with MANY others. Your silly little blame game can take a backseat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wizard Blaze","date":"2018-11-26T21:46:01.689+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"its well known Chinese company's ruin the products. im saying it for days. in Chinese Quantity is over Quality","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-11-27T09:59:59.981+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"But the Chinese company has owned Riot for years and years, it's not new.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2018-11-27T00:43:16.912+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I always thought the internet cafe thing was already a well established theory already, it was quite obvious ever since S6 or so onwards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-11-26T19:27:29.985+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":37,"body":"Edit: You know, I have to admit, I was wrong here.
