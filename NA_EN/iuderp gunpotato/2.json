The text \"Failed to load URL \"https://riot:xfb2SaEeaKzpuZDQZiNBxg@127.0.0.1:49305/index.html\"\" appears on the top of the screen. Clicking the link in the client does nothing, and the text cannot be selected. Clicking the link in the preview while typing this gives a message that the area the link goes to is insecure, and people might try to steal my information there, i'm not sure if that's relevant or not, but I think it is worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nDeleting the page via Windows Task Manager then attempting to boot league again gives a message saying that league is already running, which it is not, and thus i cannot boot up league. Restarting the computer fixes this latter problem, and usually the white screen problem as well, but unfortunately it sometimes does not fix the \"Failed to load\" problem.\r\n\r\nI am tired of occasionally being wholly unable to play league some days because the login screen won't load. Does anyone know the solution to this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-29T22:22:28.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm...
