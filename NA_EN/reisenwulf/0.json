Then in my third match for the day, our Midlaner is AFK from the beginning of the match and never left fountain. We lose, royally, and I get knocked back down to 0 LP. This does not seem balanced or fair.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-10-25T15:35:17.880+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't balanced. LP gains aren't intended to be balanced bc rank and mmr numbers aren't balanced to be the same. They used to be in season 1 and 2 I think where you would just have had a lower rank currently rather than losing so much more than you gain. I think I'm getting close to even now bc I'm not really better than most of the people I play with (25ish gains, 20ish losses) but when I was doing really well and really climbing I earned 25-30 LP per win and lost 10-15 LP loss. Removing games that involve an afk would change stuff but I don't know that it would fix much. You don't win LP for being on a 5v4 team, you don't lose it being on a 4v5. It works fine but what does it change?","replies":[{"poster":"Reisenwulf","date":"2015-10-25T15:43:57.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It changes the feeling of playing the game. Even if on the MMR end of things its net zero, it would be a more positive experience for the player, since they aren't being punished because of someone else. Losing the match because of an AFK sucks, but falling so far down in the ranks sucks much more. The ranking is supposed to be a reflection of how good YOU are, it shouldn't be negatively impacted by something that can't be overcome, like having an AFK.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-10-25T17:40:46.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except I wasn't referring to MMR being net zero. In fact what I was referring to isn't a net zero anyway if you think about it, I was just trying to be polite and not say that almost any system I have seen proposed to solve this issue either A) can be replaced by just giving players free LP points after they play a certain number of total games regardless of win or loss (I can explain this if you need but that's what happens if you don't lose LP but the winning team still wins it), or B) rewards less skilled players more than it does more skilled players, and is actually just a handicap system for bad players rather than a solution to a sucky situation.\n\nTLDR; If no one wins or loses the game then players who are climbing lose more LP per game they don't win and save less LP per game they don't lose then players who are falling or staying even, so bad players are rewarded more. If no one loses LP, but the winning team gains LP then you don't need to have the system, just give players free LP every X number of games played regardless of win/loss. Either way the solutions I've seen are bad for ranked.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2015-10-26T16:45:01.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep a stat-sheet of every game I play.

Instead of 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 it would be 1/4, 3/8, 1/2.\n\nJust throwing out ideas. Makes it more competitive for the enemy team to figure out if there -is- a DC and instead of murdering everybody for KDA and prolonging the game, it makes them want to finish faster while the enemy team wants to defend it longer.
