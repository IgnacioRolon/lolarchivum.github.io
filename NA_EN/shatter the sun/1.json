Its a zilean ult that restores mana/health and does what zhonyas does and is cheaper than it. \n\nAre they similar? Sure. But that still doesnt mean there cant be a QSS item for them. {{item:3091}} is another \"defensive/offensive\" option as it offers MR and shredding.\n\nThe point is riot has been trying to make things even in terms of items. This would just be another one of those things. If the active of QSS is that valuable that AP champs are willing to have less damage and get useless stats for it then it should be in both categories. If it was a tank items that offered tank stats then I wouldnt really question it as both could take it and benefit from it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-02-08T03:04:46.319+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"9/10 times GA is not going to be used how you described, whereas zhonyas can be used a lot more liberally","replies":[{"poster":"Shatter the Sun","date":"2018-02-08T04:10:44.068+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hibeki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yW7coPxG,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-08T03:04:46.319+0000)\n>\n> 9/10 times GA is not going to be used how you described, whereas zhonyas can be used a lot more liberally\n\nI understand that.

Zhonyas takes a lot more thought to use well but has less cooldown and better stats. \n\nI think a qss item for mages would be good if it had minor offensive buffs kind of like ga does for ad. Maybe like 50 ap and 50% health regen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-02-08T01:39:38.507+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"why is there no AD hourglass?\n\nsame argument.","replies":[{"poster":"Shatter the Sun","date":"2018-02-08T02:12:42.544+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AirKingNeo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yW7coPxG,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-02-08T01:39:38.507+0000)\n>\n> why is there no AD hourglass?\n> \n> same argument.\n\nthere is a ad hourglass called GA.
