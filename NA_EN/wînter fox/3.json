The emphasis on post-6 ganks has made his kit - completely in favour of post-6 ganks - rise to the top. I read that on PBE the starting magic damage on Devourer is going from 40 down to 25, so hopefully that should make him less oppressive than he is now and quell the whining.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-25T07:28:48.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not why at all.
