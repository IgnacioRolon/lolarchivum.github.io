I still had the cd of my GA up, and I thought the enemy team would appreciate a little bunny girl show while we all wait for their inevitable loss at the hands of the Exile. All was right in the world. \r\n\r\nThen all of a sudden their giant ass purple pet bull decides to rush at me, knock me up and into their fountain. Everything was still all good because they would lose before my GA revives me...or so I thought! But I died immediately! Giving that cow a free kill for **no reason**! Riot...seriously wtf bro. Why doesn&#039;t GA pop on the enemy fountain??","replies":[{"poster":"Urf Mode Is Life","date":"2016-11-27T00:07:58.338+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"because you shouldnt be near their fountain ever... regardless... unless youre a tool bag who likes to sit near the nexus while it dies and dance","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-27T00:10:51.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be wasted since you would die immediately after reviving.\n\nThis way, it lets you save the cooldown on Guardian's Angel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-11-27T00:11:21.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if your GA popped, I doubt that you're revival will still make you survive.  Saves time.  Cuz you'll die.  GA will revive you... then you'll die immediately again most likely. Fountain ignores ALL revives.
