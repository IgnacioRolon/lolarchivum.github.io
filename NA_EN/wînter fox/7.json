I think you need the burst to be a threat in more situations besides her damage over time is not bad with a normal AP build either. So I'd go Magus unless you need to kill a super tank and for some reason he will hold still and lose to you (and maybe then only if you already have void staff and he doesn't have warden's mail...)\n\nMaybe Devourer should not have gotten nerfed quite as hard as it did. It's just so niche now; so few champions can viably benefit from devourer compared to warrior now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePlasticSpork","date":"2014-12-25T01:29:33.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easily magus. The stats it and its build parts give you mean stronger ganks as opposed to the daggers you build while on your way to devourer. This makes it easier to snowball early.\n\nFurthermore, magus increases the damage of all of your offensive spells, including your passive, and provides CDR so you can cast those spells more often. It also increases the strength of your shield, bolstering Diana's tankiness. \n\nPerhaps most notably, Diana probably wouldn't survive a teamfight long enough with that particular build to get a ton of autoattacks in. \n\nThe only way I could see a devourer Diana is if you were to do some strange tanky build, and that that point there's no reason to not play any of the other tanks that are viable with devourer. It does sound like a quirky kind of fun, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xtremey","date":"2014-12-25T01:11:23.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i go magus because i shoot for 1k ap on every ap jungler i play nowadays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2014-12-25T01:10:18.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before the devourer nerfs it was 50/50, since then it's magus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2014-12-24T18:09:18.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Magus personally, In most fights, the most you'll get off is one passive proc, so you try to make it as big of a hit as you possibly can. I used to run devourer, but honestly, Diana's late game is already monstrous as it is, she doesn't really need the stacks from devourer to do well in late game. \n\nDiana can be run as both a sustained damager (devourer) or bursty (magus), but I think her bursty nature is so much better, if she ganks a lane and she hits a Q on you with no gap closer, you're dead, period. Even if they have a gap closer, she's still capable of dashing to them again afterwards. \n\nPlus 20% CDR so early on, once you hit 6, its stupid easy to stick to targets since your Q is on such a low cooldown at rank 5. Diana's main weakness is the fact she has a weak early game and semi weak mid-game assuming you don't get ahead. In my opinion, the Magus completely removes that element of her weakness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2014-12-24T17:25:41.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"definitely magus.  it's soooo good right now. \n\nmagus puts your ult on a really short cooldown so you can chain gank as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2014-12-25T03:20:21.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It depends how you build and play her. As a bursty assassin, I'd go for Magus for the AP and CDR. If you use Nashor's and go for more AA/Bruiser then Devourer is good. It's preference really, but I'd say Magus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-12-24T17:57:06.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Devourer would be an excellent choice for on hit Diana with a nashor's tooth and some Mpen, but Magus is far better for a bursty Diana. Personally, I think burst Diana is a bit stronger, since part of her passive is that she has awful base AS (meaning AS ratios from items don't scale well) in exchange for getting 20% free AS at level 1, so I would say magus will probably be a bit stronger if you want to kill people. If you want an AP/on-hit bruiser Diana, the definitely go for Devourer, just don't expect to kill as many people.","replies":[]}]}
