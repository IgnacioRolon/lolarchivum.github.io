He's not fun to lane against, nobody likes dealing with his shrooms now that oracles is gone, and his team doesn't like having him because you're basically forfeiting a strong teamfight phase in the hopes that Teemo's lane opponent will be similarly useless because they got shutdown. \n\nThere's also the fact that the dude has way too many skins, already.

He has poke that is annoying but you can easily 1v1 teemo even as someone who auto atks a lot. Hes a bad champ all around if you know how to play against him. It's just annoying when you get a penta kill and teemo shroom is there to kill you like wtf.
