Adding a skill shot and small delay to it would help in both of these areas. \r\nSomething like, Annie throws her teddy, sticking to the first champ hit. After a small delay tibbers appears doing aoe dmg and stunning those in the area(if she had her stun charged to do so).\r\nThis would add some form of skill to a champ that needs little to no mechanical skill to use. \r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"TheSlogs","date":"2016-03-08T03:42:24.412+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: it is a skillshot, just w/o delay\n2: you would actually make Annie a useless champion if you were to just flat out gut her like that w/o compensation\n3: +0 points for originality","replies":[{"poster":"Tayl","date":"2016-03-08T03:44:47.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"So adding some form of skill and counterplay to her would be gutting her?

When you add delay to things, they scale very quickly from good to very bad. Take for example, the change to Gragas's Q back when he was dominant as an AP mage. They only changed one thing, one very simple thing. They added a delay to his damage on the Q, forcing you to wait for it to do all of its damage. That one single change put him into the dumps until he was picked up again in S5 because he worked as a tank. Annie isn't even as popular as Gragas was, and is definitely seeing less comp. play.\nSo, when you add a delay to Annie's R, you gut her. Her ult is already predictable enough, with an easy to keep track of cooldown, and the range of which makes for clear indication when she is using it. Not to mention the counterplay of buying {{item:3140}} and all other MR items, which you are blatantly ignoring with this post.\nSo again, putting a delay like Fizz's ult would gut Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"Tayl","date":"2016-03-08T04:04:21.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lol qss which is primarily build on adc's does not save them from annies burst. A simple R,Q,W and they are dead regardless of the qss active or not. \nGrags barrel isnt comparable here. It is a non ultimate ability that was doing the same dmg as some ults.

Both what you are suggesting and what happened to Gragas are delays of the effects of a spell. Regardless of whether it is an ultimate or a Q, you are still changing it. And as you claim that the Gragas change needed to happen, you claim the Annie change needs to happen. Don't talk if you can't avoid such logical fallacies.","replies":[{"poster":"Tayl","date":"2016-03-08T04:17:56.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah so Annie deserves an instant Aoe burst/sustain dmg/ stun ult? If you cant react to something in the game then it shouldnt be in the game. Gragas barrels you can see coming, while also having enough time to react and dodge.

Of course there are others but I don't want to take three years making a complete list.\n\nAlso a note on your first sentence: it's not news that Annie has an AoE stun damage burst.

She does need much of anything because in high elo and middle tier elo they can exploit her weaknesses as well as playing to her strengths she has counter play in the fact that if u wait/bait the stun then she cant do much. flash is almost 100% NEEDED to land a good tibbers which when her flash is down she is extremely slow without a reliable gap closer. She is also one of the more squishy champs in the game even if she builds ROD so if u can get on top of her and kill her she is useless. And like other have posted in the comments below itemize against her its a vital part to the game regardless of the champ you itemize against. If the item is strong against X champion why wouldn't you buy it, even if QSS \"wouldn't\" save you as you've stated numerous times it still allows you to flash away or dash away and if timed correct can save you or if your strong enough kill Annie thus saving your team. If you are having a hard time against Annie I recommend start playing her so you can get a feel for her strengths and weaknesses so you can better your understanding of what to do against her and what not to do against her. I've done this with many champions I have a hard time playing against and it has improved my play by a large margin. I do believe riot has stated that they are happy with the state Annie in and don't play on changing her anytime soon so I thing you should just learn her weaknesses and exploit them.\n \n\nItems that are good against annie \n1 {{item:3140}} \n2{{item:3156}} \n3{{item:3111}} \n4{{item:3102}} \n5{{item:3065}} \n\nChampions good against Annie\n1.{{champion:63}} \n2.{{champion:14}} \n3.{{champion:61}} \n4.{{champion:99}} \n5.{{champion:3}} \n\nChampions Bad against Annie\n1.{{champion:84}} \n2.{{champion:157}} \n3.{{champion:105}} \n4.{{champion:7}} \n5.{{champion:238}} \n\nI hope ive informed you or someone of what to do with annie and how she is currently stable in her current state ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nanaba","date":"2016-03-08T03:45:05.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as Tibbers still apears despite a miss— not terrible.
