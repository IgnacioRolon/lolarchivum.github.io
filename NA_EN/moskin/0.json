English is not my native language)\nSo my problem is in the title. I have this issue (timer reaches zero and stops) way too long since January 2016 till now. Tried a lot of things to fix it but the result always was unsuccessful. However in the end of December 2016 (In the interval from 20 to 25 number of) there was an update that decided my problem. I was playing without troubles till next update (it was in the end of January) and that freeze came back and it got worse. If earlier I had a chance to start match without freeze so now it is 100% that I get it. \nThe worst when it happens before my pick. In this case I have 2 options: \n1. Freeze lasts about a minute and I can pick champion if I keep within the allotted time. \n2. Leaver\n\nA little better, but not much if freeze happens after my pick (usually when all picked their champions). Need to relog If I want to play. Last month client always reudates after the freeze because he does the new version rollback. Again I have 2 options:\n1. I have time to reconnect to the game\n2. Remake ---> leaver (got it 3 times) (Ok this is the worst)\n\nSo I would be very happy if you have a working version of how to fix the problem\nWith a hope and a little bit of melancholy\nMoskin\n\nP.S.
