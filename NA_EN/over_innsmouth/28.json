I look forward greatly with both eagerness and anxiety to see what you have planned for him and everyone else, but I&#039;d personally feel a little cheated if Blood Lord Vlad ended up having the same particle effects as Classic.\r\n\r\nAny plans to let **the skies rain red** in their own glory?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-02-26T14:33:30.318+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blood Lord Vlad will indeed have a unique animation as well as unique FX.
