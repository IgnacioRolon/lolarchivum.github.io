His core theme of health costs and health costless sustain kind of prevents him from achieving &quot;true balance&quot;, but that&#039;s who he is and his identity takes precedence over his health as a gameplay element. He&#039;ll always be a little bit of a bitch to deal with, but that doesnt mean we shouldnt work together to remove as much toxicity from his kit as possible. The MYMU honestly looked really promising for him - since it was more of a &quot;how can we make Vlad less obnoxious to play against&quot; than a &quot;how can we further explore Vlad&#039;s identity&quot; like it was with others such as Malzahar and Vel&#039;Koz.\r\n\r\nI guess the point of this post is this; are you guys over at Riot considering moving Vlad into the same position as post-Juggernaut Mordekaiser - where he&#039;s going to be looked at for an individual update later down the line - or are you going to do to him what you did pre-MYMU and just nerf him into the ground until he doesnt even need to pool anymore to avoid taking hits - because he&#039;ll be a liability to his team.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether he&#039;s my main or not, that&#039;s a shitty thing to do to a Champion just because they&#039;re a pain to balance. I understand you nerfing old Poppy or old Yorick into the ground because a) they were confirmed for big reworks all along and b) they were infinitely more toxic to play against than old Vlad or new Vlad ever were, but nerfing a Champion just because they&#039;re a pain to balance and leaving them in that state is...not the type of future players and Rioters should be striving for.\r\n\r\nSo, to ask my question again, if you&#039;re still dishing out Vlad nerfs does that mean you have greater, future plans for him - or are you going to leave him in the gutter until some change to itemization makes him relevant and toxic as all hell again?\r\n\r\nHumbly Yours,\r\nTides of Blood","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-23T23:02:16.776+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's weird how they're nerfing his most balanced ability, and the one that is the least impactful early game.

The promise of a tanky build removes one counterplay possibility of burst especially in conjunction with his insta pool. Of course I don't believe he should be total glass either or it would be difficult to fulfill his sustain vampire carry fantasy.\n\nI guess it's worse his new core sustain multiplier is now a full tank item. {{item:3065}} \n\nThe rework was a mild success in that it made his E make sense. He actually has a kinda higher skill cap from that resulting from combination of holding his E during pool or flashes, rather than fire forget e stack spam. He feels more mindful to play than he actaully looks [in teamfights] because you wanna cycle his cooldowns and defensive tools to maximize your lifetime while deciding where to be and dmg.\n\nMid Vlad has always been problematic to balance though. The lane is short and tiny and he has range and a slip away tool that makes him very hard to shutdown short of insanely hard aggressive trades. HP sustain inherently counters a lot of mid laners as they tend to be on the squishier side. He definitely wasn't a liability on the team pre-reworked picked to abuse safe counter matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-08-24T06:34:23.269+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup. Vlad has always been an excellent stone wall against Assassins and other snowballers if the Vlad player knew how to survive and outscale without losing lane.\n\nGiven that outside of his ultimate though, Vlad's damage abilities consist of a single-target that only does real damage half the time (at most) a shitty AoE dot that drains his own health to use, and a really powerful but blockable AoE burst that drains even more of his own health to use, I don't think Vlad being as tanky as he is damage-y is unreasonable. He has no cc or mobility, so him being a walking ball of killing and nigh-unkillableness is fair I think.\n\nThey've already reverted his passive back to the pre-MYMU state, where it heavily favoured AP builds. They've buffed the AP ratio on his Q while nerfing the bases. I'm almost certain this is just \"we don't want Vlad at Worlds so we're gutting him\" on Riot's part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-08-24T06:35:48.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, the majority of mid picks can punish him early, and are safe enough that he can't touch them without flashing. \n\nCompetitively speaking, at least. \n\nHe actually has to be at risk a little when wave-clearing, unlike pretty much any other meta mid-laner. That more than makes up for the fact that he has healing (that takes 15+ seconds to fill you up if you can't completely top off from 1 CR proc).\n\n\n______\n\n\nThe E nerfs I can see, since he rushes HP items early on, generally. I don't see why they're nerfing his Q in addition. Healing can hardly be considered his problem atm. Its his early trading and E's waveclear even with low ranks, if anything.

Although memory is not my forte.\n\nThey've tweaked his ultimate to be more selfish though, what with the self-heal pops. If they just stripped off the damage amp and buffed the damage and the pop-heals, I think it'd suit his role better as a Drain-Tank Mage.\n\nAs far as I can tell though, people mostly complain about Crimson Rush when they talk about Vlad (nevermind that it introduced a far healthier gameplay pattern than before which was just endless E-Qing with Spell Vamp negating any and all costs). \"Wah wah heals for half his health on one spell\".\n\nAnyway, you're kinda right, but at the same time I really, really don't want Vladimir to become a support Champ, and I personally think he needs a full level rework given how old his kit still feels post-MYMU (though the new particles on E still feel juicy).","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-08-24T09:07:56.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate Vlad because he wins DPS fights and doesn't die to burst. ADCs are countered by burst so they can't deal their sustained damage, Juggernauts are are melee and are easily kited so they can't do their damage. Vlad is an unholy combination of both.\n\nVlad is A) Ranged, so he doesn't suffer nearly as much as a melee despite being moderately short ranged\n\nB) Rylai's is so synergistic its disgusting. You don't get the option to run form Vlad without burning important CDs after he builds Rylai's.\n\nC) Virtually resourceless. I despise Health costs because they often don't mean anything. Big whoop his E costs 2.5-10% of his Max HP, what does that matter when his Q just heals him back up. You have to constantly fight Vlad just so he doesn't get back up to full and mana based champions just can't handle that early when he's weak and he bullies out melees top.\n\nD) Has such a huge teamfight presence with his ult, but cannot be dealt with 1v1 mid-late. \n\nE) The only counter is Grevious Wounds where the only reliable source is Executioners and good luck having anyone who is AD build that on your team. Morello is worse because it requires the target to be 40% or less and you're not getting Vlad to 40% or less as an AP who builds Morello, aka burst mages most often.\n\nI'll agree that he's moderately better than before with WotA, but relative to the of the champions, he's still pretty cancer.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-08-24T12:05:20.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I hate Vlad because he wins DPS fights and doesn't die to burst. \n\nSo you hate Vlad because of what he's designed to be. That's fine, I hate Ekko because he was designed as a \"utility assassin\" (two words that should never be together). His job is to damage soak and drain-tank.\n\n> ADCs are countered by burst so they can't deal their sustained damage\n\n...Yes, this is true, though I fail to see how this is relevant. You just said Vlad wins DPS fights. He's not a burst mage in any sense, he enjoys extended battles of attrition that he can outsustain. Vlad does not beat ADCs with his \"burst\" because he does not have burst.\n\nVlad gets outsustained by any ADC with a Bloodthirster. His only reliable heal (Crimson Rush) has a minimum CD of 6 seconds at its best point in the game, whereas ADC's can pump out Lifestealing AA's and crits more than six times as quickly.\n\n> Rylai's is so synergistic its disgusting. You don't get the option to run form Vlad without burning important CDs after he builds Rylai's.\n\nNot really Vlad's fault, though I can see where you're coming from and personally agree that Rylai's passive needs a bit of a change at least.\n\n> Virtually resourceless. I despise Health costs because they often don't mean anything\n\nHealth cost Champions are designed differently from mana costs Champions, same for Energy and Resourceless. Of the 5 health-cost Champions ({{champion:266}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:82}} ), none of them are burst-based, they're all short-ranged DPSers. Of them, three of them lack hard cc and mobility, and another one of them is total trash. \n\nIn regards to Vlad specifically, yeah, it's not meant to feel like he's killing himself with his own costs. His entire theme is based around self-sustaining, not slow suicide by abilities.\n\n> Has such a huge teamfight presence with his ult, but cannot be dealt with 1v1 mid-late.\n\nHe absolutely is not a be-all-end-all 1v1 monster in the mid-lategame. Any Champion with a moderate combination of AS, AD, and Lifesteal will beat him (aforementioned ADC's, Irelia and Jax, Master Yi, Yasuo, Tryndamere). His teamfight presence is nothing to speak of. He contributes less to a teamfight than the average support Champion, especially since landing any more than a 2-man Haemoplague gets increasingly difficult the better the enemy team is.\n\n> Grevious Wounds\n\nGrevious Wounds as a whole shouldnt exist. It's a shitty solution to Riot's shitty balancing of healing and results in shitty gameplay patterns where healers are gods when no one builds and and are complete shit when people do. Riot needs to rebalance all healing based Champions individually and remove Grevious Wounds.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-08-24T13:36:24.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> So you hate Vlad because of what he's designed to be.

You just can't stop Vlad from sustaining in laning phase.\n\n> His teamfight presence is nothing to speak of.

Damage amps aren't a joke and lets Vlad live considerably longer through the HP restore on pop. After that he can just live as long as humanly possible to draw focus or he'll do a lot of damage.\n\n>Grevious Wounds as a whole shouldnt exist.\n\nI lack the insight on this personally.
