That means you could build as a bruiser and be the front-liner against that enemy in a teamfight, and since you're at the front and effectively immortal to the people (you didn't specify it affecting only one person at a time, which is important because if they're winning then more than one can get fed) who are probably doing the most damage, they can't really engage - especially if the kit also has hard CC pre-packaged into it. \n\nA champion who counters snowballing is also incredibly niche in the first place, as that means that he relies on the enemy doing well for the greatest value of his kit to shine through, which is a pretty bad proposition to be in as a whole. You effectively just added damage reduction that stacks the further ahead they are, and then paired it with Bounty Hunter's gold-on-death from his ult from DotA2.

The support who gets no kills can still do normal damage compared to that one fed Vayne.\n\nAnd usually the one taking the debuff is the guy that's MEANT to carry games, which means it also teaches your team to be careful by making them defend the carry properly.\n\nI just made this passive because some people need to learn their common day to day mistakes, instead of spending 500 posts in the forums complaining about bad team mates.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2016-09-03T23:30:38.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Defend the carry prop- bro, you made the carry just outright 5-50% less effective against you in terms of damage in a way that had no prior interaction with you in the slightest. \"Better be careful or I might make the mistake of getting that kill!\" Of course it's going to be most effective against the carries of the game, they're the ones that are supposed to be killing you - why are you penalizing them for them doing their job properly and getting kills? It's great that the support will be doing normal damage - because it's not like they're usually a big damage threat past the early game anyway. \"Their Vayne is only 50% effective against me, but I'd better watch out for the full brunt of that Braum's fury!\" \n\nThere are better ways to teach people to rectify their common mistakes than by making yourself an effective deity against them in a way that had no interaction with you at all and making them more valuable to the enemy team than they already are because they're actually doing well. Cocky or not, this passive is a bad idea for League. It's still only effective if the enemy team is ahead, and if they are, then it's ridiculously powerful because you're halving their damage, on top of your own defensive stats, because of a thing they were supposed to do. \n\nThis is punishing them for doing well - this is the mistake that Veigar's ult had before. They're doing what they're supposed to be doing, and because of that you're innately more effective against them for no good reason.
