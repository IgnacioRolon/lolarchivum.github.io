He saw the feedback, and went back to working on it. \n\nYou guys probably can't give feedback on what he has in his pocket right now, because it isn't even on PBE. That being the case, he doesn't feel a need to talk to you. He's trying to address the concerns he already heard over a week ago. He listened, and he's working on it.\n\nI understand the community wanting comms, but I also understand Riot not giving it every single day. You say \"8 days\" like it's a really long time, but speaking as someone with a steady, somewhat intense job (like I imagine game development is), it isn't a long time. Getting good work done is time-intensive. If it wasn't, we could have all the champs in league reworked every year. That just isn't possible.\n\nI guess my TL;DR is, be patient. He heard you guys, and he's working on it, and you need to wait now.
