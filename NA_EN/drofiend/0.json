I immediately reconnected and proceeded to finish the game. Now I have a 20 minute low priority despite coming back and finishing the game? I have never actively AFKd and had a brief moment of \"attempting to reconnect\" and now I have to wait 20 mins to join a game? What is the deal?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-08T03:14:10.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeouch, that really sucks if this was your first afk and it jumped to this punishment. As Stryder03 mentioned, you won't actually get an LPQ for only leaving one game every now and then. The system should only kick in after noticing a trend, and even then it should start at 5 min. \n\nOn top of that, even when you're able to reconnect, if you're out of the match long enough it can still have a lasting effect, not to mention how hard your teammates have to work to keep winning without a 5th teammate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stryder03","date":"2017-12-08T00:29:07.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time that you are given a 20 minute low priority queue is after you have left more than a few games. Even then the queue times starts at 5 minutes. \n\nIf you have never left a game before, technical difficulties or not, then you would not get a 20 min queue time.\n\nIf you are sure this is unwarranted, then I would submit a ticket.","replies":[]}]}
