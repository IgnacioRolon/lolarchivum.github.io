It could have had issues, but network issues could also cause unresponsiveness to reconnecting with our game server.  If this happens again, try and use the legacy client to rule out possibilities:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI also suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide if these disconnections continue to find and tackle whatever is causing it.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
