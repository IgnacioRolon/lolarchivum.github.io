On Summoners rift I force these 1 v 1s through Macro so there is a deal of thought and skill involved, but when forced in a ring against any ADC not named Vayne, any support, any mage much of the Bruisers and Assasins and practically any tank I will comeout on top by rightclicking them to death. Same for URF again this is favorable. I&#039;ve been trying to learn Yasuo there and everytime that mode comes I can hardly win.\n\nRemove or Rework these modes they are horribly unfun, especially the 1 v 1 ones.","replies":[{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-12-18T23:15:42.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing about Nexus Blitz is balanced nor fair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-18T23:17:07.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2018: someone wants URF to be fair.\n\nLmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Volocaust","date":"2018-12-18T23:34:52.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xhN4BRwN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-18T23:17:07.296+0000)\n>\n> 2018: someone wants URF to be fair.\n> \n> Lmao.\n\nUrf can be in Urf. I think they should aim to make blitz kind of like a shorter summoners rift and not a 4fun mode for Silver 4 players.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-19T00:07:22.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would defeat the entire point.\n\nSR is short enough already, compared to the 45 minute games we used to have.","replies":[{"poster":"Volocaust","date":"2018-12-19T00:19:32.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xhN4BRwN,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-12-19T00:07:22.333+0000)\n>\n> That would defeat the entire point.\n> \n> SR is short enough already, compared to the 45 minute games we used to have.\n\ni havent had 45 games since I left Silver pretty much. I do get plenty of 25-35 minute games and I think thats good. Nexus Blitz with the 8-20 min games is precisely what I want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
