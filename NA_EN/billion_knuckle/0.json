Here is what they said: \r\n\r\n\"Riot Games has received a dispute filed against previous purchases made on your account. This dispute was filed by the financial institution associated with the payments made on the account, and as a result, Riot Games must refund the payments back to the financial institution (a 'Chargeback').\r\n\r\nThe amount for this chargeback is: 205 USD\r\n\r\nPlease note that you may receive multiple emails for multiple chargebacks. Each email received indicates a unique transaction which must be repaid.\r\n\r\nThe account is now considered to have a negative balance and is unavailable for use until the outstanding balance has been repaid in full to Riot Games.\r\n\r\nYou can repay your outstanding balance by visiting the Repayments Dashboard\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFor additional information, visit our Knowledge Base.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this chargeback is a violation of our Terms of Use and any future payment disputes may result in a permanent termination of your account.

If you have any questions about the chargeback total on your account, please submit a request with the subject 'Chargebacks Total' for further assistance. \"\r\n\r\nI don't understand how this has happened, I have only used vanilla cards and occasionally my parents card. My only assumption to why this has happened is because my friend asked me for help. His own vanilla card wasn't working so he begged me to try it out on my account, but it has no success. Can someone please tell me what to do? I feel I've been betrayed and robbed by a game I love. I've spent almost 300 dollars and my time collecting characters, chests, keys, skins and reaching max level. Now it has been stolen from me. I'm open to opinions on how to solve this. I have sent emails to ask them about this, but they just resent the same thing again to me: \r\n\r\n\"Hello Summoner,\r\n\r\nThe League of Legends account deathwalksamongyou has been suspended due to a purchase dispute (a \"chargeback\") made by the associated financial institution. Due to this, Riot Games has refunded payment in the value of 270 CAD ($205 USD) (a “chargeback”). This account is unavailable for use until the outstanding balance has been repaid in full to Riot Games.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information on chargebacks here:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753334#h3\r\n\r\nPlease note that this chargeback is a violation of our Terms of Use, and any future payment disputes may result in a permanent termination of your account.

This has left a sour taste in my mouth. I don't know what to do. I've sent pictures of the Pre-paid cards I've used further suggestions will be welcomed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-02T20:27:09.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help you out with this, but the boards is not the appropriate venue due to the sensitive account information of this issue.
