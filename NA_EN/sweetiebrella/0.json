None of that \"Annie who looks like an adult but still dresses like a five year old\" crap. I'm talking one who floats with her fire magic and wears robe/dress and other magical effects such as jewellery. Maybe some long hair with burning tips for effect.\n\nEach spell would become more ferocious and bright with rank, with a special visual effect when she procs a stun (I guess her Q would have to only be upon the spell landing). Her W would be a more intense colour, while Tibbers would appear in a burst of magical flames. In addition, the Tibbers would have an evolving model, looking worn and damaged at first and the damaged spots leaking magical fire as he levels up.\n\nThe skin would have a lot of special responses, including things ranking up her ultimate, Tibbers dying and stunning enemy champions with her spells. She would have taunts for enemy champions like Brand, Amumu, Lissandra or Syndra.\n\nIt may not outdo the last ultimate skin, but I'd love to see something like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vipertwin3","date":"2014-05-27T17:34:01.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Queen Of The Wild** {{champion:76}}  Nidalee would be awesome, especially if as the spear went further you could see it looking more dangerous, and maybe when upgrading the ultimate she got battle armour ( in human form ) and changed animal ( or just changed look ) in cougar form.\nI would defenitely buy this skin even if it was just legendary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-05-27T05:24:54.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pulseblade Riven.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OVv-J-LXQU","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noxinum","date":"2014-05-26T23:16:47.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think talon would need a legendary skin {{champion:91}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tanakaido","date":"2014-05-26T22:12:27.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nami{{champion:267}}  would be good, she only has 2 skins right now and thats sad considering her age, i think it would be a good idea to make a polar opposite champ which follows the skin line lissandra and zyra have going, molten. she could be red scaled with a glowing fin-disk ( not really sure what to call her fishy mane so....ya)it would be cool to have another support besides braum{{champion:201}}  that has a catacalysmic{{summoner:14}}  genre skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Ptarlorr","date":"2014-05-26T23:13:59.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soon to be 3 skins btw","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mobbs","date":"2014-05-25T22:13:48.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, Khaziz or Zed should be in the run for an ultimate skin.

The top rated guide for him on Solomid.net started off by saying that playing Ez was probably not something you should do if you wanted to win. His W was considered a joke of an ability that wasn't even worth putting a single point into. Come PFE, people started playing him, and realized that the massive attack speed debuff and huge width of his W made him the best and safest duelist amongst all ADCs, and he's been doing pretty well for himself ever since.\n\nSpirit Guard Udyr hasn't resurrected Udyr's popularity to quite the same extent as PFE did for Ez, but it still gave the languishing Udyr quite a jolt.
