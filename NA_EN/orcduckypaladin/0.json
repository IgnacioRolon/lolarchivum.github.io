It sounds like your patcher is trying to launch, but your OS settings or permissions is preventing it and resulting in this kernel error.  I recommend going over the steps in our [Permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide to grant access for the game to launch.  This should get you fixed up, but let me know if you run into any problems.","replies":[]}]}
