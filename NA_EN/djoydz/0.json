I recommend continuing to be patient while they get back to you while avoiding replying or \"bumping\" your ticket before a specialist gets back to you. When you bump your ticket, it gets sent to the back of the queue and lengthens the time it takes for someone to get back to you. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
