Windows 10 was the reason why League got screwed up on my computer; please clarify.\n\nThanks so much for helping btw! I didnt know if Rito directly helps the users, but its good to see that they do <3\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-25T19:40:01.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries dude!
