While it is generally accepted that the intent of this is to improve the Boostee's MMR, any ranked game played by someone that is not the original creator of the account may be considered Boosting and as a result may be eligible for punishment.\"\n\nI think it's great that you want to help your friends, but I recommend giving them tips or watching them play and give them live advice during a game rather than boosting their account.
