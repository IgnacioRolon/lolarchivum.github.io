During this time, Olaf also gains 0.5% enhanced healing from all sources for every 1% of his missing health.\n\nAnd then there's Aatrox's Massacre - Cooldown 100/85/70 Seconds\nAatrox draws in the blood of his foes, dealing 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 100% AP) magic damage to all nearby enemy champions. Aatrox gains 40 / 50 / 60% bonus attack speed as well as 175 attack range (325 total range) for 12 seconds.\n\nSo basically, the only advantages Aatrox has over Olaf's W is the AoE damage and additional attack range. The attack speed (Vital to Aatrox's kit) is less, plus the additional Life steal, and then the enhanced healing. Obviously he does get attack speed from his passive (Also like Olaf) and Life steal from his W, but it just feels weird to have such a weak ultimate on what is supposed to be the essential \"God of War\" in this series.\n\nAlso % Health Costs.
