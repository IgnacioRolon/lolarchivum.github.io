What about the one I attacked before, the one in the centre of the quake, will he take additional damage too?\r\n\r\n2) What is the range of Thunderlord&#039;s Decree?\r\n\r\n3) What kind of damage is dealt? Physical? Magical? And does lifesteal / spell vamp work with the effect?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-19T18:53:26.701+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The primary target also takes the damage from Thunderlord's Decree. It's Magic damage that's dealt in a 250 unit area (so a bit bigger than Karthus's Lay Waste for example, which has a radius of 200). The damage is proc type, which is the same as other enhancing effects like Red Buff, Wit's End etc, so it does not apply Lifesteal or Spellvamp.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-11-19T19:05:55.361+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's... a really small radius.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-11-19T19:28:47.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus' Q is said on the wiki to have a radius of _100_ (which is a _diameter_ of 200).\n250 is the radius of a Brand W, Cass W (at full expansion), Corki Q, Fizz R, etc. (again, based on wiki numbers)\n\nDoes Thunderlord's Decree have a radius of 250, or a diameter of 250?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-20T01:28:15.917+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus Q has a Radius of 200.

What is the exact condition for hitting Karth Q or Brand W--does the unit's center have to be in the ability circle, or can their circles just overlap each other? (I believe it's that the distance between the champion's center and the ability's center is less than the sum of their radii (i.e. the collision circles overlap), but I just wanted to make sure).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2015-11-20T01:44:05.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1Rwku1uh,comment-id=000000020001,timestamp=2015-11-20T01:28:15.917+0000)\n>\n> Karthus Q has a Radius of 200.
