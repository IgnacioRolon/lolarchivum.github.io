And Riot's kind of been moving *away* from hard counters, considering how binary they can make a game.\n\nI appreciate what you're saying, but I think it's just arguing semantics.  In the League community, 'counter' is used to denote a champion that overwhelms the one you're currently playing.  When someone says, 'Oh no, they counter me', do you seriously believe they mean, 'Oh no, they go perfectly even with me'?  That's not how it's used here.  There are advantageous lanes, where your champion has the edge; even matchups/skill matchups; and then 'counterpicks' which give you an inherit advantage over the opponent you're facing.\n\nYou can disagree if you want, but I can guarantee that when people in the community call a champion a 'counter' to their mains, they don't mean 'that champion is perfectly equal in strength, without any advantage over me whatsoever'.  They mean their kit has an advantage over yours.  That is how it is used in the context of League, regardless of which dictionary definition you choose to use.\n\nKeep in mind that your definition of counters would mean that whatever you counter also counters you.  That two champions both counterpick eachother at the same time.  There's obviously some logic that doesn't follow here.\n\nBut again, you can use whatever definition you want.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-04-18T14:45:16.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, when someone in the community is referring to a counter-pick, they are talking about a champion that has an advantage against them, but *very rarely is that advantage something they cannot play around.*\n\nThis is the difference in League of Legends; counter-play, or the ability to *outplay* another player, is what equalizes counter-picks being \"stronger\" than the champions they counter.\n\nSure, Alistar and Leona are both nightmares against Katarina, but that doesn't mean she can't time her spells in combat to avoid her ultimate being interrupted. Yes, a lot of mid-lane mages are easy targets for Zed, but they can interrupt his ultimate, which is realistically his only way to guarantee a kill if he doesn't have a huge lead.\n\nI could continue with specific cases, but the general idea is that counter-picks are not guaranteed to counter an opponent.
