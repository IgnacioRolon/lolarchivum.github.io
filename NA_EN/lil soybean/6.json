He is possibly the strongest mage out their right now aside from those issues. He can melt ANYONE with ease, and all it takes is 3 or 4 games to get the hang of his E targeting (seriously, it astonishes me that people think it is hard to aim, with or without smart cast). Viktor's burst from just his base abilities is completely unparalleled.\n\nAP Blitz is a weird off build, but he certainly doesn't care a bit about MR.\n\nHaven't played Zilean, but I've seen what double bomb does when he has full build and it makes you want to cry.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2015-01-18T09:23:36.153+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It´s seems like they don´t really know what they are doing..\n\nThe mana regen nerfs didn´t hinder mages from spamming,but made them scared to cats abilities in general.\nAlso,does anyone else think they think they ˝balanced man reg.˝ with taking into account that mages get all blues?That´s just wrong.Blue buff should be an independent variable when balacing mana regen on mages.\nThat´s what i hate about being a mage on mid,Blue buff doesnt really feel like a buff,but a ˝stat˝ that  all mages should alredy have in their desing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jacky Shen","date":"2015-01-18T06:13:28.446+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lil Soybean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m6wjWI3A,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-17T20:16:14.148+0000)\n>\n\n> Why is season 5 the anti-mage season, Riot?\n\nBecause Assasins make \"LC$B1GPLAYZ\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diostukos","date":"2015-01-17T20:32:16.567+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://gyazo.com/a419495f46be39119cbf23b6b03d6e14\n\nOh dang, she took quite a nose dive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lusth","date":"2015-01-18T01:34:32.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":15,"body":"Yes it really must be terrible to play syndra right now knowing you cannot roll your face across the keyboard and get pentas anymore.
