In reality, the effect was, _\"if you want to land your Q, you have to use your E; if you want to use your E, you now have to walk up into suicide range and stand still long enough to double-cast your new bomb skillshot.\"_\n\nAnd this is the part that really bothers me.  The ability to stay permanently sped was so fun.  It was so core to his playstyle.  **IT WAS HIS END-GAME FANTASY.**  After maxing out both E and W, and then building 40% CDR, you finally achieved it.  And you removed that.  Yes, it&#039;d be a bit stronger with his new E speed.  But not much, because - again - the movespeed cap makes that buff nearly negligible.\n\n**R -> Cooldown lowered, but actually ends up effectively longer than before (because W no longer effects it); duration reduced from 7s to 5s**\n\nHere&#039;s the most insulting thing about this, Riot.  You know what the mark does now?  It makes your ally stop running after about 2s, then say, \"oh, shit, I have Zilean&#039;s ultimate...uh...\" and then spend the next 3 seconds desperately trying to get close enough to the enemies to die.  And they do.  They get there just in time to be killed as his mark runs out, because you lowered the duration.\n**YOU LITERALLY TOOK AN ABILITY THAT SERVES NO PURPOSE BUT TO SAVE YOUR OWN OR AN ALLIES LIFE, _AND MADE IT SO IT OCCASIONALLY KILLS YOUR TEAMMATES._**\n\nHis kit is so, so, so fun.  You did a great job on that.  But the numbers are shit.  You gave him a stun and an increase on his E&#039;s effectiveness, but it turns out the E buff was incredibly insignificant because of the movement speed cap, and the range nerf nearly gutted the ability.  The bomb was only strong because it was guaranteed damage, and you made it one of the most unreliable damage sources in the game.  His ultimate was reliable because it saved allies, and so you had to make it less effective at that to - oh, and increase the cooldown by a bit just &#039;cause, why not?\n\nBasically, you gave him two small buffs, and made him funner to play, and then gutted him.  \n\nMy suggestions involve increasing the E range so it can ACTUALLY be used to land Q&#039;s reliably without going into instant-death range, but at the heavy mana cost of using E->Q->W->Q just to get your basic damage cycle off.\nFurthermore, it&#039;d actually be able to reach allies you&#039;re trying desperately to reach again.  You nerfed the range to prevent bombs from being too reliable to land, but you also made it harder to help your team.\n\nAnd trust me, you could give Zilean a lot of help before people ever consider him a reliably strong pick like Blitzcrank or Morgana instead of just a trollpick.\n\nIt&#039;s really hard to justify picking Zilean when your entire botlane experience consists of, _\"Because I&#039;m arbitrarily one of the squishiest champions in the game, if I ever get hit by a single CC skillshot, I die instantly, absolutely 100% guaranteed,\"_ with a little dash of, _\"I&#039;m out of mana incredibly quickly if I try to contribute at all.\"_\n\nPLEASE DON&#039;T LEAVE HIM LIKE THIS.  Please just talk to us about what you&#039;re going to do and when.  And please, please, please don&#039;t just give us the \"he has hidden power\" excuse and then leave him Tristana&#039;d.  Please.

In spite of having been \"gutted\" he still is although I admit I've read many good points thus far in both the initial post and the comments. With that said I'm not against the majority of the changes as I believe they separate the average Zilean player from those who actually are skilled with him. With that said, there are a few things I'd change and a few things I like which I'll be going over.\n\nI'd start by giving Zilean increased auto attack range. Pre-rework it was 600 and was the only tool he could effectively use to harass without putting himself at risk/taking his partner's farm given the cost/power of his Time Bomb/Time Bomb Combo ( Q, W, Q ) which we'll now call T.B.C. Granting him this increased attack range would allow him to poke and harass from a safe distance while preserving mana which would bring his early game to par with other supports given many other supports have skill-shots, that we'll refer to as S.S., that have near equal or longer ranges than Zilean's T.B.C. which has 900 range w/o assistance. Examples of this include Nami whose S.S. are all over 725 range, Braum's Winter Bite/Glacial Fissure have 1000/1250 range, all of Lux's are over 1000 range, Lulu's Glitterlance/Wild Growth have 925/900 range, Janna's Howling Gale/Eye of the storm/Monsoon have 1700/800/725 range and Karma's Inner Flame/Focused Resolve/Inspire have 950/675/800 range.\n\nZilean's reworked Time Bomb ( Q ) is actually something I really like. While the early-game mana cost of his T.B.C. may be a hassle it is more than fair given how versatile it has become. The big thing I noticed about Zilean pre-rework is that people wouldn't come near you unless they felt they could kill you which allowed you to zone for your lane partner. His reworked Time Bomb now allows you to toss a bomb out behind caster minions, zoning your lane foes unless they feel like risking a stun to get farm. If they attempt to go around your first bomb you always have the option of tossing a second next to it and enchanting your minions or jungler with a bomb is now a great way to zone them from under tower. A lot of risks in Zilean's zoning game are gone even if harassing with him has become brutal due to his lowered attack range. \n\nZilean's reworked Time Warp ( E ) is still surprisingly effective even with the shortened duration. While \"Zoom Zoom Zilean\" was always fun being able to stay in that state permanently was a bit over-the-top and I think removing that was good for balance. With that said I now feel this skill is a bit underwhelming and would benefit from getting a cast-range increase to 900 from the current range of 700. I feel increasing the range would help Zilean to slow a foe which is something he currently struggles to do in the lane-phase without a foe being under some form of C.C. He currently takes a lot of damage when he goes in to auto-attack or slow a foe and this change would reduce that damage while bringing him up to par with other supports who, again, have longer S.S. ranges. The fact it would uniform his abilities ( all his skills would have 900 range ) would also be nice in regards to not having to memorize a third cast range for Zilean who currently needs to keep his auto attack ranges and Time Bomb/Ult ranges in mind whenever he plans an action.\n\nTL;DR: I'd only make two changes to ZIlean, both on the P.B.E. I'd first bring his auto-attack range back to 600 to allow him to harass on par with other supports given other supports are able to do this easier due to having more effective abilities. My second action would be to increase his Time Warp cast range to 900 which would allow him to land his slows easier which is something he currently struggles to do in the laning phase. I feel enabling these two actions on the P.B.E. would allow people to test a more balanced Zilean that could be brought to the live game client.\n\nThanks for reading/please share feedback,\nMr. Beane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2015-05-16T17:07:06.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beautiful post...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-05-15T21:21:14.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I might disagree with the W - R interaction, though.

With 40% cdr, it's 108 seconds, but it is affected by Rewind, which at rank 5 (or once you hit level 18, basically) reduces cooldowns by 10 seconds and has a cooldown itself of 6 seconds.

I said 6-8 because I couldn't remember, but now I know it's 8.\n\nBut my point was that, yes, you will be spamming it most of the time, but if there is a combined total of 8 seconds where you aren't spamming it, meaning you could be sieging and saving your rewind for when a fight breaks out, the new ultimate will be on a shorter cooldown overall.\n\nI hope you didn't downvote my post because you thought I was pulling stuff out of my ass, because that was like 5 minutes of typing shit into calculators and writing it down to prove my point.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-05-16T04:44:25.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I just did backwards calculation and figured it was 27.4ish.\n\nIt probably felt shorter because back then, you could level W to effectively reduce ult CD instead of having to level R to reduce it's CD. Not to mention it had a 7 sec duration + revive duration so it felt reaaaaally short back then.\n\n( so the difference: at level 9, you can have ult CD be very short if you wish due to W. On live you need to hit levels 11/16 and I can feel this as a Zilean main)","replies":[{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-05-17T00:38:10.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why would you level your W first?

That's why skirmishes occurred very often and that's why it was a valid strategy in our ranked team as we'd always have an ultimate up before the opponent.\n\nI'd imagine it was the same in SR if you were premade with your jungler forcing 2v2s.
