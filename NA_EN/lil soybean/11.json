What does the item do then? On hit effects are what?\n\nAn on-hit is basically anything that applies when you auto attack a target. There's two main kinds. On next hit, which is when your next auto attack has a bonus effect, things like Shyvana Q and Vi E, unless these have a CD related to you auto attacking (like Statik, Shyv Q, or Yi passive) they're unaffected by the item. The abilities that are reduced by attacking are only affected by having a shorter CD, not having multiple instances applied.\n\nThen there's also continuous on-hit effects which are abilities with multiple instances of effect spread between multiple auto attacks. These can be active champion abilities (Yi E, Shyv W/E, Uydr R), Passive abilities (Teemo's E's non-DOT damage, Elise passive, Vayne W) or item effects (Blade/Wits ect.). All of these effects will be applied 3 times every 2 auto attacks with the phantom attack.\n\nA basic way to think of the difference is that the effects that will be affected by the Devourer enchant are those which persist over multiple autos, most effects which only affect one auto attack will not be affected by Devourer.\n\nThere's a page on all of this on the LoL wiki http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/On-hit_effect , although they don't differentiate between continuous and on next hit like I have.\n\n>And about the items how are they getting stronger.\n\nIn most cases they proc 3 times every 2 auto attacks. Statik Shiv and Gunblade are exceptions, they charge up faster with the new enchant. Frozen Mallet isn't any better really, but it's  technically reapplied for what ever good that's worth.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-06-27T18:34:18.063+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard someone complain about Vayne picking this up...\n\nBecause Vayne is totally going to take Smite, buy a 2k item that grants just AS, and farm 30 mobs/15 champs for this effect without being stopped.","replies":[{"poster":"Svddenly","date":"2015-06-27T18:56:20.973+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champs only grant 1 stack with it, I believe.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-06-27T20:43:47.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, even better.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2015-06-27T13:33:32.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":16,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lil Soybean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jYEIeGfm,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-27T12:37:33.215+0000)\n> \n> You wouldn&#039;t say, &quot;OMG Cinderhulk is gonna make master yi broken with all that health!!&quot; Because 99% of the time, he absolutely would not buy it.\n \n> Just my 2 cents.\n\nActually, tank-Yi became a thing with cinderhulk, making use of his fairly naturally high sustained damage and damage reduction from meditate.\n\nAnyway, on topic:\n\nPeople remember feral flare.

Counterjungling can be rewarding, it's just that poachers knife itself is shit. Compared to the other smite bonuses, that one is shit past the 15 minute mark.

Grabbing a camp when the enemy jungler shows on the far side of the map is useful. But having your plan centering around counter-jungling is almost always going to end up failing simply because half the time you wander into the enemy jungle only to find it already cleared.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-06-27T13:46:48.448+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the problem champs with this item will be {{champion:11}} and on-hit {{champion:105}}, but like you said they do sacrifice a lot in order to get it, but at the same time the item was bought on them before this buff regardless.\n\nA master Yi doing a Double Strike (which is an on-hit effect) then Phantom Strike with {{item:3153}} (8% HP x 2), {{item:3074}} (20-60% AD x 2),  {{item:3718}} (60 Magic Damage x 2 + 162 True Damage~3 Seconds x 2), Wuju Style (30+20% AD True Damage x 2), and each hit will count as an attack to reset Double Strike, giving him 6 on-hit effects every 3 hits unless I'm terribly mistaken.
