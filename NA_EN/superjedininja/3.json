It is the first time in a very long time they are sticking with a core group for more than a single split it seems. Also an improvement at support who is a bit less argumentative like Xpecial. I think they can build on last season and be stronger for it.\n\nThey are getting full on position coaches for each role, and adding to their staff, so they seem to be going out of their way to build upon what they have, and not just roster swapping all over the place like most teams.  C9 and Liquid will easily be the top 2 from NA come worlds if they stick with their current roster.\n\nCLG will be 6th at best I imagine, especially if they pick up Turtle <_< \n\nHard to say with TSM as they have a whole 2 people on their roster (that we know of) currently, as 2 people retired, one quit the team, and Turtle was replaced.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-02T07:44:19.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, TSM has been bottom of the barrel for a long time now.

They usually get the most \"hype\" because they are at worlds every year, or are 1st or second in NA (They finished second this year after playoffs still, so that isn't exactly bottom of anything realistically). \n\nI don't think they are a very good team when you compare them to other regions, but the problem is, most of NA teams aren't either, and this is coming from an  NA fanboi. \n\nSadly NA won't win worlds ever, because unlike EU for example, we rely too much on \"known names\" like Dlift just auto getting the TSM adc spot, when it was supposedly a \"tryout\". NA goes with the \"big names\" even if they are past their prime, (like Xpecial, or Saint with Gravity until he finally stepped down, etc). Up and coming players don't get a real chance until it is just too late. Look at Pobelter.\n\nDude used to be a beast of the challenger ladder and old elo ladder, never got a fair chance, and by the time he did get on a decent team, he was kicked after helping them get to worlds. The problem is NA not being patient enough for years to cultivate talent, unlike Korea, China (less so this year) and EU, and now NA is in the mindset of \"We need players NOW\" and don't plan well enough for the next split, let alone the next year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2015-11-03T00:57:55.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=4RvrfEN9,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-11-02T07:44:19.657+0000)\n>\n> Well, TSM has been bottom of the barrel for a long time now.

Like, where do you get that? Seriously! I want to know. \n\nC9 has been top 1-2 every split but the last split where they ended 6, but through the gauntlet landed in top 3.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JC Ramos","date":"2015-11-02T05:05:33.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rip Tsm Wildturtle{{item:3070}} . but hello Tsm Doublelift{{champion:67}}","replies":[]}]}
