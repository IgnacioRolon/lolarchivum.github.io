In real games there isn't much leeway to experiment. You can't test out builds because people might call you a troll and ruin your experience and you can't easily practice your combos. While this is somewhat more possible to do in customs, it's still a massive timesink. If you want to try out builds you're going to have to farm for at least 30+ minutes. If you want to swap to an entirely different build you're going to have to farm for probably another 15 or so minutes to make up the gold you lose by selling your items. This isn't even including the fact that if you want to swap to a different champion you're going to have to restart the entire thing again.\n\nWhat about changing the in game times? What if you want to practice power spikes? At the moment, players have to restart every time they pass that power spike. And what if the champion only spikes really late into the game? Are you really going to waste 40 minutes just to practice that power spike for a couple of minutes?\n\nCombos can't be easily practiced because of mana and cooldowns. Want to practice flashing over walls or using combos involving flash? Tough luck, you're going to have to wait five minutes. Want to practice a combo using your ult? Tough luck, you're going to have to wait anywhere from one to three minutes. Want to practice combos on a champion with high mana costs? Sorry, you're out of mana.\n\nDespite what Riot may say, a sandbox mode would have no impact on a \"high barrier to entry\" nor would it become an expectation of all players. The only players who would be 'expected' to use sandbox mode are players who are just trying to practice and improve. Other players probably wouldn't touch it unless they wanted to try out something or were bored. If new players used sandbox mode, they would still fall under the former category of players trying to improve. They wouldn't have to play through hundreds of games with diamond smurfs just to improve. They could learn in one hour what might take a normal player ten to twenty. The barrier to entry would probably even shrink because sandbox mode would make it easier for new players to practice and learn the game.\n\nRiot has no reason to refuse to make sandbox mode. The game instantly becomes much easier to learn for new players, thus bringing in a greater amount of new players and decreasing the amount of new players dropping out of the game. Pros gain an easy way to develop their skills and run drills which results in better play and more fierce competition. This naturally leads to more entertaining games and therefore more money for Riot.\n\nRiot favors practice through play rather than through training. They state that they don't want to see players hopping into sandbox mode when they want to practice. They want players to play the game normally. This is the equivalent of the NBA not wanting to see teams doing practice sessions. Professional basketball players shouldn't have to practice to improve because they can just play the game normally.\n\nRiot fears players will be 'obligated' to hit sandbox mode whenever they want to practice. This is some very ignorant thinking. No matter how much you practice something, you need to be able to do it in a realistic environment. If they can't do the same things to real players then the practice is meaningless. By playing real games players put what they've been practicing into action. Players can practice all they want in sandbox mode but that practice needs to be backed up by experience. A skill can be practiced in sandbox mode but it needs to be perfected against real players. Riot's fears are unwarranted.","replies":[{"poster":"Eevee In A Jar","date":"2015-08-07T18:46:53.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"STAFOO it's not that their fears are unwarranted.

It's dumb using NBA as an example. First of all, that analogy doesn't work because media covers practice sessions and the like with journalists. They have every reason to refuse sandbox mode. I'm guessing you just don't understand how difficult all this stuff is and how much it costs. Who's going to fund it? You?

The players are being told they can't practice because playing should be the 'unequivocal best way for a player to improve.' The only real difference is that NBA players could just practice anyways because their practice doesn't require the NBA to set anything up for them. They can just shoot free throws at their house or a park. They could also run drills pretty easily. League players don't have this freedom. There is no easy way to set up methods of practice. If they don't give us a way to practice outside of playing, then we can't expect to improve as quickly because the system limits what we can do. Your comment about the media is irrelevant because it has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.\n\n>I'm guessing you just don't understand how difficult all this stuff is and how much it costs. Who's going to fund it? You? Cough up the money and the department of devs who will do it, manage it, maintain it, and keep it going.\n\nThere are people doing it for free because Riot has refused to do anything. The way [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3fy5ng/league_sandbox_intwars_update_easy_download/) is setup is that the player hosts the server for the sandbox and connects to their own server. The people who made it don't have to maintain anything except patches. It doesn't cost them any money to let people use it. Furthermore, Riot already has a sandbox-type of server at their headquarters. This is very obvious if you watch any of the champion spotlights.\n\n>As much as they like us fans and want our advice, their priority is money. It's why they came together as a company.

What's ignorant are the babyrage posts, and the ever abundant \"Rito please\" mentality. People get the feeling that just because they get coerced into buying skins that riot owes them something. The sense of entitlement I read in the vast majority of the QQ posts is ridiculous. Because of all this Riot has a hard time distinguishing people who are whining from people with actual criticisms. When champs get reworked, the only people who are incredibly vocal are the people who are pissing and moaning about the changes, no matter how overwhelmingly positive they may be.\n\nPeople just complain, in large volume, about anything and everything. They want it all their way, and they don't want to wait. If riot makes them wait for gameplay changes or functionality changes they get ridiculed. The balance team has to deal with trying to make champions fair, not just immediately, but for the foreseeable future so that there aren't a million nerfs or buffs coming out every patch. Champion update team has to deal with taking the champions we know and love and make them better without spawning a massive angry mob outside of Riot headquarters. So many people bitched about Sion. Some actually complained about Ashe's lack of free crit and loss of gold revenue. Don't get me started on the polarization of the community on the GP changes. Fiora is just the current subject of controversy. \n\nThis is what makes it hard for riot to listen. This is what makes balancing such a challenge. \"Don't nerf my freelo plz\" or \"New Fiora sucks\" aren't constructive comments or suggestions, and they flood the boards, and the youtube comments, and the reddit posts. Riot isn't perfect, the people who balance the game aren't perfect, the people who create new content aren't perfect. Yet, we the people, who are both toxic and non-toxic, who feed, carry, and flame and encourage, are all so different in what we want for ourselves in the game that we forget that nothing is perfect. Riot as a company has its own intentions for the direction of League of Legends, and when that doesn't match up with the greater desires of the playerbase the entitled and spoiled brats in the community start to show, and they overwhelm the people that want to have positive and meaningful conversation. Their views are absolute, they are jus there to complain without opening up to an alternate perspective.\n\nIt isn't ignorant to ask for certain things from the company. What's ignorant is to demand these things and accuse the company of not caring about its playerbase after they have explained their rationale and priorities. At that point, you aren't voicing your opinion. You're just being childish. At the end of the day Riot has all the say when it comes to these things, but that doesn't keep them from communicating with the community about their ideas.

Riot isn't going to make everyone happy. Also the \"good\" vs \"bad\" updates is a matter of perspective. I know plenty of people who were just fine with the Cass rework, and the Soraka rework. I'm personally fine with fiora's new bounding gait. I like it even. So by my sense of entitlement, I feel entitled to Riot keeping it the same. See how stupid that sounds to you. I've seen plenty of the other suggestions people have made, some are practical, more are just overloaded kits and idiotic mechanics. Once again a matter of perspective. I like the Darius rework. Never really gave a shit about Garen or Skarner, and from what I've seen of the Morde rework he seems really strong and has an interesting new dynamic in a duo lane. Your claims make the assumption that everyone agrees with you. Plenty of people are fine with the armor changes because they don't play bruisers or tanks. Plenty of people will agree with the change to Elise q. And with a slew of new tank items I'm excited to see how the meta will change.\n\nAnd here's the thing. I never said that to disagree with the changes was wrong. I said it was wrong to make demands of the people in charge after the fact. What do you think Hitler would do to you if you questioned his logic or outright told him that he was wrong. You would be slaughtered and he would proceed as planned regardless. Adults understand that there is a time to argue points of view and a time to move out of the way or be run over. AND YET AGAIN it's a matter of perspective. If you're talking about the allied powers, then yea but we were fighting him anyway. He was our enemy from the start. Riot isn't. From the perspective of axis powers, his ideas and priorities lined up with furthering their cause as a whole, so it wouldn't be any kind of fighting really. The best part is that none of the other powers or people would care about his rationale as long as they won the war. When they were getting their way, no one cared why. Only when people were dissatisfied with the situation at hand did they care about any rhyme or reason.  \n\n It isn't as if Riot NEVER listens to the players. Maybe their rationale isn't the most sound, and being vocal about that isn't a bad thing. But they've already stated that it isn't a priority on the list of things to be done. It's hardly on the list at all. And neither you nor I know exactly would happen if a training mode were put in place. \n\nAs the patrons of League of Legends, Riot takes into account a lot of our feedback in order to make the game more enjoyable, and they are relatively transparent when it comes to process and intentions, but the players don't always know best, in fact, the players are the most biased party, each one with their own individual agenda which is why everyone isn't going to be happy, and sometimes even the majority isn't happy and that's ok, because half of the time the majority gets the fuck over it. The hud changes for example. Remember \"Rip DFG,\" everybody cried about their favorite mages and ludens wasn't great on people who didn't spam as much, but guess what? People got over it and moved on and the game in my opinion is still fun. probable the biggest issue to date has been the S4 to S5 jungle changes. No one liked them, people didn't care about smite bonuses. They wanted spirit stone and madreds back. They hated how hard the jungle was. Plenty of people even asked for the jungle to stay the same as it was in S4. Riot tweaked the game enough for people to survive in the new jungle but that was pretty much it. Yet look at the meta now. Almost anything works if you can play it well. \n \nLike kids not wanting to eat their veggies, sometimes you don't know what's good for you. Nothing wrong with having an opinion, because it's just that, an opinion. Riot has their own opinion for what they want their game to be, and when they exercise their right to change THEIR GAME, people get all bent out of shape because they don't agree.

If they added sandbox there would be way more single people in rooms putting to much strain on their servers so they'd have to pay Money to get more... They do Not want to spend money on the filthy Americans.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-08-08T00:44:50.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not even necessary.

Its one more thing we dont need.\n\n Edit: Even Custom game you can boot up bots there and practice.

A Ryze bot will build an Infinity Edge.\n\nPeople just want a Hyperbolic Time Chamber to better themselves.

Playing a game of league should be the best way of bettering yourself as a whole. There's no other place to really have the best learning experience in lane or team comp. However certain skills and end game scenarios do not come up often enough in a way that enables learning those skills. It hinders players in a way that could annoy them to no end because they will repeatedly fail flash at 3 different points on the map and can't seem to get them down.  Spread out over 30 games that on average last about 40 minutes they might need to flash at those points 30 times so once per game at those locations. If they're being chased and are low on health that can cost them a kill, an entire team fight if they were flashing over to start engaging, and in some cases the entire game if it was a crucial fight. \n\nIs it really the best way to learn when you can be so discouraged and upset with yourself for failing to flash at the same points but yet not sure the best timing to flash over those locations? No it'd be easier to learn by the visual cues by actually doing it a few time. Which could be one 20 minute session saving maybe 3 or 5 40 minute games that would end in a loss out of those 30. \n\n\nAlso to be fair the numbers I'm using are pure speculation and are not indicative of actual results. I just think sand box mode is practical and can help with practice.....honestly I see a lot of people do bots for the same thing and often can't even practice what they were really wanting to because of other players or how long the game lasts. So yeah, I hope riot reconsiders.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silverthane","date":"2015-08-08T04:44:59.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg this old man always fucking kills me xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Davy Crockett","date":"2015-08-08T04:16:22.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAHHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA oh that was great","replies":[]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2015-08-07T20:42:28.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost as good as the \"5 AD\" warrior enchant one.
