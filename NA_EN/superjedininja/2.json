I want to focus on some aspects that have not been addressed by the OP here :)\n____\n\n**I made an edited version of Project Lucian with new colours and added detail:**\n- New NEON colours! Green or blue? Either look better than orange to me :)\n- New LEDs on his boots and on the spine of the armour.\n- Metal plates on his glove (distinguishing it from his skin)\n- Brighter green colour for his armour\n- A circuit tattoo on his arm, distinguishing it from his glove (optional detail)\n- A power core in his chest (optional detail)\n____\n_**Why go away from orange?**_\n- There are already two other champions with this colour in the Project skin series: Yasuo and Yi.\n- Hired Gun Lucian already has weapons with orange glow and orange ability effects.\n____\n_**What are your hopes for Project Lucian?**_\nMy biggest hope is that Riot alters his effect colours (I am rooting for NEON GREEN :) ), as he already shares orange with two other Project champions, and Lucian already has a skin with orange effects and orange-glowing guns: Hired Gun Lucian. If Riot does not want to alter his colours, I would at least hope that they add the metal plates to his glove. It is hard to distinguish the glove from his skin and it also lacks contrasts when considered by itself. Fixing the dull green to a brighter colour, like I did, is a solid third place of importance to me.\n____\nNEON GREEN\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v709/stigtrix/Concepts/LoL/Project%20Lucian%202.0%20-%20NEON%20GREEN_zpsgfvsafqz.png\n\nNEON BLUE\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v709/stigtrix/Concepts/LoL/Project%20Lucian%202.0%20-%20NEON%20BLUE_zpsunl5hu6z.png\n\nBLACK and ORANGE\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v709/stigtrix/Concepts/LoL/Project%20Lucian%202.0%20-%20BLACKandORANGE_zps8qqhid7x.png\n____","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuzja1","date":"2015-08-23T21:14:43.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw man, you spoiled the skin surprise.
