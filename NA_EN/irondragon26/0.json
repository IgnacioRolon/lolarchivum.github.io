Is it going to remain in our Materials? Well it disappear after the season finishes? Well it convert to something else (Perhaps a small amount of essence)? Just wanted to know. Would mean a lot if this would be answered.

They will disappear when it expires on November 6 at 23:59 PST.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"IronDragon26","date":"2016-10-26T19:45:00.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have 1 more question but it isn't relevant to this topic. My question is about the hextech chests that are given out when recieved an \"S- or better\" on a champion. I read the notes on the new season: (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-2017/gameplay#items). At the bottom of the page it suggets that if we got an \"S- or better\" on a champion but havent recieved a chest for it, Do we recieve one at the end of the season? (Sorry to take more of your time but would appreciate if this was clarified for me). Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T19:59:37.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only get a mastery chest once per champion per season.  Basically, any champion that you've already received a mastery chest for in 2016 will reset for the new season.  This will allow you to get another chest with that same champ in the 2017 season.  Hope that helps clear things up!\n\nExample:  If you received a chest for Darius in 2016, you can get another with Darius in 2017.","replies":[{"poster":"IronDragon26","date":"2016-10-26T20:34:54.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just have 1 more question. Say we recieved an \"S\" on a champion but havent received a chest for them yet. Well we be given a chest at the end of the season?
