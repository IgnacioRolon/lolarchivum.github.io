HE DID SHOOT HIMSELF IN THE LEG WITH HIS OWN GUN.  I DID GET JUMPED BY ALL 6 OF YOU CHUMPS.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a quote from the movie 8 mile in one of Eminem's rap seqeuences.  I used one hard F b/c i was getting trolled by 4 ppl that were all friends IN tft, a fun game-mode and shocker...it got me upset.  If anything I dropped a hard F which is regret but going from a 10 game chat restriction (a long time ago) to a 14 day suspension is a bit of a stretch.  I was definitely toxic and I agree, but these kids legit live to troll and they are good at it sometimes and it pisses you off.  Bottom line is, I agree hard F is bad and that deserves a chat restriction.  Telling the kid to KYS might be worthy of a 3 day ban, but sorry this is kinda ridiculous that it's a 14 day suspension...oh and this is from one single game of toxicity not multiple.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nNazzgul: STOP TAKING MY UNITS\r\nNazzgul: you fuckling assdick\r\nNazzgul: they don't love you\r\nNazzgul: cheesey fucking kid\r\nNazzgul: i swear\r\nNazzgul: grats on your hollow victory b/c you abused items that are broken\r\nNazzgul: no one is talking to you %%%%%%\r\nNazzgul: talking to the kid who's going to win\r\nNazzgul: Pranu\r\nNazzgul: stop talking\r\nNazzgul: i don't care about you\r\nNazzgul: lol\r\nNazzgul: yes\r\nNazzgul: gotenks\r\nNazzgul: no one loves you\r\nNazzgul: stop talking\r\nNazzgul: lol\r\nNazzgul: i'm talking to the one who deserves it\r\nNazzgul: legit go kys\r\nNazzgul: lol\r\nNazzgul: like how lonely are you\r\nNazzgul: i'm literally telling you that you're annoying and gross\r\nNazzgul: stop talking lol\r\nNazzgul: PRANU\r\nNazzgul: why abuse items to win\r\nNazzgul: ?\r\nNazzgul: when they fix it what are you going to do then?\r\nNazzgul: Pranu no you won't\r\nNazzgul: b/c you don't know how\r\nNazzgul: you are abusing the items that are known to be broken\r\nNazzgul: kinda shitty eh\r\nNazzgul: 5th first of all\r\nNazzgul: gold 1\r\nNazzgul: 2nd of all\r\nNazzgul: about to be plat\r\nNazzgul: stop talking\r\nNazzgul: like you don't bother me lol\r\nNazzgul: Pranu and his broken ass items does\r\nNazzgul: gotends stop talking\r\nNazzgul: lol\r\nNazzgul: lol you can't\r\nNazzgul: it's beta fool\r\nNazzgul: shocker the ki di caleld a cheater is going to win\r\nNazzgul: b/c of his cheat items\r\nNazzgul: that are KNOWN TO BE BROKEN\r\nNazzgul: i did not have an elementalist ninja\r\nNazzgul: that was not me\r\nNazzgul: wait wait\r\nNazzgul: wait\r\nNazzgul: wait\r\nNazzgul: wait\r\nNazzgul: you really think\r\nNazzgul: the chain lightning from static shiv\r\nNazzgul: procing disarm\r\nNazzgul: on 5 ppl\r\nNazzgul: is balanced?\r\nNazzgul: and \"how the game is supposed to be played\"\r\nNazzgul: i was not that gotends\r\nNazzgul: stop talking\r\nNazzgul: you can't even get right who i was playing lol\r\nNazzgul: Cheddar bob\r\nNazzgul: stop\r\nNazzgul: go shoot youself in your leg with your own gun","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2019-07-25T17:00:14.369+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This literally had nothing to do with reference to Eminem's song.

Otherwise it would be an extremely simple thing to find the most hateful things said in movies and yell them in chat and be protected.\n\nYou made it clear in your OP that you weren't making that quote as a joke and even if you were...\n\nWell,\n\nYou know that awkward moment when someone says an inappropriate inside joke among people who weren't in on the inside joke?
