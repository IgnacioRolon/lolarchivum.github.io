(F*ck dota)\r\n\r\nI wanted to know if I could please have a refund on my Trundle purchase as I don't have any refund points left. (This has happened before)\r\nI accidentally clicked the purchase button, thinking it would give me an image of what my remaining RP would look like as I believe it did on the old client (Don't quote me on that) but it went through and I wasted half of the money my little brother gave me for league for my birthday.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to know if I could have my 880 RP back and a refund of Trundle please Riot Games. {{champion:48}} \r\nSincerely,\r\nA toxic, silver feeder.\r\n(I'm kidding!!!)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-22T21:45:13.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's okay to like other games.  :D I may be a gold player but I'm secretly a level 110 Ace Trainer who will one day be the very best payload runner, and hoping that gifting sashimi to Shane for days will eventually woo him.

It's not possible to perform further returns after that.  That said, Trundle is in a great spot (max his pillar) so I hope you'll give him a chance.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
