It says I have recieved a mystery icon from Riot Games. Well, Im kind of confused considering I have no idea what I did?\r\n\r\nSo if anyone else has any prior experiences, do you know what this was for? I want to know so maybe if it was something positive on my end, I can keep doing it! ! ! Also, I asked around on my friends list, and no one else has recieved it? Is it because of IEM Oakland or something? (Sorry I dont watch the LCS or whatever its called :( ).\r\n\r\n(In case you were wondering it was a TSM one, and I have another account called TSM Boompenguins but Im not sure this makes any difference?)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n~Boompenguins\r\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cape Baldy","date":"2016-11-24T02:24:49.989+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though this was an error (on the 2013 TSM icon), I still wanna thank you Riot for not one, but two free icons!

I can't figure out why you randomly received this icon, but if it was due to an error on our side you certainly get to keep it! ^.^\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2016-11-23T03:15:33.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Targons Blade.
