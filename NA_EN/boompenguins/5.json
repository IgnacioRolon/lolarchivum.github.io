Each key fragment you earn reduces the chances of earning the next key exponentially. This is because the droprate for keys is more of a curve than a line. The droprate resets approximately 30 days after the first key fragment dropped, so if you wait it out, you should start seeing more key fragments soon.\n\nFor more information, I definitely recommend checking out our [**Hextech Crafting Guide.**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) Please let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Boompenguins","date":"2016-12-02T23:26:01.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

I count 12 key fragments, 4 keys total, because I've never got more than 4 keys each month since launch. I play quite a lot of games, too.\n\n---You really don't need more than 4 keys anyway since you can only get 4 chests each month-- I guess this is on purpose.","replies":[]}]}
