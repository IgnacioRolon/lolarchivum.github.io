Yes i know 4 IP is not but when it happens a few times a day it racks up to a lost or a win of IP? is there anyway this is going to be fix or even looked into at?","replies":[{"poster":"Panic4Who","date":"2016-08-10T02:40:26.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes Its like the client is lagging. It will be slow and then pick back up. Once in champ selection and all bans are completed and its my turn to select it will just crash this is not selecting a champion or ever had one hovered. Also some times IF I go to store and buy the Champion shard and then to the Gem thing it will crash. After re logging in the someone or my self can invite me to a game or I can attempt to create a game and the nothing will happen. After a re invite or another attempt to make the game will work. This is not only happening to me but a lot of players i play with too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T18:18:52.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When your client crashes, the server sees it as a dodge. This is because it sees you connected and then suddenly you're not, the same as if you unplugged your PC or force closed your client. There's no way for the server to differentiate between those different actions, so I recommend focusing on resolving the core issue that causes you to crash to prevent future LP or match loss. \n\nCan you go into more details about the crashes themselves? Do you see a specific error message or behaviour when it happens? With this information, I'll be able to provide steps to take in order to resolve this.","replies":[]}]}
