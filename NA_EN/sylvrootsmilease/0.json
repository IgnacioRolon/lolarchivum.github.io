In Part I, Gentlemen Gustaf from the playtest team joins Scarizard, Xpecial, and Fearless to talk about some of the big game changers - vision, the Rift Herald, and new pacing mechanics - coming in 5.22.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_uBpkpSYKQ&feature=youtu.be","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w_uBpkpSYKQ/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first read this patch, I was blown away by all of the changes. It seemed remarkable in an exciting, promising way. However, after actually playing with these changes, it feels like the goal of creating options was not totally satisfied. Having said that, I&rsquo;m happy with some of the new concepts, and I realize balance is not quickly reachable. I think, ideally, every champ would be viable. Of course, there is counter play, but with the constant balancing act, some champions become less counterable. \r\n         I thought the addition of the rift herald was a good addition because top laners can intergrate with the team earlier, yay more objectives, and perhaps early teleporting is less of a go-to.  Part of me didn&rsquo;t love the idea of auto upgraded wards because it felt like it took some skill out of it. As an adc and mid, I try to upgrade as soon as possible and ward whenever I can, so I kind of pride myself on remembering. Though as a support main, I&rsquo;m also grateful for it. I also love the cost effective sight stone-support item option and the changes to sweeper &amp; scryring. I like that the new ad items give new variety to pick from. I even like the idea of refining certain adcs to be more unique. However, with any changes, there are consequences.\r\n\r\nSkip here for TLDR:\r\n         First off, it feels like between the **increased cost of mage items and the stronger ad mr items, mages all around got a big nerf.** I&rsquo;m curious to know whether that was an intended consequence, and if so, the reasoning behind it.\r\n          Second of all, it seems like Quinn, Graves, and Miss Fortune in particular are very strong- so strong that they are almost not counterable.  Not impossible to win against, just way harder. **Though refining these champions made them more unique, they feel so strong that other adcs don&rsquo;t feel as effective or viable.** I don&rsquo;t feel that Ezreal and Varus are as viable.** Then again, I know I&rsquo;m not a great adc, so maybe it&rsquo;s just me&hellip;but laning against those three feel unusually difficult.  Perhaps I have to better explore their weaknesses, but they seem pretty negligible. \r\n          Finally, don&rsquo;t the faster ending games make **late game champs less viable**?\r\n          \r\n          Overall, I welcome these changes; I just hope that they are balanced out.","replies":[]}
