Once thier health is low, an urgot ult will kill them even is applied after the kayle ult.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-10-20T20:44:13.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not a bug, the execute animation is atleast 1 whole second, kayles shield lasts 3 seconds, you can't apply the shield while one is being hooked, so the shield has to be applied as soon as the chains are 0.00001milisecond about to touch your target, and from max range, the travel time is 1.043, and even if you do that, the execution will keep on applying damage so its pointless.\n\nits not a bug, its just how it works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-10-20T19:48:47.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I heard the other day, the way urgot ult works is it deals something like 1000 true damage, checks to see if the target is dead, and repeats this process until they ***are*** going up to 2 million damage or some other ridiculous cap. Maybe what's happening is it's applying the damage while the ult is active until the moment the shield goes down and it kills them? Not sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"geeklove","date":"2018-10-20T19:46:10.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to know","replies":[]}]}
