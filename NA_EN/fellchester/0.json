Even if some of the games were remade, they probably entered into another game and the client was just left on the defeat screen when they were done messing around. I'd really suggest reminding your friend to close out their account to make sure someone doesn't mess with their inventory or get them penalized.","replies":[{"poster":"Takt09","date":"2017-07-02T10:06:19.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"btw none got into my PC ever \nand i have my gmail bro ! \nhow can it happend and the account gmail still with me !!!! \nand i send more than 5 tickets and still nothing !!!\nbut noway that somone from friends or somthing like that get into my account cuz i was already played before this about 3 hours ago !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Takt09","date":"2017-07-02T09:28:44.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've sent more than 5 tickets about 12h ago with the same proplem played 5 or 6 games and go out \nwhen i back issue with client try to open my account again but said incorrect username or password\ntry to make recover for my account to send massege to my gmail \nuntil nw none massege sent \nwhat da hell can i de !","replies":[]}]}
