When the game starts, it has a very high delay between my input and the game executing it (move commands, abilities, even just leveling up a skill or buying items from the shop). This seemed like a very common ping-related issue to me. However, I recieve and see the game (i.e. other players) in real-time with no problem. Recieving and dealing damage (once it finally decides to activate the ability), seeing skillshots hit, death-screens, sounds etc. everything on time. The only lag is between me inputting and the game executing it.\r\n\r\nUsually, closing the game and re-connecting solves the issue but for the past few days even that didn't seem to work until my 8th or 9th time passing through the loading screen, annoying teammates with \"A summoner has disconnected/A summoner has reconnected\" spam aswell (Now, there's a new way to tilt your frienemies).\r\n\r\nThe lag is also not even consistent. If it doesn't happen when I connect, it doesn't happen for the rest of the game. But if it happens, sometimes it takes my commands with considerably little lag (feels like ~100ms), but suddenly I can't stop walking and run right into the enemy (that death's on me. Never click on your mini-map to walk, Summoners). Also I can see my ping being stable in both League's measurement and other online measurments I did while waiting for my 13th loading screen, with close-to-zero package loss and no jitter - the usual for me.\r\n\r\nThis seemed very weird to me as this only happens in LoL and in no other online games I've played lately.\r\n\r\nI also thought it might be due to my ISP. As a student living in a dormitory, I'm sharing a connection with several other students, naturally leading to latency and laggs every now and then. However, none of the other students seem to have the same issue - especially considering my roommates - so this doesn't seem to be a common factor.\r\n\r\nI've tried Firewall exceptions/disabling Firewall, Repatching LoL, Uninstalling and Reinstalling fully, Hextech Repair Tool. None of them seem to help. I've also searched for similar issues but couldn't find any clues.\r\nAnybody any ideas? Plz help :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-05T23:25:54.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that delayed champion reactions sound like you're dealing with something called packet loss. Basically, it happens when your connection is getting damaged or losing important parts along its way to our servers. \n\nRun a quick traceroute using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the EUW servers at 185.40.65.1 and post the results here so I can take a look and point you in the right direction!","replies":[]}]}
