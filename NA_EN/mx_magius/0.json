Hot! Hot! That was a pepper! Hot! Need. Water.\"\r\n-Gagging and spitting noises followed by: \"Gah! I hate oranges.\"\r\n-After a short delay after he uses the ability, he says in a funny voice :\r\n-\"I forgot to tell you that I'm allergic to citrus\"\r\n-\"Blotches and swelling are signs scurvy is gone, right?\"\r\n-\"These hives must mean the oranges are working\"\r\n\r\n**(E) - Raise Morale**\r\nFor Raise Morale, there wasn't much that could differ in the activation, except for his gun misfiring, but there could be a plethora of sound effects that could accompany that it which could be the following, as well as any other suggestions, or ideas that I can come up with and will be included in an edit:\r\n-Airhorn\r\n-Vuvuzela\r\n-Bugling (Dadada Da DA! (Charge), and the notes played for the Kentucky Derby, I won't try and spell it for I might not do it justice.\r\n-Fog Horn\r\n-Generic cartoons sounds\r\n\r\n\r\n**(R) - Cannon Barrage**\r\nFor activation, Gangplank could say some of the following:\r\n-\"Incoming!\"\r\n-\"Let's see if this works\"\r\n-\"Pew! Pew! Pew!\"\r\n-\"Hey guys, check this out\"\r\n\r\n-For area of effect for his ultimate, the 'X' should be look like it was painted on the ground with red paint.\r\n-The area could resemble fly paper and sticky-peeling noises could be made as champions walk through it.\r\n-The cannonballs are replaced with anvils, that make the descending whistling sounds as they come down, and make the \"Bonk!\" noise when they land.\r\n-When the anvils land they could emanate lines from the force of the fall, stars and/or planets, when they hit the ground.\r\n-Champions hit by the anvils would have faint images of birds (anvils, pirates, oranges, rubber chickens) circling their heads until the ability ends, or three seconds after they were hit, possibly leaving a debuff on the afflicted champion \"Dazed & Confused: This unit was struck by a falling anvil\" which would be refreshed if they were stricken again by another or multiple anvils.\r\n\r\nEnd Note:\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I think needs some more thought would be his attire/outfit, and if i think of anything I'll make sure to include it in any edits/updates.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm not much of an artist, if anyone feels like they can put these thoughts into a more visual format feel free to do so!\r\n\r\nIf you think you have any ideas that are helpful to this concept, feel free to post them, and they might be included in a future update!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to contact me, my email is moardiceforbingo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks For Reading!","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-02-18T01:29:24.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b, awesome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demonz6","date":"2015-02-17T22:31:01.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the idea a lot. rito make it happen!","replies":[]}]}
