It makes sense in terms of protecting yourselves from attempts to cheat, but I always felt like it should be safe enough to have a clear cut policy of \"If we did not get the impression that this player was attempting to gain an unfair advantage in a match made game, we will limit any response to a warning not to use this program again\".
