I had stopped playing ranked for a while, and decided to play one today. But guess what? You know it! An AFK, for the entire duration of the game. \r\n\r\nAfter the game, I decided to open my search engine to find a post (Similar to this one) to vent my complaints about the ranked system and how it's not fair etc. I noticed something though. I saw posts complaining about this issue dated back in 2012.** 2012! **Are you kidding me? Riot has made a wonderful game and has done such good by it, but come on. They can't find a way to fix this lingering issue, when they've had ample time to do so in a span of 3+ years?\r\n\r\nIt's not only the player's fault for not connecting, AFK'ing on purpose, and the likes... but it's also Riot's fault for not thinking of a solution, or just simply taking a solution from the league community's _**MANY**_  posts about this issue! Of course it's possible to win uneven matches. What's impossible is to win matches where your whole team is depressed (And playing badly because of it) because they have experienced the situation many times.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not even mad about losing _**LP / Series**_ and such. It's the fact that I'm _**forced to sit through 20+ minutes of being dominated**_ by the enemy team. Hopefully one day, Riot will come to their senses and fix this issue.","replies":[]}
