Because of this, we can't undo any actions taken in Hextech crafting :(  Once it has been disenchanted, it cannot be undone.\n\nI know this isn't the answer you were looking for, but I hope it helps clarify!","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-06-06T23:12:58.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said it the last time you answered something similar, but I don't mind repeating myself ^^\n\nIf **everything** asks for a confirmation, the average person ends up not reading it anymore and blindly clicks. Asking confirmation for **any** action is not a good solution. Please relay this up to the engineers and designers that can make the change happens :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-06T22:08:28.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately Player Support doesn't offer any services pertaining to Hextech Crafting at this time. Their policy on refunding content etc. is pretty strict so they won't do things like that, sorry. Please be absolutely certain you are selecting the correct option before using it.\n\nYou can always submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to make your requests to Player Support directly, but so far I've seen them uphold their policy on this 100% of the time.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864","replies":[]}]}
