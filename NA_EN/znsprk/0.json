I've seen a few threads about this this morning.  When you have some time, download the [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a trace route to 104.160.131.1.  This will help give a better idea of what's happening.

Beofre: 40ms constant no fps lag, now: 60-80ms then spikes constantly 200-300 for a couple of seconds, sometimes 500, rarely over 500, then back down. Happens very frequently. Never ever hit 40ms anymore. I restarted modem/whatever none of the settings have changed except ip address because it's not static.

This has been known to have some issues with league from functioning normally, and may need to be switched out.  Your ping is also increasing before every reaching our servers, so your routing is hitting a few bumps to get there. In addition,  I'd suggest reaching out to your ISP, and provide them with your traceroute.  They should be able to pinpoint their node to find out what's going on.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Znsprk","date":"2016-10-25T17:42:17.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it be possible to ask ISPs to somehow re-route whatever server/bump I'm in?

I suggest troubleshooting your connection issues first, as you are getting a bump as you're leaving your local network.  If you're unable to switch to another router, try our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to help, then run a few more traceroutes and let it run for a few minutes to be sure.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Znsprk","date":"2016-10-25T17:25:17.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response!
