I came back into the game, and played for another 30 minutes and helped a lot with carrying my team to victory, despite being at a level and money disadvantage. My team won, with my doing the second most damage on my team, however I still lost 19 LP.\r\n\r\nI guess I can live with 19 LP being lost, but I feel like if I&#039;m going to lose LP anyways, why did I bother to come back? I can imagine a lot of people not wanting to reconnect to games they have dced from because there really is no incentive. You are losing either way, so why waste time?\r\n\r\nI just personally think there should be some kind of incentive, not gaining LP necessarily, but something like you dont lose any LP.","replies":[]}
