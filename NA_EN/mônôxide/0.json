I can't verify my e-mail.\r\n\r\n I reviewed the verification FAQ to see if it was a normal thing, and the issue was touched on briefly. I get a message saying;\r\n\"Invalid email token. Please click the link in the latest email you were sent.\" The FAQ states that it does this if I use an outdated link, but I'm clicking the most recent one in my inbox. I've tried to redo it several times now.\r\n\r\n I'm trying to change my e-mail to a newer one. I do the normal steps, and then the verification. Normal steps work fine. Enter the passcode, etc, it redirects me and does this.\r\n\r\n Please help ;_;{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T04:05:20.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's rather odd.
