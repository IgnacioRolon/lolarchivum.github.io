Using recent rework articles as a point of reference, I came up with a fresh take on the now-dated champion.\n\nI thought a lot about the \"power fantasy\" of playing a gravedigger, a minion master and so on. Compared to the direction and depth League has developed with their newer champions, these stereotypical concepts come off as either one-dimensional or a little too arbitrary. Would a player fresh off the heels of a cosmic, egotistical dragon, or an artistic (see: psychopathic) gunslinger feel excited to play a dude digging up graves for ghouls? Ehhhhh.\n\nYet, there's potential in the foundation of Yorick that begs for some expansion. I decided to dig a bit deeper (heh) to see what could be done about providing Yorick with depth while retaining the essence of what made him enjoyable to those who currently play him. All seven of them.\n\nTo put it simply, I imagined Yorick as a shady peddler with a suspiciously eloquent demeanor. While slipping away from a group of scoundrels after a deal gone wrong on the shores of the Shadow Isles, he has a grave encounter with Karthus. Desperate, but still of his wits, he makes a \"deal with the devil\" to collect the souls of slain travelers in exchange for his life. Karthus plays into the offer, but as a binding clause, he curses Yorick into a being of both of life and death - able to freely act, breath, eat and feel, but with bindings to dark magic.\n\n**Abilities**\n\n**Passive: Black Market**\n\nEnemy large minions, monsters and champions that are slain near Yorick drop a Soul Coin. Unspent coins empower Yorick to safeguard his funds, providing him with damage reduction for each coin held up to a maximum of 6. Spending 4 coins at the shop allows Yorick to hire a single undead bodyguard that will stay with him until it or Yorick is slain, or if a new one is hired.\n\n**Brock**: A tough, slow brute that reduces incoming damage by a flat percentage.\n**Pastor**: A fragile, slow caster that occasionally emits a shield onto an allied champion.\n**Seizer**: A fragile, quick rogue that deals stacking bonus physical damage with each strike.\n\n_Bodyguards have a leash range, regenerate health out of combat and will prioritize attacking champions in combat with Yorick. If a bodyguard is slain, they will go into stasis for a period of time before dissolving into the earth. Yorick can use this time to visit their body, paying half their original cost to revive them at half their maximum health._\n\n**Q: Shovel Strike/Shovel Might**\n\nPassive: Upon attacking an enemy champion or monster, Yorick strikes twice in quick succession on a set cooldown. The first strike reduces his target&rsquo;s armor for a few seconds while the second strike deals bonus physical damage. If Yorick lands both strikes in succession, the cooldown of this ability is reduced.\n\nActive: Yorick can manually activate this ability to shovel the ground and project a clump of earth forward, dealing physical damage and slowing targets in an area in front of him. This ability triggers the cooldown of Shovel Strike.\n\n**W: Grasping Earth**\n\nYorick curses the earth in a large target area for a set time. Every few seconds, a small area within the zone will indicate a warning of approaching demise. The area will then erupt with the clawing grip of the undead, dealing flat magic damage and slowing targets above. If an enemy champion or monster is struck, Yorick is healed for a percentage of his maximum health. This ability prioritizes enemies that have been recently struck by Yorick's abilities.\n\n**E: Paralyzing Leech**\n\nYorick targets a nearby location and after a brief delay, a monstrous leech is summoned. It travels in a straight line along a chosen direction, increasing speed over the course of its path or until it reaches a wall. If the leech collides with an enemy, it stuns them and deals magic damage over time. Otherwise, it leaves behind a slime trail for a short period that briefly stuns enemies on contact.\n\n**R: Curse of the Death Merchant**\n\nYorick succumbs to his evil curse, transforming and empowering him and his bodyguard for a short duration. During this time, he and his bodyguard have increased maximum health, movement speed and tenacity. Each bodyguard also gains an additional quality during this time:\n\n**Brock**: Emits a toxic miasma, dealing magic damage over time to enemies around him.\n**Pastor**: Increase the potency and frequency in which he casts shields.\n**Seizer**: Attacks decay his target's armor with each strike up to a maximum amount.\n\n_I thought I'd throw this concept out there to gather your thoughts. Many key stats and numbers were left out intentionally as this is purely a proof of concept for a core design. If I see that people like this concept, I'll happily post my analysis on what his laning phase, skirmishing and teamfights would be like. I'll also draw up some pictures for ya'll.

I considered the idea that he could revive them upon their demise with his ultimate. He would bring an end to life with the dead he ruthlessly issues forth.\n\nHowever, I had to stop myself, at least when it came to this idea, from letting things get out of control. I like the concept of Yorick manipulating the dead (or undead creatures of dark magic, for that matter) to do his bidding. Yet, I really tried to get in the head of Yorick's potential opponent and what already exists in League. What would be fun to play and _play against_? \n\n_Malzahar_, for example, is one crazy dude with plenty of voidlings to reap and destroy. It makes sense for him to have a number of insignificant minions to fire-and-forget. I'd like to imagine Yorick as a more intelligent alternative with a meticulous approach to his evil-doings. Would Yorick settle for a brainless zombie to do his bidding, or would he survey and select the right tool for the job. In this case, minions are his tools.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Polackslaktarn","date":"2016-06-02T22:00:37.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, the whole concept of Yorick is to use his ghouls (undead army) to fight for him.

Awesome!\n\nI wasn't considering that character in my thought process, but Resident Evil 4 is one of my all-time favorite games. Now that I think about it, the concepts align in some ways. Props to you for pointing that out. \n\nMuch of my original inspiration came from the cliche, \"don't make a deal with the devil\" in conjunction with a particular character in the film, _John Wick_. In exchange for special coins, this \"cleaner\" and his goons would tidy up and discretely dispose of corpses in the aftermath of a murder/assassination.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-06-02T00:45:00.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great concept but i feel like he has too much cc for how much power he has.

You need to reward players for dodging the initial leech right?\n\nIt's tough to say without balancing actual numbers (as I've deliberately avoided for the time being). In this concept, Yorick's CC would be collectively designed to be not too punishing - mostly so that he has a chance to chain his abilities in a sequence, especially against agile opponents. To be hit directly by the leech would indeed be the most punishing effect (keep in mind its delay and initially slow movement), but consider the trail like a different spin on a moving wall.\n\nFor example, if Yorick is able to land the leech directly, he has good odds that this W will follow suit, resulting in Yorick being able to comfortably get in range for his empowered auto attacks. If he completely misses it, the slime trail may assist in zoning his opponent and he may decide to shovel dirt at them instead of auto attacking to help his W follow up. There are micro and macro decisions Yorick can make here - both in in the conditions and chosen sequence of his abilities, as well as the decision to hire a minion that he feels is more suitable for the overall phase of the game he's in.\n\nTo put it in perspective, I imagine the direct leech stun to be about 1.5-2 seconds, while the slime trail stun would be about 0.5-0.75 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-06-02T01:20:07.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, how far would this leech travel? :O","replies":[{"poster":"Raharu","date":"2016-06-02T01:34:47.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jofeyy,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=5Z3iXYG9,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2016-06-02T01:20:07.773+0000)\n>\n> Out of curiosity, how far would this leech travel? :O\n\nI would say the leech itself would be the size of a Teemo, with a trail range of about 400. The cast range would be about 400, with a distance travelled of around 800. So if you summon the leech directly in front of Yorick at max range and set it to travel in that same direction, the maximum effective distance would be close to the range of a nidalee spear, just slower. Realistically, you might choose to set it at more creative angles to block off a certain path, though it does stop at walls or the first enemy hit (including minions).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-06-02T00:29:58.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but I don't think his ult needs to be changed.

Currently, his ult doesn't _feel_ satisfying enough to reinforce it's purpose. Currently, the most consistent \"payoff\" is when Yorick uses the ult on himself as there as is a direct internal communication within the player of what to expect. After a handful of games, I noticed that allies didn't often react appropriately to being ulted. Either they would continue to avoid combat upon revival, or they would disengage the fight completely before realizing they'd otherwise be given a second chance upon death.\n\nHowever, this could simply be a matter of feedback. Additional visual clarity might be all that his current ultimate requires.","replies":[]}]}]}
