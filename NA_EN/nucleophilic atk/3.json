Stopping Taric from healing and stunning isn't a big deal at all because (1) he can just cast them again in a second or two and (2) you just wasted a stun on taric that could have been used on someone else.\n\nYou are really failing to grasp the obvious point that CC counters some champs more than others. To say CC counters katarina is true since she is squishy and has to jump into your team. You can interrupt her long-cooldown damage ability and blow her up in just a few seconds. She is then useless for the rest of the fight.
