Earlier this week I got the message that I have been permanently banned because of use of malicious 3rd party programs. I though that this must have been a mistake, since I have never used a 3rd party program or been punished before(no bans, warnings or chat restrictions). I searched around on the league discussion board and reddit and found that other people have had the same happen to them and gotten their account back. I read that I should check my match history, so I did and saw 5 games which was not played by me. My account was compromised\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/uVnmlJde-3rd-party-program-bans\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4374753797/208383032?tab=overview\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4374697135/208383032?tab=overview\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4374757126/208383032?tab=overview\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4374802111/208383032?tab=overview\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4374842785/208383032?tab=overview\r\nI then send an account suspension ticket, which later i found out was a big mistake. \r\n\r\n“From what I saw, there were no signs of compromise on the account. Even if you weren't the one that performed the actions that led towards the ban, it still falls under your responsibility as the creator of the account to take care of it and keep the credentials private and secure. Therefore, without enjoying saying this, the permanent ban won't be lifted or modified, as a result.”\r\n\r\nBut if I wasn’t the one performing the actions leading towards my ban, but another person did because my credential weren’t private and secure, wouldn’t that not mean that my account was indeed compromised?\r\n\r\nI did some more searching where I then found out that I should had sent an account recovery ticket from their own article and twitter, since they are the specialists in this case and are the one who can actually assist with recovery.\r\nhttps://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054013-Understanding-Getting-Permabanned?fbclid=IwAR0GTrCqR0WW6CK63IUPrC_5Dw0HaL_9fF11wAdMjottUdF0wJmzMhdg4XY\r\nhttps://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694\r\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotSupport/status/1152256297569570820\r\nSo I went ahead and did that, but because I already sent an account suspension ticket where they have already addressed my concerns they won’t look at it.\r\n\r\nSo here I am making a last resort in hope that I can get a rioters attention who can help me and let me prove that this is indeed my account, and my account was compromised during those 5 games. As said before these 5 games should be the only games in my entire match history where 3rd party programs have been used, and that my account was compromised there.\r\nI know they can check and see that those are the only games in my entire match history where 3rd party programs have ever been used, and they can see where the account thief logged in from, and they can check that it’s not me playing. I am 100% confident that if I had just found the article and twitter post before i sent my first ticket, and did the instructions given there I already would had gotten my account back but now I am stuck here.\r\nPlease help me to get a rioters attention and hopefully my account back","replies":[{"poster":"DONT NEEEED TEAM","date":"2020-01-24T13:52:02.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got perms for \"3rd party\" 3 years ago and got unbanned insent tickets to riot saying i didnt do anything and they kept denying.

A purchased account that was botted up.\n2. Use of a boosting service that used scripts\n3. Giving a 'friend' access to the account and they use scripts.\n\nMore rarely, there may be third party scripts for *other* games (i.e. autoclickers for idle games) running that trigger Riot's detection systems.","replies":[{"poster":"FakeKatarina","date":"2020-01-24T04:55:31.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used an auto clicker for cookie clicker few days ago,could it be the reason i got my account permabanned?","replies":[{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2020-01-24T05:13:44.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FakeKatarina,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xMZGzpFA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2020-01-24T04:55:31.413+0000)\n>\n> I used an auto clicker for cookie clicker few days ago,could it be the reason i got my account permabanned?\n\nIt's possible, especially if it was running during a LoL or TFT game.\n\nI remember seeing warnings about them a few years ago, and I don't think that's changed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dumah","date":"2020-02-16T08:57:20.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me too and today actually, did you manage to recover your account?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karfuss","date":"2020-01-24T04:30:42.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"it still falls under your responsibility as the creator of the account to take care of it and keep the credentials private and secure.\"\n\n2020, 10 years and '200+ collective design experience' and Riot still, to this day, does not know what two-step authentication is. \n\nAny half-assed hacker can brute force an account if they're determined and patient enough, regardless of how complex the password is. They're not stupid. They know that. So do better. Cancel any log-in from an untrusted/different PC, unsecure/different network and have an incorrect password timeout (15 mins or so). Ping a randomly generated code to account owner's email or an app for them to unlock the account and force a password change.\n\nThey have this for the damn site, so why not the client itself? \n\nAnyways. Request someone else to look at it, it looks as if that support agent just looked at the account at face value. Rather than looking a bit deeper and identifying that a different PC and IP accessed the account during those games, and activity returned back to normal when you recovered it. It's understandable, it happens. \n\nAsk them to look at account activity during those games you've identified, and see what they come back with.
