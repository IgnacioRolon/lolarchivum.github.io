If i do then ill have to restart again. Sometimes it doesnt even work even when i restart so ill have to restart multiple times. I saw someone posted a similar problem and some riot workers gave them a guide, but i did everything in the permissions guide (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)  and it still doesnt work. League worked perfectly fine for me until the recent patch. I even reinstalled/repaired the game and nothing works. I disabled antivirus, checked hardware, updated everything, ran as admin but nothing works.\r\n\r\n*Yes I even tried the task manager end process/end process tree thing and tried opening the client as admin again but it still doesnt work.\r\n*Yes i even did the delete lolairclient folders in RADS before i reinstalled from scratch.\r\n\r\nIM SO FREAKIN FRUSTRATED.

So when you click on the *launch* button and nothing happens, it usually means your PC cannot reach the login servers.
