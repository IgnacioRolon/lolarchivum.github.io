I suspect this may be caused by something in your route to the server. To test this, you can try a force reroute of your connection by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). I can't provide support for these programs, but I recommend trying them to see if you can bypass the error you're seeing.\n\nI recommend trying the VPN's below:\n\n>[Hot Spot Shield](http://www.hotspotshield.com/) is a free service, but players report mixed results.\n[CyberGhost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us) has a free option.\n\n\nLet me know if anything changed.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDeathCow","date":"2016-09-15T00:57:47.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been wondering about the same thing.
