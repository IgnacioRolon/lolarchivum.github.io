I don't really mind that much. What does get to me is that I've done this stupid queue 3 times, and each time after the 20 minutes ends, my wifi glitches or something and I return to Lobby. And I have to queue again, and again. Every time I have to wait 20 minutes, and never actually play at all. The queues that I have waited don't even count towards the 5 games that I do have!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-06T02:54:48.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The queues won't count until you actually play a game. I'd honestly suggest that you step back from queuing up before you possibly end up getting a longer wait time due to \"queue dodging\" anymore. Take a couple precautionary steps by looking over your network settings following the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nPay extra attention to port forwarding and how you can configure your DNS settings, as those can help give you a smoother connection with our servers.","replies":[]}]}
