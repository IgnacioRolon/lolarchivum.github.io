(No I am not using the Alpha Client, I'm still on the classic one because I don't feel like downloading it until I am forced to)\nLast I checked, this was live servers, not the test realm. Everyone keeps lagging, everyone keeps DC'ing, skip Patch 7.1 until you get your act together because right now this game is unplayable.\n\nLast match I was Tahm vs Camille top lane. As we played it became obvious I had the advantage and could beat her, then your servers decided to constantly lag me until I got DC'd for 5 minutes.\nWhen I was able to play again I had lost 3 towers and my lane opponent gained 4 kills.\nThere is 0 reason for you to call yourselves a gaming company when your servers are not playable.\nPlease fix the servers connection before you add the next patch which will just make things worse.\n\nUpdate : Just had a match where we had a remake due to a Nami never connecting. Thanks again.\nUpdate #2 : Just played Poro King. Our Jhin never connected and toward the end our Varus DC'd for about 20 seconds, I DC'd and could not come back because the game ended, and the enemy team's Gangplank at some point DC'd toward the end as well.
