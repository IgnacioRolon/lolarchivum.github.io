Are vintage slices only shown during PvP matches? \n\nIn game, whenever I would use Grey Warwick&#039;s E, the sound of his howl was missing. The animation and visuals would go off, but he wouldn&#039;t howl.\n\nI figure there aren't many Grey Warwick owners/users, so I figured I'd throw these out there so you can get some data.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MEMEMEMEME","date":"2017-01-27T22:13:32.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Shuyin!\n\nUnfortunately there was a cut off date for the vintage border on Grey Warwick, it looks like you obtained the skin after that day. \n\nAs for the howl, I just loaded him up in game and everything looked good, are you still seeing this issue? If so are you doing anything while casting E? Or there is a chance that a volume setting is low that could be affecting this audio.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-01-28T18:58:54.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I loaded into the game today the howl issue was gone, I don't know how or why but I'm glad it is.\nThanks again for your time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-01-28T01:24:22.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To bad about the vintage thing, but that's a whatever.\n\nAs for the howl, it's the only sound effect that doesn't play. Every other sound effect seems fine, but tomorrow when I do my morning match I'll check it out again and adjust the volume to see if that changes anything. \n\nThank you for your time and I'll give you an update tomorrow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LynxWhiteGlint","date":"2017-02-02T05:51:57.637+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey when was the cut off date for these vintage borders because I've owned both skins too and don't have the border...
