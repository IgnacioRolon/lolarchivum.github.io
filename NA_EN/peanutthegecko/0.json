It worked fine last night after I added the league ports to my firewall to let me play, but today the last two games I attempted have resulted in this error giving my team a afk player. May I ask for the current ports that league uses(If I missed any) or any troubleshooting tips that would help this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T17:32:02.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like there may be a local network setting that could be preventing you from reaching the servers properly.
