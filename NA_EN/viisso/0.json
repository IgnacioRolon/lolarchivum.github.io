When I would auto him when I have the electric surge passive to do more damage, and apply a mark of the storm, if he blocked it with his wind wall, I did not lose the stack. Like, he stopped the auto, but it did not remove the passive that I had built up from Kennen&#039;s W. I noticed it about 2 days ago, and I have been seeing it ever since. Is this something that anyone else has been seeing, or is it just something I am missing in my game?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-03T00:40:31.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mark of the cheese is applied on hit with any ability, right? \n\nThe stacks go on yasou, not on you (as in {{champion:63}} passive, not {{champion:4}}  E), so a failed attack should not have any effect on them?","replies":[]}]}
