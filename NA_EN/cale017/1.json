The nerfs to mana regen are not the death of the mage class. Making the Morellonomicon cost more is not the death of the mage class. Then focusing their balance changes around AD champions is not the death of the mage class.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because having an all AD team is a bad idea in most cases. Doing all of one kind of damage makes you easy to itemize against. People can focus all their gold into just one of the two resistances and the rest into health and/or damage. And god forbid they build a Thornmail. Or have Rammus.\r\n\r\nOr both.\r\n\r\nStop freaking out, people. Please. Just because Riot has been focusing their changes on the other side of the chart doesn't mean that the one not getting as much love is being forgotten entirely. AD champions take up more slots, are usually in more places on a map, and usually act as the engagement or peel for a team so they're picked more often. Not because the mage class is dying, but because the mages have set parameters and uses. They're damage. Damage that mixes up what tanks have to worry about. Some have insane amounts of damage that even stacking like crazy won't save you from, some have a mix of damage and utility to make them horrors in teamfights, some have mobility and damage to make it so that they can juke around whatever you throw at them and then deal their own back. And that's pretty much it. You rarely see a mage initiating a fight. You rarely see them roaming before their lane is won. You don't see them divebombing the enemy team alongside their tank. They have their role, wherever they fall between caster to assassin, and they stick to it. If having a branch of champions focused only on doing one thing to the exclusion of all other possible options were a bad thing, ADCs would have meant the death of the melee champion and, last time I checked, if a Wukong jumps on an ADC he's probably going to get the kill.\r\n\r\nChill out, seriously. Especially when the change being made isn't *even that bad*. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a fed mage build a DFG and just think to myself, \"Great, now they've got another free 500+ damage on a hotkey.\" The play patterns that it creates ARE unfair to play against. They make any amount of MR you build mean next to nothing, which last time I checked quite a lot of people including myself are bringing up more and more often as unhealthy for tanks to deal with, AND does enough damage to rival a champion ability with a button press. In addition, most champions that build it don't even need it to kill you. Aside from the mass AP and the nice chunk of CDR, the effect itself isn't strictly necessary. In a teamfight you shouldn't be focusing the tank in the first place, so you don't need the extra burst on the one person who MIGHT survive your full salvo anyways, and if you're solo against a tank, chances are good that you're still going to kill them long before they can kill you because you're just dealing THAT much damage.\r\n\r\nDFG isn't necessary, in fact it's unhealthy. If anything this is one step closer to balancing champions that everyone bitches and moans about like Fizz, Akali, Syndra, Katarina, *insert hyper carry AP champion of choice here*. Funfact: I've built a DFG, in over two years of playing this game, maybe three or four times. Each of which I would realize AFTER getting a kill, or several, that I had never even activated it. Funny how it wasn't necessary for me to perform my job even with the champions who use it. \r\n\r\nI know this may be hard to understand at first, but even the champions who use DFG can still do a lot of damage without it. Something about having a passive 30% boost from another high powered AP item I can think of comes to mind, along with several scaling weapons that AD champions just don't have, and the ability to mix stats together a lot easier than an AD champ can. \r\n\r\nKnow how many AD items give MR and CDR on the same thing? \r\n\r\nHow about a mass amount of AD along with armor, and an active that makes you invincible for a few seconds?\r\n\r\nOh, and let's not forget about the AD item that multiplies your total AD.\r\n\r\nUntil the day comes that AP champs are removed from the game, they aren't dying or even on their way to die. There are QQ threads that pop up routinely about how overpowered some of them seem, and people debating over whether or not X AP champion is worth a damn because one person can play them like a master while another whiffs skillshots.\r\n\r\nI can almost guarantee that anyone who's complaining about DFG being removed probably lacks vision of the larger picture at play here, and has also complained about an Akali, Fizz, or Leblanc 100-0ing you and it being OP.\r\n\r\nSurprise, surprise. This is going to alleviate that issue. Almost like they're balancing the game in response to community outcry about how much assassins are currently dominating the meta. I KNOW, right?? Crazy!\r\n\r\nFunny how many people are blind to that. If you think you NEED DFG to be effective, I'd suggest you learn to prioritize and work with your team better instead. I guarantee you that there's nothing it gives you that you couldn't do just fine without.","replies":[{"poster":"Moulin Rouge","date":"2015-01-15T17:39:19.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Can you not see how casters have been stacking Morello's early and finding out how stupidly overefficient it is for the price?

Now, Riot has said \"NO MORE DOUBLE MORELLOS\". So now what? What the hell do we do to offset the mana regen nerf???\n\nWell, for one I'd suggest not spamming spells wantonly. It's a little known fact that pretty much any AP laner can get through the early game without running out of mana if they aren't spamming spells. Almost like you don't NEED mana regen items to preserve your mana. By the time you're at the point where you have to be spamming spells you're going into the midgame, which means that you should have one or two items built already and one of them should be a mana regen item, or a pure mana item, which alleviates the issues you're having with casting spells.\n\n> \n> The only way to now offset the nerf is to cripple the mid game of a mage with a tear or building a RoA PLUS a mana regen item. Mid game is when they're supposed to be most powerful. \n\nIt's interesting. Everyone is bitching and complaining about how hard it is to play AP casters but honestly, I haven't had an issue with it. Maybe because I've always been conservative about my ability use, but that would mean people have to adapt their playstyles and we just can't have that can we?\n> \n> So now you face this choice. Do you build mana regen items and hope you can scale into late game? Or do you build one mana regen item and hope you don't oom in the middle of a team fight or something else that's crucial? Damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n\nMost AP midlaners don't hit their stride until the mid to late game ANYWAYS. During the early game, if at all, they're supposed to either be helping teammates get kills or getting help on their own. This isn't making some drastic change to the general power curve, just shifting when they actually hit it. Plus, you can be conservative with your casting early, build a damage item, use it to win your lane and then build the mana regen afterwards, usually on another useful item like Athene's or Morellonomicon, so that you're prepared going into the mid game. Or you can sacrifice some early damage to get early casting power by rushing one of the two and running on your runes and masteries for, *gasp*, a whole ten or fifteen minutes, before building heavy into your damage before teamfights have ever really even started breaking out en masse. In either case by the time the heavy teamfighting starts you've got both damage and regen/bonus mana.\n\n> \n> And damned again if you do either because your mid game still sucks and late game, if you're not Cassiopeia, you will still be in the back drop of the emerging ADC with a full build. GG riot!\n\nIf your midgame \"still\" sucks, then it already sucked and the removal of DFG and the inability to spam abilities isn't going to change that. Late game most AP casters can nuke an ADC without much issue provided they're smart about it and don't just walk up to them trying to do it. I think you're forgetting that during the late game people aren't exactly supposed to be able to fight an ADC one on one. \n\nThe removal of DFG alters how people are abusing the ability to cast spells almost unendingly with extra regen/mana, as with double stacking Morello's and going for the DFG allows you to do. Sitting pretty at a 40% CDR cap with a neverending stream of mana? Well hell, guess you can just spam your abilities all you want and that's considered balanced, right?\n\nHonestly, half the reason Riot has a hard time is people like you, who lack the ability to take a step back and use some foresight to understand why they're making the changes they are and what to expect in the future. I'm a hardcore cynic but most of you people are so obscenely negative against any and everything that Riot does that they could make every champion free to purchase and throw out third tier runes like confetti and people would still complain.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melies","date":"2015-01-15T20:59:44.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be completely honest I've always felt that {{item:3128}} was not a healthy item.

Unless you're Amumu. The reason people don't pick them solely for their damage is because it isn't just their damage that wins them matches, it's their ability to use CC to set up for their damage, and as a result they usually have more access to harder CC than you'd find on top laners or junglers in a lot of cases. The only other role that can rival the amount of CC available for AP casters is the support role, and there aren't exactly a whole lot of those, most of whom who have the best CC are, surprise surprise, AP based champions. It isn't strictly limited to the AP casters, no, but it does heavily favor them.\n\nEarly in the game, and well into the midgame, you aren't going to find someone with access to as much waveclear as an AP mid has because a single spell from one of them can eat an entire wave in a lot of cases, whereas most ADCs have to take down a wave minion at a time, and top laners have to rely on items like Hydra to eat waves as quickly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2015-01-15T17:43:50.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read the patch notes the price of Morello's is going up.

The fact that so many of these champions rely so heavily on a DFG to do well just shows that the item is doing too much, and that their kits aren't doing enough. But you can't buff their kits without making DFG do so much more from those buffs, so it has to be removed to safely make those changes.\n\n> \n> This ALLOWS them to START THINKING about MAYBE making some changes to SOME items or SOME champions because that item is gone.\n\nThis lets them look at who needs more power where in their kits with what effects and at which points in the game. Last time I checked making some changes to some items or some champions is all a set of nerfs or buffs is in the first place. But right now they can't even begin to think about making any buffs to items or champions who normally use a DFG without allowing that DFG buy to ramp up any small change into a big one.\n\n> \n> Which means people who enjoyed AP/Mana burst casters will pretty much be SOL for the first half of the season now while Riot figures out WTF they want to do.\n\nExcept that mana users can still win lane. They can still make plays in teamfights, and they can still kill manaless users. Yes, right now they're having a hard time competing with manaless users, who IMO could use some buffs in a few cases. But the reason they're having issues against them isn't the items they have available, and if an item is the only way one of them can hope to keep up, like a DFG seems to be regarded as, it's a sign that the champions need to be strengthened so that they can do well on their own, not having to use an item as a crutch to do it.\n> \n> They never release a coherent patch where they remove something, and compensate for it at the same time. They just gut things, then go \"We'll figure out how to fix what this broke later.\"\n\nThat's how the process works. If you both remove one thing and strengthen another you get mixed variables when examining the changes that have resulted from it.  Has a champion become dominant because something was removed, or has the other champion become dominant because something was strengthened? League is a game of variables, so these variables have to be examined and changed one at a time. So yes, you have to remove something, see how it effects the state of the game to find out what needs to be changed, and then compensate for it afterwards.

Riot is updating the exact same way that any online game updates their in game systems. It's only because League is so amazingly popular, and the community is so stupidly vocal, that it looks like there's an issue with how they run things. I'm not saying they're perfect, but I'm saying the community makes them out to be worse than they actually are when they're really just making the same sorts of decisions that any other online developer has to make, even if they aren't always making the right one. Keep in mind that this is only the fifth year. Most early game companies might be lucky to release a full version of a best selling game in that time, barring the yearly CoD rehash. Honestly Riot deserves some credit for making the game as popular as it is in such a short time, and people need to understand that it isn't easy to keep a game like this running. Not everyone is going to like every change that they make, but they're trying to do what other companies have years of testing to accomplish on a weekly or monthly basis and that is no easy feat.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-01-15T17:19:24.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While yes, you want a varied source of damage so itemization becomes difficult, the biggest problem right now is there is such a massive discrepancy between AD and AP, between manaless user and mana users.

Assassins were already rising up to a problematic state, shooting nerfs after nerfs at mages with mana regen doesn't help the situation though, it only escalates it as manaless assassins and fizz are going to sky-rocket in popularity.\n\nI agree with you, the issue is coming quite a lot from manaless user's overwhelming abilities in lane or during teamfights. But getting a DFG doesn't help an AP mid laner against their opponent, for several reasons. Early on in the game, the mid lane is usually decided by who can get their full salvo out first. Whether or not you have a DFG, if you're smart about how you're setting up for your combo then you're probably going to come out on top. I know this might sound hard to believe, but you can actually win lane against a Zed. The main bulk of the problem with manaless champions is that they can usually stay in lane forever, barring being poked out of it. Buying a DFG neither removes their ability to do this nor significantly increases your chances of killing them any more than any other item, most of which are more useful anyways as a DFG *shouldn't* really be a champion's first buy anyways for every reason that they're removing it. It turns someone who could kill you by being smart about how they do it into someone who can kill you by slamming the hot key and spamming their other abilities wantonly. I agree with you that manaless champions need to be reigned in, but not that DFG is a significant portion of an AP mid's strategy against them, and that losing DFG isn't the death of the mage class as everyone seems to be saying it will be.\n\n> \n> The short end of the stick I guess is why worry about being OOM so much when there are other champions who are incredibly potent who don't have that problem?

For one example it doesn't take a genius to see that Ahri alone is most likely never going to see a lot of play again.\n\nRabadon's allows you to keep up in terms of damage, and Zhonya's allows you to negate a lot of a manaless champ's damage output if you get either of them early. Your options aren't gone, but you're forced to make smarter moves to get that reward than if you were just able to push your DFG key and then a point and click spell or two for the kill. I hate to admit it, but Zed DOES actually take some skill to play. Not necessarily poking with him, but being able to keep up with his movement and set up to get the full use out of your kit when you get your ult, prepositioning your shadows where you hope someone will go once they're ulted, yadda yadda, is no easy feat and you can tell the difference between someone who's spamming his abilities and someone who's set up their kill combo. Getting a DFG removes much of the strategy that a AP caster has to use and just makes being successful with them a matter of how quickly you can spam your abilities while they're debuffed, not how smart they can cast them throughout the game.\n> \n> While I see the point you're trying to make, it's not just about the DFG, its about the state of mana users on the whole that are getting hit hard by this as a collateral. Assassins that use DFG are still going to assassinate their targets without it, in other words, the removal of the DFG does nothing to curb assassins, but only further hurt mages instead.\n\nI never said that the mana users weren't falling behind. If you can see my point here then you'd see that the only thing I was pointing out was that the itemization changes don't mean that they're going to fall completely off the charts. The reason they're having an issue is because of the dominance of AD manaless users, as you have already pointed out, and that's got nothing to do with itemization changes on Riot's part. Whether or not DFG is removed, Yasuo will still be able to poke you for free every third Q, Riven will still be able to hit every spell to chunk most of your HP and then do so again ten seconds later. Zed will still be able to get a reduced cooldown on his W and toss a Q at you every few seconds. Riot should be focusing on that, but they have to set up to be able to determine who needs buffs where.\n> \n> You talk about itemization, but as it stands right now, considering most AP damage comes from the mid-lane (only exception I can think of is Corki, Ezreal, and Lissandra), why not just play Zed, beat the shit out of the mana user until they are so far behind they literally tickle you.  Which I must say, is disturbingly easy to do so with him, then suddenly, you don't have to worry about AP.\n\nThe reason the mage class is struggling right now has nothing to do with the items being changed, it's the competition, and the fact that they're relying on gimmicks to do well against the dominant class at the moment is a sign that there's something inherently wrong. Using a DFG to increase damage output doesn't require any skill, and there's no way to play against it. It's a point and click ability that's on about as long of a cooldown as most AP caster's ults, at least early on, and it reduces a champion with a high skillcap who's heavily reliant on predictive casting or positioning skill to shouting \"DFG POWERS ACTIVATE\" and bashing their head against their keyboard to fire off everything they have hoping the damage is enough to get them the kill instead of playing smart. That's not a healthy play pattern, and any buffs to champions who use a DFG will very quickly go absolutely out of hand as DFG allows them to do so. But by removing it from the game you can then buff the champions who have come to be known for it in a way that allows them both to compensate for the lost potential damage a DFG gives while forcing them to play smart instead of bashing a sausage against their keys for kills and calling it \"outplayed.\" As it stands, they can't buff champions, or even most of the AP caster items, without DFG taking any change they make and not just running, but flat out sprinting with it as soon as someone builds it.\n\nThe long and short of it is, yes, mage champs aren't in the best place right now compared to AD manaless mid laners, or even manaless top laners if they try and go there. But removing DFG is a necessary evil to be able to pinpoint exactly where champions who rely on it would need to be buffed without allowing the champs who use it to run rampant because of it after those buffs. It's the first step to finding their balance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"asktiks","date":"2015-01-15T12:23:23.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the disconnect is real with this one...\n\nfunny how you are blind to the double standard...\n\nzed is THE most complained champ on the game, yet they PRECISELY EXPRESS THAT THEY WANT HIM TO DELETE YOU WITH ONE BUTTON PUSH , and at the same time they cite \" we remove dfg because we think that one shotting a champ with no counterplay is not healthy for the game\"  \n\ncan you not see the hypocrisy with this? \ncan you not see how casters continue to get the middle finger with mana regen nerfs, morellos cost increased to make it \"fair\" meanwhile casters HAVE to waste one item slot just to cover mana regen and be able to stay in lane but lets give energy users a free pass so they can continue to dominate\n\nfunny how you are blind to all that\n\nive been here long enough to know how the buff nerf train goes, and I can PROMISE YOU that we will have to wait MONTHS for the supposed\ncompensation buffs for caster champs (and just wait and see how they buff veigar to cancer status because they feel he needs it meanwhile lets nerf sindras one poke spell because we cant have \"lane bullies\" yet we express that we LIKE zed being a lane bully....\n\nriot is going the way of blizzard and makes me wanna play dota 2 more frequently with every thing they do or say about game and its direction , I HAAAAATE the current meta and all these changes enforce it further..","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2015-01-15T17:31:32.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=asktiks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KkpUmmKE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-15T12:23:23.466+0000)\n>\n> the disconnect is real with this one...\n\nReally now?

Even his ult requires you to use other abilities and auto attacks along with it to actually get a kill on someone unless they're at low health, at which point whether or not someone can kill you with a single button press is negligible as any assassin can do so.\n> \n> can you not see the hypocrisy with this? \n\nNo, but I've already noticed some \"disconnect\" on your part.\n> can you not see how casters continue to get the middle finger with mana regen nerfs, morellos cost increased to make it \"fair\" meanwhile casters HAVE to waste one item slot just to cover mana regen and be able to stay in lane but lets give energy users a free pass so they can continue to dominate\n\nCan you not see how casters have been stacking Morello's early and finding out how stupidly overefficient it is for the price? Getting two of them puts you at the CDR cap within the first fifteen to twenty minutes of the game, gives you 300% mana regen, and 160 AP. The only thing that's wasted here is the unique passive. At that point they're free to cast whatever they want whenever they want as often as they want.\n> \n> funny how you are blind to all that\n\nFunny how people stacking Morello's is actually still a healthier option than buying a DFG in terms of counterplay.\n> \n> ive been here long enough to know how the buff nerf train goes, and I can PROMISE YOU that we will have to wait MONTHS for the supposed\n> compensation buffs for caster champs (and just wait and see how they buff veigar to cancer status because they feel he needs it meanwhile lets nerf sindras one poke spell \n\nI'm not exactly new myself there, pal. And I dunno how much you've actually been paying attention, but Riot's been delivering very quickly on their nerfs lately, due in large part to the large scale changes that have been made to the Rift and the various functions within it. They didn't nerf her one spell, they nerfed one spell and made the other hit more accurately to make it a bit more consistent to play against her which, honestly, she does need a bit of a nerf on that Dark Sphere given that she can cast it clear over both minion waves and chunk someone for several hundred hp during the laning phase.  \n\n> because we cant have \"lane bullies\" yet we express that we LIKE zed being a lane bully....\n\nThey like Zed being a lane bully, but most people actually have an easier time dealing with Zed than they do Syndra because Zed doesn't have a point and click nuke outside of his ult. You can still dodge 80% of his kit during the laning phase without issue. The problem isn't that he's a lane bully, it's that he's a lane bully on top of being one of the best assassins on top of having easy farming under turret on top of being one of the best split pushers. He's doing too much, something that, for all your bitching to me, *you* seem to be very blind to. There's nothing wrong with being  a lane bully. There's quite a bit wrong with being a lane bully on top of a mass amount of other options and roles. It's the reason champions like Renekton have weak late games or why Teemos are so horrifically fragile: If you can handle their intense sustain/poke during the early and mid game, you're rewarded by being able to thrash them in the late game. There are significant weaknesses to their kit that compensate for how overwhelming they can be to deal with in lane. Zed has none of these things.\n> \n> riot is going the way of blizzard and makes me wanna play dota 2 more frequently with every thing they do or say about game and its direction ,\n\nThen go play DOTA and leave League to the people who actually enjoy it.\n\n>  I HAAAAATE the current meta and all these changes enforce it further..\n\nSorry pal, but Riot's actually been improving in the last few months whether or not you agree with the choices they made. Which the only reason you wouldn't is that you're blind to the bigger picture, which is what I state as the only reason someone would complain about any of this is in the first place. So thinks for proving my point. Not only are most of the facts you tried to mention here inaccurate, but the rest of your analysis of Riot's choices lacks the level of understanding that was my point in all of this. All in all, it seems that I'm not the one who's disconnected here, you are.
