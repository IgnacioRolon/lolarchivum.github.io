Remakes only activate under these circumstances, so I'm curious what happened when someone tried starting the remake?  It's possible it didn't activate if that Illaoi was constantly reconnecting and disconnecting. Check over the rules for remakes and let me know if anything stands out.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/20e8b3825d5e149837cf23ac689995de.png","replies":[{"poster":"ARTEMIDA","date":"2018-01-19T02:02:52.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"none of those rules explain why the game wouldnt let us remake, i dont see the first blood rule being the issue because there was no kill until  long after we tried to remake, so i dont get why the game thought she was connected and she was inactive for over 10 minutes before she reconnected, so this is really puzzling me, rough start to the season.","replies":[]}]}]}
