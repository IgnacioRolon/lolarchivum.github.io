I doubt they could even do it by the 90th minute. The people NOT in the clubs helped drag the games out (by not ending) to the point where the people IN the clubs finally had complete control of the game due to scaling (which probably would have happened around the 120th minute).","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-06-11T01:10:27.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":36,"body":"They could have also just surrendered?

I'm guessing the club people were on some kind of call since you can see the veigar totally ignoring the kindred even thou kindred is killing his teammate, kindred walks right by it at less than 100 hp and veigar does nothing. \n\nThey were being held hostage lol!!!! but in reality....how are the odds of that actually happening? I mean this people queue on different groups and is not really common to be matched up (I know if you are on the same league or if people is on your friends list you are most likely to get matched against them but the odds are still pretty low). \n\nMost likely this happpened. 2 groups went into queue, they realized they were playing against each other after selecting champions. They went into call and stall or...fake xD. I will go for fake and say it was a custom game","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-06-11T02:21:52.092+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"AHHH okay that makes sense, I misunderstood that.\n\n Im going to call it fake because matchmaking doesn't work like that, at least in my experiences.
