The idea of &quot;learning  your enemies warding habits&quot; is a cool though, but, is completely useless for 2 reasons:\r\n1. most people have the same warding habits\r\n2. most games dont last very long so you sont have enough time to truly &quot;learn&quot; anything unless you play the same person/people again","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-01-28T22:14:59.519+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee Sin can now ward hop to both allied and enemy ward debris.","replies":[{"poster":"Goosetard","date":"2016-01-29T00:06:15.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"underrated post","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dediguise","date":"2016-01-28T23:38:55.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rebonack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b8Yt4RBF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-28T22:14:59.519+0000)\n>\n> Lee Sin can now ward hop to both allied and enemy ward debris.\n\nLOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-28T23:13:54.815+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're playing against people that only ward in the usual spots, or you've got a great understanding of the vision game as a whole then yeah, ward debris isn't going to be as meaningful for you. If you're a newer player trying to figure out how to use pinks/red trinkets well though, or you're trying to get a read on something pretty specific (e.g. whether the enemy team's been warding across baron/dragon wall at all) then that's the sort of case ward debris is intended to serve. It's a deliberately small, simple feature, not something that's designed to occupy a lot of mind share.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-01-29T00:37:37.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good for non-support mains to learn how to ward.\n\nAt least they're subtle enough for any \"experienced\" warders to not really notice them.","replies":[]}]}
