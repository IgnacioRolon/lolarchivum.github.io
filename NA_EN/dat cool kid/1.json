Can imagine some possible improvements, wouldn't see it as as clear a win as replacing Fiddle's passive for example though.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-03-01T08:29:56.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"Olaf's passive is great...in concept. Except for the point where the rest of his kit has absolutely no synergy with attack speed or on-hit items, and he's a Melee champ without any innate mobility. Which means that more attack speed for him means...nothing, since he only gets one attack in before he has to pick up and throw his axe or use E again anyways.\n\nHe doesn't get to take real advantage of his passive anywhere outside of the jungle at the moment, and he's weak as all _shit_ in the jungle right now. Hell, he's weak everywhere, and what's more, he's weak everywhere because you deliberately keep him that way!","replies":[{"poster":"Dantilq","date":"2016-03-01T08:46:54.633+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Umm... no. ALL what you said is simply not true.\n\n**A. His kit have no synergy with AS.**\nFlat out wrong. His E cooldown goes down with autos, he gains a major AD boost from his ultimate. High AD steroid scales well with AS. His W gives lifesteal and overall autoattack boost, which causes him to heal from autos. Olaf is reliant on getting off as many autos as possible, and his kit is built around it. Both his inlane and injungle sustain is partially based on this. In many situations he manage to get off several autos, especially during all-ins and in teamfights when he rushes down squishies.\n\n**B. He is weak everywhere**\nNot really true, he sees occational competitive play, but Olaf is among the harder champs in the game to play. Look at his winrate curves. [For players with 125+ games he have a freaking 70% winrate in the jungle](http://champion.gg/champion/Olaf/Jungle). His overall winrate is pulled down by inexperienced Olaf players. He is not weak, if you perceive him as weak, it is just because you are bad at the champion. This is not surprising though as it is a very hard champ to master, and have always been. He is up there among the top 10 hardest champs to play.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-03-01T09:07:41.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"His kit is reliant on getting off as many autos as possible, yes.\n\nUnfortunately, his kit does not actually provide him with the opportunity to get all the autos he needs unless his opponents are _idiots_.\n\nAnd he still builds neither attackspeed nor on-hit items, and this is because he has to spend all of his time actually getting onto and chasing other champions, and this he needs to build for as much tankiness and move speed as he can, and had to rely on his base damages.\n\nAnd if you really think <2% of players on a champ with less than 2000 games constitutes a valid sample size for winrate by experience, it's time to think again. Hell, that could _literally_ be one or two players, it's so small.\n\nIn short, he's weak. And everything in the game shows it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-03-01T17:14:34.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good Olaf player can catch up to his target with enough Q's. BoRK is a good item on him (which is an attack speed item). \n\nHe doesn't need to build much attack speed because there is an attack speed cap in game.

Attackspeed only works for him when he's able to stand still and auto...like in the jungle.\n\nBoRK isn't built on him and hasn't been built on him since before it was nerfed. It's all about Black Cleaver.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dantilq","date":"2016-03-01T23:50:25.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He shouldn't build AS items as he have a massive AS steroid. He should build tanky and AD, which is what he does, with some occational on-hit with BC and the situational BotRK(though it is much less popular now with better options available). If you have high AS through your kit, you shouldn't buy more AS items, it's a waste of DPS. You get AD so your attacks hit harder, it's basic math. AS have synergy with his kit, but so does AD and he gains so much innate AS, that more AD/tankiness is better.\n\nToplane he have 10K games, and the curve is very similar. His winrate really goes up when the masters of the champ play him. It's how Olaf always have been. When Riot gutted him because he was being EXTREMELY oppressive in competitive, he was having a 45% winrate in soloQ. Current Olaf is similar, he is occationally played in LCK and LCS, to example Reignover likes the champion and can play him, and he did when Immortals faced TSM in week 2. \n\nSo no not everything in the game shows he is weak. I am sorry to say but your conclusion is flat out wrong again.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-03-02T05:31:34.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His AS steroid is shit unless it is combined with his passive, and is always always always leveled last. You know why? Because Olaf doesn't actually value the AS that highly.\n\nThe curve is similar, yes.\nExcept, oh wait, apparently the very best players of toplane Olaf have about a 53% winrate with him. So viable, you know?\n\nAnd when it comes to Reignover...oh man, the very best jungler in the LCS  picks a champ he's known to be unreasonably fond of despite that champ being weak _once_ must mean he isn't weak and is totally competitively viable, man! Let's just ignore Lee Sin being picked up at more than twice that rate despite also being weak in every level of solo queue right now.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-03-01T08:52:54.148+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest Olafs passive is still on the better side.\n\nBut, on other hand thos champions have alot worse problems..\n\n{{champion:127}} mana regen gimped practically to 0\n{{champion:85}} the worst energy return from all energy-based champions. \n{{champion:35}} Huge skill-gate.
