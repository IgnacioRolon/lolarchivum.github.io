Certain champions are either going to just be flat out broken if they have the right numbers due to how frustrating and/or overloaded their kit is. See Yasuo, Kalista, Riven or Leblanc. If they have the right numbers, they're going to be difficult to deal with. If they don't, they're generally not going to even make be a presence in LoL. \n\nUsually this means their kit design is an immense problem. \n\nThen there are others whom become strong through virtue of how the meta is playing out. Vayne is pretty much a textbook example of this. Tanks are significantly more frequent then now then a year ago. The more tanks or high hp champions you see, the more you will see Vayne. I do think she is too strong, but there is a reason why her playing and win rate has shot up lately. When tanks fizzle out and assassins come back, you won't see a lot of Vaynes being played.\n\nThen the cycle will shift to complaining about which ever assassin is overpowered :p","replies":[{"poster":"Tails Doll","date":"2015-09-01T05:35:11.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not when assassins come back, but when they buff ADC lane bullies.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-09-01T14:40:33.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, because Vayne has one of the easiest times dealing with assassins - self peel too stronk.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2015-09-01T00:20:34.957+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still complain about Kalista and LB, they're still annoying as all living fuck to deal with, and I've always hated Vayne as well, among a couple other champs who become the frequent focus and then don't get talked about as much for a while afterwards.\n\nJust cause the forums do through a cycle doesn't mean no one thinks past focus' aren't still broken, OP, or just irritating.

Just by ulting and using the dmg from the 3 shadows + Botrk+ Hydra+ AA he can kill you.... Granted that's a long combo, but still, I think he is the only assasin that can 100-0 somone without his ult.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and the fact that the DMG from the ult IGNORES resistance, meaning you have to save your def skill for the tick not the dmg, which I think is kinda bullshit, and it's hidden iformation.\n\nI found out about this while playing Yi against him, meditated his full combo and barely did dmg to me, then once I left meditation the tick went of and took ALL my hp, only needing a single AA to finish me off.\n\nThat's really bullshit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-09-01T00:03:10.065+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, Vayne has gotten pretty out of hand.
