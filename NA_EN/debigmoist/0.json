But, I once considered starting playing him. Why? 1. Build path diversity: I loved how Kog'Maw was able to be both mid lane poke mage and bot lane AD hypercarry. That's a great deal, you've got 2 different playstyles packed into one champion for 4800 IP, for me, it seemed awesome.\n2. I wanted to start playing adc and I thought: \"why not try Kog\". Finally I didn't buy him because of his visuals: I'm not saying they're bad, no, Kog has very solid visual design. It's more that I wasn't keen on vomiting on everything xD But, to the topic. I also hate this Kog'Maw rework for a lot of reasons:\n1. It killed Koggie's build diversity. Let's be serious, AP poke Kog is right now dead. He was in good state pre-rework, but now he is useless because of completely unnecessary ult change that (probably) nobody ever asked for.\n2. The overall concept of Kog as adc. I may be wrong, but I always saw Kog as the sheen procing % damage shredder, who built TriForce and BotrK as his 2 core items. He was immobile, but had some means of kiting, like Phage from Trinity, his E etc. Right now, he is that on-hit completely immobile gattling gun. Stand in place and fire. If you move, you loose a lot of potential DPS. So, how do I outplay my enemies if I can't even move my ass to reposition, unless I want to sacrifice shit tons of my DPS? Which brings me to 3rd reason why I hate this rework.\n3. Protecting Kog'Maw. Let's be honest: as an adc with least CC and mobility, Koggie needed some protection and a quite good communication between team mates. That's why his win rate in SoloQ wasn't very impressive, but he was really good in 5v5 and competitive. In soloQ, especially lower elo, where there is no communication, it's harder to play champ like Kog'Maw. But, in teams and competitive, he was reliable and effective, because there is a voice communication in such teams. It's much easier for Kog'Maw and his team mates to properly position when they can communicate with voice. But even then, Kog was able to reposition himself in certain situations and kite. But right now? He HAS to stand still. If he moves. he is nearly useless. Which means that, in order for Kog'Maw to deal as much damage as possible, he has to stand still and be protected. The team comps with Kog have to be even more centered around protecting him then ever. And any good play from some burst mage, assassin, initiator etc can completely screw Kog's team. He is even more team reliant then before and because he lacks any reasonable means of protection, he is completely unreliable.\n\nThat is why I don't like this rework. It effectively turned me away from ever trying out Kog'Maw. Good job Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Melee Form","date":"2015-12-22T02:19:15.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord of Iwul,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7g8eEjfA,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2015-12-21T15:20:42.794+0000)\n>\n> 2.

Your ad is cut by 45% but you hit twice as much with your w so actually it does scale just not in the normal way. You have to consider the damage from two attacks as being one; you are actually doing 10% more ad. Bloodthirster synergizes well with hurricane on kog and has far better survivability than ruined king. Also the proc on ruined king does less damage every time you hurt the player; blood thirster gives you consistent damage.  If someone dives you late game or when your w is down you will have a much better chance of surviving this way. Really though what else are you going to buy with him? He is so forced into a that tiny playstyle box that there aren't many other good options. {{item:3153}}  is a good item on kog I am just suggesting that if you are having trouble late with that maybe try {{item:3072}} instead so hurricanes proc deals more damage and you get that extra second if someone dives you to make something happen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dr lichdeath","date":"2015-12-22T00:30:58.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont like it runaan makes his autos more choppy = not good raba aint that good botrk is far better cuz on- hit effect is not an auto\nif i had to choose a build id be {{item:3153}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3146}} or{{item:3135}} or {{item:3035}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-21T11:33:35.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DuhPaikiller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7g8eEjfA,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-12-21T01:56:13.725+0000)\n>\n> Why fix something thats not broken.

Kogmaw is insanely strong now, but its not his q or his e or his r that makes him so. Its his w. If you hit full 5 attacks a second, which is quite doable, you have decent sustain, INSANE damage, and some amazing kill potential. One of my more recent games started with me killing a zed mid lane at level 1 with kog, getting a dagger, and then going to my top lane and killing riven a couple times in lane. People underestimate kog and if they close in on you and THEN you pop your w there is no running before they are dead depending on how close to full build you are and how much mobility / mr they have. My typical build for kog goes nashors bork beserker greaves wits end (interchangeable with devourer for when you are jg kog) and guinsoos. That hits you at 5 attacks a second once guinsoos is stacked up, with 0 attack speed runes, and leaves you one extra item, which i usually make gunblade for even more insane sustain. Level q then w then e for the added attack speed. I usually start picking up kills around nashors being done which helps snowball the build. Run the stacking extra attack for a flat 80 extra damage on top, and low ad / mr doesnt matter. I also run my ap page because they removed the ad scaling from w, which was a buff to ap kog a bit.\n\nTo be fair though, i never picked up kogmaw till AFTER his rework. I have no clue how he played before. I agree that r isnt really a poke mechanic, but i also say he doesnt really need a poke mechanic. His whole thing is to sit down and kill anyone that gets close for 6 seconds, then run till he can do it again in 5 more seconds. If i throw an r right as i get into combat with someone it usually lands when they are half health, and if i throw a second one sometimes they are dead before it lands. Especially if you can land your q on them before using your w, to shred their resistances. He is one of my favorite champions right now, as long as there is ANYONE AT ALL on your team who can peel for you. He is weak to cc, extremely so, which is a good trade off for his literally insane damage. I hope he DOESNT get any major buffs as they might end up majorly nerfing him in return because he would become too good at that point.","replies":[]}]}
