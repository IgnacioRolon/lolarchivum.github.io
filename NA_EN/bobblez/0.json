Right?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"One might describe silver as a group of people who have the following problems: No Awareness, No Mechanics, Feed A Lot. \r\n\r\nSo with that said, I'm going to dedicate all my future games, to playing exactly as described above. Why? Because I am that. I'm silver 5. So I don't know any better. I can't play better than I am, because thats what I am. It's like trying to have \"naughty time\" with a girl like justin beiber. It just isn't going to happen.\r\n\r\nSo with that said, Screw everyone in the silver elo. Like seriously. F*k all of you. I will now play EXACTLY as I am....it's not trolling. There's no rule that you have to play better than you are. Soooo...for that. fuk u....get owned. time for yall to lose your next game...or carry my ass. :)","replies":[]}
