Cheers ~\n\nI&#039;m sure by now everyone has seen the new Hextech Annie skin on the PBE. If not then go check it out, it&#039;s pretty neat. \n\nHowever, this skin is going to be locked behind the RNG of the upcoming Hextech Crafting system. Now I don&#039;t mean to be a Negative Nelly, but I already know where this is going. Soon all skins are going to be released and available only through Hextech Crafting. \n\nI know what you&#039;re going to say. &quot;Rose, this system is so cool and Riot wouldn&#039;t stoop to that level&quot;, but unfortunately I am unable to believe you. There is another game that uses a random chest system for their skins, and currently out of the ~200+ skins they have released, more than half are locked behind these chests. These chests give you a random chance of getting a random skin for a random character. Doesn&#039;t that sound fun? Not to me, and that&#039;s why I quit playing shortly after I started. \n\nSure, Riot&#039;s new system is a little different. Collect keys (or key fragments to then make a key), to unlock a chest to then collect random fragments for random skins for random champions. Hopefully the RNG is in your favor to get the chest exclusive skins. Otherwise I hope you&#039;re prepared to burn your paychecks rolling for those fragments. \n\nObviously I&#039;m walking into this with a negative point of view, and maybe I&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised. Hopefully Riot will keep this trend of &quot;Chest Exclusive&quot; skins to an extreme minimum, but honestly I know better. Having been unhappy with Riot&#039;s direction for a while this is just the icing on the cake of disappointment. \n\nWith love, \nan unimportant voice of concern\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add this as I'm sure it's a point that's going to be brought up a lot if this discussion continues. \n\n\n\n> Why would they make a lot of chest exclusive skins when they can just make shit tons of money selling them normally?\n\nThe logic I fear Riot will follow is this: why make 1350 RP selling the skin directly when you can put it behind an RNG chest that costs (for example) 400RP to open for a chance to get the fragments needed to make the skin? Inevitably consumers will be spending more trying to get the skin they want. \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR...  Concerned that Hextech Annie is the beginning of a trend of Chest Exclusive skins where soon everything will be locked behind RNG. Your usual boards complaints.","replies":[]}
