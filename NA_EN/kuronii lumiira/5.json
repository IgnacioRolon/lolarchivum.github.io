Its not like Morri was a hyper late game carry.\nAnd if she plays super passively, you could just hard wave push and then roam.

Then I realized you were refering to Morg mid, and NO Iv never done that... mostly because her E is black shield and you cant hit the raptors with that... As for Q, W on them, no to that also. If I need to use that for healing I can just back off and wait on a cannon minion probably. If Im being beaten badly enough that I need to resort to the raptor camp for healing I feel like Im doing something wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Built to Tylt","date":"2017-12-18T00:49:27.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I meant q+w, sorry. \n\nI suggested the raptor camp because you can do it over the wall and the camp will reset but you will still get healed off it. It was just a thought and maybe something to help if you aren't quite ready to leave lane but need a little boost. And of course it was Morg mid, as that's what you were referencing in your own scenarios.
