From what i have gathered it seems the best way to do so is to learn to read/ write then speak as well as expose yourself to the language in your daily life. \r\n\r\nSo i thought to my self i will just change the text in League to help expose myself to the language! I was surprised that the game does not have Irish Gaelic despite having players in northern Ireland and one of the EU offices being in Dublin.\r\n\r\nI did see the other languages like Turkish, Czech, Greek, and Hungarian and was very impressed! \r\n\r\nSo i'm sitting here like \"well s@^* there goes that great idea.\", then it hit me.  I can't be the only summoner with this idea, A lot of people like to see what other regions play like and what metas and builds they come up with.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of making the league community closer and more educated i propose a wider range of supported text languages. Maybe in the form a text packets able to be downloaded to the client or selected VIA client. Below are a small handful of points that hopefully others agree with and can convince Riot to at least look into this feature.\r\n\r\nAdding options for players to change the text language would be super beneficial to those trying to learn a new language. Especially because the community is very active and players would see said language often while playing and be also able to hear the spoken English definition hence making connection between what the written word is and its English translation.\r\n\r\nNOW this also benefits players who wish to interact with other players from other regions. It would also encourage this type of interaction with players from other regions and brings a lot of potential to the table.\r\n\r\nThis potentially can be a wonderful tool for pro players with foreign members on the team to help them learn to communicate with each other. Personally i don't know enough about LCS teams to provide a strong argument to support this particular point, but i do know language is a huge obstacle among teams and this may help.\r\n\r\nLastly you would be doing something for the U.S. players by giving them a tool towards language learning that doesn't exist in out education system. More specifically you would be allowing players learning a new language to integrate that language into their daily lives!\r\n\r\nLanguage is a barrier, between us as humans, that can be brought down through exposure, curiosity, and education.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T21:59:30.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very well thought-out post!
