Karthus is absolutely silent for you and your ally team (not sure about the enemy team, the replays won't function at the moment) in all ways. No VO at all, not from movement commands, not from emotes or skills, nothing. This wasn't specified before, but neither I nor any ally can hear him, it's not just on one end.\n\nIt only occurs with Karthus. I was using Phantom Karthus and didn't try other skins, but I also don't run into many other Karthii.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FFF1","date":"2016-01-30T15:09:59.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.
