We never had an argument or anything but we lost a ranked and he got mad and defriended me. I gave him a day to chill and then sent him an invite but normally you get that little black tab with their name on it at the bottom of your friends list and I tried it on a random person(which I deleted) and it worked, but on him I got nothing. Please help im not going to say his name for privacy sake but if u need I can tell you.\r\nI belive he blocked me but im not sure :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T20:33:57.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, there's no way to tell if a player has added you to their block list. It sounds like if they did block you, it could have been an impulse decision, so maybe they'll come around.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderspam","date":"2016-09-13T21:59:05.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, im kinda sad but i figured that was the answer. :(","replies":[]}]}]}
