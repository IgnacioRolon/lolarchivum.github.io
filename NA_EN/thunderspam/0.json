I downloaded the launcher just fine and it will pull up the league logo and begin the download, but then it won't load the little bar below it and it cancels itself after about 4 minutes. I am using a wired connection with decent internet speed, and I'm just confused about what to do now beyond redownloadi g the launcher. Thx :)\r\n\r\nPS. I have been unable to pull up the launcher home with all the news and champ rotation on it, because its the loading bar underneath the logo itself that I'm having trouble with.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-20T16:54:52.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a connection problem that can't reach the patching servers or download assets like news.

I had to stop the download halfway after an error and it wouldn't load after several tries. Eventually I just deleted all league data and started again but now I'm running into a PvP.patcher Kernel error. I've googled it but I haven't found any actual help on the issue beyond re-downloading(again) and hope that this fixes it. Is there any little \"Rito Spaghetti code manipulation\" things I can try(I.e. file movement/replacement)\nThanks again for your help and for helping keep the game running!!!!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
