Ragequitters should get a more severe punishment like in Overwatch as an example, there players who (of their own will) quit the game will have a short ranked match ban and a XP debuff for the rest of the season(1 month in league would probably be enough). This Ranked game match ban would the perfect type of punishment for these types of people, they would still be able to play but it wouldn't hinder other people's competitive experience plus this combined with the XP debuff would really incentivize players to stay in the game even if they are losing. Some of you might be worried that this will affect people who dc do to their internet or electricity going down yet Riot already makes the distinction when a player goes AFK for a large amount of time their champs portrait in the post-game lobby is marked with a cross which typically doesn't happen with people who dc for a short amount so applying different punishments shouldn't be that much harder. This probably won't reach anyone since rioters aren't really active in EUW but I hope you can see the points I'm making, have a good day.\n\nEdit1:grammar.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-21T17:33:18.695+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":40,"body":"1. Because the punishment for any behavior is not going to be \"higher\" simply because it's a ranked game. If someone has an emergency, it doesn't matter what game mode they're playing in. Shit happens, and people aren't going to be punished harder just because it happened at the \"wrong time(TM)\".\n\n2. Overwatch's punishment systems, be it for chat, voice, or gameplay, are absolute shit and should **NEVER** be used as an example of good systems. There's a reason the game went to shit, and that Overwatch 2 is basically a meme at this point even before it's come out.\n\n3. The X mark is **NOT** what you think it is. Players can be detected as leavers regardless of the X mark, and there is no set time. Regardless, you don't even consider people with real life emergencies mid game, or who have computer/other issues that prevent them coming back.\n\n4. You haven't even seen the same player in your games. The chance that AFK players are having a negative impact on your climb is next to none. Maybe instead of trying to blame/punish others, you should focus on remembering that **shit happens** and there's honestly no way for you to know they ragequit. Assume the best in people - it will do you wonders in life.","replies":[{"poster":"Vonyalo","date":"2020-01-21T17:38:59.544+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"So it's better to punish 4 players instead of 1 because of emergency?","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-21T17:52:49.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":20,"body":"This has absolutely nothing to do with the other players - this thread asks specifically why the punishment to the player AFKing is not different/higher.
