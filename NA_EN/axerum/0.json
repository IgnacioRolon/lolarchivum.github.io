I find that his taunt is not that hard to hit, and it's pretty forgiving. I also love how everyone forgets his global presence which has swung a lot of games in my favor in ranked. I really hope Riot doesn't touch Shen because he's in a really great spot right now. He has defined weaknesses through a crappy laning phase and easy to stop ult, but his strengths are really cool and thematically good with a ninja appearing out of no-where to help his team.

I've never really been shut down on shen. If the laner is really agressive and shoves me under turret I usually am able to taunt him under the turret and chunk him so I can get back to even in the lane, or my jungler just walks top and gets a super free kill. I rarely \"lose\" my lane as shen on top, but then again I try to coordinate with my jungler to get an early gank if we can easily kill the lane (like ganking a ryze or darius) or I just make sure to put myself in a good position to back at 6 and make an aggressive play.\n\nFor his taunt, it is very punishing if you miss, but the hitbox seems to be decently forgiving. If your character model touches the champ, most times I see him taunt them. Also, many times I see them outside of the range indicator, but I still taunt them even though I shouldn't have simply because the champion models were close at the end of the taunt although they weren't touching. Shen does suffer if he misses a taunt, but with his Ki strike to get him back his energy, I rarely find myself useless since I run AS marks and get the 5% AS mastery so I can help energy regain.\n\nShen is definitely not a super strong pick, but I am super comfortable on tanks, and since Shen is rarely played, there is a simple bonus because most people forget, or don't even know, how to play against him. I do think that's the reason I feel good about playing shen, and why I think he's in a good spot. He isn't OP at all, because he has strongly defined strengths and weaknesses, and although the meta doesn't favor global pressure tanks right now, his niche is not \"meta\" but especially in soloq, being able to ult your bottom lane at 6 and push the enemy out of bot into a drag rotation is really strong and has won countless games for my team. \n\nI guess I'm just a shen fan-boy, but I really do think he's in a great place, but takes some time to learn how to use his global ult and have the map awareness to make the clutch ult plays everyone hates.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2014-11-15T07:24:30.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:30}} This makes Karthus a happy champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Axerum","date":"2014-11-18T21:28:04.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> We don't currently have any plans to remove any of the global ults in the game and in fact have a couple more in testing that are showing a lot of promise right now (at least one of which I expect you'll see in game at some point). \n> \n> When global ults have been problematic in the past (Panth/TF years ago for example) it's been because they've been free targeted movement abilities.

It would be a global skill shot similar to Ezreal's (visually I pictured it to be one large, spinning card), and would still allow him to gate to its location. I think it could be a nice buff to his burst (if given damage) and (depending on the speed of the projectile) give him more counter play, particularly if he tries to use it as an escape or to initiate.\n\nanother extension of that becomes possible is a variable length cooldown depending on distance travelled, likely exponential.
