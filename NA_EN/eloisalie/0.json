The thing is he doesn&#039;t really fit the definition for assassin that you gave, in fact he fits almost perfectly into the diver definition!\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I know when he was released he was supposed to be a diver type brawler champion, and his first full rework was designed to lean him away from the 100-0 death from stealth playstyle and more of a run down fighter playstyle, you guys said as much in the notes about his rework.  But now it seems you&#039;ve almost entirely given up on that original identity and have just settled on the ignorant communities view of him as &quot;just a bursty assassin.&quot;\r\n\r\nBut I feel like that&#039;s just cause of his burst damage alone, because he has none of the strengths the other assassins have!  Your definitions of the subclasses say as much.\r\n\r\nSo the main question I have is do you guys plan on rectifying this?  Will you try once again to turn him into the diver he is supposed to be and was originally designed to be?  Or will you just give up and make him a more easily balanced assassin who&#039;s only purpose in a team isn&#039;t to suicide bomb on the enemy carries?  I have always preferred playing Rengar during his periods of &quot;Tankgar dominance,&quot; since it feels more appropriate identity wise (in that he hunts people/creatures down and chases them for the thrill of the fight, not a quick out of nowhere kill), so I would prefer it if you guys tried again to make him more of a fighter like he was originally supposed to be, but even if you balance him more around being an assassin then I&#039;d be fine with that as well.  I&#039;m just tired of being pigeonholed into full glass canon assassin just cause my team rages at me if I ever build any sort of defensive items, even if I&#039;m the one carrying and still destroying enemy carries, because it&#039;s such a one-dimensional feast or famine type playstyle that cause either your team to rage about Rengar or the enemy team to rage about Rengar, at the moment it&#039;s just not healthy for the game.\r\n\r\nIf a Riot employee actually reads this I would really appreciate some kind of insight into where you internally plan on moving him, if at all, it&#039;s just with the assassin update coming sometime after the mage update and the new subclass definitions it feels like it&#039;s time to take another swing at reworking Rengar&#039;s kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-19T17:46:15.970+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"We'll be doing another class update at the end of the year. Divers and Assassins are the two best arguments for that spot at this point. Given Rengar falls somewhat into each camp I expect we'll do some work on him either way as a result. My personal take is that's more likely to push him towards diver characteristics than assassin ones, though I'd imagine he'll probably still have some elements of each regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"Fuzz2","date":"2016-05-14T02:23:09.176+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please for the love of god do not rework rengar or atleast do it very lightly.. The main reason he has such a dedicated player base is his current identity. He's a diver skirmisher that can't brawl without going in at the right time. He's an assassin that doesn't have the assassination tools other has and relies on comboing perfectly, and crits. He doesn't fit in either but right in between. And thats where the people like him. If you go on the rengarmains subreddit you will see that almost the entire community plays as an assassin. Moving him away from that will lose the interest of a ton of the player base.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ELOisaLIE","date":"2016-04-19T17:56:46.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's awesome to hear, thank you so much for taking the time to respond :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoCal","date":"2016-07-20T19:16:16.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even when significantly underpowered in terms of damage Rengar mains have always been the most persistent in terms of overcoming the difficulties and challenges of each new nerf to the champion.\nThe reason Rengar is so strong is because of his playerbase. We have thousands of hours on Rengar. Fucking thousands.\n\nRengar has a real flow of the champion. You have to weave and carefully knit in auto attacks. As a long time Rengar main I *really* don't care if I can't one shot. Just make sure he still is an extremely high skill champion whose reliance on weaving auto attacks together like a Tekken fighter weaves together combos (which is why we like Ferocity so much).\n\nWeaving is *honestly* the kind of description we're looking for when making changes to Rengar.
