I was gonna buy it but I figured since they expired on the ninth, I could wait and I'd get Sona as a champ plus my favorite skin for her. Today the card disappeared from my shop. Idk if it was because she went off sale in the actual store today or what. Thanks in advance for explaining this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-05T23:42:03.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I checked and did not see her in Your Shop.   The good news is that she is actually on [Sale ](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/champion-and-skin-sale-0102-0105-0) in the store **right now** though.  Selecting store in the client then skins should show her, just be sure to select On Sale on the left side.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsMaybelline","date":"2018-01-05T23:53:53.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks.
