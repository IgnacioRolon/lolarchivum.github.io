That being said the username i normally use was taken so my username and summoner name were different than i would have liked. The other day i found out the account that had my preferred username was inactive so i paid $10 to switch my summoner name. Is there a way to change my username to it as well? I know there isn't a way to switch your username but that would mean thousands of usernames are unusable even though no one is using them. That just seems wasteful to me. Maybe Riot will implement a system to change your username in the future, but until then is there a way to change mine?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-15T21:58:34.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently no, we don't have any way of getting usernames changed. Mostly it's due to how that is one secure piece of information you cannot find about someone else's account, as well as being a unique account identifier.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsMaybelline","date":"2017-10-16T02:00:55.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shame. What is Riot gonna do in like ten years when every concievable username is taken? Then again this is a problem only League would ever have.","replies":[]}]}]}
