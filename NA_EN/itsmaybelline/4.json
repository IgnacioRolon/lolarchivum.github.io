Match on Summoner's Rift as Bard. My game did the usual error message i get a lot which i relaunched my game and kept going. After i selected my champion the game went to the phase where you can see what everyone is playing as but aren't playing just yet. I Alt Tab'd to start some music and opened the game (Not client) again before my team had entered the map to start playing. Once the game loaded no player models were present, no minions, and no vision from players or minions. My chimes didn't spawn but the icon saying where they would spawn if they were there did. This lasted until around 3 minutes in which is when i quit the game and relaucnhed it and since that didn't fix anything i quit the game entirely and wrote this post. Is this because of my internet connection? My wifi is prone to occasionally hard crashing on cloudy days but it's only partly cloudy with moderate wind so i'm at a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-06T22:00:54.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could have probably happened from a shifty network connection, but it may have also been caused by some of the game files going wonky from restarting the match. I'd try running a quick repair through the client really quick, but if that doesn't help also go ahead and run through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[]}]}
