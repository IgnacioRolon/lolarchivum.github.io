What i mean is that im kinda forced to play a tanky fizz with road or even rylais ... thats ridicules but i really works and makes fizz viable that way. I just wonder if this was intended by riot? On the other hand Ad fizz top is a thing again and i can understand people who hate to face a tanky ad fizz on toplane because its just toxic and not really healthy for the game. Before the Rework came out, Riot said that fizz should be one of the most mobile assassins in the game, but they didn&acute;t even reduce his e cooldown. I can life with that but should Riot give him more mobility und reduce the base damage on the w? I would like to outplay my enemies with mobility not with pure damage or tankyness.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfram Oxford","date":"2016-11-16T14:17:04.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions shouldn't be forced into one build path.

They don't have the massive AoE engage and lock down, to perform the role of a Vanguard, but they have dueling power. Really those bruiser builds need to be compared to likes of Jax, Irealia, Fiora and Trundle.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Victusify,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vt4YPtoN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-16T13:43:28.501+0000)\n>\n> Tbh, after watching some streams most assasins can be turned into tanks now. the other day PhyLoL played Rengar with Cinderhulk, Claver, Dead Man&#x27;s, Spirit Visage build and when he had Cinderhulk, Deadmans and Cleaver he was sitting at 3k+ HP and 200AD. How is that fair?\n\nThis isn't actually anything new, Rengar always had a fighter build that relied heavily on CDR, as it relied on rapid stacking of fury, and frequent empowerment of his abilities, and as an added bonus more CDR meant more engages with your ult. (This was my perferd build. \n\nBack then I would have built Warrior, SV, and Lucidity boots for my source of CDR. And then I think it was common to see a Tiamat for extra clear speed. SV is always good, because it helps you sustain with your W. \n\nAmidively, the Rengar changes really helped his fighter build. This build didn't have quite the Bursting power of an Assassin build, but it game him better dueling power, and toughness. But I wouldn't say this works with all Assassins. (wouldn't recommend a tank build on Talon) But in Rengar's case, it gives him the role of a Diver, where his empowered E gives him just enough CC to make the role work. Where most other Assassins lack the CC and utility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-11-16T17:43:45.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Q's ad ratio isn't additional.
