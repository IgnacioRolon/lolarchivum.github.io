She has a 48% win rate despite being a simple champion. Perhaps one of the reasons she seems so powerful is that damage is so high right now and she is one of the few champions that can tank a lot of damage (as tanks should). Courage of the colossus is another reason, and it is getting heavily nerfed shortly, which should make fighting Poppy easier and hopefully shift the toplane meta (yay!). I main Poppy (almost 200k mastery) and I have found the following matchups to be quite difficult.\n\nMelee counterpicks are strong 1v1 champs with sustain such as {{champion:122}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:48}} \n\nRanged Champions who can kite her very easily include {{champion:10}} {{champion:133}} and perhaps {{champion:126}}.\nAlthough I have only seen it rarely, I'm sure Vayne top would also work fantastically.  \n\nIf you know what you are doing {{champion:114}}  and {{champion:41}} are good options. Fiora can riposte her stun and if you hit many vitals, does not matter how tanky Poppy builds. Fiora becomes more of a threat the longer the game goes on so even if Poppy beats you in lane Fiora will eventually reach the point where she can 1v1 anyone. \n\nPoppy has practically no kill pressure on Gangplank. He can zone her with barrels and instantly remove her wall stun with oranges. This, combined with his passive movement speed means that she can basically never catch him out and he can continue to poke with barrels and Q. Even if she ults you away to save herself, Gangplank ult can finish her off.\n\nHope this helps!
