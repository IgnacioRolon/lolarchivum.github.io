Yes, Ahri is a better pick simply because it sells but that's about it. \n\nThis was their chance to do something great with Soraka by giving her her first legendary skin with loads of new voice-overs/interactions with her pet, new animations all around with her wings, hair, death, and, again, interactions with her pet, who is practically non-existent in-game.

The fact that they took so long to release an obviously deserved skin (more than any other since no one is as star related) is so sad.

It wouldn't even give them as much trouble them to get her this as a legendary since she is already a star. But no, let's make something that doesn't make any sense because people only like Ahri.
