Riot's reworks are often aimed at A.) Champs who have fallen to the wayside or B.) Champs who have extremely outdated kits. It's why Yorick got a rework before pantheon: Despite being younger than Pantheon, less people played Yorick and he was in an overall worse spot. \n\nWukong does need a rework. He's still getting one. But he also has a pretty high playrate which means that you have to be more careful about reworking him. Also to address the incoming \"bUt wHuT aBouT aAtrOx!?\" comment: Aatrox only recently became meta after his rework was slated almost a year in advance. Bad timing, not that his design was in a good spot.

Perhaps they could do one of those many in client surveys they love so much to find out~ Besides we know Riot doesn't care about how popular a champion or role is unless it comes to selling skins. I mean Riot murdered marksmen and their popularity (number of people queueing for bot lane dropped significantly because of it), so being popular does not protect a champion or group of champions from a rework.
