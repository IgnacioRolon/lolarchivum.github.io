Just a simple button. Yeah, some people are just toxic in general and should be punished, but I just mute them and I see no further problem. Or grow some balls and don't take seriously what some kid on the internet in a game told you.\r\nBut they don't want to deal with the real cause of that toxicity. Unbalanced games, unbalanced matchmaking, toxic promo games, autofill, whole last year of dynamic q, real INT-ers ruining 30-40 games in a row and still playing.\r\nThey aren't answering on any thread about trash matchmaking, autofill, etc... but god forbid you said something to the 0/10 guy on your team.\r\nThey create the cause and then punish the reaction of the same cause they created.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-09-24T20:07:11.325+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that it is very easy to deal with flamers, so riot does.\n\nDealing with inters, trolls and passive-aggressive griefing is much harder, it is not the sort of behavior even a smart program can identify, due to how complex it is.\n\nThe sheer number of games makes it impossible for real people to review everything, and what is obvious to players is not as obvious to riot. \n\nThey have to sort through masses of reports (most of them just due to brats mashing reports on their entire team) and are only going to take notice of a troll/feeder if it is very repetitive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-09-24T20:00:32.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tbh i dont even know of its worth explainig why this threads are wrong, they come up every day man","replies":[{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-09-24T20:01:02.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i feel you man i feel you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sintrion","date":"2017-09-24T20:02:23.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you know, you can give people advice and not flame them for having a bad game.
