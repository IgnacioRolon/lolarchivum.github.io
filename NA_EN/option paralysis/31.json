Don't put words in my mouth. Like I said kat only brings damage. Other assassins do bring other things and have other things other than just damage. Other assassins have some form of cc or utility. Yasuo: knock up and wind wall. Zed: slow on shadow E and the ability to dodge targeted skills with ult. Shaco: fear, same thing as zed with ult. Kha: huge slow on isolated W and invis on ult. Rengar: where do I begin? Invis on ult, slow or root on e, cc remove on enhanced w. Talon: slow on W and invis on ult. Ekko: slow on q, stun on w. Need I go on? All of these plus other assassins bring some sort of cc or utility that keep them relavent when behind outside of just doing damage. Legit ALL kat has is damage, she provides nothing else to the team. So yes other champs are shut down by exhaust, but I would argue it hurts kat more than it does some others.\n\nI gave you a perfect example of how kat can outplay her opponents with her q placement. But of course you just disregarded it and said \"you can talk about zoning all you want and said she's easy compared to yasuo\" cause yasuo doesn't have a point and click mobility skill either. How naive of me. Must be a yasuo main. Since when did yasuo become the standard for champion balance. So I guess if the champ isn't as \"hard as yasuo\" then they have to be nerfed? Seems logical. Let me go look up some high elo yasuo players wrecking everyone. It's the same thing, it's a montage, of course they're gonna show flashy plays. You can do this with literally ANY champ. A youtube montage isn't gonna show a yasuo or kat player derping and failing hard. What a dumb argument. Oh there are kat montages on YouTube, must be OP. Stop acting like yasuo is so much harder than kat. You must not come to the boards often, cause last time I checked there's a nerf yasuo thread on the front page on the daily. The community as a whole accross all elos hate playing against yasuo way more. Yasuo has been out for a long time now, and a lot of people have a good grasp on how to play against him. \"kat wrecks high elo even when they know everything you mentioned\" cause yasuo doesn't wreck high elo even tho he's been out for a long time and people know how to play against him? \n\nJust cause my opinion doesn't line up with yours doesn't qualify my behavior and opinion as being childish. You on the other hand, launching personal attacks isn't welcome. If you want to have a disccussion about balance then keep insults out of it.

Learn how to walk around daggers.\n\nPeople seem to miss my point.\nI don't disagree with the fact the high-skill champions shouldn't have more tools in their kit or be useful  in more situations.\nI disagree on the matter that when people claim a champion should stay OP just because it's hard to play.\n\nThis is in general.IMO","replies":[{"poster":"Unvictus","date":"2017-02-05T13:09:01.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People aren't missing the point.. people aren't trying to justify her being op, we're trying to explain how to play against her cause a lot of people don't know how to. And once you do she's definitely not op. There's a difference between a champ being op and the players playing against the champ not knowing wtf they're doing and then going on the boards and crying. And then refusing to listen to any logic or advice about how to play against the champ and insist they're op anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2017-02-05T13:54:29.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Giving insight on how to play against an OP champion doesn't fix the champion.\n\nIt's useful,but if the champion is really OP,counterplay doesn't help much.","replies":[{"poster":"Unvictus","date":"2017-02-05T14:50:47.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'm saying is if you know how to play against her she ISN'T op.
