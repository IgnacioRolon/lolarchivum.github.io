All of her damage is frontloaded onto her W so once you hit that if you can't kill them with one rotation you're pretty screwed. Getting to people is hard without mobis, and sometimes you just can't build mobis or you're screwing yourself over. Waiting on full W to proc takes a decent amount of time. Her early game is worse, her late game is worse, and her mid game is okay if she gets ahead early. She does worse damage to tanks than other tanks. Her E range is nearly as short as an auto attack so in order to actually hit someone with it you have to sit there and walk up to them and if they're ADCs well you're gonna be dead before you get to them on most occasions. The speed up tied to your E is pretty ridiculous as well because you're only gonna be using it when you're in their face anyways so the move speed boost only has a point if they flash. Even then you're not likely to catch up to them unless they are  a fair distance from a tower even with the flash. The ultimate does insane damage, which is good, the problem is you have no way of gap closing without flash so most of the time you'll be using it to actually close distance instead of dealing damage with it, unless you're already on top of your target. I think she needs an E range increase, it's not even as long as her tentacle things. I also think the W prep time needs to be reduced per rank. With old Eve, you had a huge move speed buff to get to your enemies before they could react, as well as a decent sized shield and dual scalings so you could build whatever you needed. Now you're locked into AP so you have to build squishy and also be expected to just walk up and slap someone in the face. It's a little annoying. I might try building duskblade on her even without the AD scalings just so I can see if it'll kill them in one rotation because a lot of the time I can't unless it's an ADC and even then I can't without using ult. Might I also add I was charming a Yi during a game and every time I did, it lasted enough for me to get one Q off and he was back to normal.

For starters taking her stealth away until 6 is a huge difference in game play compared to her former kit and makes her quite bad at ganking or getting early pressure in (which usually determines the tide of a battle). Doing this makes her power farm until 6 (hello Diana 2.0) while the rest of the team is getting ganked by early junglers AKA Kayn, Sejuani - honestly anybody with a dash. Hell even warwick can gank pre-6 with his super fast W into lane then dropping a fear. The problem with her early pressence is that she no longer has her stealth to keep enemies on their toes and keeping vision control in check. Now all they need to do is drop a ward in bush and watch her walk into the brush then spam the GoodJob emote in her direction. The only way to actually do anything pre-6 is to W then flash Q or E to get the charm off, and even then they'd just run away once the charm starts casting.\n\nWithin all assassins there is one thing in common, a dash/escape. Evelynn does indeed have a dash/escape in the form of her Ultimate and (**poorly** ranged) E. Look at almost any champion in the roster that is an assassin and you will see that ALL of them have an escape/dash. With Evelynn she cannot kite out or deal any sustained damage in a team-fight because all she can do is go in pop her skills then ult away. Yea that **sounds** great and all but that seems to only work with team comps with only 1 tank or none. When it comes to tanky comps and comps that have multiple hyper carries it makes it impossible for her to do her job properly. All she has to offer is to do some damage **maybe kill** then dip for the next 4-6 seconds re-positioning. \n\nNow with other assassins they can do their jobs flawlessly because they have an engage and disengage in Ult and Skill form. Evelynn has that in the form of her ult but its her ult that can only be used once per fight (also stupidly high CoolDown), she cant bob and weave or outplay anyone like how LeBlanc, Akali, Katarina, Kass, Fizz and Diana can. And yes I even said Diana FFS, she can dash mutiple times when landing her Q on minions and enemies allowing for outplay potential. Eve on the other hand struggles hard with picks and actually carrying because of this. She feels like the wrong type of assassin in terms of League. When you look at all assassins within league they all have a similar narrative and that is to go in do damage and kite around with their abilities, AKA Zed's Shadow, Kats Shunpo, LeBlancs dash, Fizzes TrollPole etc etc. They are able to dish out constant damage and have the ability to position themselves in a smart and fast paced way. \n\nWhat you guys failed to do was make her the assassin she was always meant to be and is the reason why old Eve fell flat. Hell even her old self could deal a ton of damage over time with her constant spam of Q and E while building off-tank. Some suggestions for her would be to make her E a dash where she can pull herself to her target (and minions - kinda like Amumu E but with tentacles grabbing instead *no stun ofc*), enable stealth early game (maybe level 3?) and having the detection range be bigger then going down once you hit 6 or so as suggested by another user. Doing this will allow her to be played how she was meant to be an Assassin. Also her ult needs a CoolDown reduction so bad, honestly if zed and fizz can use their EXTREMELY high damage ults every 50-55 seconds with only 20% CDR then I think its fair that Evelynn can do the same; make her an assassin like her brethren and make her mobile.\n\nI think that about covers it and I feel many others would agree that she needs her stealth revamped a little and to enable her to kite in fights with mobility (Seriously she needs that dash/grab/tentacle grope whatever you wanna call it). Doing this will make her kit feel more fluent and sound, its the reason all assassins (except you diana) are extremely successful when pulled off by a skilled player. If you guys agree with what I said or have some suggestions please UpVote and share your thoughts, we all don't have access to PBE so initial feedback cannot be provided by the masses so lets voice our opinions and hope for a change.\n\n-Extra Suggestions\n* When Evelynn ults and teleports back make her instantly stealth to allow her to re-enter the battle swiftly or for a smoother escape.\n* When Evelynns in stealth make the charms mark time reduced\n* Reduce her E by half if she does get a dash when a fully Marked target is attacked (allows her to outplay and re-position like Katarina)\n* Reduce her ult time if she kills an enemy/enemies with it\n* Sorry I gotta mention it again, give her a dash (maybe reduce the CD when she gets a kill allowing her to keep fighting )","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2017-10-11T19:27:12.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't gotten a chance to try her out yet, but I'm still pretty bummed Riot went Explode from Stealth Assassin instead of Stealth Skirmisher.  They have her damage spread out and telegraphed due to her W and Q already.  Haven't we already learned that spreading out an Assassin's damage makes them feel awful?  Why not just cut out the middle man and make her a Skirmisher if she's going to be dealing damage over ~4 seconds instead of 0.5?","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2017-10-12T03:28:41.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her E still does a lot of damage if you land the charm.

She has oodles of damage.  But because of her W and Q, that damage is telegraphed/spread out over a pretty significant span of time.  If Riot wanted to make her deal massive damage over time, why didn't they just make her a Skirmisher instead of an Assassin?  Then they could have kept her hybrid scaling instead of giving most of Eve's player-base the finger.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
