On 4/5 of my deaths, I died with less than 1 second of my passive ticking, based on the replays. I was basically as tank as any other squishy champion because I had no tankiness outside of items and aftershock. Truly a sad state for tanks/voli.\n\nI see tanks melted in 1-2 seconds, there is no point in playing them unless you somehow snowball and finish the game, being almost unkillable before enemy team manages to buy damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-12-08T02:26:55.041+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":">Other than macro, there's literally no difference between a gold and a diamond player.\n\nIs this a bad thing?
