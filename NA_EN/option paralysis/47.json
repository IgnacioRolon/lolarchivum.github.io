The entire point of a jungler not being unable to gank is usually because they are blocked off, or the person they gank is pushed in. So the easiest way to have a clearing to gank is to let the wave go to your tower, and not suddenly show a change to aggression once your jungler is there.\n\n>Also the enemy laner would have to walk through all those minions to help with the gank.\n\nAs far as I know, if that was a thing then the boards would be much more enthusiastic about minion block being broken.

It's not just Ekko that's a problem here; it's also Galio, Katarina, Talon (to a lesser degree), Xayah, Azir, AP Nasus, and Taliyah. \n\nAbilities that deal front-loaded damage, then zone with the threat of additional damage are inherently problematic because the zoning requires no tradeoff (like Lux E) and you don't avoid all damage by leaving the zone (Maokai sapling, Illaoi, Heimer, etc). It's also a problem that these champs have incidental zoning power not factored into their power budgets, unlike champs designed for zone control (eg Zyra, GP barrels, Heimer, Teemo, Illaoi, Zilean, Cait, Mao, Cassio, Lux, Gragas, etc).\n\nThis is the exact problem with the old Yorick. His abilities dealt damage up front, then zoned with the penalty of additional damage from ghouls. It was most pronounced on him because the design was used on *all* of his abilities, but the design flaw doesn't become less flawed because it's on 1-2 abilities instead of 3. \n\nW: Delayed and telegraphed are two different things. The delay is 3 seconds. The telegraph is .5 seconds, which is the amount of time you have to dodge an Arcane Comet or Xerath W (and shorter than Brand W and Zyra Q).\n\nR: Yes. First reason is because the clone is buggy as fuck and appears and disappears so often (regardless of whether Ekko is actually nearby) that's it's unreliable to play around. Second reason is that because of Ekko's fucking insane move speed, the clone is often not actually visible. \n\nThird reason is because playing against one Ekko requires the mindshare of tracking two moving units at all times. That's also part of the skill cap of playing him, but his players innately have more practice with the mechanic, making it more reflexive and lower mindshare. Playing against him is more demanding of attention than playing against most other champs.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WubbaLubbaDubDab","date":"2018-03-05T21:24:10.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fuck ekko dude so fcking annoying.his slow is op and he has a fcking double dash and he can get his 3 stacks so easily which gives him such a huge burst of movement speed and his ult god his fucking broken ass ult.it's literally a deny death ult and the cool down is so damn low for some reason.it makes no sense.\nBut do u know who's worse?shack FCK that guy all stealth champs has a range that if u go in u can be seen but not shaco cuz his one tricks will start bitching he is by far the unhealthiest jungler","replies":[{"poster":"HungryAngry2SPP","date":"2018-03-06T06:26:01.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WubbaLubbaDubDab,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4jGPk0Os,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2018-03-05T21:24:10.937+0000)\n>\n> Fuck ekko dude so fcking annoying.his slow is op and he has a fcking double dash and he can get his 3 stacks so easily which gives him such a huge burst of movement speed and his ult god his fucking broken ass ult.it&#x27;s literally a deny death ult and the cool down is so damn low for some reason.it makes no sense.\n> But do u know who&#x27;s worse?shack FCK that guy all stealth champs has a range that if u go in u can be seen but not shaco cuz his one tricks will start bitching he is by far the unhealthiest jungler\n\nIn late game R has got 33s cooldown circa","replies":[]}]}]}
