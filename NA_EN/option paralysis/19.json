There.... you pretty much eithr have to decide to give up, or to use R.\n\nThe PBE mod will make people consider, but using your ult for a kill just isn't always possible (although a bot lane just set me up for 3 double kills vs karma and jinx last game...)\n\nTbh Post PBE, Eve is probably going to be just as annoying if not moreso than a fed Zed. The fact AD is getting introduced back into the E brings so many more possibilities back to eve's build..... Like a Sterak's or Hextech gunblade, both of which impact a Lich bane, and add some serious presence to Eve. I'm personally looking forward to Sterak's, because the tenacity is REALLY nice vs lockdown teams that prevent you from ulting out. The fact that you can Sterak's + Ult and automatically go into Demon Shade is really scary.\n\nThat brings me back to the convo about using an Ult to chase.... post PBE, her ult is going to reset empowered E. In other words, it will enable a DOUBLE dash after you've already blown one on an engage. 3 if you still have Flash.....

I know people subscribe to Q being the end all for a charm, but it's a CHOREOGRAPHED PLAY. If you charm 70% of the champs out there, they will respond, you will lose them, or they will kill you!\n\nIf you W >Q a Lux for example, she absolutely will respond, will hit you with everything in her kit, and she will get to ult you the same time as your charm procs, resulting in your death and her charm status after.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't times where W > Q is the right call (no escape corridors where you are moving perpendicular to your target and they have no way to dodge it), but it's definitely NOT the right call 70% of the time as you will lose your target.\n\nYou're not going to divebomb a team play 5v5 with Q. Your E out of Demon Shade can do aoe damage to their group that takes about 40% of the entire group's HP when considering the flat damage + % damage. Even if you only E and R out of a team fight, you can do about 60-70% of the entire group's HP in damage, which allows your team to clean up. If you Q from the outskirts, you maybe hit 2 people, do much less damage, and make yourself a visible, easily snipeable target.\n\nMost 1v1's if you want to get close and ENSURE a charm, once again..... E puts you right on top of them, so they will ALWAYS be in range of a charm if they run. If you rely on a W> Q to charm, 1) They know you're there 2) you're likely to lose your target pre charm or 3) if you do manage a charm, you might not reach them in time to E or R.\n\nThe highest kills I've done on the new Eve is 19/8/21. My worst game has been 4/6/7. I'm usually closer to 10/2/13. I think that's pretty good to be giving advice.\n\nI'm not on the PBE atm, so I don't know the actual incarnation of these changes. I just know where to find notes. Even if Demon shade only resets on R if you kill someone, I could still make use of it in a bot lane, or group fight, especially if I run a Sterak's. Go in ham.... kill one of 5 on the ult out while massively damaging the rest, and then go back in to pick up scraps.\n\nThe E change isn't a HUGE damage boost..... only about 60 on a full build and Eve arguably lacks damage over the course vs other assassins, so it's not a game breaker. But it will give Eve the option to HEAL IN BATTLE again. Which again... isn't a game breaker, and I doubt we'd get a nerf just because of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-10-28T22:56:46.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually when someone is at no health sitting under turret so you can just R in, E them for the movement speed and leave.\n\nSimilar stuff to that, just picking off low targets, never as a true engage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-10-28T21:27:01.357+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old eve had ms boost and smaller stealth radius\nit's a blink, not a tp.
