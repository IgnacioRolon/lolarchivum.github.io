Varus's Q has a longer range.\n\nHer kit apparrently takes a ton of skill, because even in LCS, she can't land kills. She has never broken a 50% win rate either, and her damage per game usually is never the top damage. It's usually tier 2 damage.\n\nYour comments just suggest you've always perma banned and never even bothered to learn her.","replies":[{"poster":"Krytoric","date":"2018-02-25T03:44:41.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i said pretty much infinite, because if you want you can flash, flash again with w and ult and make it go insanely far, ADC's dont have that range.\n\nThe backwards motion is still time when its in the air, and distance its travelling.\n\nJust cause someone misses doesn't mean they take a ton of skill, Varus / Ez miss all the time, and win rate doesn't say if a champion is broken or not, although it is a factor, its not the ONLY factor. Her Q was literally one shotting people from out of vision, there's low risk on all of her abilities and one even got stronger if you missed. Burst mages usually dont have most damage, thats not what the class is for.\n\nYour comments suggest you're a biased Zoe player that doesn't want to accept she has major flaws in her design and was insanely broken. I have never banned Zoe, i ban Janna every game, and i played that champ like 6 times? 2 support 1 top 3 mid, and i think i did poorly once and every other time within building half an item no one could touch me.\n\nI saw in your comment below you said :\n\n \"Her damage was never in one thing and you'd know that if you actually played her. it's in Q + lich bane proc + 2 More sparkles and E. You just think it's all in one because the kit works together.\"\n\nThat isnt true, thats what she CAN do, not what she was doing. She was literally one shotting people with a single ability (2 if you count the ult) If she had to do what you said to secure a kill every time, then yeah! shes a fine champ, but thats not even close to what she had to do to kill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-02-25T05:01:03.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"unique\"\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/ce/Nidalee_OriginalSkin_old.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121214111735\n\nnice meme","replies":[{"poster":"PeachyPosterior","date":"2018-02-25T12:08:40.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AngusBoomPants,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aJ7Eut17,comment-id=0008000100000002,timestamp=2018-02-25T05:01:03.246+0000)\n>\n> &quot;unique&quot;\n> \n> https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/ce/Nidalee_OriginalSkin_old.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121214111735\n> \n> nice meme\n\nEveryone is griping about how it's like pre-rework Nid, but Nid has more than one damaging ability, and also transforms. \n\nZoe's kit is unique due to her E and R being made for adding damage to her Q through skillshot and range, Q dealing the only damage, and her W allowing her to steal summoner spells from others once they've been used. \n\nI'm sorry you're sour about Nid's damage having been taken away, but if it means much of anything to you you would be making threads and starting discussions about Nid trying to get attention to her for her to be in a better place.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-02-26T00:49:45.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Old Nid was focused on just her Q in human form and couldn't transform until 6.
