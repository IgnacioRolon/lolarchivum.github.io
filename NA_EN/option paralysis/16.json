Ardent is nerfed so it&#039;s better in later lvls, redemption is nerfed so the heal is good only if you have multiple heal boosts before building it, athenes is good when you have a lot of mana regen so you get more AP.\r\nThere&#039;s no &quot;go to&quot; item to build first. Anything you build first is just mehh and it will be only good when you build that 2nd-3rd item.\r\nI know, I also don&#039;t want the &quot;redemption locket&quot; rush every game or &quot;ardent redemption&quot; to become a thing again. I&#039;d just like an item to build that I know it will be good as soon as you get it, just like in every role.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Fish Nami","date":"2017-12-10T21:13:15.440+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing I kind of find funny is that, instead of focusing on improving the strength of the champion itself, Riot is trying to focus the supports into building active items who has a lot of impact. While I dont mind having a lot of active items,  this is where it creates balance issues for the support class. They made the active items have too much impact and now, they are trying to balance supports around those items over their own pros and cons.\n\nThen again, I might be wrong on that statement but this is my opinion on the balance of supports atm.\n\nRegarding what first item to buy, I have no clue. As Nami, I usually go for athene, it seems to have enough impact with her and with the bounce, you always get blood points in combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Hikageya","date":"2017-12-10T21:23:44.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god, its the man, the legend.

You’ll only get 10% cdr and 8% heal/shield buff once between the two idols.

The enemy of sustain is always burst, and nowadays there's more burst than ever. That increase in burst makes Tanks (Who can take a hit) more useful as they can block and survive through more of the burst than an Enchanter otherwise could. I think I'm overall fine with them tuning Shield/Heal power in general because especially last season that got ridiculous, but I do think there's also a broader issue of the sheer amount of power creep this season has had in store for it, which is going to hurt Enchanters a good bit, at least in regards to protecting their carries.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"option paralysis","date":"2017-12-10T21:01:04.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KirbyCake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k1Gl0lAE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-12-10T20:17:45.364+0000)\n>\n> The problem is that enchanters have a lower win rate than tank supports right now, so riot is nerfing weak/balanced champions for no good reason.\n\nholy shit, wattup man, I used to love watching your Soraka mid back in the day, part of why she's one of my fav champs too.
