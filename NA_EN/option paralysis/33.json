They don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m picking Urgot, they just know it&#x27;s an offmeta pick. They also know that there is a troll/int on the team. They don&#x27;t know that the troll/int. has to do with the Urgot pick. They identify them as two separate people. For all they know, I could very well be an Urgot one-trick pony. But they don&#x27;t want to play with a troll/int, and an Urgot on their team. So, they dodge.

I'm talking about your decision, and why you make it. Not the specific champion that gets picked. The point is you chose a champion you knew your teammates would be opposed to in order to make them dodge. That is not the same as picking a champion because you plan to use it in game and play your best to win.\n\n> It&#x27;s easier to show than to type it out.\n\nYou're not showing anything, you are deceiving your teammates in order to manipulate their decision. If you were to actually communicate with them that would be different.\n\n> If you&#x27;re in a ranked game, and see a Darius jungle, what do you think the person on your team, in promos, will respond with?\n> \n> Most likely, something along the lines of &quot;pls no, I&#x27;m in promos.&quot;\n> \n> What are you going to do when they lock in Darius jgl?\n> \n> What can they do?\n> \n> Who&#x27;s at fault?\n> \n> According to the system, the guy in promos is at fault for complaining about an off-meta pick.\n\nThis is another composition/division fallacy. There's nothing wrong with an off-meta pick if the player is trying to win the game with it. You on the other hand are taking an off-meta pick for a different reason.

In reality, you can physically click on the button. That&#x27;s not how it works. The purpose of dodging is to avoid a loss. If you click on the button in promos, you aren&#x27;t dodging. You aren&#x27;t dodging a loss. You&#x27;re closing the client.\n> \n> There&#x27;s nothing illegitimate about this. It&#x27;s the exact opposite. If you want to be competitive, you&#x27;d be even more of a cutthroat. It&#x27;s basically always been used as a loss, and Riot probably planned for that. That&#x27;s how it was used in DoTA, which league was based off of.\n\nMaybe we are using different definitions of competitive. Correct me if I am wrong but you seem to be thinking that being competitive means \"doing anything to win no matter what.\" I am saying that \"being competitive is about trying to be the best.\" Am I correct in identifying your stance on this? Do you understand mine?\n\nRiot's intended purpose for dodging is not to avoid a loss. It is to avoid terrible experiences. Riot makes it available for players to dodge awful experiences, they punish it because they don't want players to do it often and ruin queue times.\n\nI agree that the way they apply it to promos is kind of fucked, but I don't think that makes it OK to make other players pay a price so that one individual can circumvent that problem. It would be better to address the problem directly with Rioters, which brings us to our next area of discussion.\n\n> Stop avoiding the point. It&#x27;s not an argument, it&#x27;s the way things work. I&#x27;m not arguing about that. I&#x27;m TELLING you. They won&#x27;t. It&#x27;s that simple.\n> \n> It isn&#x27;t. The number of previous posts  that have failed to do so are enough to show that.\n> \n> It doesn&#x27;t impact other players.\n> \n> Oh no, those vocal complaints are well-written essay-types. Still no response. Just use common sense.\n\nI'm not avoiding the point. You made an unreasonable claim, and I pushed you to argue it better. I won't dispute that a lot of posts get ignored. My point is that some of them do get attention. Usually the ones that meet Rioters where they come to us, such as Meddler's gameplay thoughts posts.\n\nWhen you give up and don't participate you lose your stake in the issue. People who choose to abstain from voting are the same. Nobody gives a shit what they think about whichever party is in government because they chose to give up their opportunity to make a difference.\n\nCaring and participating is important because if you never even try then there's 0% chance of being represented rather than the higher chance if you do try.\n\n> Can&#x27;t dodge in promos.\n\nNot arguing over this again, you're being absurd. Dodging means a loss, but if you really don't want to play that game then you ought to dodge it yourself. If your only reason for dodging is to avoid a loss then IMO that's a terrible reason.\n\n> They dodged of their own accord. No matter if I had ill intent or not, they would&#x27;ve dodged in the same situation no matter what.\n\nNot all of them would have dodged if you hadn't acted in that manner. The problem is that it's not fair to expect another to pay a price so that you can benefit. Asking is fair because it does not manipulate, it only raises a request and communicates openly. I understand you don't think this will work, but I doubt it would fail every time. I'm as cynical as the next guy, but not everybody sucks or is even normal. Some people are kind enough to oblige.\n\n> Not at all. It isn&#x27;t toxic at all. It isn&#x27;t negatively effecting them making them do a decision they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise do.\n\nYou cannot be certain of that every single time. The problem lies within the situations where it does force them to decide upon something which they wouldn't otherwise have.\n\n> Which part are you referring to?\n\nYou talked about bad team comps such as all-ad vs armor tanks. Other examples include getting autofilled teammates, or a teammate getting counterpicked. Not all your words, but several possibilities for when someone might decide the game is disadvantageous and want out. I'm looking for what situations like this you might consider it OK in (obviously assuming in Promos) . Also I want to know which methods you consider OK to use in order to get teammates to dodge.\n\n> I don&#x27;t want to pull this crap, but I have to because you either miss my points on purpose, or can&#x27;t understand it no matter how many times I repeat it. \n\nThis is counterproductive. \"Pulling this crap\" just results in us arguing off-topic rather than discussing the main points. I don't miss your points on purpose, I make an effort to understand your ideas and I cut a lot of bullshit from my arguments before replying.\n\nThe reason I have trouble understanding them is that you have this fundamental assumption about the nature of things that is so foreign to me that I cannot fathom it. I can understand that you don't want to play with trolls, and I can understand that you don't want to lose. But I cannot fathom how that leads you to think it is OK to manipulate others to take the fall for you.\n\nBy the way I appreciate that you aren't pulling other crap like rank shaming. That gets in the way of valid discussion even worse than straw-man arguments. Props.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n> The whole &quot;can&quot; or &quot;can&#x27;t dodge&quot; is an example. You just can&#x27;t dodge in promos. It&#x27;s not that hard to grasp.\n> \n> It doesn&#x27;t. Who are you to judge whether or not picking Urgot is toxic?\n\nI don't think picking urgot is toxic. You answered your own question:\n\n> The reasoning behind it may be toxic\n\nDoing something for a toxic reason is wrong. Whether it is caught and punished or not.\n\nRiot cannot punish me for it. Players aren&#x27;t negatively affected. You cannot punish me for it.\n\nOther players are negatively affected, somebody else loses LP for your sake. Sure you can't be punished for it, but lack of punishment doesn't change that it's wrong.\n\n> Yeah, except I am trying to win... that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m making someone else dodge.\n\nYou aren't trying to win that match, you're trying to win your promos.
