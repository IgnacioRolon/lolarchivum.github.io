It could be argued that it's obvious when vlad will run up to EQ you based on his passive bar, however this creates well-defined moments of power and clarity that are key game-play philosophies that Riot Games hold. If you think it's better for a champion to have a mediocre level of power all the time than clear, easy-to-read high levels of power and low levels of power, than that's perfectly fine. But riot games doesn't hold that philosophy, and that is why it is how it is. Yes, you can argue that 4 stacks on tides is a clear indication of power, but as long as vlad remained in lane, that power was constant (It also ment sacrificing his sustain to keep that power) It proposed a strange ultimadum. \"I should fight vlad when he's strong so he sacrifices his damage so that he can start healing back up. . . or. . . should I not fight vlad when he's strong because he'll out damage me? What if I keep forcing trades with him over and over. . . but he's supposed to be a sustain mage... isn't that what he wants??\" After vlad got his wota, that ultimatum became \"Vlad no longer sacrifices sustain to keep his strength.. which means he's always strong\"\n\n> The situations where decent players will eat E without wanting to or being forced to are few and far in between.

If adding the 1.5 second delay on the full charged E can make or break a fight, you're were cutting it very close. Moreso when considering it has a much faster projectile speed and slightly higher range than the old tides of blood. Besides, he can instantly cast it, which means he will take less damage and deal less damage in exchange for making that damage immediate, much faster than the old e.

Also, the combo is R->E->Q->W->E->Q->Zhonya's->E->Q->W->E->Q. Nobody wastes Zhonya's that early unless they have to.\n\nWotA wasn't just a boring stat-stick. It allowed you to heal based on your initial damage, rather than post-mitigation. That's a good trade-off if you compare it to something like bloodthirster. Its a parallel to Infinity Edge or Death Cap, though healing rather than damage, and comparable to many other AD items as well. To say its antiquated is entirely false. To say its better to remove it than keep it in the game, due to the limited members of the cast that can successfully utilize it, crutching, and abuse-cases, would be true. \n\n\n> &quot;Sorry it took me so long to get to the teamfight, I had to go through the jungle so I wasn&#x27;t missing a lot of hp when I got here..

Decent Vlad players were missing 70-90 HP at any given moment. No more. \n\nAlso, everything breaks Vlad's walk-cycle except his W. Even with the new rework. Q, E, and R. \n\n> If by animation delay you mean the spell breaking your walk cycle, new vlad has fewer than old vlad.

Its called a cast animation.\n\nIts not any easier to get 40% CDR after the mage rework. Anyone worth their salt was using CDR runes to hit 10, 20 or 30% depending on what they were planning on building towards. After the rework, you have to fill those runes with something else that gives much less effect than what that CDR did pre-rework. \n\nThe new .5 second slow doesn't really help you stick in realistic scenarios. It would be better if they removed it to put power somewhere else, since he near- universally buys Rylai's now.\n\nCrimson Rush doesn't help keep up with enemies at all. 16 MS for its insanely short duration does nothing for you in cases where they aren't already in range anyway. It helps in very early laning, and that's it. \n\n> I&#x27;m not going to argue the point. Not because I don&#x27;t respect your opinion, it&#x27;s just that what gratification comes down to varies person to person and is hard to truly prove/disprove.\n\nFair. \n\n> As mentioned before, E is typically used in tandem with your crimson rush passive.

You're dead weight if you do that. The 'key game-play philosophies that Riot Games hold' is bull and you know it. The degree to which they went with Vlad is above and beyond the 'well-defined moments of power and clarity' displayed for any champion, and it absolutely gutted him. Not because they're displaying it. Because they made him less reliable, nerfed him, and telegraph every single way he can impact anything, not that he has any real impact now when he actually manages to do something. \n\nAnother thing is that Vlad was actually very weak prior to level 7. He couldn't manage all-ins until after level 12. Considering you have to wait half the game until you can reasonably function, it was fair. His laning was parallel to Nasus' laning, which many people don't complain about.\n\n> As I&#x27;m sure you are aware, vlad&#x27;s play style isn&#x27;t typically synonymous with full on commits until after he&#x27;s poked down the enemy laner to a point where he&#x27;s comfortable that he can kill them.

This gives him options and versatility.\n> \n> \n> If I missed anything just let me know, preferably in a respectful, constructive tone.\n\n\nNo, he was never about full commits until he gets Rylai's. As far as that goes, both kits run the same pattern, due to the massive animation delays he has and lack of mobility. The problem is that team-fights cannot support this play pattern, making the new Vlad pretty useless. \n\nThe problem isn't that 1.5 second delay. Its that nothing you've said really applies post-laning.\nIts that in teamfights, Vlad's impact within 5 seconds is extremely minimal considering all of the ways to 'out-play' him now, even during his best-case scenarios. And the amount of pay-out he gets for the next 5 seconds doesn't make that worth it. Nor do the next 5. Or the next 5. It takes over 5 rotations for Vlad to be able to kill anything that isn't glass cannon, and that's IF they choose to face-tank him. In such a scenario, he basically isn't casting E, or he's paying 50% of his health in true damage over that time. Delays stack up in situations like that.\n\nThe new E's snap cast does under 1/3 the damage of old E, and has a higher CD. It deals damage maybe .25 seconds quicker. If they're in melee range. It doesn't give him ANY options or versatility, in reality.\n\nAnd finally, the range increase is pretty moot, considering most intelligent people will be moving away from you. Due to the missile speed of E, the effective range is about the same from Vlad's perspective.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cynika","date":"2016-05-14T17:44:00.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand the idea of wanting counter play to e, but I just wish that it would still hit targets behind the first.

So many times when I die, my Crimson rush buff was just about to come back up, but alas lol.\n\nAlso side note, the riven example makes me cry inside because let's be real, she wrecks vlad's ass so fast her regen doesn't matter lol. (Also malphite and singed get so tanky you'll never be able to solo kill them except super early or if they aren't very good).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cynika","date":"2016-05-14T23:37:05.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's say for argument sake you have 3k health and 300 AP. That means 180 base, 300 from health spent, and 210 from AP = 690 dmg total against a target with 0 MR. Against a target with 40% MR (not hard to get) you deal 414 dmg. So you spent 300 health, 1-1.5 seconds to channel, and your CD to deal 114 more damage than you spent.\n\nI agree that I exaggerated saying you deal more to yourself than you dealt to them (unless they have 56% or more MR, not uncommon with tanks), but I'm not that far off. If you're close enough to get e off you're close enough for them to be hitting you too. And it's not hard for a squishier target to get out of range or LOS with a beefier teammate. \n\nAlso before you mention it, I know it's aoe, but your opponents need to be making pretty poor decisions to allow an immobile medium ranged caster with no cc to get in position for him to hit everyone with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"option paralysis","date":"2016-05-15T18:42:32.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just played a mirror lane with Vlad and we just both walked away from one another when either of us had crimson rush coming up.

You have to be in the perfect position on a particular side of the wave, and hit the Q on a particular part of a specific minion to get it to be AoE. It's much easier on the caster minions since they stay together, but melees are more difficult to deal with than the actual lane opponent. Even a SINGLE melee minion in front of the caster minions will completely block your Q (as in, if you have no minions to distract the melee minion) and it will walk straight towards you, completely blocking you off from being able to land a q on the casters. You literally have to walk completely around it, circle the minions around to get them to clump, then Q them.
