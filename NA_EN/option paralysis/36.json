If ranked is supposed to be competitive then they should be matching equally skilled players so your teammates think similarly to you. Problem is that's not the case at all. Trust me... I been to an elo or mmr before where I thought similarly to those around me. I knew if I wanted to rank up I needed to get better but I actually felt like I had an idea what's going on around me. But when you get stuck playing with first season or first time ranked players when you have played forever it doesn't matter if you doing well or not because they will consistently be making mistakes you know better than not to do and it will throw you off your game and frustrate you. Have this happen in almost other ranked game plus throw in auto fill you get yourself madness and a poor match making system.  Its the reason I no longer enjoy playing LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-05-18T14:54:30.724+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":10,"body":"The rank you get is the rank you deserve.","replies":[{"poster":"Oldwisepotato","date":"2017-05-18T15:06:42.486+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zFrostistic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ybfhRLVU,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-18T14:54:30.724+0000)\n>\n> The rank you get is the rank you deserve.\n\nIf you believe that then you truly brainless. Everyone knows you have to play hundreds of ranked games to even get close to your actual rank. People quit playing all the time just because their rank says \"gold 5\" or Plat w/e\" or silver\" w/e doesn't mean that's their actual skill level unless they play hundreds of ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-05-18T15:51:44.804+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That his point... but thinking u derserve better than your current rank without prove it with game is purely arrogant.  \nIf u are silver and u deserve gold... just play.","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-05-18T17:42:52.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"This.\n\nJust play.\n\nBut of course the boards community is made of people who would rather cry to Riot than take a reality check.","replies":[{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2017-05-18T18:24:03.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zFrostistic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ybfhRLVU,comment-id=000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2017-05-18T17:42:52.834+0000)\n>\n> This.\n> \n> Just play.\n> \n> But of course the boards community is made of people who would rather cry to Riot than take a reality check.\n\nSupport main with over 600 ranked games giving out advice.
