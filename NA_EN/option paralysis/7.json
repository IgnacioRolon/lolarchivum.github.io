He has a 1% pick rate for 2 straight years and is one of the most linear champs in the game. Only thing you can do on him is build lethality and hope you delete someone in a teamfight before you die. Also, the question is how you&#039;re gonna get to that full lethality build since you get owned by almost every champ top/jungle. That last compensation for the duskblade nerf just puts him even more in that situation of &quot;lets hope I delete someone before I die&quot;. He has so much potential with his lore and skins for an amazing rework.. I don&#039;t get why is it being held back for so long.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-25T20:50:47.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple years ago for a brief period of time, and never at high levels.\n\nAlso, changing a couple of abilities requires far less effort than making an entirely new model (plus models for skins), VFX (+ skins), sounds, voice acting, animation, kit, and lore.","replies":[]}]}
