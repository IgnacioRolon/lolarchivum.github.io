The old offensive masteries gave you 5% CDR (this mastery has been removed) , the old Lucidity Boots gave you 15% CDR ( now it gives you only 10% ). With Athene's/Morello's , you could achieve the 40% CDR cap (no runes or any other item). Today , with this build you will still need 10% CDR to achieve the cap , despite the fact that you actually trade damage ( Magic Penetration ) for it.\n\nIt isn't the problem that EVERYONE wants to build full CDR , it is the problem that a build path has been removed/nerfed, and there are less choices to make as a mage in terms of items. \n\nSome people prefer to offer utility instead of damage/kills for their team. CDR was and still is the best stat for that.","replies":[{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-11-28T05:24:27.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the full cdr build didn't lose any pen or ap.  You just would run cdr per lvl glyphs instead of mr glyphs.  So you'd do equal damage just be squishier in lane, which was a fair trade-off in my book.","replies":[{"poster":"Anu3isII","date":"2015-11-28T12:11:58.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only problem with the CDR per level glyphs is that you don't reach the cap as soon as the Lucidity Boots build. \n\nIn my opinion , when I need CDR on a mage , I need it at least in the mid-game , when teamfights start. When you play a champion that isn't focused on dealing damage , like Lulu , your only focus is to offer as much utility as you can.\n\nAlso , trading the MR glyphs for CDR/level is a significant trade for me. You practically trade your early game safety for a bit more utility in the late game. Most of the times you will see that the early stages of the game are the most deciding factors of a match. Still , I think you can get away with some long range champions ( Lux comes to my mind ).\n\nSo yeah , I agree that your build path works , with the only problem that the results come later (than you want) for some utility champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2015-11-28T01:45:22.994+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vel'Koz needs CDR to proc his passive more.\nVeigar needs CDR to Q-stack.\n\nSomething like Annie isn't as CDR reliant I guess.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-11-28T04:54:26.260+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well there's Lost Chapter.\nRite of Ruin.\nNetherstride Grimoire.\nPox Arcana.\n\nSeriously Riot, give us more of the Black Market items.
