If Riven is moving (before or after pressing Q), her animation is unlocked after an arbitrary delay based on server tick rate (0 - 0.25s). This timing is pretty much random. So your ability to animation cancel is more determined by your latency and luck.\n\n>We are trying to make this no longer random, but deterministic - If you cancel your animation via moving, it will reliably cancel your animation.\nhttps://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/IYzG01mq-710-riven-changes\n\nThere's more stuff in that post, but I quoted the main bit of interest.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2017-05-27T12:08:48.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember playing as annie vs yasuo and he rushed a hexdrinker.
