I personally agree with most of them, being that I see the problems having these champs the way they&#039;ll become. Personally though, instead of complaining at Riot that they shouldn&#039;t do this (because we know they&#039;re going to do it anyway), I suggest to every summoner to boycott the champs. That&#039;s right - just don&#039;t play them. Don&#039;t use them, don&#039;t buy skins for them, don&#039;t use them at all.\n\nNow I honestly don&#039;t think this would work and make Riot change their minds. But it will make our voices more heard. I mean, they keep track how often champs are used (Galio is the lowest used champ, after all). If they aren&#039;t making any profits on those champs nor are players using them, it might, _MIGHT_, catch their attention. We are the players who make this game run. Without us, it&#039;s a game with no purpose. If the champs are going to be ruined in our eyes, then we&#039;ll just not use them nor buy them/their skins, period.\n\nI can be wrong with this, but Garen and Darius have been some of their money making champs.\n\nObviously I can&#039;t make you guys do the same, but this is my suggestion on the matter. Riot isn&#039;t going to listen to us on the boards, so we might as well show them just how much we don&#039;t like this. When the new patch comes out, I will not be using Mordekaiser, Garen, Darius, and Skarner at all.

And while Darius does gets nerfed, he still gets that new power to chunk enemy's health based on how much HP they built (unless I'm mistaken, like I said I should reread that whole thing). And with no/less armor to use, you have no choice but to build your HP to last longer in fights. So Darius will have an unfair advantage due to the circumstances Riot forced us in.\n\nI don't think they would either, don't get me wrong! After all, it's only one solution to being peaceful while protesting.

The best thing you can do is convince people to stop supporting Riot financially and hopefully it will make an impact.\n\nI've already stopped giving them money, because the only good work they've put out, to me, is the skins they release. Time and time again they do things that I can't agree with in terms of actual balance. Sure, they have a good patch here and there, but for every good patch there's three or four leaving a problematic champion alone for years at a time, changing items with no good reasoning, or changing champions (like Veigar, know he's fine but his rework to me seemed halfassed) for the worse.\n\nAnd back to the topic, I already don't play those champions for various reasons (in general, I played Garen recently because I was forced top and Cho was baned), so I can't really contribute there.","replies":[{"poster":"MafdetEgypt","date":"2015-08-05T20:59:40.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never said it was perfect.

Gnar gets away with having only a few skins since he's still more recent. Galio had been around since, what, since League of Legends started? Probably why he doesn't get much.\n\nBut Garen and Darius have been some of their money makers, because a lot of people (especially newbies) wants to be tanky yet offensive. These two offers that the best in my opinion.\n\nI've stopped giving them money as well some time ago. Around the time they decided that lore was too hard to keep. Much as I want to buy Captain MF, I'm not flimsy. Pretty skins are the only thing that gets them money, yet they insist on crud moves like this patch, so I don't want to support them however I can.

My games, at least, don't have many Darius' and Garens, and the last time I Skarner I was playing him, and Morde was just because he came up in ARAM and the guy didn't have any rerolls. Chances are if the patch goes through without much improvement, it will return to the same exact state after about two weeks. I'm sure Skarner will disapear first, then Morde if he can't keep up bottom lane because of the fact he's melee and the large presence of engage tanks, ranged poke, and sustain which I doubt he will be able to handle very well.\n\nI'm looking forward to changes, but I doubt Riot will make any given the upcoming Worlds thing, unless they just let the armor and basic balance changes go through so the game can be \"flashy\" again for mass viewing.","replies":[{"poster":"MafdetEgypt","date":"2015-08-05T21:44:49.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I love to main as Galio as support, he offers some tankiness and good AP damages plus boosts to my allies. His ult is the reason I got into using him. Run into a team fight and ult them into attacking me so that my allies could either attack or get away? I say it's pretty worth. Even when you get knocked out of it, it has to be fair in some way, so I accept that he can get knocked out of his ult just like Katerina could. \n\nMm, most likely not. Though while I don't play Skarner, me and TDC usually go in bot lane with him as Skarner for support and me as Vayne. Now that is made useless for the most part since he don't have anywhere near as much of an ability to pull champs in with his Impale.
