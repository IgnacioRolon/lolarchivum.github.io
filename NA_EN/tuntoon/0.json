They don&#039;t try to promote a healthy learning community, just a competitive one. And through this idea we keep watching as the pool of players becomes more and more toxic. \r\n\r\nWhen I learn a game, I want to understand why I&#039;m losing or winning. Not, &quot;wow, you should never play this game again&quot; or &quot;good game, that was easy&quot; (the exact opposite of a good game in my opinion). It just doesn&#039;t seem like this game will stand the test of time with the current attitude. \r\n\r\nWhen someone on my team starts mouthing off to the opponents (even after he gets carried or we lose, of course) I always ask why they feel the need to talk like that. I never get a reasonable answer. Mostly just people saying, &quot;because I felt like it&quot; or &quot;because it doesn&#039;t matter and I&#039;ll never see them again.&quot; What a way to treat strangers. \r\n\r\nI would love to hear from a rioter how they intend to keep getting people involved and how they are going to get  the  next generation involved, but honestly, I doubt they look that far ahead. Really, I think this game will die in a couple years, or more worrisome to me, is that the game will continue and younger and younger children will get involved and learn to be hateful like the toxic pool of now. There is nothing that would make me want to get my would-be children in this game right now. They would learn terrible hateful habits while I wasn&#039;t playing with them. I understand the game is rated T or whatever, but that doesn&#039;t mean I would get even a middle schooler or high schooler involved. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just not an environment that is conducive of learning as opposed to hating/blaming. And, it feels like riot doesn&#039;t care as long as they are raking it in. I would appreciate a conversation with any player behavior expert. Not to pose an ultimatum, but i&#039;m rather inclined to move away from this kind of game which, at it&#039;s core i consider extremely fun and challenging, but on the surface has a terrible community. I really think the behavior threshold is very lax compared to any truly competitive sport. But, as they say, &quot;good luck in e-sports.&quot;\r\n\r\nI would much rather talk via email, but it doesn&#039;t seem like they care about back and forth there either.\r\n\r\nTruly, \r\nTun","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-10-06T09:47:43.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">There is nothing that would make me want to get my would-be children in this game right now.\n\nRiot has a strict diploids only law.\n\nAs for riot caring about player behavior, they've implemented the instant feedback system. This notified players more quickly about their infraction, from weeks to minutes, increasing the likelihood of reform. They've also implemented the new honor system, encouraging players to interact positively.\n\nI don't think they will ever eradicate toxicity in games, but I don't think they'll be satisfied with their efforts on it either.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-06T11:46:36.828+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll just add that notifications were disabled because Riot found they were more confusing:\n\nThere was a time that Riot sent you a notification saying \"hey warning you were recently reported for this try to take a step back and improve your behavior a bit\". But people were getting confused, thinking they were punished, worrying, plus it'd send it regardless of if a report was verified or not (because it took a while from report to punishment back then).\n\nNow, they *punish* players more quickly after a toxic game - not just notify.","replies":[{"poster":"Tuntoon","date":"2017-10-06T18:52:36.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not promote the tribunal, if that is what you thought I implied.

Their email system takes you to someone that actually has no authority to make decisions and only alerts those who can if what you tell them is legitimate.

Many of them banned for what you are talking about in this thread.\n\nSo I pose the following counter questions;\n\nHave you been reporting this kind of behavior?\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nWhat would you propose they do beyond what they are currently doing?","replies":[{"poster":"Tuntoon","date":"2017-10-06T18:49:51.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, i read through this board (and others), and I only say something in any thread, comment or post, when I feel like I have something to say. A lot of people who want to better themselves come her, but what about the majority of people that get punished who don't? They go unnoticed and do not rehabilitate themselves after the transgression. \n\n1) I always report unsportsmanlike conduct. \n\n2) Because I want to be a part of a community that fosters construction rather than destruction.\n\n3) Implement something that triggers more often than \"I'm gonna murder your family\" to \"gg ez\" and actually tries to view case by case why someone is being so harsh on teammates rather than promoting a learning scenario, especially in normals but really in any gametype. If you don't have something constructive to say, don't say it?\n\nI understand this is hard, I'm an engineer, not a comp sci person trying to create an AI. But they aren't making statements to the public, almost ever, on toxicity. Why not constantly show professionals/twitch streamers being punished/reformed? Shaclone deserved recognition for his devolution into a non-humanist while tyler1 is basically constructive now. Promote a constructive society, not one where you only punish the dissenter? \n\n\"YEA, honor dumbass. Everyone gets it.\" Isn't enough. It doesn't promote sportsmanlike conduct, just good plays. ie. don't tilt, suggest plays, make plays. \n\n> Most of the threads posted on this board are people who have been punished for toxic behavior <  This doesn't seem like a justification to me. More like these people (the few), came here to understand why they are being punished. Do you really think most people come here to understand why they're being punished? I do not. \n\nAlso, I don't post often, So I don't know how to block quote. And really, just like the last person I asked \"why be a poor sport?\" I am just trying to open a conversation, before trying to attack you or anything you believe.
