He hits hard if you are unable to avoid his attacks. Its easy to tell when to avoid Vel&#039;Koz in the laning phase if you&#039;ve caught some stacks. His R does massive damage through-out the game, but gets stronger late. Late game, his ultimate is on the lowest CD possible and has good base damage and has a very high ratio. You could argue by this point it is hit R to win, but Vel&#039;Koz must stay still when doing his ultimate. Its not for a long time, but its a good pocket for assassins, especially after the preseason updates. Vel&#039;Koz has true damage that is half of his AP. This allows Vel&#039;Koz to eat anything that isn&#039;t incredibly mobile. This means you must be patient when killing Vel&#039;Koz before you take up stacks, or simply dodge them.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience Vel&#039;Koz is a 8/10 in difficulty.","replies":[{"poster":"Oelyk","date":"2016-12-03T01:10:13.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pffftttt\n\nIts against my ethics to disagree, but I believe you highly overrated his difficulty!

He has incredible range which gives him safety during the early game. His Q is highly effective due to its both direct and indirect trajectory. \n\nMost of his cons are shared by all mages.
