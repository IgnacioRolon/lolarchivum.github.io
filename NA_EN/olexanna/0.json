I started with Jinx before quickly moving over to Ashe, which is the champion I first got comfortable and familiar with. After grinding her out I decided to try Annie and found I did quite a lot better with her overall, and have been mainly using her since. Both Annie and Ashe are longer ranged so I don't necessarily want to get stuck only feeling confident with champions that have that distance. What I like about Annie is her stun, and the ability to poke and deny farm fairly well without too much confrontation.\n\nI have been doing bot games mostly, but have done a fair chunk of PVP with my higher ranked friends, of which were quite interesting due to the drastic level difference, but definitely beneficial on my behalf.  What I would like is some feedback on is perhaps some other champions I should attempt to branch out to, maybe some helpful guides to read. My friend suggested that I should either attempt at Lux or Morgana because they can mid as well as support?  Thank you for any recommendations!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2014-11-09T23:43:16.961+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!  What I did when I started playing MOBAs was to play every single character I could get my hands on, and I think this is what everyone else should do too.  Playing every champion allows you to\n\n1.) Learn what everyone does.\n\n2.) Expose yourself to various playstyles.\n\nEventually you will figure out what champs you like to play and then you can really work on the fundamentals while having the best time playing the champs you enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"LordOfTheLeague","date":"2014-11-10T00:27:40.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's what you imply in 1) but it's not very clear, to play every champs allow you not only to find the champs you will enjoy to play as but to find the weaknesses of the champ you will play against too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-11-10T00:24:05.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note that this also allows you to improve your counter-play against each champion you learn in this manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2014-11-10T00:19:37.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully agree with this. I personally spent my first games of League of Legends trying out a lot of different champions, and found the kinds of playstyles I liked early on.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to try out champs that you may have not had the most fun experiences the first time you played them. In some of my first games, I played Viktor (I don't recommend trying him early because he's so difficult to play), and I ended up not liking him the first time I played him. I tried him a few more games, and started to really like how he played. Now he's my favorite champion to play, and one of my most played champs overall.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"llamasx","date":"2014-11-10T00:53:14.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every week I would just play the free week champs after watching their champion spotlight on youtube.  Though a lot of them are a bit outdated, they still serve as a decent starting point.  I would play bot games with them just to familiarize myself with the champ.  I felt like this gave me a good experience in getting to know what every champion can do and what ever lane did.  I felt like playing  a variety of champs and lanes helped me become a better player.  It gives you a better ability to anticipate what your opponents will do because you've been in their shoes with that champ.\n\nI didn't start focusing on getting good at a specific lane or specific champion until I was about to started ranked games.  For that I just looked for high level streamers playing these champs / lanes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2014-11-09T07:36:20.364+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I feel like I should let you know that you can get Tristana, Alistar, and Garen for free by subscribing to Riot's Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter accounts.  \n\nAsk your friends about when to buy runes and what your should get for your initial pages, if you haven't already.  It doesn't really matter yet, but it should be helpful in the long run.\n\nI would suggest looking at champion guides at Solomid and Lolpro for tips regarding champion, skill order and item builds.\n\nI would recommend trying the free champions each week to see who you enjoy and try expanding your champion pool with some of the 450IP and 1350IP champions.\n\nSome good, cheap champions I would recommend are Kayle, Cho'gath, Jax, Morgana, Taric, and Nasus.

They're a good precursor to the more expensive champs.\nAnd they're really easy to learn and use too. \nIf you could master Master Yi, you could easily have a good win ratio. \nA lot of lower ranked leagues ban him because they don't know how to counter him well.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2014-11-09T09:00:13.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A lot of lower ranked leagues ban him because they don't know how to counter him well.\n\nI'm tempted to say that lower ranked leagues literally can't know how to counter him. Of the 450 champions, there are no proper engage tanks (Malphite, Amumu) or true tanks (Alistar, Maokai), the two archetypes that counter Master Yi the hardest (at least in my experience). In other words, in the lower leagues/levels while a lot of people are still learning, they may literally can't know how to counter Yi yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-11-10T13:51:15.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard cc and exhaust stop yi's damage long enough for him to get bursted down.

If I was you, and what I did, is to whenever free rotation hits try a bot game with every champion you haven't played yet over the course of that week. Try as many champs as you can. I have historically preferred big, hard to kill champs which is why it came as such a surprise to me when I found out how much I loved Karthus and Lucian. Also, about supports, I feel like more than almost any role there is a wide variety of supports. Lux/Morg, Leona/Braum, Thresh, Sona, Soraka. If support's something you want to try to do, try a bunch of them because there is almost certainly a style out there for you.\n\nIn a slightly different vein, one of the biggest things that helped me was watching streams. Nightblue is really good jungler and does a good job at talking through what he's doing. Trick2g is a great player and you can learn a lot from watching him or his \"Trick spectates X\" streams where he watches someone else play a game and talks through what they're doing right, what they're doing wrong, etc. Those are the big 2 for me, but watching really good players and trying to figure out why they did what they did is a great way to figure out the hows and whys of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-11-09T09:40:15.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"stop thinking bout champs so much cuz one day ur gonna be sitting out on the rift with a sign saying \"will work for runes\"\n\nyou will survive off playing the weekly free rotation champs i think","replies":[]}]}
