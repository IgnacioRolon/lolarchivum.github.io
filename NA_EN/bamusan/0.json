The replay was extremely smooth with some lags because of my pc but after I watched the recorded there was loud screeching and the lag spikes were too high.

Very loud screeching sound the first couple patches from Pre-Season.  However, has decreased in how loud it is in this patch.  Every highlight I try to make has the same issue.  If needed, I can provide a link to a private video I made for a separate post to give you an idea of what I'm having to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T00:13:00.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using Razer Synapse or a Razer headset by chance? I've seen reports of issues with both their headsets and with Synapse causing issues on the Beta Client for audio. Additionally, if you have any sort of audio application running in the background (discord, skype, control panels for audio, etc) you may want to close them about before recording or watching a highlight, since they can interfere with your audio.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Dean Munsch","date":"2017-03-13T02:54:44.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be too late but I'm having the same problem and with no spund apps running in the background nor those headsets","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wooddawg74","date":"2017-01-01T05:06:53.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm having the same issue now.
