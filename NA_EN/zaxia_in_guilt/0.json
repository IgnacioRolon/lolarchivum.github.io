The team had decided to remake the game. Afterwards I uninstalled league, reinstalled it. Then, I tested it out on a custom game it worked fine but as soon as I join a pvp match meaning in-game it crashes. Today, it happened again and did a custom afterwards it worked fine. I don't know whats going on can someone please tell me what's going on?
