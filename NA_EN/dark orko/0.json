If they want consistency, why the hell even make Taliyah work the way she did in the first place? It's clearly not a matter of consistency, so what's the reason for it? Were they trying out a new mechanic to see how people liked it? Well interestingly, I haven't seen many Taliyah mains who are happy about this switch to consistency, so they made a mistake either way.\n\nEither be consistent or innovate, but don't innovate and then go back to the old way when people get used to the innovation.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-13T19:34:40.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She was designed differently in the first place because the designer wasn't capable of landing Viktor's E, and decided that that must mean that nobody else can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Godhri","date":"2016-07-13T19:45:38.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=musounotakamaru,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XhRJ96Ng,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2016-07-13T19:23:54.801+0000)\n>\n> Yes.

I think the switch just puts her at a higher learning curve. Changes in mechanics generally makes mains unhappy unless it makes things easier for them. In this case, this wasn't the case, but that doesn't mean that the change was a bad thing. They don't make changes for the popularity, but for balance or any number of other reasons. They don't cater just to the mains but to the general population of League despite the fact that they base their changes on pro plays.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-07-13T19:21:58.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When people who know nothing try to talk.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2016-07-13T19:29:11.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nep2une,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XhRJ96Ng,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-13T19:21:58.590+0000)\n>\n> When people who know nothing try to talk.\n\nThis one is a bit more up in the air, but if I'm not mistaken, this is another case of a comment perfectly describing itself.\n\nSeriously, this adds nothing to the conversation.

I don't say that as a good thing though since before she felt like a rock type champion, sturdy and a bit clumsy, she's now a lot more powerful and fast which is a good thing for the gameplay but not for the thematic of the champion itself, before it was as if she was starting to control her powers and like she was a bit afraid of them, now she's in full control.\n\nAlso, from a visual design standpoint her Vector cast W is problematic because you can't see the circle anymore, you can of course estimate it from playing a bit but still, it's just odd that you can't see the initial circle when you hover over the skill.\n\nThe fact that you can change your rotation is pretty cool though and if you ask me I'd vote to keep her old W cast type but getting rid of the lockout mechanic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-07-13T20:21:15.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another one of these posts,  how nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Megamike","date":"2016-07-13T19:47:21.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the real problem with it is casting it at max range or even further than max. Even after adapting I struggle with casting w at max range. When I walk away from my opponent and cast w (at max range), Taliyah starts to move back towards the opponent and then casts W. It should be cast at max range regardless if you used it outside her cast range. I had so many scenarios where I thought I casted W E Q just to realize that my W didn't even go off since Taliyah wanted to \"move\" to cast W at my location and then I cancelled the move command with E Q. Otherwhise the new vektor cast is much better since it keeps you unlocked so you combo anything else into that W. However the best solution imo would be to revert it and still keep Taliyah unlocked out of her W cast. You may also say now that I just have to \"adjust\" a bit more to the point where one has mastered the max range of her W. But that's just plain bs, even Annie had a change where her W was cast in front of her rather than moving first and then cast to the targeted location.\n\nTL:DR\nPros: Working faster combo W E Q instead of clunky E W Q.\n\nCons: Casting W OUTSIDE max range = Move command and then cast at location. E Q follow up may cancel W move command resulting in W never being cast.\n\n+ You can't wait and adjust your W direction anymore (Makes it alot harder to land...)","replies":[]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2016-07-13T19:36:58.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i cant use her anymore after the changes to her w, makes me sad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-13T19:05:00.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I actually like it more as a vektor cast.
