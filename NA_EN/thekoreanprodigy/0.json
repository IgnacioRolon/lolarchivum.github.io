For past couple of months, after the end of every game I would be directed to a waiting for stats page that never loads the stats, if you skip the stats, I go back to home page with a message saying that I've been disconnected from the pvp network. The client seems normal after that, except for the fact that it sometimes wont show my last game stats. I can still get into games, then fall back to the same problem at the end. Pls help.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-16T21:53:29.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually due to how League works with both the client and the in-game experience.  When you hop into an actual match of league (the Loading Screen), the client actually enters in a dormant type state when you are in-game.  If for some reason your computer completely drops the dormant connection, then you will have problems when the game ends and it tries to \"wake up\" the client.\n\nIn order to get this resolved, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
