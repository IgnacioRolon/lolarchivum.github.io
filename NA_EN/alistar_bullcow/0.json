You gimp newer players... why? What&#039;s the point? Why do runes cost so much, and why can&#039;t I get good ones until level 20? Why do champions cost so much damn IP? \r\n\r\nIn HotS, I can own every hero just by completing daily quests. And I only have to complete them once every three days. And guess what? I am much more likely to spend money on that game, then give Riot money because they are choking and squeezing my ability to play the game?\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, league is a good game and I love to play it. But how has there not been a revolt against their shitty, money grubbing, terrible design OUT of game? It&#039;s appalling, and the main reason you have leavers, afkers, and ragers is due to the harsh punishments and leveling up design.\r\n\r\nIn HotS, if you rage uncontrollably, they just silence you and ban you from ranked. You can still play, cool off, and relax. In League, they straight ban the account, banking on the chance that they will make money off your new one. I say this as someone who hasn&#039;t been permabanned or spent money on the game. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand how anyone supports this game financially. I urge you all to stop giving Riot your money until they fix the real issues with the game. The predatory tactics. Thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-07-15T20:14:17.436+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes and HOTS has such low playerbase , Blizzard had to offer free mount on World of Warcraft for those who go and play some matches in HOTS.

Rune system is getting changed as soon as this season is over. League is one of the MOBAs who never gets stale, which always changes. One of biggest reasons it just keeps growing constantly.  Low tier champion is 450 IP, you can earn that in 2 days playing just 1 game a day against bots or in just 3-4 games.  You can get most expensive champion in a week or two of playing 5-6 games a day.\n\nAll MOBAS combined couldnt even come close to League.","replies":[{"poster":"Alistar Bullcow","date":"2017-07-15T21:07:46.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nah, League is trash.
