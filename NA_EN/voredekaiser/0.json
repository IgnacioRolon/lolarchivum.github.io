(Solo baron, 1v5, surrender before nexus destruction, spam pinging, proxy farming) you know what I mean.  Of course none of them have a problem with it and it&#039;s all to have a good time I just want to know if I can get reported/banned for this special play style.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-04-24T22:47:02.854+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The answer to this mostly is yes. The only problem would arise if what you're doing is going to detract from the enemy's game experience somehow - ex: refusing to end but also refusing to let them end, or open-mid and AFKing, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-04-24T22:55:15.972+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how most of the examples given are trolling even in a normal game.  Solo baron is a valid strategy if your champion can do it.  1v5 is fine as long as you aren't straight up inting and your team can gain something from it.  Surrendering just before winning is a team wide effort and I see no problem with it as long as you aren't going with a party of 4 and regularly doing it to troll the 5th member.  Spam pinging can be annoying and done in a toxic way, but that is in a different category from trolling.  It can also be muted.  Proxy farming is a valid strategy for champions who can actually do it like Singed and Tryndamere.  It can do multiple things to help your team even if you are consistently dying.  These things include setting your laner back if they are playing a champion who struggles farming under tower, taking the enemy jungle/middle laner's attention giving you easy dragons and plays in bottom lane to get your adc fed, and later in the game, making it so your enemy can never take towers even if your team gets aced because they never have minions to push with.\n\nSure, people can report you for doing any of the things listed, but you should never get punished for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-04-25T02:23:43.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your teammates are OK with it then its perfectly fine.\n\njust no inting, inting is still inting.

I almost exclusively play this game with real life friends, and we do dumb troll shit all the time. There's no one on our team to report us. Just make sure these fake friends (i say fake because they arent actual friends, they are strangers who play the same video game as you) of yours aren't going to report you out of nowhere, because all Riot will see, is a player getting trolled and reporting it, expecting a punishment to be dolled out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-24T23:04:02.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get reviewed if you get reported, so it entirely depends on how the other team feels about it.\n\nNone of the things you listed are trolling or punishable.","replies":[]}]}
