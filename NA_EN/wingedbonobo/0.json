Went into Ranked champ-select. Everything up until that point was fine. Client closes and brings up game screen. Usually I have to wait a few seconds for the screen to load in from a black screen (patch 7.12 - 7.14). During this specific game instead of the above happening the game displayed a black screen and went unresponsive. Couldn't move the cursor and Alt+Tab did nothing. Turned off Mac and restarted it. Same thing. Tried 1 more time and same result. Only thing that worked was the Command+ALT+Esc. Found this thanks to \"QLT PRODIGY\". So at this point Initial full repair doesn't work. Restarting doesn't work. AT this point can't get into a game of League. Attempting to reinstall the game which is gonna take awhile. **Help**.{{item:3009}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-15T20:28:45.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen can be a result of a connection problem that can't reach the game server, and failing to download any assets.  A reinstall in this case may not work if the issue is with the network and not game files.  For this case, the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should do the trick!
