So I bought a gaming pc this year from ibuypower and being in my parents home I'm upstairs while the router is downstairs and I am experiencing lag on pc games where my xbox works just fine in the same location. I am on wifi with my pc so I'm unsure if it's just a shit wifi adapter in the pc or what. I of course would love to just be wired right into the router but that's not a very viable option. So I'm curious if you think a wifi range extender would be good (and if so if anyone has any recommendations:)). Or any other ideas for me. Thank you for any help!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-27T02:09:08.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not entirely unlikely that your network is working really well, but just has a hard time reaching out servers specifically.

I recommend getting a 50ft ethernet cable and wiring it up. If your family doesn't mind feeding it through the downstairs ceiling of course. If not just get a strong USB WiFi adapter. Also make sure devices connected to the WiFi are limited. WiFi becomes unstable with multiple devices using it and results in WAY slower speeds","replies":[]}]}
