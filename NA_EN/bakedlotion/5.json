Something about too much synergy IIRC.\n\nIs there a reason Ashe was nerfed so hard? I get that she was too strong at killing towers. That nerf made sense. I get that she had too much damage, so the volley nerf made sense. I get that getting 5 stacks of Q with one volley was too strong, so addressing it in some way made sense. But now it's a little too frustrating to get 5 stacks on her Q while every stack falls off after 5 seconds. Yet more it also kept its 18 second CD at all ranks. It's powerful when you can unlock the fully stacked ability, but it's hard to unlock and underwhelming until then.  It needs a little bit of a buff IMO to make it easier obtain the 5 stacks more often, make <5 stack activations more rewarding, or give some power while stacking it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MeÂªt","date":"2015-08-31T02:54:25.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think it would be possible to buff her wall?

These guys don't use 'cold' to slow people though so maybe i wouldn't make it work.\n\nVolibear and Tryndamere use a fear, Trundle's Pillar of Ice could work, and Olaf just throws axes, but these 4 all benefit from building either Frozen Mallet and/or Iceborn Gauntlet to some extent.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-08-30T19:05:35.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trynd doesn't have a fear, and Voli's fear only works on minions.
