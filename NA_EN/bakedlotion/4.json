Also, dashes and blinks can dodge the detonation since most anivias wait for the slow to hit then stun for double damage so they have a short period to dodge.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2016-09-10T00:00:45.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HfvZAEil,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-09-09T22:18:58.525+0000)\n>\n> Chilled won&#x27;t override Iced, so both will be on the target.
