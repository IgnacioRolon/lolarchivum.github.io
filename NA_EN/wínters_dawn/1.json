This is to allow situations like a group of people (like a group of friends) making jabs at each other, with no ill-will intended or taken, without getting banned when no one had a problem with their behavior in that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-02-14T01:52:52.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. It has to be a problem to someone.

This is done so it intervenes only on the basis of someone being offended and files an report, instead of just going around banning someone on its own; it's also to reduce its workload as it's easier to just tell players do reports instead of having the system monitor each and every single match there is and will be.\n\nIf reported with perfect spelling and all, then idk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bishasaurus Flex","date":"2019-02-14T04:14:53.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was told by my previous team to kill myself, and not come out of fountain because they are better 4v5.
