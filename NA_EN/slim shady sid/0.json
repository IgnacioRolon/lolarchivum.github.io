But the in-game ping is around [350-450](https://imgur.com/9v3H7Pz).  \nThis did not happen earlier as I've been playing for the past few months totally fine but the last few weeks, the ping is high.\nIs this my pc's fault, if so is there anyway to fix it.\nor if this is the clients fault, are there any settings i messed up?\n(I've tried the basic things like turning firewall off and the hextech tool thing.)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-07T16:19:06.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That ping seems pretty high, even at 207.  This could be cause by either a local instability, but also how your ISP is routing to the game server.  This can be especially higher if you're playing pretty far from the server itself.  The steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help, especially configuring your DNS to help change your routing.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
