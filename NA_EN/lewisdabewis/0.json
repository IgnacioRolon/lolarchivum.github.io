I started out the game and it was working fine. At about twelve minutes I started experiencing frame drop which is very uncommon on my computer (its a mac). I told my teammates I had like 30 fps. At about 15 minutes I decided I couldn't do this any longer so I decided I would just quickly relog and told my team I would do so. When I tried to exit out of the game, the screen froze and I eventually had to restart my computer. After getting back into the game after about 5-7 minutes I continued on playing normally. The game ended at about 30 minutes. When I exited about of the game I was told that since I had afked I would receive a 5 game 20 minute wait. Obviously, I was pretty pissed. I was just wondering if there was anyway I could get this taken away? I just finished up with another 5 games of 20 minute waits about a week ago. Ive never rage quit in my life and Ive never left for no reason. I highly doubt riot will do anything about this and Ill just end up playing them off but I hope that maybe just maybe theres something riot can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T22:01:23.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't remove [lower priority queues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), and they would only apply to an account after multiple leaves.
