It is consistently around 200-250 when it should be 60. I tried ping testers for lol and it said my ping should be about 25 which I don't believe.

I have now gone through every tooltip and common fix, to re-setting my network, changing ip, flushing dns, I've confirmed now that the problem persists and that it is only affecting league of legends. even the lag report is saying I have had 19 MS latency to their servers in the past day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"honor me 9x ","date":"2017-11-12T05:38:11.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yah, the past 2 days I have had bad ping past 12 at night.
