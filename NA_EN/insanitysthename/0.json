Tell me what you think!\n\nPassive - Poison Trail\n\nSinged lays a poisonous trail behind him that deals 10/30/50/70/90 (+20% Ability Power) (Levels 1/5/9/13/18) magic damage per second for 2 seconds.\n\nRylai&rsquo;s Crystal Scepter does not apply to his passive.\n\nQ - Corrosive Flask\n\nSinged throws a flask at a target location, applying a corrosive potion to all enemies struck that deals 65/120/185/225/260 (+60% Ability Power) magic damage. If the flask strikes an enemy champion it explodes in a greater range and applies a Mark of the Chemist for 5 seconds to all champions struck.\n\nCooldown: 14/12/10/8/6\nMana Cost: 40/60/80/100/120\nCast Range: 1000\nRadius: 75\nChamp Explosion Radius: 250\n\nW - Frozen Trail\n\nPassive: Increases Singed&#039;s Ability Power by 10 for every 100 Bonus Health he has.\n\nActive: Singed changes his brew by adding a freezing mixture for 5 seconds. Singed poison applies a debuff that slows enemies for 30% for 3 seconds, and then stuns them for 1 second.\n\nCooldown: 20\nMana Cost: 40/30/20/10/0\n\nE - Fling\n\nSinged flings an enemy over his shoulder, dealing 50/80/110/140/170 (+2/4/6/8/10% of Singed&#039;s Bonus Health) as magic damage. If the target Singed flings has a Mark of the Chemist, they are also rooted for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8\nMana Cost: 80/90/100/110/120\nCast Range: 175\n\nR - Insanity Potion\n\nSinged drinks a potent brew of chemicals, granting him double speed, double damage from his passive, and a 40% slow on his passive for 8 seconds. Upon activation a global laugh is heard.\n\nCooldown: 140/120/100\nMana Cost: 100\n\nHow about a Drink? -- {{champion:27}}\n\n\nEdit 1: Added W rankings and added global laugh to ult.","replies":[{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-08-19T20:19:32.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does he still laugh when he flings someone?","replies":[{"poster":"InsanitysTheName","date":"2016-08-20T16:44:20.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude why would anyone remove that.

Mana management cant exactly be a key element to a kit unless the whole kit revolves around it.

It means he can build utility and usually not get instakilled in fights, that's pretty interactive. Most mages rely entirely on managing mana, anivia & swain being very obvious examples; if they run out they're useless. Both things can be said with half the champions in the league, some are new ones! \nTaliyah gets movement speed on her worked ground, aurelionsol's stars execute minions when they're low, jihn gains attack damage based on attack speed, kindred gains a scaling botrk effect with each bagged mark, tahm's shield is only as effective as his health is; and so on. Stat checking and self synergy has always been some kind of mechanic, some more abusive than others, but that's ingrained everywhere in the game. \n\nSinged is front liner, and you want to remove some of his survivability? I appreciate keeping the double dip kind of mentality on him; but something like 'gains an extra +5% Max health from items' would incentivize tanky-ness better. Most people build ability power as an afterthought already; but I doubt either of our ideas would make him being played like a mage, viable.","replies":[{"poster":"InsanitysTheName","date":"2016-08-15T06:57:20.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't type a longer reply at the time but the real answer to your above question about why taking away the mana to health passive is not about it being interactive. I'll try to be more clear.\n\nI'm going to remain firm on my aurguement that mana management should not be a CENTRAL gameplay element because it is not very interactive. Mage's mana management is defintely a core part of their class, but if mana management is the only gameplay element anivia focuses on, she will lose out on what I believe are the high moments of her gameplay - Critting with her E or stunning a high priority target and one shotting them.\n\nHowever, I totally agree with you that the self synergizing passives are essential to many character's success. \n\nWhen creating a self synergizing stat buff there are a few things to consider: \n\n1. What build do you want to incentivize. \n\n2. What build do you want to deinsentivize. \n\n3. Either - what do you want the characted to recieve from buying the incentivized stat or what stat do you want the character to buy in order to recieve the incentivized stat. \n\nFor this Singed rework we agree on numbers 1 and 2. We want Singed to buy health and not to buy AP. Number 3 however is the tricky one. \n\nCurrently Singed uses a mana to health system. I would argue this works on his current character because he wan'ts to purchase mana to extend his Q's maximum duration. If I added the same passive to the reworked Singed however, he would not have much to do with all the mana. This led me to a stat he WOULD like regardless of the stat passive, AP. That's the reasoning for why I originally chose that passive but I want to talk about why avoiding something like a %hp boost is a good idea. \n\nFirst, yes, that would incentivize tankyness a WHOLE lot more. There are some downsides however. First, if super tanky is the only optimized build, then Singed's base damages need to be high to make him impactful. This can be scary because it can lead to an extremely strong early to mid game as well as a stagnant late game. Second, if the base damages are very high, the AP ratios need to be lower to halt any potentially strong off meta mage Singed build. \nThe Health to AP allows for a linear progression of damage in relation to health, which allows for his enemies to feel comftorble with the amount of damage Singed is doing. \n\nI would argue that a passive like %hp boost from items is cool and should definetly be used on a future champion. It work great on a Tahm Kench or Mundo like character who wants health and only health because he scales off only his health. However, I don't think its right for Singed with these reworked abilities specifically. \n\nI hope that answers your questions!","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-08-19T15:32:06.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh duh, I was overlooking the major change you did to his poison when you moved it to be his passive, you removed the mana cost, and thus the need to need excessive mana. \nThough I was being ridiculous with my comment about bonus health, I agree it should be for a primary tank, lol. \nAnd yes it did!","replies":[{"poster":"InsanitysTheName","date":"2016-08-19T19:48:49.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-12T18:19:24.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont like the idea of making his main spell his passive. \nHe really needs to manage his mana, and thats an aspect of singed that should never change. \n\nFor w, I like the idea of throwing an unstable contoxtion. Nice idea\n\nI think it should be like this:\n\nPassive: Singed gets bonus movement speed equal to 10% of his max mana (or whatever % is balanced). MS for singed is good, encourages mana builds\n\nQ:Same as Live\n\nW Sticky Concoction: Throw a sticky bomb in an area which SLOWS all enemies.

Not broken at all. Yes, the damage is lower, but you put enough damage elsewhere in his kit that it doesn't even matter.\n\nQ: One of Singed's core weaknesses is his lack of a ranged skill. This blows that away, with a massive nuke, but the tiny radius (even when you hit a champion it is small) makes it bad for pushing, which is the only thing Singed ever does. Adds too much damage, as well as a ranged farming tool, to Singed's kit.\n\nW: You get literally nothing for more than 1 point in it. Also, this allows Singed to hit 300 AP with a full tank setup. Too powerful of a passive. Also, don't give Singed a stun. That is just asking for trouble.\n\nE: An argument could be made for his E scaling off of Singed's HP instead of the target's, but that root is out of the question. Singed's current root is balanced because it is damn near impossible to pull off; this is basically guarunteed.\n\nR: Singed's current ultimate grants him 25 seconds of a moderate increase to his speed, AP, regen, and defenses. This makes it incredible for doing what Singed does best; running around wasting the time of enemies. This ultimate is a massive increase to his speed, damage, and utility, but with a short duration. This would turn Singed into a champion who wants to engage instead of a champion mean to apply permanent pressure, and I don't like that.\n\ntl;dr \nToo powerful, and doesn't maintain Singed's playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"InsanitysTheName","date":"2016-08-12T18:14:22.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always imagined Singed's playstyle as more of an engage tank with fling.
