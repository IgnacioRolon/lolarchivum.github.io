Did something get broken?  I did get FWotD on one but it showed 0 base xp.  The other one I had an XP boost and it showed negative base xp to get me to 0 overall.  This is really annoying.  Please fix this.\n\nEdit:  This seems to happen with games a little over 7 minutes.  The two I described above were just about 7:15, I just played an 14:32 game and it worked fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T23:52:25.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coop vs AI games will give lower XP depending on your level:\n\nLevel 30: Bots grant 75% XP (55% after 180 minutes each day).\n\nYou won't receive XP if you are marked as a leaver, but there's been some visual issues not showing XP received as well.

So I checked into this and it looks like the match was too fast.  I asked our game team, and it seems like the match needs to have lasted at least 8 minutes to be eligible for the XP.
