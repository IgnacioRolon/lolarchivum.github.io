We're looking into a fix, but for now, you can try updating windows to see if it resolves the issue, as it has for some. \n\nI don't have an estimation for when the permanent fix will roll out, but let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"CrescentMoon","date":"2016-08-11T00:30:06.970+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am experiencing the same issue but I've tried to fix it tho so I've tested things around, didn't have success but here is what I got, maybe it helps you:\nRunning as admin or not, using the lol admin client or normal doesn't make a difference.\nRepair function doesn't fix it, deleting adobe air client and redownloading doesn't fix it.\nChanging servers didn't work either.\nAfter many tries, it randomly worked twice normally and didn't crash. One time it worked but when I clicked on profile it immediately crashed in the same manner.\nA few times it crashed differently, it reported that Visual C++ Runtime Library had an error in the RADS\\Projects folder, couldn't see the full path.\nI've updated the Visual C++ Runtime, didn't fix it.\nSometimes it crashes as soon as I login, in the same way as opening the Hextech page.\nRunning in compatibility mode didn't work.\n\nI am using the latest Windows 10 (64bit), Windows 10 anniversary edition with an windows update too, it had one.\nEverything is updated to latest, drivers, everything as it's a fresh windows install.\nI've actually used LoL normally today but I don't remember opening Hextech, most likely it's the new patch if you ask me.\n\nIn Launcher logs it gives weird errors about not finding friends:\ncom.riotgames.platform.gameclient.chat.controllers.BuddyListPresentationModel BuddyListPresentationModel.updateOnlineStatus: Could Not find MIRRORED dest Roster Group For User, He may be stuck in wrong group now!\nAnd also an OMG error.\nIt also gives the error: com.riotgames.platform.common.http.HttpRequester Service returned status: 304 URL:\nfor Item sets and GamePreferences, I prefer not to give the url in public if it's not safe.\n\nThose are all my findings, hope it helps you~ Everything else works perfectly fine except those things that I've mentioned~","replies":[]},{"poster":"If You Seek Amy","date":"2016-08-16T02:04:22.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i was gone for a few days i come back there is a cool event i buy all the stuff from the shop and go to open it, then have this problem with the crafting page crashing my game, i've tried all the \"fixes\" i can find online about it, and nothing helps.  So now i don't get to open them and i'm going to lose out on the special loading border which is the only reason i decided to spend the time on this. So i have just one simple question since there is a known problem with this is there anyway i could get refunded my purchases of the augment chests, or could i get credit for the border since it was stated in the post about the loading border that you can get one guarantee from all the chest?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T16:21:35.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you happen to be running Plays.tv?
