I haven't played since Monday and tried playing a game before going to work today and the same thing happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfearent","date":"2017-02-16T18:49:32.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saaame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"13SHADOWS","date":"2017-02-17T02:06:00.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BOYS! i know how to fix this fps issues ( IM SO HAPPY )\nit can take 1hour to fix him.\nfirst step: update java to java 121\nand finaly in the launcher,\nu need to click to the case ( the ''?\"\" ) and click the scanning files.\nAnd then enjoy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T18:59:44.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sudden and erratic spikes in ping like this can be caused by a bad connection to the game server, and it specifically sounds like you're experiencing packet loss.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these games to really know for sure.

What I don't understand though is why my ping is staying between 40 and 90 when my usual ping is 31-33. If it were between 31-90 I could understand but that's not the case since even at its lowest my ping is still above its usual values.","replies":[]}]}]}
