Earlier in my last game, I was getting that issue and 2 players on my team randomly disconnected at the same time because of that (they were not premade).\r\n\r\nLet's say I'm just farming bot lane and then the minions are glitched, I'm not moving anymore and I can't see the enemy Corki and Bard moving towards me but I can still see my health bar dropping when they attack me, even though I have no idea where they're attacking from. That's exactly what's happening.\r\n\r\nIt's basically an anticipation game and you pretty much have to play the fight in your head while it's happening and hope the enemy doesn't flash because you WON'T see it.\r\n\r\nIt's really fun to play Fiora against a Riven what that kind of stuff happens.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-09T22:14:45.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that you hit the nail on the head when you attributed it to packet loss.  It's hard to say exactly where or why this packet loss is occurring, but there are some steps you can take to make sure it isn't an issue locally on your own computer and network.  Make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are a lot of steps there, but it should help to get your connection consistent again.\n\nIf you are still seeing the issue, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"ßLACKPłNK Rosé","date":"2016-05-10T02:21:01.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just did the packet loss test, says everything is going well on my end (or at least everything that would affect my connection in-game).","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T20:39:14.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you did the Packet Loss Test, did you run a [tracert specifically to the NA Servers](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674#wq2)?
