I play draft so I can choose the role I play. I play the role so I can have fun, but now by some random chance I get forced into a role I&#039;ve played like twice in my life, I do terrible, my team rages at me, and I don&#039;t wanna play League again. If I try and dodge because I don&#039;t want to put up with getting screamed at because I&#039;m feeding BECAUSE I HATE PLAYING THAT ROLE. I get blocked from quene. Isn&#039;t the point of a game to have fun? I would so much rather have a longer quene time than be FORCED into a role I cannot play. This isn&#039;t fun anymore. I&#039;m not even going to bother playing League until RIOT FIXES THIS. Anyone else feeling the same way?","replies":[{"poster":"Diamondback583","date":"2017-01-02T21:29:51.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with auto fill is that it ruins, in my own personal experience, not one, but two peoples games. Most people, when they are auto filled, get all mad and pick a troll support and int for the rest of the game. This makes playing adc cancer as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2016-11-27T08:09:08.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dodge every queue in which I am auto filled.\n\nAuto Fill is an incredible step backward from the improvements they've made to the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-27T04:57:33.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wants everyone to be a SRSBSNSMLG riven player, to the point of saying they plan on removing normal draft, and only leaving ranked draft.\n\nAt this point i am pretty sure they have no idea what they are doing and are ignoring all feedback, which is the videogame studio equivalent of jumping the shark.
