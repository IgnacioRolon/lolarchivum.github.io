Although I was very frustrated with recent teams, I really don&#039;t think I deserved a permanent ban from what I said.  The banning system that gets you banned from a 1 sided conversation from 1 person&#039;s report is very ridiculous.  It doesn&#039;t promote a better league community of excellent players.  First off, why would you ban a LOL player that gives you revenues.  Second, why don&#039;t they include the other person&#039;s conversation in this one sided conversation list.  Obviously the other player was just as guilty in having this conversation with me throughout the game, both instigiating more negativity and not focusing on the game.  The worst thing that should happen is a ban from chat for a period of time or number of games, it should never go as far as permanetly banning someone for being iritiated and speaking whats on his mind.  The bans should go to people who intentionally feed a game because they don&#039;t like a player or something didn&#039;t go there way.  This loophole that exists probably already lost a major portion of the gaming market share of players who don&#039;t want to return to LOL because of their PG 13 rules.  If you lift this ban on permanent players that have been banned for a while i guarantee you that you will gain a great number of market share of players who return to LOL.  You guys should promote excellence in gaming not players that write a full page report on someone else because they have a grudge for some reason and has nothing better to do and probably feels good about it at the end of the day.  Scumbag.  Riot lift the bans.  \r\n\r\nP.S. My last conversation with the kid was me blocking a spell and being a sportsmanship like player in the game.  Does me having some harsh words in game to get the guy to focus a permanent worthy descision?

If Riot does ban a toxic player, even if that player gives them money, then the remaining players who aren't banned will very likely have a more enjoyable experience and thus be more inclined to spend more money on the game. So, it's actually in Riot's interest to ban toxic players, as they are more likely to earn more money in the long run than if they didn't ban them due to the non banned players having a more enjoyable experience.\n\nThis same logic can also be applied to any other business there is too. Get rid of those who are causing a disturbance and you are more likely to gain a bigger profit from those who aren't a disturbance.\n\n>  Second, why don't they include the other person's conversation in this one sided conversation list.\n\nAlthough Riot does have access to the other players' chat logs, they only include yours in your reform card because that is what you are punished for. You are not punished for the actions of others, only your own. It doesn't matter what other players say or do, if you respond with your own toxicity, then you are simply making an already bad situation even worse, making yourself open to punishment. If others are being toxic first, the proper response would be to mute/ignore them and report them after the game. This way they will be judged for their own actions and you won't be punished because you did nothing wrong.\n\nAlso, if you're going to say \"why don't they mute me if they have something wrong with what I say in chat?\" I'm sorry to break it to you, but the existence of the mute button is not an excuse for you to be toxic. The mute button is there so that others don't have to deal with your chat for the remainder of the game. The report button is there so that future players won't have to deal with your chat and bother muting you in the first place.\n\n> The worst thing that should happen is a ban from chat for a period of time or number of games, it should never go as far as permanetly banning someone for being iritiated and speaking whats on his mind\n\nRiot already hands out chat restrictions. Riot has essentially also tried permanent chat restrictions (it was really infinitely stacking chat restrictions, but pretty much the same) and found that they didn't work. While most people who get a chat restriction reform and don't get punished again, some people just don't get the message that their behavior is not acceptable with just a chat restriction, and this is when temporary/permanent bans come in. When a player shows repeated toxic behavior in chat showing no intention of changing, that's when Riot permanently bans the account. It's unfortunate for these players, but sometimes that's just what it takes for someone to finally realize that their behavior is not welcome here.","replies":[{"poster":"4th Quarter","date":"2016-10-24T21:38:45.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"Although Riot does have access to the other players' chat logs, they only include yours in your reform card because that is what you are punished for.

If you believe another player is instigating and promoting negativity, report them and they will be judged for their own behavior, just like you are judged for yours. However, what you are doing in the chat logs provided is adding on to the situation with your own negativity, and that is not acceptable. Doing so makes a bad situation even worse and makes their reports against you valid.\n \n> THIS IS WHAT I SAID.  I&#x27;M NOT THE PERSON THAT IS MAKING THE REPORT.  I HELD MY GAME DOWN AND DID MY BEST TO WIN THE GAME.  THE REAL QUESTION IS WAS THE OTHER PLAYER THAT MADE THE REPORT BEING TEAM ORIENTED AS WELL?\n\nSo you were trying to win the game, which is good, but you were also being quite negative in chat. What I was saying by that comment is that if _you_ find another player being toxic first, then _you_ should mute them and report them after the game, if you feel it necessary. I'm not talking about what they should be doing, I'm talking about what you should be doing, because this is your case and punishment, not theirs. You found someone else to be quite negative in the game, and instead of muting them, you responded with your own negativity. \n\n> I NEVER IMPLIED THAT IT IS AN EXCUSE TO BE TOXIC.  IT JUST SHOWS THE PERSON THAT MAKES THE REPORTS INTENTION.  THEY ARE PURPOSELY BEING NEGATIVE BOTH IN GAME PLAY AND CHAT TO INSTIGATE FURTHER NEGATIVITY AND USING THAT TO MAKE THE REPORT.  THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO WIN THE GAME.  **IF THEY WERE LIKE I SAID THEY WOULD BE MUTING THE OTHER PLAYER AND FOCUSING ON THE GAME.** \n\nOkay, so if you were trying to win the game, why didn't you mute them and focus on the game? Sure, you could be focusing on the game while still arguing with them, but you could have been focusing a lot more had you muted them to begin with.\n\nNow, I know that muting someone doesn't not take away from their gameplay actions. If it comes to that, you still need to do your best to ignore them and focus on the yourself, or at the very least not respond with your own toxicity like you did in the above chat logs. \n\n> YOUR SAYING THAT PERMANENT CHAT RESTRICTIONS DID NOT WORK?  TELL ME MORE BECAUSE I REALLY FIND THAT ONE HARD TO BELIEVE. YOU CAN&#x27;T SAY TOO MUCH IN CHAT RESTRICTION SO IT IS BEST IF YOU SAVE THOSE CHATS FOR MEANINGFUL PURPOSES AND THEY WORK PRETTY WELL.

Riot truly did find that this course of action did not work.\n\nTo start, it gave absolutely no incentive for a player to reform their behavior. The chat restrictions kept on stacking and stacking, to the point where players would have thousands of games worth of chat restrictions, which could easily last a few seasons. This gave players little to no incentive to reform because even if they did, they would still have the chat restrictions for a very long time. So, instead of reforming, these players just used their limited chat to harass and abuse others because all that would get them is just more chat restrictions. They did not save there limited chat for things that would be useful to the current game at all. Also, this does show that you can indeed be toxic even with a chat restriction.\n\nOn top of that, because these players only had a limited number of messages per game, when they ran out, Riot found that they would vent their frustration through different forms of toxicity, such as trolling or intentionally feeding, which jsut lead to more problems. So, Riot decided to throw away the infinite scaling chat restrictions and issue temporary or permanent bans to those who are repeatedly toxic in chat.","replies":[{"poster":"4th Quarter","date":"2016-10-24T22:16:34.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you have thousands of games worth of chat restrictions you deserve a ban.  That would be unarguable (but your obviously puffing).  Like I said in my other reply, if riot created a full non-chat restriction (0 chat not limited chat) for players that \"stack chat restrictions\" then there would be no way the restriction would \"not work\".  That would solve a lot of problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-10-24T22:39:54.521+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I'm not puffing. You can go ahead do a google search if you don't believe me. There were plenty of people of were chat restricted for thousands of games. Now, I do admit I could have been a bit more clear on this. For some people, the chat restricted games weren't given all at once. They had maybe just a few at first, but as soon as they completed those, they instantly received more, and once they completed the second set, they instantly received even more, and this continued to the point were they eventually went through a few thousand games of chat restrictions consecutively.\n\nHowever, there were some players that received a few thousand all at once. In fact, there was someone who received 5000 chat restricted games all at once. This was all due to how the punishment system worked at the time, but it has since been replaced by the Instant Feedback System, which works drastically different.\n\nAs for having absolutely no chat messages, again, that won't really work either. If players who are toxic in chat could no longer use chat, Riot found that a large majority of them would resort to other forms of toxicity, such as trolling or intentionally feeding, so Riot would just wind up banning them anyway. Doing this would simply give them more steps before a permanent ban. Players are already given multiple chances to reform their behavior before a permanent ban is issued, and a very small percentage of players even reach the permanent ban step. Those who do have simply shown that they have no intention of reforming their behavior, so even a complete chat ban wouldn't help them anyway.\n\nOf course, there are some players who would benefit from it, but unfortunately Riot doesn't give them this treatment because then they would have to do it for everyone. As I stated before, a large majority of players would not benefit from this, so doing so would simply give them more time to be toxic before being punished.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-10-24T21:37:47.264+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Goes to jail*\n\n\"I think jails should not exist.\"","replies":[{"poster":"4th Quarter","date":"2016-10-24T21:41:11.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Freedom of speech.","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-10-24T21:43:58.236+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freedom of speech states that the government can't censor you, any other company or private group (ESPECIALLY if you have signed their EULA) can get rid of anything you say and you can't do anything about it.\n\nRiot could right now delete this post and block you from posting forever and you couldn't do anything about it, it's their property.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-24T21:48:33.408+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freedom of Speech also doesn't mean Freedom of Consequences, which OP seems to so conveniently forget.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4th Quarter","date":"2016-10-24T21:54:10.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am implying that I have the freedom of speech to write whatever in chat based on the fact that you referenced the reporting system for in game chat to going to jail.

If you can&#x27;t handle what&#x27;s going on in the chat why don&#x27;t you simply mute the player and try to win the game instead of being this sore loser that loses the game intentionally although we are on the same team and writes a full page report on a player that he instigated the whole game and feel good about it.\n\nI don't think the above chat is _minor issues_ , especially if it's consistent (it would need to be for perma.)  Wouldn't it be easier to just not write the chat instead?  One person to stop writing vs getting potentially 9 people to read then mute?\n>Worst part is that the ban system works this way.\n\nThe comment section is for ease of investigation and improving the system (to see what players deem unacceptable), it's not used as straight-up evidence.","replies":[{"poster":"4th Quarter","date":"2016-10-24T21:40:48.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"9 people to read then mute?\"\n\nFirst off, i rarely all chat because I don't think communicating and chatting with the enemy team benefits your team in any major way.  \n\n\"The comment section is for ease of investigation and improving the system (to see what players deem unacceptable), it's not used as straight-up evidence.\"\n\nIsn't part of investigating finding evidence or I could be wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-10-24T23:45:28.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=4th Quarter,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=56a3qJE3,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-24T21:40:48.216+0000)\n>\n> &quot;9 people to read then mute?&quot;\n> \n> First off, i rarely all chat because I don&#x27;t think communicating and chatting with the enemy team benefits your team in any major way.  \n\nI put it there as a worst-case scenario, but yes it's 4 if you don't /all chat to shit-talk teammates.^^\n\n> &quot;The comment section is for ease of investigation and improving the system (to see what players deem unacceptable), it&#x27;s not used as straight-up evidence.&quot;\n\nWhich is exactly what I'm saying.\nThey can't just read a report that says \"he/she was trolling\" and automatically say the player was trolling; that wouldn't make sense :P\n\n> Isn&#x27;t part of investigating finding evidence or I could be wrong?\n\nYeah it is, but why make it harder to investigate and find the evidence?\nIf they have a lead why not share it?\n(Inting/trolling is sometimes hard to detect compared to a bad game)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-24T21:57:39.391+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot tried to do away with permanent bans before.

This behavior isn't acceptable by Riot or by the community, hence why you received a ban. Chances are you already went through the other tiers in the punishment system without bothering to reform. \n\nYou can make a new account and try again if you want to, but judging from your responses you don't seem to realize your mistakes and that you got yourself banned for your own behavior.
