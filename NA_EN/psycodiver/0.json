Almost every time I see that comment it is from people who are toxic, and have received numerous punishments. The general attitude is if you got punished, you did something to deserve it. As you can see going through these forum posts, most of the time people who post about being punished for no reason get down voted pretty hard. That is because the majority don't agree that the punishment was unwarranted.\n\nOf course we would love if everyone were happy with all of the systems, but I know there will always be a vocal minority speaking out against them. We are of course open to feedback from people about improving.","replies":[{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2016-03-08T17:36:44.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straight from the website on reporting functions.\n\"Refusing to Communicate with Team - This applies to any Summoner that refuses to use chat or pings.

After all, what if someone thought griefing and refusing to communicate were the same thing?
