I&#039;ve been playing League here and there for a while and I find PVP games too toxic so I play Co-op Vs. AI and even then there&#039;s people trying to grief me from time to time. This time I was banned, and I don&#039;t understand why. I had a Riven (botter/cheater; if you&#039;ve played bot games you&#039;ve probably seen some) in my lane feeding the bots so needless to say I&#039;m behind. Then the jungler walks up, takes both the kills before I could secure them, and proceeds to take my cs. I tell him to leave and spam ping him since he has 2 jungles to farm. He replies with spamming his laugh and emotes at me while taking my farm. It&#039;s frustrating so I let him know that he&#039;s griefing and will receive a report from me.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s the backstory of how it began, thus an argument occurred about whether or not what he was doing was in any way breaking the established code of conduct. IMO both of us were annoyed at each other, but neither of us were verbally toxic.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s ironic how during this argument I was trying to explain the ban system to him, then I&#039;m the one getting banned and don&#039;t understand why. Lol\r\n\r\nCould someone please enlighten me on how to deal with difficult people like this in the future on League? Also point out what I did wrong here. I want serious responses please, as I seriously don&#039;t understand why I&#039;m being punished. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n*It should be noted I&#039;ve never received a punishment before on League at all, and that I just lost all my honor rank I was working so hard for :/\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: get out\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: riven greifed my lane\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: I dont need you greifing it too\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: Really?\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: I&#039;m reporting honestly\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: for griefing me\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: Ofc I can\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: Obviously you don&#039;t understand what greifing is, or that people actually review games on reports\r\nxXSp4Rt4nBl4DeXx: To troll your own team member in a bot game, how sad.

So if someone is really reviewing these, then i am pretty sure i would get more instant feedback reports unless riot is is fine with homophobia, sexism, and racism.

I sure have, countless times. You cannot tell me someone is sitting there reviewing and confirming the reports within seconds. Reports do get reviewed by someone but not for first time offenses.  \nOr try this, report someone who is being completely racist, like crazy racist.

Next time you see an outright racist, or homophobic player ,report that person. It would not result in any penalty unless you get more people to report along with you.  I repeat , this is easy to test. Most players forget about offensive remarks by the time the game ends so these usually results in a single report....it won't do anything.  \nThere would be countless instant penalties if there were.\nRegardless I have seen innocent players get penalties because they were mass reported in a game and then have the penalty removed the day after disputing the penalty. Think of that....8 or 9 fake reports resulting in automatic penalty while countless single reports against truly toxic players go unanswered.  It is definitely a measure of report quantity AS WELL.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-10-21T23:00:47.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report weight no longer exists, according to riot.\n\nYou dont always get a feedback card, but it is pretty easy to tell when someone got banned or blocked from ranked by their history.
