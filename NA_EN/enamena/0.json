My laptop has never had any trouble running LoL before, and now I can't connect.  It disconnects me at the 45% mark and tells me that there was an error.  I am using a msi GT 70.  Could somebody tell me how to fix this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEnamena","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-19T18:06:13.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Enamena!\n\nI completely understand how frustrating it can be to disconnect over and over again in the Loading Screen without knowing why.
