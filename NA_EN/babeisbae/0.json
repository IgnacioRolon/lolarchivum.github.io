I ganked 3 times early, teammates just sat there farming, so didnt get any kills out of it, then all game im getting blamed for not ganking :P They say they are gonna report me for trolling but the whole team fell apart because i picked Taric jungle and they cant understand that they themselves have to not feed to win the game :P Why am i reportable for picking a champion if i told them we had a late game team and it was a good fit?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-21T18:43:48.037+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can be for \"refusing to communicate\"\n\n\nThen again you can actually be reported for almost anything in the game.

This can go multiple ways like trying to make Rammus support work, compared to something with more utility it can punish the lane more than reward it.  \n\nThink like Sona mid---it works, but it isn't as valuable in team fights for damage and utility like an actual AP carry.  [Ahri taunt > Sona Q]  Make sure if you do an off-meta pick that your team can back it up with another tank or more damage to contrast that.  Remember ultimately that it is a team game and you want to help your team, not hinder them.","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-03-22T20:11:58.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except you can't be punished for disagreements in tactics or off-meta picks.\n\nYou can't be held hostage by anyone and everyone in champ select lobby every time you want to do something off-meta and people freak out over it; regardless of whether _they_ think it works or not.\n\nWhat if you're a one trick Taric jungler and you play a lot of league? That's going to stack up the griefing reports, whether you win or lose games.

With Taric jungle, I guess I'm unsure how he'd be able to clear the jungle or gank effectively. If your plan is just to get to the mid-late game, how do you expect to fair against junglers that are more prone to ganking? Like Khazix, Rengar, Gragas, Elise, Lee Sin etc? \n\nI'm not saying Taric support won't work, but when your lanes need to be set up for safer play, their picks should correspond to that plan, and so should your warding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kit DoubleEdge","date":"2017-03-22T15:10:04.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stated in that Summoner's Code or whatever that you cannot be banned for off-meta picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-03-22T01:52:34.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you reportable?
