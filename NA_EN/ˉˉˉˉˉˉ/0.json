Why do you not simply listen to your players? Why do you keep refusing to give us OfA, Urf, etc? Why is it so hard to satisfy a simple need? And if One for All isn't optimized for new client or whatever, why not work on that, or give us other FUN game modes meanwhile?\n\nMost of the community is sick of Ascension and Poro King, since the latter for example is pretty much ARAM with a big extra poro. If you are worried of &quot;too much&quot; Urf and Nemesis Draft making us tolerant and sick of it, don&#039;t be. Each one of us prefers those over Poro King every 2 weeks.\n\nHaha also don't forget All Random Summoners Rift amirite?
