I'm really curious to know if saving an hextech chest and opening it when a future released skin is out will have a possibility to contain that skin.\r\n\r\nFor example, Archlight Brand is not out yet, I do have an hextech chest right now. If I open the chest when the skin will be released do I have a chance to get it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2019-02-22T23:16:26.337+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!

Good luck!\n\nThanks a lot for the answer!\n\nThough I'm really upset right now...\n\nthe 8th November 2018 I've sent a support ticket about THIS question and I received totally the opposite answer:\n\n> Hi Noxian Assassin,\n**The prize contained within the Hextech creation is assigned when the creation is obtained and remains '' hidden '' until you open it.\n**\n\n> So if you wait for the release, you will not be able to find the skin of Leona (the Solar and Lunar Eclipse) :(, because those orbs (KDA orbs) were purchased before the release of that skin.\n\nSo I opened the KDA orbs knowing they wont contain future skins...\n\nBut in my ticket question I also asked if an hextech CHEST may have a future skin, and the Rioter said not (the first sentence).\n\n\nSo once for all I'd like to know the truth. Could the KDA Orb contain future skins and can hextech chests contain future skins?\n\nI'm thinking I've lost many chances to get skins not yet released like Winter Wonder Soraka or the Leona skins due to the Rioter's reply.","replies":[]}]}]}
