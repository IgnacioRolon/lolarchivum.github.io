When no one wanted to he showed he wanted to pick fizz support which I said thats fine aslong as he actualy plays support. we loaded in the game and he bought a dark seal and refillable pot first time and I asked him \"fizz support item?\". He walked to lane and began to take cs and I couldn't do anything to stop him his W was able to take all the cs, he than began to flame me aswell as the mid and top laners. So my question is what can be done about this kind of player? This has not been the first time between level 1-28 and I dont think this will be the last. And for a player trying to reform its extreamly hard dealing with these kind of people.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T04:11:27.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Wow, what a helpful and Supporting Fizz' said no one ever.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}\n\nTrolls like that are not what anyone wants to see, and I'm really bummed it happened to you dood. I know I hate it. Fortunately, that kind of behavior doesn't go unnoticed; there are systems in place that help our Behavior Support Team detect and reform (or remove if necessary) that behavior. Remember that you can always mute trolls if they're abusing chat; that's the single best defense to stop that. After the game, hit them with a report and leave details in it, and that will assist our Behavior team further. With your help their trolling days (and hopefully Fizz Support days, plz) will be numbered. :)","replies":[]}]}
