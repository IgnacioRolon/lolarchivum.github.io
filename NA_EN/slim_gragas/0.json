Just like Irelia, Yuumi, Akali, Aatrox, etc. It is absolutely ridiculous that we are conditioned to expect this, and i expect the same for the next champion coming out as well. We simply do not have enough bans to deal with all of these champions anymore that Riot is powercreeping.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-12T17:53:23.661+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yuumi was 28% wr dogshit on release what are you talking about","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Gragas","date":"2019-06-12T17:54:49.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=R07FKUGj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-12T17:53:23.661+0000)\n>\n> Yuumi was 28% wr dogshit on release what are you talking about\n\nWow, people have problems with using a champion correctly on release, color me surprised. Now look at what she is, everyone hates her. It matters not if its on release or not, though the vast majority of the time it has been this season.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-06-12T18:06:08.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slim Gragas,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=R07FKUGj,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-06-12T17:54:49.245+0000)\n\n> It matters not if its on release or not\n\n????\nIs it does matter if it's on release when you're complaining about champion strength on release.\nHas any new champ this year been broken on release? I recall every one of them getting buffs, either hotfixed or in the next patch. We literally just had the 2nd lowest winrate champion of all time get released last month.

But you literally fight them the same; kite them and CC them.\n\nYou can also QSS morde's ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Gragas","date":"2019-06-12T18:29:44.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pika Fox,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=R07FKUGj,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-06-12T18:26:49.581+0000)\n>\n> His W functions as his pull/gap closer/1v1 tool, and even gets armor shred on E.\n> \n> Nasus is still the best straight duelist in melee range in the game, unless morde just eeks by on it.
