(That's right, I live in South Africa, where national blackouts are a thing and all kinds of wacky stuff happens, but don't worry I ain't the guy that disconnects in your promos cuz of it. Since it's scheduled blackouts, I don't play near the times it goes out.)\r\n\r\nAnyhoo back to the topic on hand, I logged in and immediately recieved my first win bonus and some tokens (Yeah I bought the pass, cuz it's a good deal and I like opening lootboxes) , I found that very strange, since I last played the previous night. So I checked my match history and lo and behold, theres an Ezreal match in Arurf that transpired today (1st February 2020) and he/she went like 25/7 or something.\r\n\r\nSo I decided I was gonna go change my account details after one or two ranked games with my duo support (shoutout to my guy TheDeadlyDonut) after winning two of my Iron 1 promos (we definitely gonna get that gold this year lmao) and losing the third, I got a notification about being permabanned for third party software. \r\n\r\nI do NOT use any kind of scripts or third party programs, besides overwolf. When I finally get silver, I want it to be out of pure skill and dedication to the craft not some cheap hacks. So I submitted a ticket to riot support and changed my email and password so long.\r\n\r\nObviously I was kinda in a state of disbelief, and I tend to laugh off negativity, but now I'm starting to feel down for sure after reading a few negative forum posts about similar situations. But I still have hope that riot will check the login ip etc. And realize it wasn't me.\r\n\r\nWas hoping you guys could share some positive experiences with riot support, or maybe just some memes or funny stories about league to take my mind off things.\r\n\r\nHave a lovely day guys.","replies":[]}
