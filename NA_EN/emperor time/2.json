Unfortunately that isn&#039;t the case anymore since Ekko jungle has been gutted. I don&#039;t agree with the decision to prevent Ekko from jungling one bit. It&#039;s probably the worst set of changes to ever happen in this game. I absolutely loved Ekko on release, he was so strong and flashy, he really felt like the one champion I had been waiting for my whole life. I know this probably sounds cheese or dumb, but I really did love that champion. So it really hurts when I see him being played mid and I can&#039;t enjoy the fun of playing him anymore. Some might say that you should just play mid then, but the thing I hate most about this game is csing. That&#039;s the real reason I play jungle, so that I can avoid that chore. \n\nSo I believe that this is the patch that destroyed his jungling\nV6.11\n _**Z-Drive Resonance\nOn-target cooldown increased to 5 seconds from 3.**_\n_**Timewinder\nOutgoing AP ratio increased to 20% AP from 10% AP.\nIncoming base damage reduced to 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 from 60 / 85 / 110 / 135 / 160.**_\nParallel Convergence\nStun duration reduced to 1.75 seconds from 2.25.\nChronobreak\nBase damage reduced to 150 / 300 / 450 from 200 / 350 / 500.\nAP ratio increased to 150% AP from 130% AP.\n\n\nSo without even considering jungle they destroyed his passive, which was the one of the major abilities that was allowing him to jungle. It also didn&#039;t help that his base damages got gutted systematically patch after patch after patch and that was mainly due to tank Ekko. There is a quite simple fix that I believe wouldn&#039;t be too hard to implement and that would be to allow Ekko&#039;s passive to never lock out or have a reduced lock out on neutral monsters. This would be a slight buff to mid/top Ekko as they would be able to take neutral objectives a little quicker, but this would be a godsend for jungle Ekko. Also there aren&#039;t very many runic echo junglers and it would be great to have another, I think only 4 champs use it and those being Gragas, Elise, Evelynn and Nidalee, sometimes Gragas could just buy cinderhulk as well. So I think having another ap jungler to play wouldn&#039;t be so bad.

Also the ap ratio increase they gave him here was a revert of a change they made back in patch 5.12\n\nAnd to top it off this one patch made his clear go from semi decent too trash tier. \n\nso essentially what the passive lockout does is prevent you from proccing as many times, so lets say you procced it 4 times before at 3 seconds per. now since they essentially almost doubled the lockout time you'll only ever get it off around 2 maybe 3 times. Which sucks because to clear fast you have to get the camps low enough so that the w passive starts to take effect. And to top it off his AA base damage was lowered by 4(in patch 6.18)which may not seem like much either, but lets say you AA a camp 7 times you just lost 28 points of damage.\n\nAll in all Ekko's clear is garbage and he can't really do it unless you do some really gimicy stuff with talisman and starting blue side so that you can q raptors constantly wilst doing red buff.

I still say the thing needs a massive hit to his R atleast considering how much of a cheap juke or EZ get away card it is for him not to mention he's basically a fighter with how much sustain damage (Q spam then E in soon as 2 marks are applied) he pulls off, yet at the same time enough burst damage (thunderlords, W passive, W+E stun+shield damage combo, Q to EZ proc thunderlords repeatedly or his own passive).\n\nBeyond his W and his R, the rest of his kit is basically short as heck cooldowns (Passive has a 5 sec 'waiting time' per proc, Q can be spammed every 9 to 7 seconds pratically the same to Ahri's 7 second Q, plus many more things*, With his W may having a 22~14 cd base, that passive gives him some rather insane finish off potential where he's adding at least 6% missing health damage at the early levels with 100 ap and likely be up to 300 maybe 400 to bring that 30% hp threshold whacker with autos up to a whooping 9%~12% bonus. Oh plus his EZ gap closer is a short 11~7 cooldown base).\n\nI've said it plenty of time's but he's less of a assassin/fighter hybrid and more of a burst in close range assassin then run away like a arse with EZ, regardless if he killed his target or fked up and got caught in CC, basically rather pick off EZ squish targets on ends i see most bronze players use'm as, just like how Tryndamere is the EZ mode top laner who just smacks thru turrets with EZ. If Ekko actually had the damn risk like maybe a debuff or HUGE range limit on how far he can R jump (preferably up to maybe 5~8 teemos away because alot of Ekkos seem to pull it easily 15 teemos away or further), the debuff could easily just be a true cap on how much he heals, because him being able to full heal from taking 60% of his health in damage with his R is kinda silly and should at least be capped to maybe 25% of the damage he took at rank 1 and MAYBE 50% at rank 3 just to keep him from just EZ re'engaging as if he just hit a actual reset button on the fight for him and no one else).\n\n*namely these many more things include : Ahri's Q costs 15 more mana at rank 1, Ekko's 2 hits on his Q basically dealing the same base (60~120 30% AP scaling and 40~140 base with 60% AP scaling) on top of having a slow to it, even if Ahri's Q has 'true damage' on the 2nd hit o the Q and 'micro move speed bonus during it' they aren't exactly shaping up for that difference (Ahri's being 40~140 with a 35% ap scaling on both hits).\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nI would even be happy if they just take away the 2nd hit on his Q just to restrict his rapid procing of his passive and thunderlords and buff the dmg on the Q to 'compensate' because a rather EZ damage hitter with a slow and multi hit is way too strong of a gimmick on plenty of champions for a strong 'harass tool'.\n\nUltimately he needs to be made either a pure assassin where he has to rely on burst and sticking on a trade can put him in a horrible position especially if the opponent uses a 'barrier' to block most of your opening damage and can wrek you and said R getting used more like a escape tool then a 'damage tool' might as well get capped off on the health regain so a 'Assassin ekko' can't just repeat 2 more times or so to kill the target and have full health on the 2nd attempt even though he lost like 80% of his health and just instant 'negate it' including anything like ignite the whole ability combo of the opponent, etc.\n\nOR he needs to be made a pure fighter where he needs to stick in a fight longer then EZ jukes and throwing in a few autos, which if he was remade into a pure fighter, using the old strategy currently used with him should result in him dealing neglible damage instead of EZ killing while having too many defensive measures that assassins should not be 'overloaded' with.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Just A Prodigy","date":"2017-06-23T06:58:57.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey man, I'd like to state that Ekko is arguably the most balanced champ in the game, and before you explode in to a million pieces hear me out. Ekko has good wave clear, I will not deny that, because I know that first hand. The issue I'm having is that people think Ekko can do this without giving up a lot of other combat stats. Ekko gets bullied so hard by every meta mid laner right now, IF he doesn't start the game with 45 AP. That means no MR, no scaling CDR, only defensive stat he gets is either flat/scaling health, or flat/scaling armor. Most mid laners right now are AP mages, and well...armor doesn't \"really\" matter against them. Ekko has a telegraphed ulti, and I'm not talking cast time, I mean YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE WHERE HE WILL BE IN 4 SECONDS (if you have vision). Ekko is an assassin yes, and his job is to delete squishies and get out. Sure Ekko has a lot in his kit that makes him insanely mobile and slippery, but his downfall is that he needs set up and to be smart. I've heard \"Ekko stun shouldn't be there, an assassin shouldn't get a stun and shield\", and sure it may seem a little broken at first, but the thing is Ekko needs 3 seconds for that thing to arm itself. 3 seconds where if he's missing you should think \"maybe he's setting up his stun, I should move\". Now on to the point of his Q only applying one stack of his passive. What kind of reasoning is that, if you get hit by both ends of it then you are doing something wrong. He E's in Q's you, alright that's the one time I can sort of see where the issue is that shit hurts I know, but if you're standing in his range as a squishy then you're playing it incorrectly. Would you stand in range of Zed shadow? Or Fizz shark? More than likely no. \n\nNow, don't compare Ekko and Ahri, that actually disgusts me. Ahri has a line CC that will literally stop you in your tracks and make you walk at her, then get double edged Q, with a W to the face, and maybe an ulti charge for your health bar. Ekko has to land a delayed stun if he wants to stun you, then has to get in melee range to get his combo, and to get out the dudes usually gotta burn ulti, an amazing damage tool and his bread and butter escape. That's like a full minute or team fight where the dude can't go in. Then there's the typical \"Just CC him\". That may get annoying to hear, but it works man.\n\nNow on to the original reason you responded to this post. Why shouldn't current Ekko be able to jungle? His slow on passive was why he was considered a broken jungler. His only reliable CC right now is his W, and again that takes 3 seconds to arm, and even then that isn't completely reliable.\n\nI'm sure you'll be thinking my response is very biased, because I'm an Ekko main, and yeah, it is biased, but I've layed down the facts. In higher elos it's not as easy as it may seem my dude. If you're gonna disregard everything I just told you, and still considered Ekko to be busted, then all I can tell you is this my friend. Stay bronze, cause you'll never, and I mean NEVER, climb with that mentality. Fucking comparing Ekko to Ahri, smh.","replies":[]}]}]}
