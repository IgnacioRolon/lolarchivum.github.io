I think the problem with her is her god awful passive, sure you can move around, but canceling AA animations is a big part of being an ADC. I'm also not sure why they decided to make it so where her passive is her movement ability, why not just change one of her base abilities to a dash/blink and then put that ability on her passive, then allow her to cancel auto attacks.  Her w passive ability would be good to move to her passive and then changed to a movement ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Togekiss24","date":"2014-12-17T04:45:19.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista does pretty much everything an ADC SHOULD do except it's inherent to her kit instead of being a honed skill.

It does make sense in terms for a high mobile champ, The hop seems to be mostly used for dodging skill shots if your reaction time is good enough. I played with a friend while using his account (had permission) to see what it was like and I could feel how useful it was against someone like Lucian its just MY reaction time was bad and I could never pull it off but I could feel if I was just a bit faster I could pull it off. I guess what this story is trying to say is her passive Requires a lot of training in timing to get down so it isn't broken its just on a high skill cap.","replies":[]}]}
