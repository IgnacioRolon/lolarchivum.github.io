I've been playing for over 4 years now, and during the championship Riven event i didn't get the skin. But, i did get the season 2 championship summoner icon for it. I kind of doubt it, but will i get Vintage championship Riven? Or just the regular one?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T17:05:49.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe the summoner icon will have any ties with the skin itself.  Meaning, no adjustments or special effects would be made by obtaining her skin on the upcoming release by having the old summoner icon.  Still it will be a great skin either way, and it's pretty awesome you've been a summoner for so long!  Long live on the rift Justce Justin! :D","replies":[]}]}
