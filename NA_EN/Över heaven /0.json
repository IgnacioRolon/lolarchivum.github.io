He is playing the game. He just can't reveal himself or he gets banned. You people asking for him to play just want to see his YouTube, you don't actually care that he is still playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-05-07T04:30:03.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rather than posting him being a nice guy, you post a 7 second clip of him saying he's reformed, and still being upset over it.\n\nI kinda see that clip as him still thinking he was in the right the previous times. That doesn't sound like a repentant soul, it sounds like someone who just wants to say what they think someone else wants to hear so the punishment can be lifted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jingo Jhin","date":"2017-05-07T04:14:45.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only reason Riot doesn't want him streaming League, is because it made them look shitty as a company. Why would someone want a player who calls their teammates trash every game, promote it via streaming? They don't give to shits if he plays the game, what they don't want is people seeing that they're allowing that on stream. Simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-05-07T04:27:29.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's more the promoting his behavior that was the problem. Before he was lifetime banned, I started seeing people coping his behavior in my own games. One of them literally said that if Tyler1 could get away with feeding, so could they.\n\nI don't think he can expect to have the ban lifted in less than 18 months from the time it was issued.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2017-05-07T04:21:47.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everybody deserves at least one chance?

They decided to ban him to further stop him from ruining games and convincing his fans to do the same. He was fun to watch to learn draven, but he actually got really annoying yelling all of the time. It's not worth letting that behavior spread again because it's unfun to play with.\n\nIf he really is reformed, great. Hopefully he'll stay like that for the next game he wants to play. Just let his legacy as once the second best draven and the most toxic league player live on.
