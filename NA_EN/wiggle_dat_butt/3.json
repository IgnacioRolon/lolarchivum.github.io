Especially Warwick, I miss that crazy wolf. However, to bring an item back that makes anybody unkillable who has BotRK and any form of lifesteal is just ridiculous. Not to mention that their damage is so outrageous that they could top the charts participating in only half of the fights. Look at Kayle, this chick can wipe out an entire team in less than 3 seconds with 4 items built including shoes and sated. When is the line going to be drawn?\r\n\r\nI am honestly just sick of Riot coming up with complete unbalanced bullshit, and allowing it to basically be &quot;tested&quot; by giving all these asshat kids freelo. This is supposed to be a game of skill, strategy, and teamwork. It was a game of who can pick Ezreal, and now it&#039;s a game of who can pick Shyvana, Xin, Master Yi, or Kayle. Come the fuck on this really can&#039;t be non-lobotimized human beings coming up with what they call &quot;balance&quot; in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Bloodhawk95","date":"2015-07-12T16:34:23.269+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"was literally about to make a post about it.

Other than that, can't 1v1 shit and my team just gets waxed like a college basketball court","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-07-12T16:47:15.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Lifesteal is nothing to write home about, lol.

Rito definitely did not think this item through. Broken as all hell. I'm definitely not playing ranked until this item gets dismantled. Cuz if youre not playing udyr or another retardedly broken sated devourer jungler, youre team is going to get wrecked. Rito does these things to \"increase champion diversity\", yet b\\c of this OP item there will be no diversity over the next 2 weeks while we wait for the next patch to fix it. Either you play a runeglaive or devourer jungler right now or dont even bother playing ranked","replies":[]}]}
