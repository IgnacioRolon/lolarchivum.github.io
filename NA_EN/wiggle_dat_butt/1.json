Anyways, 8 minutes or so into the game I&#039;m 4-0 and have killed top 3 times and mid once. Bot lane has died 5 times to Vayne Janna as Lucian Taric. Lucian flames me from this point on until the end of the game about 30 minutes in, and constantly tells me to &quot;kill myself,&quot; &quot;shit jungler,&quot; &quot;come bot come bot come bot,&quot; &quot;useless jungle,&quot; while spamming pings the entire game every single time I die or any time I go back and buy while he&#039;s dead.\r\n\r\nThe only things I said were, Lucian the lane is lost she will just kill us all so I&#039;m going to get other lanes fed, and stop being so aggressive and calm down. Everyone on the team was talking shit to him about how much of an asshole he was being, and how I was doing well. \r\n\r\nMy problem is this: if I said ONE SENTENCE back to him of the shit he was saying it me, I would be banned right now. After the game I know at least 3 people reported him, and I still have got no message of punishment and he is on to a new game. Why do you not ban people like this but the second someone retorts, they get banned instead?","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-10-31T00:33:43.981+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have plenty of faith in the behaviour system.\n\nIt is renewed every time I see people falsely claim innocence in Player Behaviour and Moderation with obviously toxic chat logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2016-10-31T14:11:15.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why do you not ban people like this \n\nThey do if there's a pattern of similar behavior.

Reports and what they do aside, there is just horrid behavior that continually permeates nearly EVERY game we get into and I think it stems from a lack of communication and a lack of understanding of the game.\n\nSimply, we don't have enough time to teach someone the game in one game.  So \"Can you please ward the tribush and shove the lane and run down to mid to help with a gank because that's what needs to happen since I just ganked top and we forced a recall\" (or whatever) becomes \"WTF, shit top\" (after mid gets rekt, and no one wants to take the time to explain why).\n\nPoor example maybe but I hope you get the point.\n\nI'm hoping RIOT has taken a turn toward helping people understand the game and how to play it.
