It is mandatory for champions such as {{champion:90}} and {{champion:96}} who are squishy, immobile, and have no self peel. But not every champion absolutely needs Flash to the same level as those two. For example, sometimes I use Ghost/Ignite on {{champion:8}}. This is because Vlad is tanky, has self peel, sustain - so he has enough safety to forgo Flash in favor of Ghost, which actually gives him the power needed to chase some targets. Some people don't know, but one of Vladimir's main weakness is that because he has short range, it is difficult for him to stick to targets that have an higher range than him or are mobile.\n\nOther champions that do not need Flash as much: {{champion:120}} (in fact, most people play him with Ignite/Teleport), {{champion:35}}, {{champion:77}}, and believe on me: {{champion:105}}.

If this happened, it would have to be part of preseason to give Riot time to rebalance the outliers.  I still think the extra possibilities it opens up could be worth it.  Summoner spells are supposed to help customize the champion to your playstyle and team composition, but the worthwhile choices are so constrained that they pretty much fail at their intended purpose.  I think making Flash free could help get them back on track.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-06-30T14:50:56.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or let it also reveals stealth traps/champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-07-01T00:01:52.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CV + Oracle's Lens on the supprot = have fun playing non-Evelynn stealth champions in a teamfight brah.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Verandure","date":"2015-06-30T07:55:22.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another option would be to passively increase sight radius while clairvoyance is on cooldown. \n\nIt's weird, because it'd be the only Summoner Spell with a passive effect, but clairvoyance simply can't compete with the Farsight Orb in its current state. \n\nA similar treatment could be given to Clarity and Barrier as well (though I can't think of what to do with barrier.
