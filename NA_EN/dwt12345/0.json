While I'm going to miss wondering why his Roger's so jolly, this update just adds some much needed depth to not only him, but Bilgewater as a whole. Before, we were just told that GP could become Pirate King if he wanted to, but that wasn't really reflected in what we saw in-game (jolly energetic pirate who liked fighting). BUT NOW, THANK THE MOTHER SERPENT, AND HAIL GANGPLANK! He truly fits the bill, in terms of personality AND appearance. Hell, he'll meticulously scrimshaw a man's leg to make sure no one strays against him. And probably the part I love the most about him is behind this tough facade is still a man who feels pain and such, but is still able to keep up his image for his followers. Gosh, now I'm just gushing, but I really can't wait to see him action again and just keep learning bout him and Bilgewater as a whole.

I'm assuming this event is canon, so there has to be another act or something.  I could be wrong but just killing off GP without some sort of grim \"or is he\" is kinda strange.  MF went from charming bounty hunter that I think had been friends or at least competitive rivalry with GP to vindictive revenge seeking woman on a mission.  All is forgiven between TF and Graves? While I find it a believable situation for reconciliation seems like a strange choice, certainly makes for interesting possibilities between the two criminals.\n\nQualms/Minor Grievances\n   - lack of MF development, just really sudden BAM here she is\n   - Tahm/Nautilus wHERE?!
