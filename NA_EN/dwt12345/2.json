There's a lot of cool stuff his paladin ish sort of theme could support that at present isn't being done too well (his ult for example's really powerful, but pretty flat, both in terms of ability to make skilled plays and in terms of appreciability of power).","replies":[{"poster":"Kinky Rhydon","date":"2014-11-20T02:48:30.784+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nail on the head.

It sounds fitting and since it's not done often I figured he can have his own unique item/trinket, like a bone tooth necklace where Rengar enjoys buffs on stacks. Only on assists, Taric would be able to increase armor and MR on allies, as well as buff AD/AP in higher stacks, increased ward vision, more potent heals, CDR, etc. It has to be gem themed! Basically a unique buff for all colors. Like for every assist he'll get 1-3 stacks and with those stacks he'll craft gems into something visually significant (his shield, his aura, his weapon, etc.) and at a max cap he'll have each and every gem on display, and each gem is designated to their own respective buffs. Something like that would be cool, and personally, if this idea comes into fruition, I will definitely consider being a Taric main (which is something I never thought I'd say)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tspiggs","date":"2014-11-20T03:21:13.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you mess up Armor of the 5th age, i will call my friend Liam Neeson.
