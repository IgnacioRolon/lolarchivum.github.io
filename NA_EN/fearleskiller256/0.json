Every time I will see a black screen and my mouse which I am not able to move. Before this problem started 1 or 2 days ago I was able to play lol perfectly fine, so I have no clue what happened, because I didn't press any button in order to cause this. Sadly for some reason this happens every time and I have no idea how to fix it... I currently have a week of vacation and would love to spend it playing lol :(","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-28T23:33:25.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Fearleskiller256,\n\nGive Riot's Connection KB a try and see if that fixes your issues up.
