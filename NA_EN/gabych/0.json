We was flaming eachother for the rest of the game and then my teammate said &quot;go kill yourself ryze&quot;. So the point is : I got a chat ban after 5 minutes for &quot;being toxic&quot; , but that teammate who urged me to kill my self and the rest of the team didn&#039;t get even a chat ban , how is that fair? I&#039;m actually sick of playing anymore , cause you can&#039;t try new champs without getting flamed and people can&#039;t understand everyone have bad games.By the way if you say something to a troller you will get banned , but what about him?{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}
