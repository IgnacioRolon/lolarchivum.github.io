I remember it being a rather sunny day. On this lazy Sunday morning,   I created a league of legends account. One of my friends had asked me to because they were going to start playing it again. I remember getting a \"Welcome to League of Legends\" e-mail and everything. I logged in once when I downloaded the game that afternoon, and then immediately closed the game, it was going to be something I would do on my free time, not when I had many assignments to get started on for the upcoming week. \r\n\r\nUpon much convincing, I decided to finally try this game out today, December 5th. I figured I might as well update to the beta client so I don't get used to an older one, only for it to change. I tried logging in once it was finished, and it said my account was permanently suspended. \r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's a glitch,\" I thought, as I was noticing something about transfering accounts over. I tried again, same thing. \r\n\r\nIt was at that moment I had decided to try logging in on the older launcher/client, the one I could log into before. I redownloaded it, and tried to log in again. \r\n\r\nYour account has been permanently suspended, check your e-mail for details. My e-mail associated with the account has a \"Welcome to League of Legends\" e-mail and a \"Verify your e-mail address\" e-mail. \r\n\r\nHow peculiar.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T23:02:25.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ouch, that's certainly not the welcome that you were looking for!
