He just stands there and claps his hands to nothing. Now before you say &quot;You can&#039;t recall in ARAM.&quot;... you can still press b to do the animation.  If you do Star Guardian Lux&#039;s recall in ARAM it does the music for her recall animation.

When he sits still he floats forwards every 7 second or so. When he floats fowards (while sitting still) he enters into a weird transparent box.You can sort of see the edges of it in this [screenshot I took](http://imgur.com/a/516Yx). But it's much easier to see in your own client. Another bug!\n\nEdit: This happens when he's facing southwest. Not sure if it happens every direction.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-19T22:18:44.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyyy again! \n\nOkay, so cool news, the audio should be fixed up by next patch. ^-^ Lemme look into that Teemo thing!","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Fury","date":"2017-05-20T10:13:33.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:79}} Sweet.
