You'd just throw it out cause it's free and it's good. There's CLEARLY many instances where you'd rather use Pow-Pow (wearing down tanks, dueling, split pushing a turret, quickly finishing off a turret) and CLEARLY instances where you'd rather use Fishbones (when you need to reach something but don't want to/can't be within 525 range to do so), so their damage isn't absurd because it doesn't overshadow the rest of her kit. It fits nicely within it with its own set of weaknesses. That's what I was trying to get across.\n\nAnd NO SHIT they're ideal for team fights. Her usual range is freaking 525 with extremely limited escaped options. Why on Earth would you go into a team fight with Pow-Pow? You start with Fishbones, then clean up with Pow-Pow and her passive.

Jinx has no escapes. This \"advice\" is just bait to get low elo players slain by dashing/blinking/jumping/hooking engages. Now, you SHOULD shoot and move, but don't make it look like you're gonna escape a charging Garen or something just because you're stutter stepping.\n\nAnywho, if you don't have good attack speed, you're gonna get 1-2 rockets off before you're done shooting. In games, the best cc is death. Splashing their whole team a few times is cute, but if no one dies, nothing was accomplished. Bursting one target down with more attack speed and slightly lower range on someone like Cait/Ashe/Trist is technically more effective than throwing out sluggish aoes UNLESS someone actually dies from the aoes. It's a give and take. If Jinx is safe, but doesn't kill anyone, what's the point? Now we're making it even harder for someone with no escapes...to land kills?

To be honest there is no con to using it other than not being able to DPS fast enough, which is why she has minigun form. The benefits of using Rocket form is just too high.

Her passive means if her team starts to win the fight it's an ace, and she is almost guaranteed to be out if the team is losing as long as one kill happens, and her minigun form lets her take towers faster than just about anyone in the game.\n\nWhile she may have a reasonable win rate because of her lack of mobility, and doesn't see a ton of competitive play, she just outclasses so many of the other ADCs in terms of damage and utility (multi-target snare, very long ranged poke + a slow, faster turret removal, and a global execute).\n\nLucian getting hammered was deserved initially, but IMO, they went about it the wrong way. He's too feast/famine now because of the short range. The biggest problem with him was his passive: getting double autos and an AA reset after every ability gave him obscene burst at all points in the game; toning the second auto down to 30-50% damage based on level or ult rank would have been a reasonable thing to test initially rather than  a range reduction. Aside from that, his E should never have removed slows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dannykun","date":"2015-08-29T02:29:08.682+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hayaishi2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jAi03V0N,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-29T02:05:54.304+0000)\n>\n> I'm more fed up with Jinx, she's been relevant ever since release and Riot refuse to give her a meaningful nerf, yet they don't think twice when it comes to hammering Lucian.\n\nGranted Lucian needed the hammering, he was in every single game from release because he's able to capitalize too heavily on anything and everything in the shop.
