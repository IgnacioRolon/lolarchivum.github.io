I fail to see how having no effective defensive options is any different than not being able to cc olaf.  The difference is that olaf's immunity turns off after a few seconds, whereas vayne's true damage does not.  \n\nI think broken works fine for a champ that spams %maxHP true damage, has a 2 second cd combat stealth/reposition and a point and click knockback/stun.  This champion has so many good things on her kit, and is, by virtue of having that stupid true damage, way too good at dealing with tanks, who are are basically %%%%ed as soon as vayne is locked in if they don't have a point and click cc and a team with good followup.  If the % damage wasn't enough, she's got flat true damage too just in case she can't kill you in the duration of her stun for some reason.  If she wants to shred tanks, that's fine, but she shouldn't just win a fight with anyone who can't reliably cc her.  You can't nerf the stealth in any meaningful way without mechanical changes.  The dash can't get much shorter, and increasing its cd would likely make her unplayable in teamfights.  Per passive also makes her impossible to run from, but she also gets access to more disengage than any carry should have.\n\nSo yeah, she's %%%%ing broken.  She is a champ who will never both be, and appear balanced.  She will always hard counter tanks unless she loses enough true damage to be legitimately terrible.  She will always hard counter skill shots because of her tumble being on a laughably low cd.  She will always destroy squishies in her current state because of the duration of her cc and all the free stats she gets when she ults, in addition to the flat true damage.  If it weren't for her lack of wave clear or her low range, this champion would be damn close to perfect.\n\nOn top of that, her numbers are %%%%ing stupid.  Aside from draven and morde, she's got the highest AD scaling of any ADC, and she has one of the higher base attack speeds in addition to the highest attack speed scale in the game, for the highest attack speed at 18.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-08-31T23:08:26.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boy, any champion is broken and overpowered when you inflate their kit to ridiculous degrees. \n\nVayne isn't broken, she has many aspects to be changed and tweaked that allow her to function in a healthy state, while the champions I mentioned are left intentionally in a nerfed state because their kits are unable to be balanced in any way. \n\nBroken is being used haphazardly now for any champions someone dislikes instead of the actual meaning Riot is using.\n\nShe really hasn't received any meaningful changes the last few years, minor buff here and their but nothing significant, but was regarded as being fine before hand.\n\nWhat's changed is the champions that were keeping her in this state got nerfed and Meddler has acknowledged that already.
