Now I have a 30 minute cooldown. I keep getting punished for your broken ass client. It happened before, got low priority que from your server mess ups a few weeks ago, now I'm on cooldown from abandoning champ select. I didn't take a screenshot because I panicked and tried to get back to champ select as soon as I could. God damn guys. In your efforts to stump toxic players etc, you're ruining players who have been playing for years and years. Fix your shit.\n\n[Gyazo Link](https://gyazo.com/2035c42fd1b439c286dd70503d32ea66)","replies":[{"poster":"Urethra","date":"2017-03-31T15:29:46.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened again, and I did have my client open for about 5 hours.

If you reload every client after a match I found it works. But if you have been afk for awhile with your client open...reload the client...cause it will give you the error.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-28T18:07:02.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The create to fail dump error happens if your bugsplat fails to grab logs for you.  There was probably another error message that was missed regarding losing connection to champion select.  This is a pretty frustration situation, and I'd like to help!  Your network might be unsable, so it's losing connection to champion select and leaving you behind.  You should go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, and test it out in a custom game. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
