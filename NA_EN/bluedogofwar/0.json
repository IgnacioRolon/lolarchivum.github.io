I&#039;m just imagining how hilarious it would be to have 5 Jinxs or Ezreals all ulting at the same time every 15 seconds or the intensity of 5 v 5 Nidalee U.R.F in one lane\r\n\r\nthank you for reading","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-10-26T04:47:31.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5v5 nidalee URF. Make it more intense. Every Nid has 2000 AP and no MR.

The escalation is real! Well... might need to add a lot more minions to stack that.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-10-26T06:30:59.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no no no, the idea is that you can walk into the lane at minute 1 and get one-shot.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-26T06:45:07.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But... but... escalation...\n\nIf you're gonna be that way about it, why not just give everyone 1 health?","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-10-26T23:26:40.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because then you'd get auto'd and one-shot. no counterplay aside from stay away. However, it's also really scary having the \"I have 1300 hp and then just got deleted instantly\" situation.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-26T23:46:18.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q-range >>> auto-range. Besides, I dunno man, I like to live life on the edge. Minionssassination op. I say we give minions 1 hp too btw. Just give EVERYTHING 1 hp. The game would be all about creating formations to prevent anyone from ninja-flashing close into to a tower to one-shot it.\n\nOf course, most of those games might only last 5 minutes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
