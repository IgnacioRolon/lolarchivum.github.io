We just went through a terrible tragedy. We lost our house and everything we owned. Our garage caught fire, I immediately called 911. No one came! I sat with my 7 year old son and 12 year old daughter and we watched our house burn to the ground. Firefighters didnt show up for 30 minutes. We lost everything. I'm calling out for help from all my fellow players. I may not be the best at league or a pro but I love this game and our community. Anything would be grateful, I'm on Facebook or skype if anyone needs to contact me. Also my phone number is 8304334699, if anyone lives in the area of Seguin Texas and has any spare clothes or food anything would help at this moment. Please Share this , I don't care about anything for myself, I just want my kids to feel safe and secure.
