Runeglaive is able to turn the entire attack into magic damage like Poppy&#039;s Q, This is also a change that every Lichbane user would benefit from. Why does Lichbane not do this too? Very very few people get Essence  Reaver either, but when both of these effects were applied to runeglaive, people are considering running smite in lane on the like of Ezreal, AP Gangplank, and the likes. These two are probably the biggest examples of a sub-build with viability that would want to use Lichbane, but Runeglaive gives them waaaaay too much instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-27T21:50:53.192+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because then runeglaive  would be totally useless.\n\nAnd honestly, unless they buff it's ap, it still struggles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-06-27T19:27:52.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"runeglaive is like a closer cousin to ludens you have to think of it in this manner. \nif lichbane was spell effect it could spellvamp which you absolutely cannot have unless you did something to it....\n\n\nahem: see this solution. \nhere's how a dynamic lichbane would look like: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ie1gASUh.jpg\n\nit could spellvamp off of equation 1 but not 2 even though it could still do equation 2 worth of damage. \n\nas an on hit effect and one that scales with deathcap (ap's equivalent to IE), it'd be as though you could spell vamp off crits. there's a reason lifesteal is less than spellvamp since spells are gated by cooldown of spells. \nCrits while not classified as such, are a close cousin to on hit effects. If anything lich bane's on hit effect resembles crits closer than they do regular spells. \n\nludens has charges too which gates its ability to spellvamp. \n\nSay we were to implement this suggested improvement to spellvamp i posted here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/TaXPYTao-spellvamp-100-scale-on-aoe-but-with-100-cap-as-thoughwas-singletargetoverlap-w-current-equation\n\nruneglaive would likely op since it would sustain at 100% value as well. so you'd have to apply this dynamic feature to it as well. \n\nits doable for sure but riot needs to approve/be behind it.\n\nor perhaps items could just behave in their own unique way and just sustain off 33% if aoe.
