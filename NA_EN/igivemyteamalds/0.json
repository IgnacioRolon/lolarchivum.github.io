Heck you should be taking any mode seriously, as the point in all the modes is to win.

Everyone including everyone on this thread has said something worse than anything you said in this report. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who did not at some point break the summoners code. Your problem here is the consistency of your comments. You obviously were flaming your team as well as the enemy team in a manner that was unnecessary for any level of play let alone a normal game. From this exchange alone it is easy to see that this is your normal behavior and is underscored by you running to the boards to play the victim. \n\nBTW Rito does not give two week bans for a first offense, especially not one like this. You obviously are not telling the whole truth about this ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-10-05T10:55:48.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao, toxic af. \n\nAnd you thought if you shared this we would agree with you??

I would definately call that harassment and worth a 10 game chat restrict.\n\nAssuming you didn't get two chat restricts beforehand, the thing that escalated you to a suspension was use of the word \"retarded\".\n\nThat being said, I would heavily suggest not typing unless it is something purely objective and productive. Things like \"MF flash down\", or \"dragon up in 20\".\n\nIf you dont think you can do that then just mute everybody. Keep in mind your next punishment will be a perma ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2016-10-05T13:34:03.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"deserved. feels good to know that you wont get ranked rewards. they only show your side because its the only relevant one. its what you write and if you have yourself under control not what others do","replies":[]}]}
