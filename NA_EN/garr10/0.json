I Guess I Should not queue up because my ISP could have a outage and its my fault because I chose to get internet from the only ISP in the area. That's stupid. Automating a system to punish people is stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Aloexx Ratfoot","date":"2017-08-23T18:38:23.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question... did you leave the game before it was over?... Answer... Yes.\n\nThe reason doesnt matter, and you dont get leaverbusted over a single game.. To get this punishment you had to have left multiple games in a short period of time.  Meaning you either rage quit a lot, or you have a lot of connection issues.  Either way this ruins the game for 9 other people and you keep doing it.  Fix your shit or get punished.  its really not that hard of a concept...","replies":[]}]}]}]}
