He's meticulous and calculating - League's slowest marksman yet. But when the murderous artist gets you in his sights, when he catches you off-guard, there's not much that'll save you from an inevitable, perfect death.","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-reveal-jhin-virtuoso","image":"http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/pages/2016/january/jhin/img/Jhin_E.jpg"},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"EDIT: Welp. I was wrong. For those of you who have not heard, Jhin is confirmed as a Ionian criminal, who was broken out of jail by shadowy elements in their high council. Thanks for commenting. I'm glad I managed to convince a lot of you with my assorted evidences that he was Demacian!\n\n\nFull Disclosure: I am not the first one post this idea. I did, however, come up with it independently. I&#039;ll try to link in as many other threads as I find.\n\n     The first Demacian connection I saw was Jhin&#039;s color scheme in the leaked splash. White and gold are the traditional Demacian colors, and he is practically festooned in them.\n\n     After that, I got to thinking. There has not been a new champion from either Noxus or Demacia for quite a while (Lucian was the last, and he is not very strongly associated with Demacia). That can moderately affect his providence, especially if you consider the recent expansions in the Pilovian and Zuanite champion pools. As par of that, Demacia&#039;s characters are all very much the same on live: Goody-goodies with a fairly similar views on honor, justice, and all that. In contrast, their enemy Noxians have proven to have quite a variety of morals, from the sinister Black Rose, to the loyal Du Couteaus, and the idealistic Riven. A &#039;evil&#039; Demacian would make sense from Riot&#039;s perspective, as he would be a unique character.\n\n     However, the most interesting, and solid piece of evidence in favor of Jhin being Demacian comes from his recent champion reveal. At the very end of the detonation of Jhin&#039;s E (Captive Audience), a flower symbol appears. However, I do not think that is just _any_ flower. Observe the following:\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/1KaUBPr/new\nhttp://tinyurl.com/JhinTheory1\nThe similarity was striking to me. Perhaps Jhin is Fiora&#039;s disgraced father? The crazy uncle they never talk about? To say anything at this point is pure speculation, of course.\n\n\n**Credit Where Credit is Due**\nHere is all the other threads which support this theory:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/jqEY7aM2-the-jhin-connection-people-seem-to-ignore\nThis thread compares the art of Jhin and Lucian and suggests that they might both be connected to Demacian purifiers.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/U0L5FZj8-jhin-related-to-fiora-look-here\nSomeone else drew the Laurent connection by comparing Fiora&#039;s Splash with Jhin&#039;s release art.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/Eu915WsB-jhin-outfit-reminds-me-a-bit-of-fioras\nAnother Laurent connection. This time, it is the outfits are compared.\n\nTell me if you find more!

It's plausible that Jihn attempted to follow the same path Foria did in restoring honor to his name and family, and failed miserably at it and becoming horrible injured as a consequence, therefore his name and house was exiled as punishment. He could have gone independent, and possibly had contacts in other global cities such as Zaun and Piltover, where he began his plan to make things beautiful and picked up everything he needed from these locations.\n\nAlso, to call oneself 'The Virtuoso' screams Demacian arrogance.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-01-13T07:27:47.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Furor Nexis,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=I6IAMOMx,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-01-13T00:05:36.286+0000)\n>\n> Also, to call oneself 'The Virtuoso' screams Demacian arrogance.\n\nBut Piltover is also seen as rather arrogant and they have the technology for his equipment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2016-01-13T01:53:35.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the flower looks like a black rose :0.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2016-01-12T23:07:05.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if they want us to think that and he's actually from **BLACK ROSE**?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CAESARRRRRRRR","date":"2016-01-12T23:04:25.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I think Fiora and Jhin are friends or allies?
