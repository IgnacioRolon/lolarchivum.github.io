Mages were mages and were playable, adc were adc and were playable. There were also a small number of assassins who kept meta at bay. \n\nEverything started to go downhill when RIOT decided to shift their attention primarily to E-Sports. More speed, more action and interaction made big number of old-school champs and meta unplayable, champs and meta which made this game so popular in the first place. \n\nSame happen with StarCraft. Original SC:BW game was so fun for casuals that it naturally became E-Sports. SC2  was primarily made for E-Sports in mind and therefore it never reached expectations despite it&#039;s early hype. Unfortunately, LOL blinded by its early success now walks the same path.  Players are  leaving this game. In fact, Internet traffic for LOL went down to 30% of what it was back in  2015. LOL still speaks about big number of &quot;unique players&quot;, while in fact everybody have at least 2 - 3 alternative accounts and if you tried to level new account you noticed that most of them are smurfs too.  There is a reason why LOL introduced new MISSION: &quot;Teach a Friend&quot; - because there aren&#039;t enough new players to play this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-08-09T13:46:33.281+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Old school champions typically had kits that were extremely simply and prone to being highly volatile with the slightest changes.

Developers didn't care that much about 0.1% players base who represented E-Sports either. There were 3 bans for each team to veto broken champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-08-09T15:10:28.028+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sure, the developer views have changed, but the game is still fun in most scenarios, and the bans _only recently_ got increased to 10 after overwhelming player requests for it, and it wasn't just from eSports, it was casuals too, and everyone in between.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-09T15:32:05.086+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it also just made sense as 3 bans since the beginning, but now there were triple the champions since the original.

Everything was tankier, no 1 shot bullshit like you get now. Even assassins didn't get to 1 shot ADC, because you'd see an ADC typically have a GA or Banshee's. Tanks were actually tanky but couldn't nuke anyone late game, yet you couldn't totally ignore Amumu because he'd **eventually** cry your team to death. Eventually.  That was fair.  Assassins had to play around the tanks, just burst through them with armor pen+lethality like they do now but at least they didn't instant explode because they'd build a little defense as well. Everything was fine then, until damage fking creep.","replies":[{"poster":"Stevev45","date":"2018-08-09T18:08:36.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a lot of 1 shot in the early seasons.
