Free speech\n> [...]\n> 6. Its brash and not nice---- but that doesn&#x27;t mean its worth a third party getting involved to take away their right to play.\n\nI'd like to first focus on these two things, since you clearly do not understand how rights work:\nFree speech means you have the right to voice your opinion. Apart from the fact that even free speech has limits, this right **only** guarantees you that the **government** won't punish you for voicing your opinion. If Riot somehow got the real life police to arrest you for something you said, **then** you could cite free speech.\nAnd playing the game? That's not even a right to begin with. You don't have a right to a private company providing a service to you.\n\nAnd in all honesty, this is by far the biggest source of problems with online toxicity. It always comes down to the same thing: entitlement.\nYou are neither entitled to playing this game nor are you entitled to Riot giving you a platform for your \"free speech\".\n\nAs for the rest of your points:\n\nMost people don't \"choose\" being offended by things. If you can consciously choose your own emotions, cool, but most people can't.\n\nMute is an after-the-fact band-aid fix that only serves to mitigate the effect of flaming. It neither fixes the actual problem, nor can it prevent it unless people sacrifice the social aspect of the game completely by preemptively muting everybody.\nMuting is a workaround, not a solution.\n\n\"It's not sexist, racist or homophobic\" does not mean \"it's good\". In fact, using this as a way to relativize something makes it sound pretty bad.\nI mean... if you heard somebody closing a story with \"Well, at least Steve is in a stable condition\" you wouldn't exactly assume the story was about how Steve won the lottery.\n\nAnd as for the \"misleading\" statement on negativity:\nNobody here has said that there exists a negative statement that is acceptable (even though there probably are many that by themselves will not be persecuted).\nWhat The Djinn said was to use **less** negative statements. Right off the bat: That includes positive statements. Positive is less negative.\nThe system does, however, also differentiate between different levels of negativity, so something **less** negative is absolutely **more** acceptable and **less** punishable.\nSaying \"gg ez\" is less negative than \"you're a fucking idiot\", which in turn is less negative than \"I hope you die in a fire\".","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2017-12-02T19:38:47.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"you're literally just repeating what others have said I shouldn't go read other things and you'll get most of what my response would be to the whole thread\n\nWe should stay away from free speech topic, we're clearly not going to come into a range of agreement there because I don't agree with assigning criminality to words even if their intolerant, ignorant or spiteful.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you  and everyone else keep taking what you feel is the moral high ground.

Dong Huap made a video about how broken the system is. Essentially, the automated system can&#x27;t tell the difference between a feeder and a bad game, so it won&#x27;t take action against them. The only thing that -does- happen is how seriously the bot takes you goes down. So, unless someone is breaking the rules in chat, don&#x27;t waste your time.\n\nIf you report a feeder it will get reviewed.  No need to insult.  Don't even need to say you are reporting.","replies":[{"poster":"ALittleBlueGuy69","date":"2017-12-02T21:36:53.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot does not review cases unless requested to do so or if it's for a permaban.
