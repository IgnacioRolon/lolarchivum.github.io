I am unsure if that night a patch was released or not, I wasn't completely paying attention to that fact.\r\n\r\nSince the game I played the evening of the 11th (as Leona), my latency will start around 100, go down to 70, ROCKET up to 400 (which is where the lag spike occurs), then slowly but surely simmer back down to about 70 (over the course of 8 seconds), and rocket back up to 400. It repeats this way to no end and makes it impossible for me to play games against other people confidently. It has nothing to do with my background apps (I play with spotify open as I always have, I've taken it on test runs in practice without anything open and this still occurs). I've turned down all of my qualities in game (shadows, animations, etc.) and even let my computer have the night and a full day off. Nothing I can control changes this and it began out of practically nowhere. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T05:10:45.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm if those lag spikes are coming in 'waves' like that, it might a specific type of 'lag' called packet loss. Packet loss happens when your connection runs into some issues when it's traveling to servers and it loses bits of data or becomes damaged along the way. Do me a favor and run a quick traceroute to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and post the results here so I can take a look with you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YohanasChimpo","date":"2017-12-13T07:51:14.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: Repatched then reinstalled to no further progression.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YohanasChimpo","date":"2017-12-13T05:52:13.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is another reading after a few more minutes\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                10.0.0.1 -    0 |  203 |  203 |    4 |  254 | 2732 |   26 |\n|                          96.120.104.233 -    2 |  196 |  194 |    0 |  247 | 2699 |   16 |\n|xe-0-2-1-sur01.shphrdstwn.wv.bad.comcast.net -    1 |  198 |  197 |    0 |  255 | 2570 |   58 |\n|ae-74-ar01.whitemarsh.md.bad.comcast.net -    1 |  198 |  197 |    0 |  253 | 2549 |   32 |\n|be-33657-cr02.newyork.ny.ibone.comcast.net -    0 |  201 |  201 |   19 |  250 | 2450 |   48 |\n|be-10396-pe01.60hudson.ny.ibone.comcast.net -    1 |  198 |  197 |    0 |  255 | 2550 |   42 |\n|                          50.248.116.202 -    0 |  201 |  201 |   18 |  258 | 2438 |   57 |\n|                          104.160.132.35 -    0 |  201 |  201 |   18 |  255 | 2419 |   41 |\n|          ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  201 |  201 |   33 |  269 | 2528 |   73 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 |  198 |  197 |    0 |  274 | 2519 |   45 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[]},{"poster":"YohanasChimpo","date":"2017-12-13T05:49:26.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be completely honest with you, I've never done something like this before..
