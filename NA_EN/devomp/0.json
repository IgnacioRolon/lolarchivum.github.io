How do you know if you&#039;re any good at this game? Do you judge yourself on your Kill/Death/Assist ratio, win loss record, the letter grade you&#039;re given after every game, or some other way?\r\n\r\nMy win loss record is above 50% (89-69, I think that&#039;s 56%), so that&#039;s good, I must not be awful, but after some games I honestly don&#039;t know if I did well.\r\n\r\nAnd I should have different expectations for myself for every role, right? If I&#039;m support, it&#039;s acceptable to have few kills, more deaths, but a ton of assists? ADC should have a ton of kills? etc.?\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
