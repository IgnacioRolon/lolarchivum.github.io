Could it be drivers? If so how would I fix it? I wouldn't think that it is a hardware problem because it happens at the exact same time every time I try to play, but typically software problems don't cause hard crashes like this. I did not have this problem before patch 6.19. Could 6.19 have caused this problem? My computer is not even 2 years old.\n\nThings I have tried:\nSystem restore to before the last time I played and it worked. \nun-install re install(before and after the system restore)\nFull virus scan\nRepair league of legends\n\nI am using a dell laptop with 8 gigs ram and an integrated graphics card. IDK if that is significant.\nI would appreciate any suggestions or knowledge.\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T17:13:11.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, this is likely caused by the Xbox game bar that was recently updated to enable a feature called *Game DVR*.
