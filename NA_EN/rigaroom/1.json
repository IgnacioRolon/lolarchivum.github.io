Then to the second game immediately, my game just crashed and when I tried to reconnected, it said that my game has corrupted files ? If my game is corrupted, it supposed to crash in the first game right ? If I knew that my game/client have problems and still played, I deserved a ban. But this, I thought my game/client was ok then suddenly crash and corrupted from nowhere, and now I will have to wait for my punishment ( I'm writing this while wait for my client to fix ). Riot pls","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T22:12:54.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the client recognized game files, it will run a repair to fix everything up.  This may take a few moments!  I highly recommend testing things out in a custom game to make sure that whatever was causing the issue is fixed to prevent further penalties.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
