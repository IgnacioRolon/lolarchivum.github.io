I did check my internet, router, etc, none of them fix. Infact, yesterday I played like more than 10 games and around 8th or 9th I lost my connection, I couldn't connect. It was very frustrating for me, and again I did check my internet, to the point where yesterday I watched youtube while waiting to be connect (it was around 15 min, my team surr at 40 min)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T18:25:49.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find any issues with the server.
