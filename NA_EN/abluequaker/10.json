Not AP Assassin. Not TriForce. Not Tank. Not Off-Tank. AP Bruiser. It did what I wanted and fulfilled the gameplay fantasy I desired.\n\nIt&#039;s not that he&#039;s OP. It&#039;s not that he&#039;s useless. It&#039;s that he has an incredibly annoying early game and an almost non-existent late game.\n\nFizz was actually fine before Riot decided to rework him. His last lot of changes had brought him in line and he had reasonable scaling. He could be punished in lane, he could win certain matchups, and he was fairly relevant throughout the game. More importantly, regardless of whether he was AD, AP or Hybrid, he dealt damage fairly proportionate to the damage items he built.\n\nHis W and Q still worked relatively well with TriForce/IBG builds, he could do a bunch of off-meta builds (Gunblade Rylai&#039;s was a favourite of mine) and the conventional Lichbane Glass Cannon build was actually reasonably healthy.\n\nYou know, this isn&#039;t Season 2/3 anymore. There are plenty of champions capable of peeling him off carries, and enough carries with reliable mobility to counteract Fizz&#039;s.\n\nFizz didn&#039;t need the huge change he got. He would be right around Ekko&#039;s level of power right now if Riot at least play-tested his Old Kit with some of the reworked items for a while.\n\nRiot&#039;s sitting there messing around with his R when that&#039;s not even the god damn issue. His W is stupid. It&#039;s a weird last-hitting tool, but also his primary damage outside of R, but it&#039;s so delayed that it becomes impractical when you look at the likes of Zed/Talon/Ekko et al.\n\nPlease consider pulling a Kog&#039;maw and revert otherwise you&#039;ll still be tinkering with stuff (that didn&#039;t need changing) 8 months from now.\n\nI&#039;m not saying Fizz is OP or weak. I&#039;m saying his rework is unhealthy and unrewarding. You could put in the same amount of effort on similar champs with a much higher rate of success.","replies":[{"poster":"Åeolus","date":"2017-03-29T16:54:56.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":20,"body":"Land your r level 6 and you get a kill.

They not only made him MORE unhealthy, they made people hate him more too\n\nThey deleted his potential assassination combos by forcing him to hit a max range ult. There is no other order you can attack since you must gap close after using r, and you want the w passive to be ready to pop when you get on them\n\nHis entire kit is currently \"did you hit r\"\n\nAnd since the size/latch changes made it look like it wasnt going to hit and then did, everyone hated him even more","replies":[{"poster":"Hunted9000","date":"2017-03-30T14:49:54.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"To be fair his ult is on such a low cd that waiting for your R to assassinate a target isn't asking too much.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf76109271","date":"2017-03-30T17:26:00.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It made every melee matchup mid go from fine and skill based to completely unplayable. Plus it make you ask the question, why arent i playing a melee mid which can do well with just their basic abilities? Zed kat yasuo ekko\n\nIt is not realistically possible to hit a kat, zed, ekko or yasuo with your fish at max range if they just have vision of you while laning there. \n\nWhich means they jump on you melee range, you either weak ult or smack them to start w timer, they deal damage for 1.5 seconds and then escape before you can w active. \n\nYou lose all trades against them if they just dont let you max range ult or pop w. Which isnt hard to do with the mobility those champions have. Fizz has mobility but has to use e during trade and wont have it up again. So why ever play fizz. Just play one of those, who function without ult, but dont auto lose against other high mobility champions","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2017-03-29T22:32:25.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fizz will never be balanced while his W exists.\nIt's a dps ability on an assassin, forcing so much - too much - of his power to be dumped into his E.\nHe needs another damage-spell so he can have his power budget more evenly distributed.","replies":[]}]}
