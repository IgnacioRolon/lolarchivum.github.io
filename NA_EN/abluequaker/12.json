I'm saying the problem is that they don't think trolling is a problem, not that it doesn't occur. In rito land it is perfectly fine to pick Annie as last pick, even though Mid has been called, run down mid lane feeding saying, \"lulz itz jus a gayme nuub has fuun\"...in a ranked game. But, it's not ok to ask this person to stop trolling, because \"it ruins their fun\". I've actually seen this exact situation take place. The person also had a match history full of doing the same thing, yet no punishment. I'm just waiting for the day that Lyte gets his head outta his ass and realizes that this is what causes the \"toxicity\" of the community. Because until it's addressed, League will continue to get more toxic, just as it has done since he started \"fixing\" it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-07-20T17:00:21.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">In rito land it is perfectly fine to pick Annie as last pick, even though Mid has been called, run down mid lane\n\nIf their team doesn't want a second mid player, then it is reportable for \"refusing to communicate\".","replies":[{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-07-20T20:47:39.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is ignored.
