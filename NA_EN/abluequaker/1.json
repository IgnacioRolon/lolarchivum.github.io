I'm a University Student who is currently completing a Bachelor of Contemporary Music. I like to listen to a lot of Alternative music (usually pretty clean, but I've developed my taste to the point that I quite enjoy a lot of heavier stuff immensely) so I'd say my favourite music to have come out of LoL would be the Vi & Jinx (the Jinx login theme actually got me into Djerv and a few similar bands) theme songs as well as a lot of the hallowing login themes.\n\nTo the Rioters who removed this yesterday - this is me introducing myself specifically to this area of the forums and getting a feel for the type of people in here (musical tastes, musical backgrounds, etc).
