Assassins have very low counterplay, their burst should be predictable and largely countered by building armor and surviving their rotation. Their auto attacks should not be something tanks have to worry about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2016-01-10T09:34:14.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3078}} + {{item:3031}} is still good for AD casters, and I love the raw AD on Youmu's now it feels much better as an early game item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DerZermetzelte","date":"2016-01-10T09:18:57.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still take Infinity Edge and build an Essence Reaver on Talon for example.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-01-10T10:07:15.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP my IE Ghostblade Nocturne...\n\nEDIT: Yeah, that's pretty much what I figured the reason would be.

I'm clearly against RNG, and befor preseason, i had viable options to opt out of RNG, like an actuall ad-caster built with ER rush into LW+trinity or a lifesteal focused built with hurricane.\nAnd trinity aswell as ER were quite usefull on non-adc champs, especially trinity.\nActually, most trinity users are/were not very crit-focused, so why the choice to break the 'trinity' by destroying the **30**ad, **30**ap and 30as picture, and most off all, why replace it with crit?? I think that there are more reasonable options for trinity changes, like replaceing crit with a stinger or recursive bow, or even a kircheis shard.\nEspecially as it seems that trinity isn't meant to be an caster-adc item, as it only gives 20%crit and ER, THE (new)caster-adc item, now needs 30% cdr to reach max cdr, which makes trinity feeling bad as followup for ER.\n\nAditionally, why exactly was Zephyr removed? i don't think it was so out of line that it had to be reomved, the idea of an mobillity focused AS+AD item on it's own doesn't seem like a problem for me.\nAlso, some context in the reduction of tenacity would be nice...\n\nAnd a last one: Why was TBC changed once again? now it is not really a juggernaut/bruiser item, nor a great ad-caster item, but somewhere in between.\nWouldn't it have been a better idea to split it up into a tanky cleaver(White Cleaver) and a damage focused cleaver(Black cleaver), makeing it a pairing similar to the Hydras?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brimaz The King","date":"2016-01-10T22:25:58.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a thing called patch notes.

The crit. was a rather bad stat on the item and wasn't worth the gold you put into it for most champions who bought.  So they removed it and used the gold to purchase more AD for the item, if you will.
