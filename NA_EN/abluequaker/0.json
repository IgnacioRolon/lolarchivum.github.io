Let me know if you're having these issues with only League running, otherwise, OBS might just be what's lowering your frames.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-08-24T03:54:47.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did a clean install of LoL and OBS and it seems to be fine now. Still not a single clue what the problem was. Thinking maybe my OBS setting were dodgy/overly ambitious and when I set it up after the clean install I corrected any issues.\n\nI don't stream _that_ often, but OBS is pretty handy for taking good quality clips so I like the recording function.","replies":[]}]}]}
