They should have removed DFG and left Ahri untouched for Patch 5.2 and identified things such as what item Ahri players substituted DFG with, how much her overall power decreased (if at all), whether it altered the timing of her power spike, or if her play pattern changed.\r\n\r\nI would have been up the the challenge. Is Lich Bane a suitable replacement? A different item to provide the missing CDR? Could I become slightly more CC-oriented and build a Rylai's? Or could I offset the missing damage by purchasing Seraph's embrace or some other high-AP value item?","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-30T13:47:04.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri is kinda awesome right now.

I probably had a 75% hit rate with the ability.\n\nThese changes benefited everyone except for competent Ahri players and it's quite a sad prospect, really.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2015-01-30T18:28:14.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"before mana nerfs I always built Seraphs on ahri. the extra mana and her passive essentially let her stay out forever if you spent a decent amount of time split pushing so long as you minded your team getting derpy close to a 3v4 or a 4v5 on occasion. havent played her since probably 4.20 but im certain i'll pick her up from there and see where things go. probably still building seraphs though. hey, if mana regen sucks, oh well. cant nerf mana pool. dont need regen if you never run out.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-01-31T00:14:28.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sinlaire,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=w5TE5EGa,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-01-30T18:28:14.732+0000)\n>\n> before mana nerfs I always built Seraphs on ahri. the extra mana and her passive essentially let her stay out forever if you spent a decent amount of time split pushing so long as you minded your team getting derpy close to a 3v4 or a 4v5 on occasion. havent played her since probably 4.20 but im certain i'll pick her up from there and see where things go. probably still building seraphs though. hey, if mana regen sucks, oh well. cant nerf mana pool. dont need regen if you never run out.\n\nI always got Double Dorans and Morellonomicon early.
