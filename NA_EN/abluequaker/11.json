Simply make it so her Rend's damage caps at the same amount of damage that a Smite would do at her level.

Do you actually play your own game? \n\nI'm not trying to be a dick, and I totally understand the idea of \"making Kalista a strong in objective control\" is an interesting path for a character... BUT, here's what makes me wonder if you even play the game: Do you understand why every other such ability is capped against monsters? Or why Smite has always been a thing in the jungle even back when you didn't necessarily need it to survive and clear? Why Smite would still be a jungle auto-lock even if you removed all the little Smite-bonuses many jungle mobs have? \n\nBecause of objective securing. Because of how important that is.\n\nBecause, up until Kalista came around, Smite did the most damage to any jungle objective, and thus was a way to guarantee them barring player error. It was the reason Junglers were important and had presence late game and why killing a jungler generally results in really high jungle pressure. \n\nEnter Kalista. Kalista makes an objective \"unsmiteable\", uncontestable. Once Kalista starts an objective Smite is literally no longer a threat as Kalista can simply outdamage it. \n\nYou think this is healthy for the game in any way, shape, or form? Kalista starts an objective and the only possible threat you can level against the team is a full team wipe. If you can't threaten that it's a completely free objective even if their jungler is dead, or securing something else. \n\nNow, you could also \"unlock\" similar skills in different characters, like Cho'Gath, but the ability to secure objectives is so crucial to high level play that I guarantee you, with no shadow of a doubt, that as long as a character has such an ability and isn't completely terrible/unusuable outright, they will be a top pick/ban. Which is the beauty of having Smite be the highest damage, \"objective secure\", utility - any character can use it.  \n\nSame is going to happen to Kalista. As long as she has the 100% guaranteed objective secure she is going to remain a top pick/ban unless (or until) you nerf her into the ground. \n\nI get that you want more diversity, but there is good and bad \"diversity\", good and bad \"homogenization\". A character that would have an easy to hit, 3 second cooldown, 100% guaranteed kill, targeted spell with no mana cost would be pretty unique. Also pretty broken. Which is what Kalista is right now - Broken. Regardless of her overall power one facet of what she does breaks the game.

Or why not put in on another champion entirely, perhaps an ADC *designed* for the jungle?\n\nWhile it may seem like its too late to get rid of it, I don't think it is.

Surely you can capitalize on the fact that their ADC isn't doing any damage and go for a fight? I haven't played Kalista before, does her rend stack on multiple targets simultaneously? Because if it does, you could make rend only stack on EITHER a minion/monster or a champion(s). That way she can't take baron whilst killing your entire team. Idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2015-02-14T14:05:24.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does stack on multiple targets. That might be a good change to alleviate some excess power, but on the other hand it does also add another level of clarity problems to a champion whose damage is already hard to read. Certainly wouldn't be a quick fix to be implemented either. Thematically, I think it would be better if the ability only stacked on one target at a time. That would hurt Kalista's waveclear quite a bit...but I think she doesn't really need to have that as a strong point.\n\nOne thing to also keep in mind is that it may still be problematic for a champion to have too many options compared to other champions. People (who have a reasonable understanding of the game) don't complain as much about Lee because he is numerically OP, for example, but because he is so incredibly versatile.\n\nOne of the big questions about Kalista's balance is whether she threatens to entirely push more team dependent play-making carries like Ashe or Varus (and perhaps Ezreal) out of their already small niche in the game. If Riot wants to emphasize Kalista in the direction of a very objective focused champion, though, it would certainly be better if it was more of a pressing decision when it came down to those moments.","replies":[{"poster":"TomA3X","date":"2015-02-14T14:58:01.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree with that, She's got quite a lot of utility as is, no need for her to have the ability to slow the entire enemy team whilst moving at 100m/s","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2015-02-14T20:51:44.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naw, I would say when she has ranuuans hurricane she can only hit one big monster (drake and baron) at a time or the other team because I do agree being able to kill the other team while doing drake/baron is a bit too op.

There are only a small amount of point and click abilities left, so late game she becomes difficult to lock down. Honestly she sort of took the place of Vayne as a mobile hyper-carry (who took remotely decent mechanics to pull off successfully) while Kalista can just kite back for free. I think that when you guys make some champions you are looking at a small pool of potential counters for the champion but not seeing how the champion just strictly outclasses some others.

She will still hop a set distance at a set rate based on boot tier and AS. In order for her entire windup animation to occur within a shorter period, you have to speed it up.

This would essentially be admitting that her Martial Poise passive is completely broken and should be removed from the game.\n\nedit: in fact, now that I think about it, why not? Remove Martial Poise. Move her W passive to her actual passive. Maybe buff her movement speed a little to compensate. Done.\n\nAs far as her E stacking goes, I'm fine with the way it is now. If you want to cap it vs monsters, I won't cry. But it really would be a shame. All anyone has to do is force her off the objective before she gets enough stacks to \"smite\" it. Versus a squishy champ like Kalista, that shouldn't be a problem. And if she fails, her E goes on cooldown and then your jungler can smite it. Good counterplay isn't always about nerfs and buffs or adjusting game mechanics. In this case, she spent all that time shooting baron instead of the opposing team; a gameplay decision on the player's part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-02-13T19:03:45.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A champion with a dash on every attack gets more mobile at high attack speeds?","replies":[]},{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2015-02-13T17:50:31.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about after every 3/5/7 attacks {{champion:429}} \"accidentally\" drops a spear in her foot rendering her unable to hop around for 8/6/4 seconds?
