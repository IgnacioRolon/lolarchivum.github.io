Since then as an Immobile Poke/Catch champion who's core gameplay was Poke with Q, catch a squishy with R and deal mixed damage with Blight & Blight Detonation.\r\n\r\nBut right now his niche out outclassed by the likes of Kalista and even Ashe who can engage from a safer position and poke without having to put up with an absurd channel time that also slows an already immobile AD Carry. It's really not optimal  because what you trade for that poke far outweighs the strength of the poke itself.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at other AD Carries I seriously wonder why Varus was designed the way that he is. Does he really need a channel time on his Q? Should that channel time be as long as it is? Should channeling his Q really slow him? Sadly, the answer to most of these questions is something along the lines of 'back in 2012 it would be alright'. But since 2012 we've seen the introduction and rework of AD Carries such as Lucian, Tristana, Sivir, Twitch and Kalista who all have more Poke, Carry Potential and Mobility than Varus - even Kog'Maw got some love.\r\n\r\nNow, I've played Varus a fair bit since I started playing mid-2012, and I've always liked his playstyle. But nowadays I can't afford to pick him in most situations because, despite my affinity for him, he's just straight-up outclassed in all of the roles that he half-fills. If I wanted a High-poke AD Carrry I'd probably pick Jinx or Caitlyn who are much safer and scale harder into the game. If I wanted a champion that I could use to initiate fights I would probably pick Ashe or Kalista who are also much safer where Ashe can engage from a much greater distance and Kalista is far more mobile.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-01T07:46:36.575+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"The niche we've got in mind for Varus is a combination of poke and moderate ranged initiation/counter initiation, primarily via his Q and R respectively. We've been feeling he's a bit weak at those for a while and have been gradually buffing him as a result. That's involved increased mana regen late last year to support poke and increased R width recently to improve his ult's reliability.  Additionally in the upcoming patch (5.5), we'll be changing his Q cooldown to begin at start of channel, not when he fires the arrow off. That should give him access to more Q casts late game in particular, and make charged shots (as opposed to saving the Q to proc Blight) a bit more attractive.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-03-02T07:05:03.284+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has there been any discussion on making his Passive less...disappointing?\n\nPerhaps something less conditional and not just a rather unsatisfying *\"win harder\"*-passive?","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-03-02T07:27:02.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh I'd eve be satisfied if his passive was something as % movement speed burst on-hit based off the number of blight stacks on them.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-03-02T07:35:35.120+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather if his Blight stacks WAS his Passive, because in literally any other champions, it would have been the case.\n\n\nThen his W can be something else perhaps.

Otherwise it's like using Ace in the Hole in the middle of a teamfight - it's detrimental to your DPS. Perhaps maybe reducing the cast time (and possibly allowing it to be cast while moving) and increasing the missile speed on E could be a good way to make it more teamfight-friendly.\n\nObviously you can't implement all of these ideas, but considering one or two of them couldn't hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2015-03-01T17:09:04.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cooldown starting at the beginning of the cast is already a pretty big buff","replies":[{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-03-02T07:13:56.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can't really make him move at the speed because if you take a look at Xerath he slows down to charge his q as well.

Shen's armour looks way lighter than Jarvan, and Jarvan's kit\ndesign is similar to shen's (he even has a gap closer and like 700 range on Q).
