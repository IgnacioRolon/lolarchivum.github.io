AFTER they use the exploit and ruin another group of players' games and negatively impact their ranking.\n\nWhere the FUCK is competitive integrity here? A champ that barely sees any play with a situational minor bug gets disabled. A heavily played champion that is a contested pick in the meta with a game breaking bug is allowed to remain available for players to use to cheat with and ruin the gaming experience and competitive environment of league for the entire rest of the playerbase.\n\nYour decisions are always extremely questionable. The reasoning you gave here for why competitive integrity of the game is allowed to remain completely non existent isn't just questionable. Its downright moronic.\n\nI'm just saying mate...\n\nYou folks at Riot have zero sense of priority. And this happens on a daily basis for the past 6 seasons. How do you guys continue to screw up this badly on SIMPLE issues? Any other game would have just disabled the champ... because thats fucking common sense. Why are there scripters abusing this exploit? Because you allow it to remain possible for them to exploit it...\n\nThis kind of failure on something simple and small is a prime example of the ways and things on which Riot has failed for years that has made this game a low quality, unenjoyable, thoroughly frustrating thing to even play. It's no wonder the playerbase has shrunk this season and its no wonder it will continue to shrink in the coming years if you folks continue to display this level of negligence for your own creation and the playerbase that creation is meant for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2016-09-22T15:24:24.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come Graves is getting a nerf to his armor and magic resist bonus stats on his E on the PBE?","replies":[{"poster":"LoopKat","date":"2016-09-22T17:02:21.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he deals shit tons of damage and gets super tanky while doing it.
