Most would respond with your hardware needs an update but my current computer has a i7-7700k, a gtx 980ti, 32gb RAM, 960 pro, etc... So I know that's not the issue.\r\n I have reinstalled the game multiple times, in hopes that the problem would be solved, I've downloaded the hextec repair tool, again no luck. I have searched on forums and boards for anyone having the same issue but I haven't come across it thus far. \r\n This is the only game I'm getting dramatic fps drops, even tho it is the least GPU demanding game I play. \r\n\r\n Someone, please help!\r\n\r\n Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T22:39:50.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS drops don't necessarily require a hardware upgrade, but more often than not they're fixed up by a simple driver update.
