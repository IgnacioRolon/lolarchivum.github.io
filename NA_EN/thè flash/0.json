I can see a couple of lines being misinterpreted as flaming but it actually wasn&#039;t. If you look at the replay of the games and time of words, you will understand. \r\n\r\nIn the first game when I said &quot;We hate Lee&quot;, let me give some context: my team mate Heca and I chased and suicided to kill the Lee and when questioned about it, in response as a joke I said &quot;we hate (enemy) lee&quot; I just meant we hate the champion I hardly see this as flame.\r\n\r\nIn game two, when I said &quot;loool this swain&quot;, I was actually complimenting my team mate swain 1v3&#039;ing and being an absolute monster, if you look at the time I wrote it and watch the replay of the game you will see this. When I say &quot;fk this ali&quot;, I&#039;m expressing my frustration at the enemy alistar always stopping me from getting kills, I am not flaming him in all chat.\r\nI am very upset by this Permanent Ban when there is people in game wishing me cancer, all sorts of diseases and for me to kill my self;

I'm here for fun not to have people like you call out EVERY LITTLE MISTAKE I make but conveniently leave out the fact that you're 0-8-0. Just had a game with a dude that scored that but flammed everyone about how \"Bad\" we were playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Récognize","date":"2017-02-24T19:44:50.626+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If everyone was perma banned saying stfu , riot will lose half its community...","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-02-24T20:06:45.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RecognizeUrLord,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ghLwoEhH,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2017-02-24T19:44:50.626+0000)\n>\n> If everyone was perma banned saying stfu , riot will lose half its community...\n\nWell, good thing they don't ban **everyone** that says stfu.\nThey do, however, ban people that were on their last chance to shape up and still decided that \"stfu\" was the right thing to say.\n\nSomething small like that may not be indicative of somebody being toxic, but it certainly can indicate a relapse of somebody that has been toxic in the past. And having that relapse 12 hours after being given your final chance is a very good indicator to somebody not taking their previous punishment(s) seriously enough.\n\nAs an analogy: Drinking a beer doesn't make you an alcoholic, but in most cases somebody with an alcohol problem drinking a beer means they either relapsed or never even quit.\n\nAfter a 14-day ban, you are either on your best behaviour, or you're out. It has always been like that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-24T00:59:45.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{summoner:11}}","replies":[]}]}
