Also, my work, when I use my computer, will notice times I sound \"roboty\" also in discord while playing games there can be times I go \"roboty\" like my voice is having issues sending through the internet.\n\nI have played it on the lowest settings confirming it's not a PC issue (at least I think)\n\nI like to have friends over and host a fun get together tournament and I don't want this internet interfering with those events.\nHelp me Riot community and it's members, you're my only hope.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T17:50:27.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lag or input delays are usually connection problems, so your PC might be okay.  You could be having packet loss or some problem with how your ISP is routing to our game servers, but you can run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to really know for sure.  Try the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as well to troubleshoot any local possibilities or blocks to the game server.

However bottom line what I have seen here is it's my ISP providers fault and not league of legends or my PCs so thank you for the reply and for the time.\n\nIf there is anything I can maybe get as a keyword to explain to my ISP company that maybe would help them understand the issue cause i have a rented Modem and Router with them as well and it is business level/class.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T19:11:33.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the kind words.  :D  I appreciate you getting back to me and the screenshot!  That is a lot of packet loss!  I'm glad you went through the connection guide, and I'm hoping it does the trick.  If the issue persists, we can run a traceroute to see how you're routing to the game server which you can give to your ISP for more context.  Let me know and we'll go from there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
