You better realize that is the exact opposite of what he is right now. He's an melee carry mage who is famously known for lack of both movement- and cc abilities. Once he has some levels, he can clear a minion waves extremely fast and that is one of he's core strengths.

He doesn't initiate, he's very weak when behind and carries hard when ahead.\n\nEven for the DFG part I wonder. Have you taken an objective look of what people who play him successfully build before and after it's removal, how it affected their success? It was probably decent, but a lot people, myself included, never even built it. People **who don't play him keep thinking it was he's only item**, but actually DFG worked a lot better on ranged assassins with cc, such as LeBlanc, Ahri, Syndra, Veigar.

That's very much an idea being explored right now though, not yet a proven direction.\n\nI doubt this will be seen BUT I would like you to consider looking more at mobility than reworking his abilities all together. As it stands, Mordekaiser works well as an AP Bruiser in the top lane save for his lack of mobility. I've found that he can lane similarly to the likes of Lissandra and Cassiopeia in that he can harass as he farms and exploit missteps by the enemy Top Lane. What he LACKS in comparison to such champions, though, is mobility in his kit. As such I only pick him in team compositions that can supplement that lack of mobility (i.e. If I have champions such as Thresh, Lulu, Orianna, Jayce, etc).\n\nI'll also usually only pick him in team comps that have the potential to quickly kill a champion (usually the enemy AD Carry) marked with his ultimate. But back to his mobility issues...\n\n**Ideally** (at least as a starting point) he probably only needs a Rage/Furor Passive on Mace of Spades that starts as a nice boost of speed then diminishes over a short-ish duration of time.\n\nFrom this point there are two other abilities in his kit that could be used to provide mobility - Creeping Death and Children of the Grave. These would provide movement speed for Mordekaiser for that duration of the abilities (in the case of Creeping Death, it would only provide Movement speed for Mordekaiser and only if he casts it on himself).\n\nHere's a mock-up of these abilities:\n**Mace of Spades (Q):** On next hit, Mordekaiser swings his mace with such force that it echoes out, striking up to 3 additional nearby targets, dealing 80/110/140/170/200 (+100% bonus Attack Damage) (+40% Ability Power) Magic Damage. If the target is alone, 132/181.5/231/280.5/330 (+165% bonus Attack Damage) (+66% Ability Power) magic damage is dealt instead. *Mordekaiser also gains 40/50/60/70/80 Movement speed that diminishes over 5 seconds.*\n**Creeping Death (W):** Unleashes a protective cloud of metal shards to surround an ally for 6 seconds, increasing their Armor and Magic Resistance by 10/15/20/25/30 and dealing 24/38/52/66/80 (+20% Ability Power) Magic Damage per second to nearby enemies. *If Mordekaiser casts Creeping Death on himself he gains 3/6/9/12/15% Movement Speed for the duration of the ability.*\n**Children of the Grave (R):** Steals 24/29/34 (+4% Ability Power)% of target champion's maximum Health (half stolen initially and half over 10 seconds; deals Magic Damage).If the target dies while cursed, their soul is enslaved and will follow Mordekaiser as a ghost for 30 seconds. Mordekaiser gains 20% of their Ability Power and Attack Damage, and the ghost's stats are enhanced. *For 5 seconds when Children of the Grave is cast, Mordekaiser gains 50/100/150 Movement Speed and for 5 seconds after that the bonus becomes 25/50/75.*\n\nIt would also be really great if his abilities had shorter/no cast time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkna","date":"2015-01-29T07:02:43.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8qkcROAR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-29T06:39:44.895+0000)\n>\n> One of the options we're looking at at the moment is whether we should play up Morde's tankier side a bit more.

Instead I have to just wait around and then burst the enemy carry and then rely on the ghost to generate the shields to keep me alive as well as do damage.

In keep with the theme of him controlling the dead and their spirits though, perhaps his new ult should be him releasing a number of spirits (determined by the number of minions he has farmed, kinda like Nasus' Q but defensively) that surround him kinda like the Necromancer's bone armor skill in Diablo 2. These spirits block incoming projectiles (both horizontal and vertical) and traps, potentially negating CC\n\nThis would facilitate his ability to do damage at close range and charge his shield to become tanky at the same time by giving him a gap closer of sorts where instead of him having increased mobility all of a sudden, he is not affected by mobility inhibitors or damage. With this mordekaiser would have a window of immense power when his ult is available but when it is not his opponents can still resort to staying outside his range and CC him so he can't do damage to generate shields.\n\n\nTL:DR Change morde's ult into a a swirling shield comprised of the ghosts of minions he's killed that protects him to allow him to becoming an immobile, CC-less mage that gets tanky when doing tons of damage at close range","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-02-01T17:46:17.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main Question about Mordekaiser is, what is his shield for? It's as if it serves no other purpose than to act as Temp HP.\n\nOne thing I would like to consider is adding some Mechanic to actually stacking your shield, giving him a bit more power while in the thicket of combat. \n\nSomeone suggested a slow aura when the shield is full. The problem with this is that it takes one spell or auto to negate the slow. Perhaps a passive aura that scales with shield strength. \n\nI think the Direction was more towards Bruiser than tank. So Probably not as much CC but good trading and lane sustain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordékaiser","date":"2015-02-01T17:18:19.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi everyone out there, I hope those of you who love Mordekaiser, and enjoy playing him read this.\n\nI'd just like to say that my favorite line of our beloved murder emperor is, \"I shall bring great suffering\". He may only say it once when you pick him, but I always find it his most iconic line. I just want people to remember that he is pains paladin, and making Morde a tank doesn't really fit with his whole theme. Sure he's a big suit of armor, but just his lore and kit don't suit the idea of a tank, but rather a fighter or some kind of battle mage.\n\nAt the end of the day though, what ever the changes may be, I'll just accept them and learn to play Morde a new way, I just hope that he doesn't stray to far away from what he is right now.\n\n{{champion:82}} When there's a will, there's always a hue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archonshope","date":"2015-02-01T15:02:10.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always loved morde as a Lich King (more magically oriented).\n\nRight now other then his look he is lacking in the frontline armored guy(wraight?)  departement. (He does have a \"magical\" shield but so does annie :))\n\nFor previous champion reworks like Sion it was a healthy change to choose between either AP or Fighter aspect and stick with one. It makes it easier to give those champions a healthy gameplay and make them up to par with the other current champions.\n\nIn this particular case I however would not do this and try to explain how you could achieve this :)\n\nLike mentioned in a post below our beloved mordekaiser has on first glance a lot in common with the Lich King and even more to Sauron.\n\nSuggested changes :\n\nW : becomes now a sweeping attack with his mace, from right to left with a small knockback that stuns his enemies for 0.5secs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhjDnrw34QA watch at 3:30 for the mentioned attack.\n\nQ : make his Q a linear skillshot where he throws his mace to his enemies, staggering them for a short time slowing them for 40/45/50/55/60 %\nreactivating his Q would summon his mace after a short while back to his hand (StarWars style where you summon your weapon back to your hand or even similar to Oriana) the move back could have a unique ability affecting all units is comes across on the way back.\n\nThese 2 changes are core changes I think (they don't have to be exactly like I mentioned abilities and effects could be different, I'm not a very creative person :D)\n\nThe **GOAL** of these 2 changes :\n\n1. make tank/fighter Mordekaiser a possibility (without any form of cc there is no purpose for him to become a frontline)\n2. giving him a way to initiate a fight (another very valuable tool for a frontline, not needed but highly appreciated)\n3. A skill shot to separate the good from the great mordekaiser's (raising his skill cap a bit can't hurt ;))\n4. merging the \"huge metal dude\" aspect with the Wraight/ Mage not only visually but also in his gameplay.\n\nR is pretty fine to me and a unique and pretty much core aspect that defines current Morde so I wouldn't change anything here.\n\nW : could use so changes but probably more on a visual side where there are weapons / undead creatures (previously slain foes ?) that whirl around him and act like a shield blocking projectiles ? The only problem I see with this is the readability of the move might make it look chaotique in team fights and I guess from a developer side it might take up to much resources making a skill like this ?\n\nPS : my body is still ready : http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=80276&d=1333011362\n\nEDIT : changed the layout a bit.
