They fit most adc&#039;s perfectly but I just can&#039;t seem to find one that works properly on Jhin. \n\nI can&#039;t use any Precision keystone as i&#039;ll get 18% attack speed from the secondary one which is literally worthless until like full build (4 ad lvl 1 to be accurate), also Footwork heals me for like 30 a proc with 4 items, Bloodlust would&#039;ve healed me for 400 without a crit at that point so I don&#039;t see a point in trying to run Footwork anyway. \n\nDark Harvest and Electrocute are actually alright, you can take Precision as secondary and get &quot;Coup De Grace&quot; (for the execute) and  &quot;Legend: Bloodline&quot; to compensate for the lack of any sustain, with 8% life steal you won&#039;t have to buy any life steal item. And that&#039;s good cuz I never did thanks to Bloodlust. \nThis seems somewhat alright but you will absolutely HAVE to run Precision secondary. \n\nOne big downside to Domination Jhin is not being able to start Dorans Ring as the passive bonus is adaptable so you will get ap bonus instead if you do, and not buying it will cause you to lose a lot of early pressure and run out of mana often, and Essence Reaver is not even close as destructive as Statikk Shiv as third Crit item (after IE and RFC which I consider core items). \n\nOn a slightly different note, even with Domination rune page and Dorans Ring/Long Sword start Jhin feels a lot weaker in early - mid game... I played him as a lane bully with safe Q+4th shot trades with my +14 lethality and +14 ad rune page which gave me decent early game and big power spike after first back if I get Dirk, and he scaled well on top of that. \n\n**so my ideal build was D Ring start, Dirk + boots or Dirk + cull on first B, BF sword on second, finish Ghostblade then IE or RFC rush, then Statikk and Last Whisper... Boot upgrade anywhere along the way, i&#039;d buy any boots except the CDR ones.** And this felt a lot more powerful than what I have now with these new runes. \n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, I love the new runes, they made the game a lot more fun and there is a lot more variety but it&#039;s just that it feels like Jhin took too much big of a hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-11-10T18:48:19.529+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"So...you cannot be a bit less spammy with your spells early and you don’t want to sacrifice a bit more damage for more spell spam?\n\nI’ve been running electrocute on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Space Jhin","date":"2017-11-10T18:50:21.515+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"If I start Doran's Ring I'm sacrificing literally all of my lane phase damage for the wave clear/pressure.

That's way to far to fall! They destroyed all the luster Jhin had even when he's a your main. They have NO keystone for a burst ADC that attack speed is almost useless on, Jhins entire game plan is based on his 4 shot Passive and hard build. he was already hard countered by 6-8 ADCs depending on the support matches, skill was all you had. So he's now a skill champ only???? how does that make sense???? Riot produced nothing for jhin that makes any sense. he needs the mana from the DRing to even sustain enough mana to hold his lane. Warlords BARLELY made the cut when they nerfed death for AD damage, and they role out another patch that does nothing for him.\n\nRiot you have ruined Jhin. You wanna produce a Video on how to make jhin matter again, that would be great? You wont tho cus you Killed him and have no answers right now.\n\nBoost his early game base stats so he can make it to Mid-late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deez Crits","date":"2017-11-10T22:55:49.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I haven't played Jhin too extensively (we're only a few days into preseason after all), I think he's fine and Lethal Tempo is great on him.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2640827936/34584450?tab=overview (yes, this one was a loss but I was at 200+ ping for no apparent reason)\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2640996780/34584450?tab=overview\n\nI think attack speed is a little underrated on Jhin; last season I played him with straight AS runes (no AD). I have personally always been focused on late game, however.\n\nSince match history isn't showing new rune builds yet, here was the setup I used.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8000-8008?build=01021158\n\nLethal tempo gave me about 80 AD late game with full build and I was breaking 1k AD with ardent censer. It synergizes well with deadly flourish. Hopefully you can run up and extend its duration (you have 4.5s to do so). It also possibly works for improving ult damage if you're following the tempo of the keystone.\n\nAlthough unrelated, maybe this will keep you motivated to find out what works for you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WrQ0mVUgiI","replies":[{"poster":"LochNessBunny","date":"2017-11-19T07:58:13.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you add me and give me some tips on how to play IGN is LochNessBunny","replies":[]},{"poster":"Space Jhin","date":"2017-11-11T09:38:32.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that attack speed is good on Jhin in late game, but unlike you I prefer playing him as a lane bully and pressuring hard to set the enemy adc as far behind as possible to get me through Jhin's awkward mid game so I can proceed to one shot the hell out of everyone in late game. \n\nThis could work but the 18% attack speed bonus from runes literally gives me 4 ad on lvl 1, compare that to my old rune page that was +14 ad +14 lethality. Not even close. \nJhin could still be fine but my playstyle that is literally what made me a good Jhin player is pretty much dead. I would have to play him like the old Vayne now - make it through the horrible early game to get to late game. But there's a problem there unrelated to runes - after this new update my framerate stared dropping to 35 even in smaller fights after 20 min mark... I used to run the game at medium - high and never drop bellow 60 (vsync on) except in larger 40+ min teamfights which was one in 15 games, and now Zed ults at 25 min and my framerate is 45. They should look into this, it affects the playstyle that I'll need to work with heavily.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NTrumpWeTrust","date":"2017-11-10T19:42:38.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"aery scales with ad and mana flow band makes him more spammy.
