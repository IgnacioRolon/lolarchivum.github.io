To me it seems as your guys just have it there to make people feel like they got a voice, but the thing is that it&#039;s not being heard. For example i just experienced playing with a toxic kayle who just fed, was negative, and even AFK. i send the report and nothing happens. Another time i was having a bad game as ashe and the guys called me and inbreed, %%%%%% , %%%%, and so many more words, i send the report nothing happens. Riot you are trying to make your game &quot;FUN&quot; , but you guys are really not doing that good of a job. You guys are just not strict. Don&#039;t worry  though because i have a solution. If more than 2-4 players have a report on this other toxic player, he should get a time penalty, if 5-7 people report the toxic player have a temporarily ban, and if it&#039;s more than 8-10 perma ban. I don&#039;t know if you guys will ever read this riot but i hope you guys get at least one idea of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-06T21:28:28.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the problem is that the feedback popup only appears if you were the last person who reported them . So if you report somebody and they get banned in the next game, you won't receive the feedback even though you contributed to it. It kinda makes you feel like your reports aren't doing anything. \n\nOf course, if you get flagged as often making invalid reports then your reports will indeed do nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"rekted360","date":"2017-01-07T15:31:55.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good point gotta think harder","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-01-07T05:32:23.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with the premise that toxicity is what people hate the most about league. I'm quite the opposite... I say fuck chat punishments and focus on trolls instead. That's a little harder to do though, so I don't expect much. But just stop focusing on social interactions please riot. There's trolls and bots and scripts and int feeders out there legitimately ruining games. Toxicity doesn't mean you lose. People are toxic because they're losing. But trolls does mean you lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The 14th Angel","date":"2017-01-06T20:28:55.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ummm no. because theirs trolls that will report for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"rekted360","date":"2017-01-06T20:51:19.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not if riot can make somesort of way that they can view the game the reports came from and see the persons perfomance and actions. Yea its far of but its worth giving it a try","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-06T21:30:10.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering there are thousands of games being reported every minute, it's not realistic to expect them to manually analyze them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
