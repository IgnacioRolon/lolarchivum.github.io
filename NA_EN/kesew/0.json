Playing as Blade Queen Lissandra I ulted a tristana. Her begining jump animations and my ult animations happened at the same time, but then she was still carried the full distance from her jump. I think you may have missed this in your birthday present to her in April.

The ult's currently set up to stop dashes/leaps already in progress. Abilities that are mid cast when the ult hits however will then still process normally, despite the champion being stunned by Frozen Tomb. I'll look into fixing that, might take a bit though, suspect we might need a bit of scripting tech we don't currently have to catch that particular case.","replies":[{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-09-25T13:20:39.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about other forms of CC like blitz grab?","replies":[{"poster":"KLONDIKE007","date":"2014-09-25T21:40:44.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and warwick's ultimate","replies":[{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-09-25T23:56:02.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All CC's that should stop you from using the ability in the first place really.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Baron von Jiggly","date":"2014-09-25T10:40:51.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i remember having a match where lissandra ulted a fiora who also ulted it turned into a frozen tomb jumping around killing my team still instead of stopping the ultimate so yeah this probably needs a look into","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-09-25T08:00:06.265+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is actually working as intended.

I think Ezreal and some other champs do this as well but it's honestly the wonkiest thing in the game atm to say Blitzcrank pull an Ez and have him fly towards you only for him to suddenly teleport away. It looks weird, feels wrong and also feels very unfair. To me it's the equivalent of CC'ing Fiddlesticks while he's preping his ult only for the ult to go off anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"KLONDIKE007","date":"2014-09-25T21:43:16.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so true! not to mention warwick ultimates a champion like tristana she jumps near same time and warwick is suppressing someone that is a leap away from him.

Why can some champions essentially negate CC by using their abilities after they're hit?\n\nEdit: Particularly when the obvious and more engaging counterplay is \"use your ability to dodge the CC\" rather than to negate it.","replies":[]}]}]}
