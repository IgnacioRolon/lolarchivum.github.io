The patcher will need to be able to scan all of your game files and check for updates.  If you attempt to just transfer a full game, it's likely that the files will only last temporarily or rescan your game files every single time you open the patcher.  If you're running into errors, let me know, and I'll see if I can help.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
