Basically Rito is promoting LEAGUE OF TANKS. instead of 300 health. You get about 1000 health in every teamfight for everytime you land cc for 4 seconds. It doesn't even have a long ass cooldown. \r\n\r\nReason Two: The minor Reworks. The minor Reworks basically nerfed champions soo hard. {{champion:35}}  can't stack his boxes, His Q time got nerfed. His damage from his E got nerfed, {{champion:121}}  deals less damage with his Q and it really didn't give him uniqueness to all of his evolutions like RITO wanted it to be. People are probably not going to choose w since his now useless compared to the other three evolutions, {{champion:245}} got a huge nerf so now you have to get  your ult as an offensive tool rather than an escape, since his passive slow gets moved onto his ult. If they werent nerfs, then they are just some BS buffs. Fizz's ult can have a bigger hitbox now, Zed can now have more AD for everytime he kills someone with deathmark. \r\n\r\nReason three: The Plants. The Honeyfruit especially is just stupid. You gain 400 health from practically doing nothing. So you can go back to clearing instead of going back to base. \r\n\r\nReason four: CONTROL WARDS. Control wards disable all traps and wards around the area for 50 gold. That itself is BS. \r\n\r\nThe Most Umbearable Reason: Assassin Rework in general. \r\n\r\nHow RITO RESPONDS TO AN {{champion:245}}  OUTPLAY: Give MORE DAMAGE TO THE TANKS. While nerfing the Assassins. Maybe that would solve the problem. Got to make sure tanks deal the most damage in the game. Instead of DPS squishies outplaying you, were gonna give this huge ass bulldozer. Basically, he will deal almost as much damage of an assassin, while taking no damage itself. Now isn't that fun.","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-11-09T00:57:59.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wrong section","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Q","date":"2016-11-09T00:50:17.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Ekko changes were not nerfs, also they did not move a slow onto the ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T00:29:05.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I can definitely tell you're *very passionate* about League by this post.
