Kinda removes tactical picks when you have a shield on any one of them that greatly boosts an AD's survival.

Saying other lanes won really means nothing because you don't specify: How hard did they win? If bot lane is 20/0 and the rest of the map is 0/10, The bot lane is way farther ahead than anyone else in the game, so it isn't too surprising if they go on to win the game. Additionally, they may just have a better 5v5. I've had games that started out 1/15 and we eventually came back, and this was even WITH a losing bot lane.\n\n2. Not really understanding the point of calling the support the \"slave\"... are we saying ADCs are some sort of evil toxic flamer who has complete control over every game because of how overpowered his role is? I don't think that's true; like, even Hashinshin admitted that ADCs were only kinda overpowered compared to supports, and supports still control the lane for the most part.
