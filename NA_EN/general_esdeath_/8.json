Even in that bullshit Roundtable discussion, they only accepted culpability with regard to their execution of DQ, not the core tenants of the system. They will continue to modify it the system for at least a year (probably more) with extreme favoritism shown to high elo/pro players until they stop complaining. Then that will be it.
