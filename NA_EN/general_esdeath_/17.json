NEVER GANK A LOST CAUSE. If a lane is losing hard enough (matchup varying), then even if you gank that lane odds are they will be useless due to being so far behind giving the fed laner even more kills. ONLY GANK LANES THAT CAN FOLLOW UP AND ALWAYS PING WHEN YOU GO TO GANK, not everyone is able to look at the mini-map every 3 seconds when they're in a hard matchup and trying to get as much CS as their enemy laner allows without getting all-in killed. \n\n2. You don't have to always assist lanes directly, the in-direct approach is abusing the enemy jungler. If you abuse the enemy jungler enough then it delays them throughout the game and makes their ganks much weaker due to the lack of levels and items. This makes teamfights one man down due to the jungler having less income and levels than their team's support. Also making smite-steals easier due to the level advantage. \n\n3. USUALLY, only help push lanes into the enemy tower IF THE ENEMY CHAMPION ISN'T ITEM DEPENDENT OR IT'S FAR ENOUGH INTO THE GAME (this applies mainly to top lane only). Sometimes it's best to keep lanes pushed to your own tower. Freezing lanes like this, even if the enemy laner is missing or dead, makes it so they can't return to lane for farm. If setup correctly, the only way they can farm is to either deny their own jungler camps or to put themselves way out of position to be ganked and to die again. If the enemy laner surrenders the lane due to this, as the laner feel free to break the freeze to draw attention back to you so they can't focus down other places of the map without losing towers.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-01-21T20:58:56.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand these points but the problem is:\n\n1.

If i am ganking early it better be that your lane is pushed in and you are going to help follow up. If i get stomped trying to help you cause they are 5-6ish and i am 4 i DON'T want to hear you crying about how i am a bad jungler/suck etc or blame me for him getting a kill if you don't help it's not my fault and i will not be back in your lane period.\n\n2) If your lane is pushed in and i am at the other end of the map i am not rushing up there to bail you out you have to play your lane as well as i have to play my jungle. If i go to a lane everytime it's pushed in leaving my farm i'll fall behind becoming useless so at this point i say either play safer until i get there or i am applying pressure to another lane to force their jungle out to me or to get a tower. My objective is objectives not coming at a call like a dog even if i am on warwick.\n\n3) I am going to to what is right for the team not just one player. I am not going to keep camping top for my bot lane to be crushed when i can crush that lane. If they are pushing a lot and can't capitalize i am going to bale out bottom as they are holding their own and i can take the damage out of their teams sails. Just like if bot is playing fine crying for ganks and top is holding well and getting pushed in a little and they are wreckless like the bot example above i will crush the top laner. \n\n4) Considering almost every game i jungle i am usually the tank as well i am of course going to be more worried about my mid and bot doing well cause if they fail we have no damage which means no team fight which means game over. The only times my scores have went negative is when mid and bot fed so hard that i could not fix the issue i rarely go neg when our top looses lane. \n\nThese are my 4 main views on how i jungle and that is why i still have a 60%+ win rate on shyvanna and all my scores are high on her even then sometimes with the best basics you can't carry them all.","replies":[]}]}
