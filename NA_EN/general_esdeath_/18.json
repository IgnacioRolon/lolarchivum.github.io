Anyway you were the one that caused the game to go that way, I do not see any successful ganks for bot or top at all just mid and even with their feeding mid he kept up in cs and xp unlike the perma dying top that nobody not even your mid roamed to help with you. psshu k? there literally last line of defense from them surrendering was the top laner getting super fed prob saying they can carry and 1 shot ur fed midlaner so no ff.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-01-11T05:08:33.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know if you read it, but nobody dying by mistake would say \"I'm gonna feed if you don't give me blue\"","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-11T06:47:29.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why should that matter in that particular game you played?

You did not mention that particular saying in your post, I did not read it cause of that and yet you may or may have not forgo it so you don't get bombarded in hates and disapproval of your post that you shoulda known better not to mess with the wrong fool, fool.
