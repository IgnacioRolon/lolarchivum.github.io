In the first post shown it sounds like they're saying \"wow, just waiting for crybaby playerX to come here and try and defend themselves\" which easily falls under shaming.\n\nOP. You named. You shamed.

Boredom!? Maybe! Please don't take my earlier post the wrong way. I am definitely on your side. Like I said, sometimes certain people drive you so crazy that you're incredulous about their existence over the Rift and surprised that they are still able to access the game, given how malicious and abhorrent that they are. But when that happens, according to Riot.. you may only report them or submit a ticket with screenshots, showing evidence. \n\nIf you think about it, it does make a little bit of sense. Because if everyone who was dissatisfied did this, started calling people out over the forums.. \n\n.. it'd just become a flea market. We wouldn't be able to do normal discussions or address actual topics that the boards were created for, right?! Also, some of them might even be the unreasonable players who just post their side of the story while cleverly dismissing their own poisonous words which may have started the entire thing, in the first place. You only get one side of the story and no one knows the entire thing! Which, may start a 'witch hunt' on a person who was actually innocent in the first place! \n\nSo, I do understand why they made this rule. And at the same time, I feel your pain as well.. being someone who has had to deal with such obstructive players on the Rift before. I think that most of everyone who reads this post, including you my dear OP, has! So, the right place for this would be 'Submitting a Ticket' to report said player because that's where they address these issues.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IAintDarius","date":"2019-10-25T17:19:39.884+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can someone take the risk and tell me who they are talking about?","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-10-25T19:06:51.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IAintDarius,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=1Qq7fEYo,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-10-25T17:19:39.884+0000)\n>\n> Can someone take the risk and tell me who they are talking about?\n\nCan't name him since it would technically now be naming and shaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-10-25T17:22:01.992+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IAintDarius,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=1Qq7fEYo,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-10-25T17:19:39.884+0000)\n>\n> Can someone take the risk and tell me who they are talking about?\n\nI would not recommend it, no, as encouraging violations of board rules is *also* not okay.
