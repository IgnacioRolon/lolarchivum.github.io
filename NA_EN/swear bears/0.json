Their policy regarding this is detailed in the same support article:\n> #CAN I HAVE MORE TOKENS?\n>No. Our standard policy for a long time was to not offer refunds, and these recent changes were implemented to better assist our players. Every account is given three refund tokens in order to give Summoners an opportunity to exchange content that they regretted purchasing or bought accidentally. In other words, you are provided with three exceptions to our no refund policy, and we will not be able to provide you with more tokens once they are all used up.\n\n>Before purchasing content, we highly recommend taking a look at our previews for skins and champions in our Forums or in the Champion Spotlight videos to ensure that you are making an informed purchase.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ#h2q2","replies":[{"poster":"Tilthankaldar","date":"2016-08-06T18:19:39.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=MEwmGPiY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-06T02:47:54.836+0000)\n>\n> Hey Swear Bears! \n> \n> If you have one or more of your original refund tokens, then you can definitely refund this purchase!
