Why the huge open target right on her gut? That's kind of an important place to cover when fighting.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f1v6peA.png\n\nShe doesn't have to be fully armored, just designed so it looks like an epic skin on par with Dragonslayer {{champion:201}} and {{champion:80}} and not a 'sexy' skin. Hopefully her eventual VU can help fix that.","replies":[]}]}
