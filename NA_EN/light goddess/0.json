It just isn't as effective anymore because it puts your teammates behind and the gromp bonus is just too strong to pass up (and if you are playing something like sej, udyr, etc. then it will be one of your strongest buffs all game long). After you clear gromp you should place a ward at the entrance to your jungle. This will prevent some nasty lee sin or shaco from walking right up to you and getting an easy first blood. Get your blue then head over to the wolves and clear them. \n\nSomething important to remember is not to use any of your health pots if you plan to back after the wolves. I haven't played all the junglers (just started playing this game September) but as long as you don't stand still while you are clearing your buffs, you should be fine. However, if you plan to keep clearing, use them to your hearts content. As to when you should keep clearing or back, that's up to you. A general rule of thumb is to not back if you think someone will take your buff, and to instead catch them out at it and maybe kill them. However, from what I understand you aren't the best clearer, so you should almost always back after 450 gold and level 3 (that's what you will have after three camps).\n\nAs for starting on the red side, start with krugs, go to the chicken camp (something most people don't do, but trust me, it's a thousand times better), clear the little ones first (it'll save you a but load of damage) then go to red buff and smite it (why clearing chickens second is better). You can ward the bush leading to your red, or the one behind it depending on the person you are playing against. If it is someone with a gap closer, like lee or shaco, place it on the other side of the wall, then check the bush leading to it. Usually you don't have to back and probably shouldn't because red buff is a powerful ganking tool, especially this early.\n\nClearing scuttles is possible after this, and/or ganking. Really, only do scuttles if you have some form of cc or a lot of damage, because if you don't it could take    too long to really be considered efficient. Good early scuttle takers can be xin, udyr, lee, etc.\n\nWhich buff you start on should depend on the game, as you should almost always be going BOT lane, not buff lane. This is because you get a stronger leash, thus taking less damage and getting a faster clear.\n\nWhen you back get a {{item:3713}} until you get better at clearing.\n\n**Invading**\n\nIf you plan to invade, make sure you know which buff they are going. This means you will have to get balsy and ward their jungle, but if you don't want to do that just know they will almost always go bot lane. It's just standard.\n\nYou can invade with almost any champ, but certain champs shouldn't like amumu, or sej, while others like udyr or lee sin can pull it off incredibly easily. Pay attention to who the enemy jungler is as well. For example, if you are playing udyr and the enemy is eve or sej, just invade that bitch, get a free buff and first blood and walk away like a boss.\n\nPay attention to the laners, because in some cases they will come to kill you, which means if any enemy laner is missing DO NOT CHASE THEM. Go to their buff, take it if you think you can, then walk out. Doing that was a enough damage, the kill is just helping a bit, but it certianly isnt worth dying for.\n\nAlways know where the enemy jungler is. If he goes top lane, take his bottom jungle and/or buff. If he goes bot do this top or gank another lane, or countergank. If the jungler is top lane that is a prime time to take dragon as well, especially if the mid or bot laners are missing, and even if they aren't, you have smite advantage, which means it's YOUR dragon.\n\n**Ganking**\n\nIf you have an ult reliant champ like Warwick or amumu, gank whenever it is up. Otherwise, ganking is probably a waste of time and gold, so don't do it. Junglers like Lee Sin, on the other hand, are gank reliant. You should not die as these junglers because it will set you behind, a lot. They are also champs that will snowball really hard early to mid game. So get a kill.\n\nPay attention to the map. As a jungler, and as a laner, your eyes should always be on the map unless they don't need to be. If you pay attention to the map, you will know when lanes are gankable or if they will be gankable in the next minute or so. If the enemy laner is pushing, thats a good time to gank, if he is low at turret, thats a good time. \n\nSet up a jungling route. This is why you are falling behind, because you dont path right. If you get this right, you will have so much more cs and be at least a level ahead of your bot laner (should be a goal). What I mean by pathing is think what camps youll go to before ganking or invading. As a jungler, something comparative to 70cs at 10 minutes is 80cs at 20 minutes. To get this you need to have at least covered and pushed out a lane once. This goes back to map awareness. If you see one of your teammates backed, clear and push out their lane, if they enemy has backed and they want to back (are oom or low) then help them push to turret.\n\nYou do this right, you will have cs and outlevel almost everyone, depending on your elo. Farm=fed, dont let any of your laners tell you differently.\n\n**Tips?**\n\nFocus on a thing. What I mean is, invade, gank, or farm, or you will fall behind. If its a tryndamere jungle and you have udyr, invade; if you have ww, farm your ass off and have devourer by 8:30 at least, or get cinderhulk.\n\nYou should be objective based. If you pay attention, you can easily have a mid turret by at least 15 minutes if your good enough. By doing this you can also get the enemy jungler to reveal themselves if they want to cover lane, being extremely useful. You can see what buffs they have, and see where  they go afterwards, setting up a possible invade.\n\nIf I think of anything else I'll try to edit the post. First time I've done it though, so I don't even know if that's allowed. We;ll see.","replies":[{"poster":"Light Goddess","date":"2015-06-12T15:02:30.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

If you're looking to learn how to jungle, don't do this. {{champion:17}} is very difficult to jungle with, which will just make your jungling experience frustrating.\n\n2) Your runes aren't well suited for jungling. Unfortunately, this is a problem that takes a lot of IP to solve. I'd recommend attack speed reds, armor yellows, and AD or AP quintessences. I use magic resist blues, but I feel like there could be other options there too. Getting the extra defenses and improved clear times helps a lot in the jungle.\n\n3) Your masteries are also not well suited for jungling. You're going to want Bladed Armor (second row, fourth column in defense) for sure. Look around at some guides for some help with the masteries. (Side tip: you're only using 26 mastery points in both of your mastery pages right now, so you have unused mastery points).\n\n4) Jungling is extremely complex, and that is true even more in Season 5 than it has been in previous seasons. Don't be discouraged by those first few jungle games you played that didn't go well; in every game you'll learn something new, and you'll improve over time.

It's safer because you don't have to worry about a level 2 buff bum rush, and I have no problems clearing this way and can gank sooner. Then I look for more ganks, clear a few camps and usually get gromp on my first trip back. The biggest thing about ganking is pathing. Try to go around ward spots, ward behind you to prevent countergank and make sure you ping, make sure your team is in position when you go in (but don't wait on ward if you have to gank thru a ward spot), and don't try to force a gank against a lane that is behind and will be scared and expect you to do all the work or be desperate and feed, especially if there is a chance of countergank. Try to get top or mid ahead early, then focus on bot as much as possible to get Dragon control and generally just be near Dragon. If your bot lane is bad or too behind, especially against a sustain lane like Sona or Raka focus on mid instead. Also ward for your lanes and buy pinks. As for clearing, what runes/masteries are you typically using and what champs?\n\nEdit: After reading the comments MushroomMan64 had good advice as well. I don't recommend starting out with someone who is level 6 reliant for ganks like Warwick or anyone that is farming based as this won't help you improve. My best advice is look for ganks without forcing them and focus on controlling Dragon but being patient. Don't try to cheese with invades, afk-farming, early Dragons etc. Just don't pick someone who is super mechanics-dependent like Lee Sin. Someone like Elise I think scales well enough but has good ganks, counterganks, is versatile as she can initiate, disengage, peel or kill squishies, and has good sustain and Dragon control. She relies on having good positioning in teamfights and that's about it.\n\nAnd AS quints are much much more efficient than AD quints. If you take 3 AD Quints and 9 AS Marks you'll have 15% AS and 6.8 AD. If you go 3 AS Quints and 9 AD Marks you'll have 14% AS and 8.5 AD. Huge difference. For Seals and Glyphs I prefer flat Armor and MR which help win trades and make initiating ganks safer for you and your laner and often negates countergank attempts by someone who thought they were going to be able to afk-farm jungle all day and aren't built properly (think lane bully but jungle bully), but some junglers are very CDR reliant which helps secure ganks and clear and still scales well as long as you itemize correctly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Their Jungler","date":"2015-06-12T06:23:01.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Sejuani because she gives freelo but also has good clear and amazing ganks.

For example, Warwick is an EXCELLENT choice for a person still learning jungle. You don't have to worry about dying to jungle camps. He is also very cheap (only 450), and his ult makes it easy to gank with. Here are a few short tips I have to help that really change the game for you: \n\nIt is (usually) best to start gromp by smiting and clearing it, going to blue, then to wolves. If you want, you can continue to raptors and try to do a full clear or you can just recall, get stalkers/rangers trailblazer, etc. Before starting gromp, make sure you utilize your ward. So many junglers don't do this (even though they buy the ward ... and never use it). All you have to do is ward the river entrance to see if others are coming to try and steal your camps. If you're really worried someone like a Shaco will swoop in and steal your buff, start blue buff first then do wolves/gromp. \n\nOn your first or second back, it's best to get a sweeping lens and some health pots. Worry about wards not on your first back but on your second or third one. This is just to make it easier for you. \n\nFocus primarily on farming as Warwick in the very early game. Don't force ganks (in other words, if the lane is pushed, don't try to make a gank happen if you don't think anything will come of it). If the enemy is pretty close to your laner's tower or if they are a little bit past the middle, a gank can happen. Sit in the brush, ping the enemy champion SEVERAL TIMES so your laner is aware (sometimes laners just sit there as you gank ... or they engage to slowly and so the enemy gets away, making yourself feel inadequate when really they should've helped you earlier ), then go in for the kill. I've noticed that how your laner reacts can make or break the gank, so make sure they get involved!\n\nBeyond that, make sure you get an early pink ward around your second to third back and place it at dragon or somewhere near it so you have vision of it. If you feel like you're wasting time by sitting in the brush and trying to force ganks, then immediately start farming back in the jungle. Don't waste any time, because you're missing out on gold and experience. If possible, it's best to gank every lane at least once, but since you're still learning, just try not to force the ganks. \n\nThat's the main advice I have to say about this. I didn't include counter jungling mainly because I wanted to cover the parts you seemed to be having trouble with. In case you didn't know, you can also press tab to see the times of dragon, baron, and the red/blue buff. This is so immensely useful. It helps you plan your jungle path and reduces the amount of time wasted. When in doubt, press tab.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S2C2Xd9KOy","date":"2015-06-12T03:07:25.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gromp - Wolves - Red - Raptors (might have to back here, if you don't, do Krugs) then do Blue.

If you start blue side, you'll want to hit the gromp first, smiting it immediately for the buff, then to blue, then onto red, smiting that too for the health, then depending on which jungler you're playing, hit scuttle then gank, or back there, and then gank.
