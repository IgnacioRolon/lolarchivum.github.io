By recently, I mean literally today. I have 2 computers, one is a mac and the other is a Windows. Apparently, on my Windows computer, my ms used to be 46, staying there. Nothing weird, till I suddenly spiked to 700 MS while in a game and then sit flat on 106 or above. The only time it decides to change is if it wants to increase. I never had this problem before, and while I do play with WiFi ( i know its not a good idea to go wifi but its giving me 46 ms ), I have extenders too. So I'm almost as good as using a cable. This problem has only been encountered after 7.5, which I find weird because I am not the only one that only got this after 7.5, but I'm sure its different because  I didn't get it instantly after the update. This problem carried on to make it so I always have 106 MS on games.\n\nOn my Mac, it seems that my MS is normal. I don't have an amazing memory, so I might be wrong, but I think my Mac computer is better than my Windows at playing League. Think of it as my Mac is D2 and my Windows dropped from D5 to S3. However, I don't always get to use my Mac due to family issues (more of my mother going facebook mode on it and never stop), and I am loyal to Windows mostly. But it's vital to note that I am not the only one with this problem. \n\n\nAlso, what is this thing {{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rishal21","date":"2017-03-21T11:15:11.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually have a constant ping of around 250, and my game works just great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-21T03:30:48.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your ping is spiking up to 700ms while playing, it could be due to an unstable connection that is only showing up on your Windows pc. Even if your Mac never has connection issues, there could still be something affecting your Windows connection such as firewall or DNS settings. \n\nGo through the steps in our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so we can rule that out as a possibility, and let me know if you have any issues!\n\n\nP.S.{{champion:266}} <- this is a Darkin named Aatrox.
