Interestingly, both of these items have the _&quot;Unique Passive-Lifeline&quot;_. I thought it was confusing how the name was the same yet the passives were different. I wondered if either they should have different names, or if together they apply at the same time. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know. I have a feeling that the passive names are supposed to be different since both items do different effects.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2017-06-07T21:14:10.431+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Roll,\n\nThey are meant to have the same passive name because they are both Lifeline type interactions or same unique passive family. By that, they give you a shield or boost that is suppose to help you in a panic moment or when you need your life saved... by a lifeline. \n\nThe buffs they give are actually called something different, enraged for Maw and I think Sterak's Fury for Steraks. \n\nThe reason this came to be was a popular build was Steraks and Maw at the same time because they did proc together and it made champions really strong and very difficult to kill.\n\nSo to sum up, they do different things but are in the same family of Lifeline Passive. Hope that clears up some stuff :D\n\n\n-Ranger XIV","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-06-08T16:25:40.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, why is the new Athene's passive not simply named the same as the Mikael's passive, as per the usual rules for named passives?\n\nInstead, it has a different name entirely, but it explicitly states that it disables Mikael's.
