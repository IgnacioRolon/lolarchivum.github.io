I don't have any news on a fix right now, but there are two workarounds you can try in the meantime:\n\n- Press \"Alt+Enter\" together when on the black screen\n\n- Or log in to League of Legends\nBrowse to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config and open \"Game.cfg\" in notepad or any other text editor\nFind this line: WindowMode=X\nChange the \"X\" to 2. IE: WindowMode=2\nSave this, then launch a custom game\n\nEither of those should get your screen restored!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLOODCRYPT","date":"2017-01-12T11:05:54.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soon it'll be 24 hours from the beginning of the bug ;) they'll delete ur discussion or post a \"click alt+enter , we know that its completely unplayable that way but hey you can see a screen as big as our dicks in the cold and if you play you'll get frustrated but just wait ;)\"\na company as big as riot cant fix a bug that they made themselves ?
