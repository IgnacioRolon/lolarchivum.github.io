We get some vague &quot;it&#039;ll come out dont worry&quot; type answer (if we&#039;re lucky, you ignore 99% of the questions about it.) Just tell us if it&#039;s coming out or not already. Why is releasing one single emote that&#039;s already done and was supposed to come out months ago so damn hard for you people?\r\nIt&#039;s actually starting to piss me off. The one time my fav champ gets some love and it gets pulled away from us for no reason whatsoever.\r\n\r\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vbqJS8Uv9SM/WyLFWG9l1FI/AAAAAAABBeM/RSrq9mEoMXIkWsWW3cH7nXUdIrqXaxoSQCLcBGAs/s1600/ee57b11cdd0a060a.png\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s wrong with this emote? it&#039;s perfect.
