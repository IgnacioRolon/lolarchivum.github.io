The research is as follows:\r\n\r\nPocket-protected scientists built a wall made of Iron and crashed a Mordekaiser into it at 400 miles per hour, and Mordekaiser was unharmed.\r\nThey then built a wall out of Mordekaiser and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. \r\nThey then crashed a Mordekaiser car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. \r\nThey crashed 400 miles per hour into a Mordekaiser travelling at iron car. Western Ionia was powerless for hours. \r\nThey rammed a wall made of metal into 400 miles an hour made of Mordekaiser, and the resulting explosion shifted earths orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Shuriman suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Demacia at 400 billion miles an hour. \r\nThey shot a diamond made of Mordekaiser at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 10000 wayward boats to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 10000 buildings in downtown Noxus. \r\nThey spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per Mordekaiser. The results were inconclusive. \r\nFinally, they placed 400 Mordekaisers per hour in front of a car made of wall travelling at miles per iron, and the result proved with out a doubt that Mordekaisers were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known to man.","replies":[{"poster":"AstreaSoul","date":"2019-03-05T03:09:54.230+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah.
