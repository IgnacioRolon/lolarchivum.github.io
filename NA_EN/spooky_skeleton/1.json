We had a rioter say &quot;dont worry, it&#039;s coming&quot; at some point, but that genuinly just felt like a &quot;stop asking about it&quot; type of reply more than anything. Could it be that the emote got shelved in favor of Jinx&#039;s emote that&#039;s very similar? who knows. But why tell people that you&#039;ll release it if several months later there is still no news on it. Think of the living impaired riot, stop rattling our bones and release it or give us some context as to why it got removed.","replies":[]}
