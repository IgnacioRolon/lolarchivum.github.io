Please remember that epithets like \"retarded\" and \"autistic\" are not welcome here.\n\nAs far as the question of \"hovering Alistar jungle\" goes, no ban is ever the result of a single incident, unless that incident is highly toxic. Any player who believes their ban is solely due to off-meta choices is encouraged to submit a support ticket for Riot to review. In the meantime, it's often helpful to find queue partners if you're doing something weird. Having people who opt in to your strategies makes the experience better for everyone.\n\nWith regard to \"Free Tarzaned\", we cannot comment on disciplinary actions where there's a question of boosting, toxicity in other venues (Twitch, YouTube, etc.), account compromise or the like. These actions are handled manually by Riot and should be referred to them.\n\nThank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oniigiri","date":"2017-10-18T01:55:14.970+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":8,"body":"Weren't you banned for threatening to play zilean jungle in champ select to get people to dodge?","replies":[{"poster":"VÃ¬vÃ¬","date":"2017-10-18T01:59:23.371+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":7,"body":"\"there are multiple instances where you threaten to troll the team and lock in intentionally poor picks for jungle such as zilean in order to get people to dodge the queue\" https://twitter.com/LoLTarzaned/status/920445252103786497","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-10-18T02:56:31.122+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":4,"body":"For those who dont know, Tarzanned (who is the OP of this thread btw) is a full blown rager who is well known for flaming others in game, on his stream, and across multiple platforms such as Twitter.

If you only feel like playing off meta when your best champions are banned or you're just bored, it does NOT change a thing. It's either allowed or isn't. You can't say \"oh but you usually don't play off meta so now I report you\". Context does not matter in any way here unless he was not trying in the game and just walking in circles etc. I certainly am more willing to go off-meta in games I perceive as low winning chances (Teemo ADC). I have every right to do this. It is completely up to me when I choose to go off meta and my motivations for it are no one's business as long as I try in game. Obviously, there are some exceptions. Taric mid is just not remotely viable (unless vs Zed, I guess) so that's going past just off meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slice n Dice em","date":"2017-10-18T02:36:02.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"what context?

This person has used their fame for attempted monetary gain (by advertising for and/or actually boosting accounts). Further, this player has made a **list** of \"dodge players\" - players who he will troll champion select lobbies to get someone to dodge in if he is matched with these players. And he trolled to attempt to force people to dodge in **multiple** games - simply because he didn't want to do it himself.\n\nRiot placed this ban on the player because ***nobody***, no matter how high ranked, no matter how much they stream, no matter how popular they are, is above the Summoner's Code. The Summoner's Code can be boiled down to one line: \"don't be a jerk\". Making a \"hit list\" of dodge players and then releasing it publicly, trolling to get other people to dodge games that he doesn't want to play with them in, and trying to use your fame/high rank to advertise for services which are at best anticompetitive and at worst worth a permanent ban in and of themselves - those are **all** negative behaviors that are contrary to the spirit and the words of the Summoner's Code.\n\nThe bottom line is that this player has been doing this for **quite** some time - and it only came to the attention now towards the end of the season, which is why everyone's crying \"politics\". There is no politics involved. Riot saw enough reports with validity to perform a manual review of the account, at which time they discovered punishable behavior (and quite a bit of it). I'd be surprised if they weren't **also** aware of the other actions that the player has taken on off-Riot sites (twitter/streams) that are also contrary to the competitive spirit of League.\n\nMy personal opinion? This player doesn't **deserve** to be Challenger at the end of the season. They don't **deserve** their ranked rewards (which they are now ineligible for). They don't **deserve** their honor. They are certainly not an honorable player, and if they try to game the system by trolling to get people to dodge bad selections, or making a \"hit list\" of \"bad\" players to try and game the matchmaking system, they aren't skilled enough to be Challenger on their own.\n\nLet this be a warning to everyone - nobody is above the rules, and Riot **will** catch you eventually.
