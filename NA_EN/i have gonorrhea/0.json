Although my ping will be 30ms for the first 5-10mins of the game after that it will spike upwards of 700 and because of that makes the game unplayable so as I try to reset my internet I disconnect and get Leaver Buster as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"Megagig","date":"2016-08-26T21:06:50.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sure is a nice response.
