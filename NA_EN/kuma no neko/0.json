No idea how i can fix this. you can't even open the menu with keyboard, cant click anything as OP said you don't get given the LOL cursor you get your pc cursor and cant do anything. you can load into the game, watch what is happening and see the game unfold while your champion is sitting at base and you're screen is just stuck on the champ as that's where the screen starts at the nexus. it's like you're a spectator in the game but you're stuck on champ and have no control over anything. couldn't even close the game without having to end task it from task manager as i couldn't click on the defeat button once the ennemy team killed our nexus or open the menu.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dezeption","date":"2018-01-19T09:17:33.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confirming: Closing discord worked for me as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silver Jinx","date":"2018-01-19T07:39:37.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont even have installed and never have had it installed and Im getting this issue still","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pavah","date":"2018-01-18T00:18:31.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's another thread with a guy with the same problem.
