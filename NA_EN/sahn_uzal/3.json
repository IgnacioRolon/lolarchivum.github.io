It also keeps your imagination sharp, which is most important.\n\nWriting more is simply a good way to get better at the craft. Plus, you know, you have to write to... be a writer. You'll also, if you've been reading or consuming written media a lot, have a good sense of taste -- even if your skill level isn't quite meeting your own standards yet. Just keep making stuff. The things I wrote five years ago are nowhere near the quality I'm hitting today, and I suspect in five years I'll look back on my work now and find ways to improve it further.\n\nFinally, you need feedback. Honest feedback. If you're surrounded by people who say your work can't possibly be improved you will never get better, ever. Get a peer group together and write with them. If at any point they all think your writing is consistently flawless, find a new writing group and start over. You can always, always, _always_ improve, so keep working at it and keep your mind open to new opinions or ideas.\n\nAs a side note, don't get too comfortable with your own work. A little humility goes a long way.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-03-29T20:53:05.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I think the last one is the hardest.

He was a prince of Wallachia, which is now Romania, and launched a very extensive military campaign across Europe and parts of the middle east. He was particularly known for his cruelty and particular fondness for impaling his enemies on spikes as reminders to his other enemies not to cross him. He was very much one of the most iconic warlords that many fictional stories based their warlords off of, and it was Brahm Stoker who borrowed his name when researching for Dracula who inadvertently immortalized him in fiction by linking him to vampirism in his novel. \n\nThat said, Stoker's version of Vlad Tepes is a sophisticate who uses cunning, magic, and trickery to seduce and claim his victims, contrary to the militaristic and tyrannical nature of the real Vlad Tepes. \nThe skin, Count Vladimir, is based on Stoker's version of Vlad Tepes - the smooth, sophisticated aristocrat with unearthly beauty, who lived in Victorian times.\nThe skin, Blood Lord Vladimir, is more based on the actual Vlad Tepes from the medieval era, the imposing warlord who ruled with an iron fist and instilled fear in his enemies and his people with his penchant for blood and murder.\nOf these two skins, Blood Lord Vladimir would fit the Gothic Horror theme better than Count Vladimir on the grounds that that skin is based on the tyrant from the medieval era, which appears to be the general era this skin line is pulling inspiration from (based on the face mask Singed wears, which was commonly worn by doctors during this era).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rendrex","date":"2018-03-29T17:55:28.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=iOagysGr,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-03-28T21:23:34.070+0000)\n>\n> Neither of these skins really fit the line.
