Even if they were running 9 MR glyphs.\nSo the assumption, is that mages already are doing true damage to you with their pen when you have 9 MR glyphs, why not run 3 instead, take the same amount of damage because penetration can never exceed 0 (only reduction does that) and get a little bit more out of your blues.\n\nNow, the one issue is that this rune set up starts netting an advantage once the mage builds void staff, and also usually by the time they get void staff, which is a flex item, you should be able to pick up an MR flex item like banshee's veil or mercurial scimitar.\nAlso this build existed before keystones existed and reworked the entire mastery tree, so the greedy build is also like 2 years old at this point.
