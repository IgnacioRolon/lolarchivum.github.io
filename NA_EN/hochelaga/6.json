Not all supports can heal their adc too. Tham kench thresh and blitz also have some target spells. None of them cost that few mana\n\nSion has massive amounts of CC and damage in his kit. Sion also has probably the most telegraphed and counter-play ridden kit in the entire game.\n\nHis Q is a large hit box stun which deals absolutely massive damage (early game) based off of his base AD alone. Inversely he has to stun himself for at least 1 whole second - upto 2 - in order to get any cc or damage out of it. During this time he cannot move, re-aim, use any abilities / summoners (outside of Smite), and the channel can be interrupted.\n\nHis W is a massive AoE % health + base damage nuke.. which is easily countered by just hitting him. Srsly, the shield's absorb is pretty low all game long.\n\nHis E is requires a middle man to reach decent ranges, meaning that you can use angles to make it absolutely impossible for him to hit you.\n\nHis R has a global warning and isn't super dangerous unless he covers some distance. It's also pretty easy to dodge.\n\nNot all supports can heal their ADC, but all supports have some form of snap power / cc / trade potential. Sion does not. You can (relatively easily) avoid everything in his kit through movement or simply CCing him out of it, which is the cost he pays for the power he has when he lands EVERYTHING.\n\nThis is why Sion became unbelievably broken when his E was bugged to have a gigantic hit box. Sion's weakness is unreliability through counter play; if you make him reliably unavoidable he's broken as shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2018-03-23T19:43:04.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Tahm flings his tongue, he doesn't have to sit there with a giant \"I'M CHARGING MY TONGUE\" animation for a full second if he wants to actually land the hit and it be a valuable one.\n\nWhen Thresh or Blitz fire their long-range CC, they don't need a minion as an intermediary for the range to actually be long, and the resulting CC is much better than a slow.\n\nAnd they all have instant ways to protect their ADC even if you get inside their long range. Tahm can eat his ADC and has two health bars for absorbing skillshots, Thresh can flay and ult, Blitz can knockup and ult. Sion can sit there with his I'M CHARGING MY AXE animation, and maybe pop you with a slow, both of which are very difficult to effectively peel with as support in a gank situation because almost everything in this game is just so fast these days. And even if he DOES zone the jungle gank off with a well-timed Q charge that magically doesn't get interrupted, he's going to die himself so his ADC can live if it's early game, because he's got the mobility of a rusty door hinge 95% of the time.\n\nAnd don't tell me his passive makes up for that. Sion's passive is _worthless._ The only time you might get a few hits off with it is level 1 or during a chaotic teamfight, but by the time those come around you're really not doing enough damage to be a threat. Outside of these scenarios, _every_ death to a Sion in his passive is down to a mistake on the part of the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Hochelaga","date":"2018-03-23T19:56:48.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like you've never played against a Sion support. Sure on paper it looks awful but wait until you see a good one. What division are you?\n\nBasically he would shout a minions, damage and slow you (arcane comet hits you + scorch) then axe you. Remember that he can cancel his axe animation early and just swing it. Starting with relic shield provides him with more hp than the average support, heals his allies and his big hit box just tanks everything for the adc. Sion can literally solo push a lane too.\n\nThank kench doesn't clear wave as fast as him, his tongue is easily blocked by minions, \nBlitz's grab basically cost 40% of his mana. he can't spam it.\nThresh depends on how good is your adc.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2018-03-23T20:26:27.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Sion support.

I know Sion pretty well too. And I believe that his mana cost is way below others especially during early game. This isn't about -- He can hardly land his skills, so his spells shouldn't cost alot ! Your reply hasn't answered anything.\n\nYou're literally switching the subject's topic which is ''Sion's spell cost are so low''. This has nothing to do with his ult not hitting or being too predictable.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2018-03-23T21:29:33.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it does.\n\nHis spell costs are so low because they're telegraphed skillshots. When Sona hits her buttons, her spells WILL land. Period. Sion has to put some serious effort into landing his, and there are some champions that he's essentially got no chance of hitting on his own. And also because he's a very slow, very large melee champion, which means he not only has no escapes, he's far easier to hit with skillshots than most of the roster.\n\nThey're also low because he's a top laner and he has to go against champions who have similar if not cheaper spells, many of which are also easier to hit with than his own.\n\nCourse, if you had responded to Morgan Freeman Bot up there, you'd have already gone through all this. i didn't mention it because he'd already said all that was needed on the subject, but if you're going to avoid his post because you have no response, and continue trying to fabricate one for my posts, I'll just quote him for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hochelaga","date":"2018-03-23T23:12:45.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Telegraphed spell has nothing to do with ''oh this should cost less''. I took Sona as an example of how unfair early game mana cost was. I could have taken Nami's W if you wanted, or Blitzcrank's grab. Want a top ''telegraph'' champion? Jayce would be a good example, all of this spells cost about 50-70 mana in early game and he can easily run out of mana.\n\nMorgan's arguments don't even stand at all.\n\nQ dmg range from 12-120 based on charge time. him saying '' Inversely he has to stun himself for at least 1 whole second - upto 2 - in order to get any cc or damage out of it'' is false.\n\nNo matter how long he charges the Q, if it hits a target, you get a guaranteed 50% slow \n\nW's shield is scaling on MAX HEALTH %. That is not a small shield. Sure it looks small on him because of his massive health during late game. Either way, you don't max his W first.\n\n**E's initial target range is 725, if it hits a minions, it goes forward up by 775 range for a total of 1500 range. EVEN if this spell a telegraph spell as you would say, IT'S 1500 POTENTIAL RANGE for 35 mana at level 1 that slows for 2.5 seconds, reduces armor by 20% (hidden effect for adc?) does an increased 30% magic dmg to all subsequent ennemies hit by E. Even Xerath's Q range or Jayce's blast aren't that far. Combined with Arcane comet and scorch, you get a 150 dmg spell for 35 mana on a 12 second cooldown**\n\nIf all you have to do if to Avoid his spells to counter him, heck, that would be the same against a Xerath mid, and life would be easy.\n\nBut you know what, you can Keep using Morgan's argument against me even if I just proved them wrong. This conversation is over.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2018-03-24T00:34:25.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-Yeah, it does. Nobody's spells are as telegraphed as Sion's. And that's on top of, as I pointed out, the fact that he naturally shoves waves when he casts spells, which is severely dangerous early on.\n\n-The chargeup time is also required to charge the distance of the hit, and the slow lasts _one quarter of a second._\n\n-That is a small shield. At no stage of the game is that shield even remotely difficult to pop in a team fight. It's rarely even difficult for one person.\n\n-Again, his E requires minions and shoves waves to be used like that. Also, you should really do your research before spouting off arguments. The armor shred only applies to things hit directly by the scream, and if that happens it's not a 1500 range spell. Xerath's got four long-range spells, Jayce's stuff hits ridiculous hard and he's got SEVEN buttons to work with, he should do less than a guy with only four. His spell also moves slower than shock blast and only requires watching Sion's position to avoid.\n\n-I've played against plenty of people that have avoided the vast majority of my E attacks. Sucks for you that you're not one of them, but that doesn't make the move too powerful or too cheap.\n\n-You haven't proven a single thing wrong yet. And it's hard for a conversation to be over that never began.
