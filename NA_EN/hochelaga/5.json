By pushing for an actual rework or even just larger scale changes youre running the risk of riot doing to varus when they did to shen and malzahar. stripping him of his identity and original vision in favor of a soft relaunch.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2016-08-17T01:25:13.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To make it clear: Im talking about advanced stuff, above the \"just nerf/buff x\" typ. Let me give you a short example:\nWe could swap Vaynes W with her passiv, scaling with levels etc., But this does not feel right! A PASSIV should never be main source of dmg! But it should make the kit feel somewhat round. And yes im mostly talking about ApVarus the ADVarus doesnt care much for these changes. But i hope you get what i mean. (And having the %s scaling with level, destroys AP Varus, or atleast nerfs him really hard early/mid(where hes already weak xD 15%blight dmg at level 9 vs level16..... BIG diffrence!))\n\nNext: I would like to give insight on some other things too, I call those Leona, Sona, Annie etc. \"reworks\" only \"Updates\". I consider a Rework only at the scale of changes like Sion or Taric! But theres no real line at where you can divide those, I just use them for clearification. So I would suggest only an \"update\" scale for Varus, I dont think he needs a full rework. \n\n___\nAfter all that information talk lets get to the changes: His W as a passiv doesnt feel good enough, theres no Rage or vengance in it and it doesnt feel right as a passiv. So lets assume we dont touch the W and only talk about passiv changes! Its clear that he needs to get AS, but he should only get it after something happend!\nSome possiblitys are(no real numbers just some ideas):\n\n- after x(~4ish) kills(minions etc.) he gets something like darius passiv only with AS instead of AD. \n- If he or his allies(maybe minions too) get attacked he gains +AS for some seconds, and refreshes the duration if he AAs an Enemy champion. \n- if he gets 3 stacks on someone and procs them he gains x AS for some seconds.\n- He gains X AS for Attacks on the same target, stacking to up y. OR he gains AS vs targets that have stacks of blight or are in his E/R\n- If a ally dies he goes beserk, getting AS,AD,AP etc. (so kill him first or die if you touch his allies xD)\n\nA simple AS steroid ability may be simple and effectiv, but there are already to many and its boring, so lets mix it up a bit :P\nI would want to change his E, so it has the grounded effectiv too, maybe a bit smaller range and maybe R speed down a little too(~50range & -100 speed maybe). Varus is imobile af so giving him the grounded debuff would be super awesome! But thats only on a side note.\n\nI know not all of those suggestions are good, some are only there to show you a bigger extend of options.\nMy favorites are: getting beserk if allies dies and gainig stacking(!) AS vs the same target/with W debuff.\n\nThis would be my way of changes Varus, specially his passiv, to make his gameplay closer to his theme and give if some love taps too ;D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-08-16T14:49:58.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would it be a problem?\n\nInstead of scaling with an ability rank, it'd scale with levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2016-08-17T01:28:17.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">And having the %s scaling with level, destroys AP Varus, or atleast nerfs him really hard early/mid(where hes already weak xD 15%blight dmg at level 9 vs level16.....
