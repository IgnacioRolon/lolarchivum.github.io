It's a massive can of worms with inherently unbalance-able runes that encourage further power creep in the game.\n\nIt's a very unwise choice to allow most of that tree to exist. Particularly after the coming nerfs to Domination and Sorcery (making assumptions here, they sure better get nerfed) that tree will increase in relative strength. Personal opinion is it's an extremely unwise design and development choice to even allow those things to exist.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NTrumpWeTrust","date":"2017-11-17T01:37:42.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"imagine annie with a 12 second hexflash.
