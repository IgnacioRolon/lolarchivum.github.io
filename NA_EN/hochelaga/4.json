The only cool thing about that skill is the fact that it can activate thunderlord\r\n* His E is a stun spell that has the LONGEST cooldown of all basic stun spells. On top of that, it only stuns for 1,25 second at all level, has a high mana cost at level 1 and is extremely hard to land from distance which makes Heimerdinger having the most unreliable stun of all mages.\r\n* His R SHOULDN&#039;T cost 100 mana upon activating it. If Heim wants to empower his Q, why not make it cast 100 mana when he casts his Q with his ult. He basically can waste all of his mana upon activating his ultimate on and off without doing anything.\r\n* His turrets are sometime so stupid that they can actually miss an IMMOBILE target.\r\n* Heimerdinger is one of the hardest mage to land his abilities. Coupled with HIGH cooldown spells and turrets charges, he can be completely useless during a period of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-20T19:13:22.853+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"because nobody wants him to be good","replies":[{"poster":"Hochelaga","date":"2017-03-20T19:19:56.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I do want him to be good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SevenStars7","date":"2017-03-24T19:42:24.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like heimerdinger to be good as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ultra Rapid Fyre","date":"2017-03-20T19:31:34.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear OP where do i even begin\n\nFirst off... you play heimer MAYBE once every 5 games, so youre someone who casually plays heimer\n\nsecond... you have the SAME EXACT BUILD PATH in every game with him... regardless of lane opponent... you literally ALWAYS BUILD THE SAME ITEMS\n\nThe fact that you think abyssal, zhonya, and morellos are the 3 core heimer items to buy just proves you know nothing about this champion.\n\nAlso youre probably one of those guys who doesnt realise in team fights that ult + E is far supperior to ult + Q or ult + W\n\nmaybe you should learn a champion thoroughly before speaking about them. give it a try","replies":[{"poster":"Hochelaga","date":"2017-03-20T19:44:08.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So before you make any non sense comments about how I play heimerdinger, I suggest you make more research on my profile instead of just dropping a sneak peak.\n\n- I've played Heimerdinger since season 3 and average about 80 ranked games on Heimerdinger each season (the most being 155 on season 3 and 40 on season 6).
