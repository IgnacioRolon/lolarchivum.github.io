Anyone have any idea how to solve this issue? I know a temporary fix is to reassign to something like N and M and use that, but I click around my map with the side button since I have Attack Move mapped the Left Click so this is a bit tricky.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-19T16:49:22.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue might be specific to your mouse, double check any third party apps that may be tied to configuring it.  A config reset in-game could also help:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.  \n\nIf that doesn't help, are you on Windows 10 and recently had it updated?","replies":[{"poster":"igorpo","date":"2017-12-20T05:53:12.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Setting do sync properly, the issue is I cannot even rebind MB4 and MB5 to anything only in LoL.

For Macs, you may need to locate an app that will allow those buttons to match a binding on your keyboard, instead of adjusting them in-game.
