I found these really cool and I was wondering if you can get banned for using these. They give no unfair advantage and are purely cosmetic. Ive heard people say they have gotten banned for using custom voices but others say its safe. I have a friend who uses the japanese voices and he says its safe. If someone could tell me I would appreciate it. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T21:19:24.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind that altering or changing any of the game files could upset how well you can run the game, as well as the fact that some of those third party programs/files could potentially contain virus's or other malicious software.
