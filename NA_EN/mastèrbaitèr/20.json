Everyone says Cass is in a bad spot, but i decided to random a support yesterday and got Cass.\n\nLet me explain a bit about this.\n\nCass needs stacks to be good. Stacks are mainly based on seconds enemies are poisoned. Its more of a kill lane but, Cass has serious zoning potential that only makes her strong. She might be a little squishy early on, but at that point you have a poke comp no different that cait/sona(w/o the healing and buffs).\n\nAt level 6, if you get hard engaged, you can turn the fight with an easy front faced ult and pump out twin fangs to do massive damage and heal.\n\nI started a typical ap support mage build with frosthief to spell(didnt upgrade to queens) then jumped right into a tear and rod of ages.\n\nI am not sure if i should have maxed twin fang first, but for zoning potential i maxed q instead because of the dot, range, and damage","replies":[]}
