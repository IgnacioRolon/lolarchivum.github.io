It was more of a challenge to play it that way and i find it fun.\r\n\r\nThe q does do some damage, and does do true damage, but no spells have any ad scaling. The main gist of it is nomally to play it top.\r\n\r\nYou run ad runes with hybrid pen and armor seals, and i typically run cdr glyphs.\r\n\r\nMost top laners will be mellee and few ranged, but ahris range is pretty decent.\r\n\r\nThe gimmick is simple. Get big ad, farm easy, and harass a ton.\r\n\r\nLiterally everytime he goes to cs, free harass.  If they try to engage on you, charm for some free q + w+auto dmg, and just trade freely. \r\n\r\nThe other part to that gimmick is your ult. While you have no ad scaling or steroids, you still have her high mobility, allowing for easy roams mid for ult+charm kills to get you fed.\r\n\r\nI have beaten several renektons top(which is funny) and many other champs which frequent top with this.\r\n\r\nIt does lose(obv, it's a dumb build), but it definitely wins too.","replies":[]}
