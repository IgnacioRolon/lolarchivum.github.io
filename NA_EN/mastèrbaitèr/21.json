Everything else has been replaced within the last 6 months, but i would actually like to build a better rig in a higher price bracket.\r\n\r\nOf course i would have no need for the old one, but i really don't want to sell it piece by piece.\r\n\r\nIf you were to buy gaming parts, would it be in pieces? O would you rather buy a whole system?\r\n\r\nI am attempting to sell it as a \"Preconfigured\" system ready to go out of the box(No assembly, all Programs installed, pre OC at stable clocks etc) but have no experience selling my old systems as i usually give them to family and friends. This time i have nobody left to give them to, so might as well sell it.","replies":[]}
