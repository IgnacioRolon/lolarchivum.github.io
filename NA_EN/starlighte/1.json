I've mained Syndra since she came out and have played her through the ups and downs. I am very happy that you guys are acknowledging that she was nerfed a bit too much. I have some thoughts:\n\n1. I read through the patch notes dealing with the nerf (5.1).  I understand that her being a lane bully in counter pick scenarios is the main reason behind the nerf. From a purely statistical point-of-view, she had an almost perfect 49-51% win-rate. Even if she can be a lane bully, what is the reason behind re-balancing a champ that seemed pretty balanced?  I think it is pretty sad that she dropped from a 50% win-rate to a 42% win-rate (lowest in the game). \n\n2. I remember how buggy she was on release!  Besides the bug fixes that helped a lot, I know that she was buffed post-release (1.0.0.148). I remember those buffs making a night and day difference when playing her.  Particularly, her Q was buffed to 70/110/150/190/230 from 60/100/140/180/220 (release). In 5.1, Q's base damage was reduced to 50 / 95 / 140 / 185 / 230 from 70/110/150/190/230...   That means that release Syndra had a higher level 1 Q than current Syndra. Because there isn't numerical data on the nerf for E, it is hard to quantify the nerfs on her E.  I agree that some stuns were very generous. Before 5.1, I considered release Syndra her lowest point as a champion... Now that I have had two patches to play nerfed-Syndra, I believe she is at her worst point.  I feel like some bugs were reintroduced as well (stun detection on Q+E combo at close range).   It feels like all of those issues are compounded with the itemization changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2015-02-13T16:10:47.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can an analysis of the Q+E hitbox/stun bug be prioritized with the width increase?
