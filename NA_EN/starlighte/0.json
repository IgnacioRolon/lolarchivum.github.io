The passion is ebbing from this board, and the growth at which it is doing so is exponential. Your continuous silence, has created two things. It has created a divide in the community where many refuse to believe or trust you anymore. These are the people that desperately don&#039;t want to see their favorite champion next on the rework list, because they&#039;re convinced you will remove everything that made them unique. Then, there is the group of the bated-breath faithful, who are slowly suffocating in your poignant absence, and silence.\n\nResentment and guarded hope, that&#039;s what your community is devolving into, and where are you to revitalize it? Locked in board room meetings 16 hours a day, with neither content to present nor time to offer to your lore-faithful? I think not. Here&#039;s what my humble opinion is: **you&#039;re afraid, because you have let this toxic resentment build up, and it is at critical mass after the retcon announcement.** Unless you perform perfectly, you are certain your performance will be crucified. You know what? That is rightfully so.\n\nForgiving the 3 years of Narrative silence (and many are not forgiving that grievance) you have what; 8 months of little production and a multitude of silences since the retcon? You know you&#039;ve done wrong to the community, and you think the only thing that will make it up to us is delivering perfect content. **YOU ARE WRONG IN THIS BELIEF.** The _first_ step in setting things straight, is to maintain your promise of continued communication, and to stop hiding behind bullshit excuses of \"If I&#039;m on the forums, I can&#039;t produce content.\" Sure, that may be true, but you not only gave your word (how much is it worth to you nowadays?) but your rate of production is slow enough that nobody cares if it becomes further slowed at this point. Currently, you&#039;re fighting the growing opinion that you guys simply aren&#039;t producing anything anymore. That your department is a number larger than -1 but less than 5. That you don&#039;t care, and that you don&#039;t have the budget even if you did.\n\nMend the rift, talk to your community. Everyday you remain silent, you turn more people against you and make the expectations for your _eventual_ reveal of new lores, that much more unlikely to be well-received.\n\nWith the Utmost Sincerity,\nA Growing-Resentful Player","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-05-04T08:47:43.989+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":2,"body":"The key problem with the narrative team's argument that they're trying to make up for their blunders by delivering to us a lot of something very high-quality and perfect is:\n\n1.

Narrative's silence is doing more harm than they realize, and they need to make adjustments. Regardless of scheduling or time conflicts, look at other Rioters on boards. IronStylus, Meddler, etc. rarely post while at work. They post at home, out of the office, when they do have a little bit of free time. And this is not to say that Narrative must give up all its free time away from work and bring work home with them, not in the slightest. But it definitely speaks to a lack of passion on the part of Narrative if they're unwilling to take their work home, and to the forums with them.\n\nForums suck sometimes. And people can be critical, cruel, and crass, but that is NO excuse for doing further damage to your lore-faithful by continued silence. We've had 3 years of it, and you've even come out and recognized as a department that its unacceptable. Now we're falling back into those same tracks...

It those that are at the top who consider spoiling stuff to be worse than communicating it upfront.

Let me clarify.\n\nRiot leadership absolutely thinks that story is important. This is one of the reasons that Narrative has been so aggressive in leveling up as a discipline. We've restructured, we're in the midst of a big push to hire more great people and so on. We're currently undergoing the kind of change that Art has done. We want you to look at characters and stories in the same way you can look at some of the old splash and then look at the new. \n\nIt's simply that the best ways to tell story are being researched and tested. What media, what teams etc. Those are the discussions, not whether or not we need story at Riot.\n\nThe changes we have been undergoing are to create special things for players to engage with. We weren't built to do that as a Discipline or from a Product Team standpoint. The changes we are making are to allow for those things in the long term. There are growing pains, but we're getting there.\n\nAnd here's where me saying there will be something in a month is a problem and why I don't usually do it: The imagination of what that will mean (you're talking about us having rewritten all bios for the Champions, which just isn't feasible in that amount of time), to you as a player is unlikely to be matched by the release as you are going to expect a lot due to the time that has passed.\n\nThat's understandable, but, as I said, much of that time has been spent in restructuring, growing and refocusing the Discipline (all while working very hard on things like Kalista, Bard, Ekko, [a certain river dwelling fellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9RM4HwwoKs&feature=youtu.be), and more.\n\nWhat you will see in a month is a response to feedback, including that on these boards, about how we introduce a champion to you in their bio/intro/[insert name of background here]. Ant in Oz might put something together on our thinking, if not, I'll be around to talk about it. Plus some other writing I can't talk about. But I think you'll like it.\n\nThink of it as a written format that's a platform to build from. A move towards some of the things we used to do that players on these boards like, in a way that we feel ups that quality we're striving for.\n\nAgain, I hope that makes sense. Though I'm fully anticipating some chagrin, I hope people will also see what we're trying to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2015-06-21T22:55:13.599+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bvhOElyf,comment-id=002400010000,timestamp=2015-06-21T22:30:55.432+0000)\n>The imagination of what that will mean (you're talking about us having rewritten all bios for the Champions, which just isn't feasible in that amount of time), to you as a player is unlikely to be matched by the release as you are going to expect a lot due to the time that has passed.\n> \n> That's understandable, but, as I said, much of that time has been spent in restructuring, growing and refocusing the Discipline \n\nSo I want to spend some time and focus on what you've said here, because hindsight is 20/20.\n\nNobody can really argue that the timing of the retcon and the fact that there was nothing to replace it was abysmally done. I doubt you would argue that either. I think we also get that restructuring an entire department is difficult at best, impossible at worst (while trying to produce narratively cohesive material) and we can argue whether or not the material released since the retcon is good or bad. _Cadence has been, and appears to be, far too slow._ At this point there really isn't any explanation or excuse as to why champions that are \"in limbo\" with the retcon directly destroying parts of their lore, are not fixed. This should have been priority number one. You can't just keep waving the \"We were restructuring.\" wand at every mistake that has been made along the way. \n\nIt **IS** perfectly feasible to expect that every bio, which was damaged by the removal of the IoW, is fixed by now. 9 months, and many months prior to the announcement of the retcon, was time that could have been spent mapping out, and executing on altering the bios of champions like Kayle, Morgana, Jax, Cho'gath, etc. I'm sorry to say, but suggesting that it isn't feasible, is setting the bar quite low.\n\nJaredan I'm not trying to harp on you, but you have to have a perspective from this side of the fence. We have none of the inside knowledge that you do. We have been promised for months now that Riot is listening... They hear us... They can't wait to show us what they're cooking... And we get champions like Bard, and Ekko, which no offense to their respective narrative designers, but just feel shallow. We're promised quality being improved, communication will be better, and cadence will increase. And time and time again, things either get punted (tech issues), ignored (cadence), or shit happens (communication).\n\nYour department is currently toting the biggest blemish across Riot's disciplines. And like I tried to delve into with the OP of this thread, your (Narrative's) continued silence and lack of tangible results, only continues to exacerbate the problem. As time goes on, the expectation gets higher. As the expectation gets higher, the likelihood that Narrative will be able to deliver gets slimmer. As that gets slimmer, the resentment, anger, and frustration get greater. As those get greater, time and quality will have higher expectations. (Do you see how this cycle will NEVER end once it gets going?)\n\nAt the end of the day... The cadence of which you guys have moved through with this retcon, has turned the lore-faithful into a powder keg.\n\nI'm afraid to see what happens if expectations aren't met in the coming month(s)... (and this isn't because of your month timeline promise... this has been building to a boiling point since you fell ill and narrative went dark for several months)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-06-21T22:35:46.337+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":">We want to give you content to talk about rather than talk about the issues due to a lack of content.\n\nWhat about the issues that aren't the lack of content?

Even if that's their goal, I would question their decision: what a setting needs is a certain magic, a certain internal chemistry. I think, for all its faults, the old League universe had that. This new League universe? It's pretty hollow. It's overproduced and hollow. It does everything just right, hits all the authorial buzzwords and media reqs, but it has no heart. It's like a Hollywood movie: the product of a truly painful volume of highly paid talent, gone over a thousand times with fine-toothed combs looking for any hints of a \"mistake\", venturing nothing, risking nothing, surprising no one, inspiring no one.\n\n>If I'd started League a couple weeks ago, I'm pretty sure I'd never have started writing League stories or becoming invested in the universe. I'm fairly certain I'd never have started Factions. There's nothing here that inspires. Nothing novel or interesting. Just a bunch of well-produced intro-marketing pieces for new Champions and skins.\n\n>The original League universe was stupid as hell sometimes, but it caught the eye. I mean, a fantasy UN created to prevent the world's destruction through magical WMDs, an interconnected fantasy universe with newspapers and ray guns and knights all crashing together into one surreal metropolis: these are eye-catching ideas. The new Runeterra? \"Here's Ekko. He is from a place called Zaun. It's basically Shadowrun with some extra mutants. Now watch him exercise his agency to confront a difficult challenge and emerge from the experience having grown as a person.\" It is absolutely the way to write a character story. It is correct. It is professional. It is dull as hell. The original characters in League didn't have such well-produced backstories; their backstories were crazy grab-bags of random events and flashes of personality. But the idea of all these characters, most of whom were ripped off from one place or another, joining the League together and meeting one another? Whoa. That's kind of a neat idea. What if a frontier sheriff and an Arthurian knight ended up crossing paths? I can work with this. No individual faction in Runeterra is particularly interesting, either; they're all rehashes of standard fantasy tropes. But putting them all together on one planet? That's pretty freaking interesting. That gets my attention. I can write stories about that. That's fun.

Unless some serious optimization is made within the next half year or so, I can't imagine that all of the \"chapter 1s\" for all of the city-states/factions/regions/dimensions (unless the Void gets retconned into a corner of the ever-expanding Valoran, R.I.P. whatever planets Malphite/Nasus/Kayle came from) will be done within the next 5 years considering the current pace, and then comes actual meaningful development beyond that...\n\nIt's good that you guys are sticking to your guns however stacked the odds seem at the moment even if it's mostly just empty promises and the occasional comic or music video (that, again, serves more to establish than develop or flesh out), although I do hope that, if things don't work out, that all of you men and women in Narrative take the lessons you've learned and have yet to learn into whatever project(s) Riot has in store for the future. \n\nIt's a shame to see a game I loved, and want to love again, in such a state, but if you guys are as passionate as you constantly say you are, maybe y'all can find a way to turn it around.

Nope but they are driven by a stylistic sense. They did not need the lore, they just made art.

Even without knowing lore you can make identifications through looks, comments and play styles.

Now you are saying that i do not belong cause i brought a legit example of how lore is not used to identify with in game characters.

If they would have kept that up they now would have created sth. similar to warcraft  - a brand on it´s own right, sth. you can really work with in all directions. But as it is they decided to totally neglect it and only live of their snowball hype of being the most popular moba. But if that ever comes to an end they sit on nothing.

If someone were to give me a sheet a paper with the text: Check the BOX that explains why you _started_ playing League of Legends...\n\n...I would probably check the box saying a friend got me into playing this game, because that is certainly the primary reason. I would never have gotten into this game without my beloved friends skyping late on friday evenings.\n\nHowever, what if they gave me the text: Check the BOXES that explain why you _continue_ to play League of Legends...\n\n...I would probably check several boxes, them being my friends, the forums/boards, and the fantastic lore discussions that my friends could have day in and day out at lunch. Just because something didn't get me to _start_ a game does not mean it holds little value, or that it doesn't help me continue to be immersed in the League community.\n\nHowever...it is probably true that I would still continue playing this game even without the lore. But it certainly makes me a happier consumer, and it made my day when new lore came out on a regular basis","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
