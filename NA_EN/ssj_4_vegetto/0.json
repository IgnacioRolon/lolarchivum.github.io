Did no damage, and he wasn't blind.

What I mean is, the blind is so bugged, I don't even think it should be on the ability tooltip.\n\nThe Trynd example is the first thing I thought of.  When you Q a spinning Trynd, it DOES NOT BLIND HIM.  I have died from a Trynd more than once, from him slowing me, then spinning into melee range of me, and as he is spinning, I turn and Q him as his spin ends... EVEN WITH THE BLIND ICON OVER HIS HEAD, his very first autoattack out of the spin crits and kills me.\n\nAnother one Ive noticed is Yi.  But maybe this is supposed to happen.  Ive again, more than once been autoattacking a Yi, almost dead, I Q him, and the moment my Q hits, he also uses his Q.... which yes does the damage like its supposed to but since I'm alone his Q only jumps to me, and lasts a fraction of a second, he is not blinded when he comes out of it and ends up killing me on the next autoattack when he should be blinded.  Unless using his alpha strike is supposed to completely negate my blind and remove it.\n\nLast one I've noticed is Jax when hes using his dodge.  His dodge is only supposed to ignore autoattacks, and lessens the damage of AOE attacks.... nothing about abilities status effects. A Jax running towards me, uses his E, jumps... I land my Q on him as he starts his jump.  He lands, jump does its damage, but so does his next autoattack which is empowered and hes blinded... Now I thought his empower was a basic attack modifier meaning IT SHOULD BE AFFECTED BY BLIND just like his passive third hit is affected by it.  NOPE, they both, while blinded, do their full damage.  \n\nOn a side note, even playing as Teemo, who has a working blind... I've noticed getting hit by someone who has a shiv while blinded still procs the shiv damage even when the autoattack misses...","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2015-02-03T00:48:19.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I hate this glitch, really can chance how a game goes out when you are almost about to kill that Yi but than one auto attack takes 1/2 or 1/4 of your health even when you landed that blind{{champion:133}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2015-02-02T21:27:53.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noticed this about a year ago, too bad she isn't a popular champion or she would have all her bugs fixed the patch after they were reported but Quinn just gets ignored.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-02-03T02:34:32.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"blind just work in weird ways.
