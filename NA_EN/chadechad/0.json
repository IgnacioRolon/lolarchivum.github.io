I was attacking a level 3 kassadin at the end of a round and would have easily killed him and the champion next to him (not a lulu or nid so no heals) except he would cycle between levels 3, 2, 1 and back to 3 again. Something to look into for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-14T22:18:15.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I raised the same issue earlier.  There's something legitimately broken with the cursed blade that actually heals your enemies.  Don't ever build it until they fix it.  I've won matches because my carries were saved from the enemy's cursed blades.","replies":[]}]}
