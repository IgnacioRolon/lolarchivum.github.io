Riot is working on it, and things will be back to normal shortly.\n\nYou can check to see the server status at ( status.leagueoflegends.com )\n","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-06-27T01:56:34.877+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a bunch of man-children exerting the little bit of control they have on someone else.

He was placed on extra duty, temporarily lost his rank of SPC and was demoted to PFC, and lost half pay for 6 weeks.\n\nI still gain IMMENSE satisfaction from that. And if any adult male ever admitted to DDOS'ing Riot in person... if it were within reasonable privacy, I would attempt to physically humiliate that person or if I had gained physical proof as well as a confession, I would report them to the authorities and hold them until arrival.\n\nSome people go FAR out of their way for vigilante justice because we like that it that way.","replies":[{"poster":"ReportObama4AFK","date":"2016-06-27T03:20:12.900+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is a great story.
