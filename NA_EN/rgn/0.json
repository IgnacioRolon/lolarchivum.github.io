I meet both of the criteria and I have for some time now. One thing I noticed (this may be the cause) is the area where is says I need to be level 7 it shows my old summoner name \"Reignbow\" (I highlighted it in white). When I originally made this account a long time ago the name was \"Reignbow\" and was only level 1 or 2 then I did not play the game for a very long time. When I decided to give this game another shot years later I came back to the same account and someone had taken my name so I changed it to \"Rgn\". So I'm guessing for some reason the boards still think my summoner name is \"Reignbow\" and I'm level 1 or 2. However, my name and icon are updated correctly on in the top right corner of this website.\r\n\r\nI also just noticed even now as I type this it says i am posting this as \"Reignbow\" below. It should be \"Rgn\"","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T23:09:47.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your account just needed to sync up with the boards.
