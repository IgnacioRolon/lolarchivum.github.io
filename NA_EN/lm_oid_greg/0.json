I would say one in every 3 or 4 clicks will actually be read on the game, and my camera will not lock on, no matter which option I choose to try and make it do so. The camera will also not allow me to move it by moving my mouse I have to left click on the map in order to move, which makes it almost impossible to land anything. I have tried resetting all my settings (video, interface, etc.) and even as far as quitting and joining the game again and the issue persists. However after that game the next one is almost always fine. I would say 1 in every 4 games, maybe 5 are having this issue. I most commonly play ARAM, but it does happen on the rare occasion I play normal modes too. Not specific to any game mode. Any advice to resolve?","replies":[]}
