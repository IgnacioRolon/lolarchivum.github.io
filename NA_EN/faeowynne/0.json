I realize that makes it _pretty_ old, but I still need to be able to play! I tried to fix my masteries in the queue, but the X to get me out of that screen did not appear, and I got pegged with a queue dodger penalty. This has happened twice (though admittedly it's likely my fault the second time. I should have known.) Please fix this!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T18:03:20.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your resolution might be a bit too small to support, but you might be bale to do a workaround for now.  Try seeing if you can reduce yoru client's size by tapping Ctrl + Down Arrow.  Try this in a custom first though, just in case you run into any issues.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
