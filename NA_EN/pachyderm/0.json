I'm reminded of the fact that this game isn't about improving alone, but improving _faster_ than the rest of the playerbase improves. \n\nI do wish Coy Coy the best of luck in his endeavors. He seems to have found his stride and will likely leave iron soon. Thanks for the game, mate. \n\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=coycoy","replies":[]}
