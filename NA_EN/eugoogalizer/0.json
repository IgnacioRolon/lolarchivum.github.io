People say games like Overwatch are not competition because their demographic is different than MOBA&#039;s, but if it&#039;s taking away game time from league....isn&#039;t it a threat?

Every single game you mentioned Character become stronger off Gold from Kills or Equipement/Loot. In Overwatch there is no Gold/Loot. If you teammate is feeding it sucks but it's still carryable. You can leave, he WILL be punished for trolling (unlike League) and once you respawn you just have to analyze the map and use the proper Hero for your team/etc. \n\nOverwatch will take an INSANE amount of time to master. I've seen 6 Winston's comp work, There's so much possibilities, since if you die, you aren't snowballing a member of the other team, and if you work together, you can still put the lowest skilled player on your team as the tank and just tell him to shield up.\n\n\n\nNone of that is possible in every single game you mentioned. If people feed in League, they snowball the enemy. In Dota same thing. In Starcraft you fall behind in upgrades. In Counter strike you fall behind in Gold/Weapons. In WoW you fall behind in Loot. In Ultima I don't even know wtf that game is. \n\n\nIn Overwatch, you die, you give up position. Your team works as an Army Group and it feels amazing. Built in Voice comms make it nice for you to hear your teammates and chat like you're an actual **TEAM**. Not to mention, so far the community in Overwatch is pretty darn nice","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-05-13T20:46:40.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much TF2","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2016-05-13T09:13:17.091+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Least we can do is enjoy the highs while they last. \nAnd the Overwatch Beta left me with a very satisfying high, bring more on I say I'll be glad to find something to largely replace League in my schedule.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-05-13T16:14:43.237+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"And an example of why I hate the meta; it makes games dull.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bellows","date":"2016-05-13T02:10:12.505+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Far less, and its only declining.

I wasn't afraid to talk to give advice in fear of \"FUCK YOU YOU NOOB STFU IM THE BEST BRONZE CHALLENGER PLAYER EVER\" attitude that's all over League.\n\nTeamwork just happened because we were a team, and it genuinely felt like I was playing on teams, not a bunch of random strangers on a Ego trip waiting till someone says 1 word to begin the intentional feeding.\n\n\nIf things ever went wrong I could just leave.

Again, my hope is by the end of this season, they'll have gathered all of the data (yes, REAL data this time, Lyte...) they require to post a \"what we learned from season 6\" dev blog where this season was actually just a giant experiment all along, and the season 7 design philosophy will go back to focusing on what makes the game fun to play rather than fun to watch.\n\nThen again, pride-fueled insanity is a real danger to  devs who work on games that grew to big too fast *cough* Warcraft *cough* and they forget about the community that built the game up from nothing, becoming so detached that they feel they don't need feedback anymore.  Kinda like J. Allen \"You don't want that. You think you do but you don't\" Brack. \n\nIf that's the case, the only way feedback works, which sadly seems the case already, is there's usually only change when the devs feel the same way...which isn't effective because the devs tend to do whatever they want anyway regardless of feedback, at least from a gameplay and balance point of view.","replies":[{"poster":"Fenikkusu1","date":"2016-05-13T17:58:16.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What scares me is that doesn't Blizzard have that kind of attitude towards its playerbase as well?

I'm confident that the community is in good hands, but I've been burned by Blizz before for being hopeful.  It depends on what Activi$ion thinks about its success and if they decide they want even more money - that's when things might get ugly.","replies":[{"poster":"Fenikkusu1","date":"2016-05-13T18:06:26.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh joy.

A realistic thinking person!\n\nA few things to note here:\nI don't think you enjoyed past seasons a lot more than you do this one, you might! but I don't think you did.\nIt's most likely that you remembered some specific thing about LoL in the past, and it's a lot more fun in your memories than it actually was in reality. AKA: nostalgia xP\n\nI've been playing less LoL recently, because I simply don't have time :l Yeah...\nI've also tried smite, because I'm a huge mythology lover. But it didn't give me that enjoyment League gave me... \nSo I'm still playing LoL.\n\nI'd recommend you to think bad about the past, think about what champions you used to play in earlier seasons, and try them again.\nI've been getting back into Renekton recently. His new lore refreshed my love for him, and playing him refreshed my love for LoL.\n\nHave fun playing whatever you end up doing ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-05-13T17:20:15.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Only casuals turn to Overwatch.
