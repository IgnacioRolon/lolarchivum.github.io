I love your game so much but from the balances to dynamic queue, I just can&#039;t see the point in purchasing any more RP.  I like an even playing field, but this season just isn&#039;t cutting the mustard.  I finally reached my promo after a constant grind where I split the first two games.  What do I get next?  I queue in a game only to get absolutely destroyed in my third game.  I&#039;m far from a good player, but I know I can handle myself fairly well in Silver  even when losing, I&#039;m not too far behind my laner.  Being completely outclassed by this Yasuo and seeing how good he was vs my teammates made me think something was up.  Looking up his match history, he has gone 17-3 in his last 20.  I know streaks happen, but I just find this one fishy.   Even if it legit, I can&#039;t but help think that dynamic queue has made this hard for a solo player to climb.  I work 40 hours a week, so I don&#039;t typically have a duo or trio to regularly queue with.\n\nI know I&#039;m not smart enough to quit league all together because of that addicting pull it has on me, but I don&#039;t see the rank climb worth it anymore.  I love my Gold morgana skin, but at this point it&#039;s just not fun to even try.  As someone mentioned in a previous post, DQ feels like a form of boosting that you seem to be okay with.\n\nI know in the grand scheme of things, my wallet won&#039;t dent your revenue, but for someone who spends more on here than the average player, I hope it is a wakeup call.\n\nKeep trying to improve you game, I really don&#039;t want to quit altogether.","replies":[{"poster":"LaughingStapler","date":"2016-04-10T09:35:46.948+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's not even about being unable to climb.

I remember a long time back I was in a ranked game and someone raged about how shit I was and his buddy would stomp me 1v1 bla bla bla. I needed mechanics practice so I said I'd play against his friend if he wanted to, and it was so far back it was just customs on SR instead of the 1v1 mode they made. I screwed up an engage and had first death, but the guy said he thought you played it out when I said he won, so I just manipulated side waves and out rotated/out farmed him and after the 3rd unanswered tower he apologized for his friend being a jerk and added me to his friends list so he could help me w/ mechanics and laning and I could help him learn better rotations and push strats. Just bc someone doesn't have the mechanics, doesn't mean they have the same impact.

Still there isn't much I can do for my teammates and I can put some of the blame there on Dynamic Queue.  I can do that because most games for solo players do come down to whoever has the best premade.  Furthermore, if the enemy premade contains a jungler, their odds increase.  You can be fully aware until you're blue in the face, but if a solo player is the jungler and the enemy trio of mid, top, and jungler are there to contest every blue while your team don't even bat an eye, there's not much you can do.\n\nIf a trio ganks top lane for a 4 man gank(and I've seen this many times) while your mid and bot continue to last hit instead of trading towers or rotating, there's not much you can do.

It's about the system's imbalance(which I am crediting riot has been tweaking and working hard on), and the fact that one person who is clearly ranks ahead queuing with 2 other people helping them move up to rank.  It shows how imbalanced DQ is at the moment.  It's brought me to think that the climb(or supporting financially) isn't worth it at the time being.\n\n** I never said being a duo makes someone a better player.**  If you were diamond and queuing with me, it doesn't make me better.  It just makes me climb into a rank that I don't clearly belong when we're not queuing together.  Not only did you just screw over 5 opponents per game by boosting me, but now you're screwing over 4 other players when I'm a silver in plat game.  Add in DQ and now you have 2 other \"plats\" struggling in a rank they don't belong.  That's what I have an issue with.
