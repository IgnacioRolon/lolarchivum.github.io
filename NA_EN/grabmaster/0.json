I feel proud of my ranked stats and just wanted to show anything is possible just do your best every game. Always improve, you can blame a feeder but sometimes you can pull together as a team and win. Throws happen in bronze. I know people always say exactly what I just said but legit do it. Focus on doing your absolute best.  Just play to improve and you will improve. Had a 2 and 32 xin zhao and we still won. Always play your best and I bet you will gain elo. NO LONGER BRONZE!!!
