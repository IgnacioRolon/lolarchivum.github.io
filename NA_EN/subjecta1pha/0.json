So as soon as I launch the client it tells me \"We have restored this installation to an older version it gives me the traditional of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version\" upon hitting OK it gives me the League will Patch in 9,8,7, etc. The main issue here is it either shows the patching bar with only .2 mbs needed to patch to which it goes to .9 and then says \"An issue occurred while trying to patch restart and try again(basically)\" or it pulls the mini patch window with no progress at all and no shown amount needed to patch(no .2mbs or anything shown at all). I have tried to wait it out and no progress accrues what so ever even over a 2 hour period of time, I have done the DNS nonsense to no avail and I have set my computers clock back and the time and it still gives me the same issue. If anyone knows of a fix it would be very much appreciated, Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-03T20:38:17.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you haven't done so yet, try giving the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) a go. Make sure to turn on the **force repatch** option and let that run. It should be able to apply the patch that way, but hit me back up if not.","replies":[{"poster":"SubjectA1pha","date":"2017-09-04T15:09:31.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried the Repair Tool with the force repatch option selected, and it still says the \"We have restored this installation to an older version.
