He saved allies I focused while he himself was really tanky. What are his weaknesses so I can abuse him next time?\n\nWere you trying to 1v2?\n\nHeavy, sustained burst is problematic. Once the shield has to be popped, its on cooldown for around 10s, which is a huge window of vulnerability - especially as the shield decays by itself. The devour ability's on around a 10s cooldown as well - once he pops both, he's more or less out of tricks that I'm finding. Hide behind a minion, then burst him while your ally (again, don't 1v2) is hitting him to force him to pop his shield - he'll likely be building HP, not armor. Once the shield's down to save himself, even if he devours his buddy he'll still be downed quick and you can proceed to brutalize em.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shloonz","date":"2015-07-10T05:19:04.638+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"Tahm is seriously overpowered.
