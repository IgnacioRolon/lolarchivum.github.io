I know it is the most useful, versatile summoner spell, but you are a tanky support, not a carry. You don't need it as much to get away, because you should be baiting the enemy team to save your carry. And it isn't as useful as it once was to get away anyway, what with the obsession with champions whose mobility has no limit. Udyr, Zed, Lee Sin, and other champs can follow you over walls easy, without using their flash at all. (Udyr just runs around the wall fast enough to catch you) Therefore, it is a viable option to run spells which enhance your ability to fight these champions, and prevent the situations where Flash would be needed.\n\nTake my Heimerdinger game for instance. I always run Barrier+Heal, which allows me to be more secure in my turret ranges, even at low health. When someone tries to engage, I can instantly have a health pool twice as large as before. \n\nWith Janna, I take Teleport+Heal, which gives me a quick back, allowing for more daring pokes, with less wasted time. I can also still heal my carry, which, in addition to my shield, usually turns the tide of a fight. Then, late game, I am fast enough to run away from any fight where I am not surrounded.\n\nThese are just a few examples of times Flash not only isn't necessary, but actually preferred to NOT take.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SelflessTeammate","date":"2015-01-05T14:37:57.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

The upgrade to smite is only there to make the spell useful outside of the jungle for junglers. In all situations, exhaust is a better pick than smite if you're not going to jungle.\n\nI can answer that\n\nMerc Treads-provide nothing for the team benefit. Big benefits of it is just Tenacity for support, ergo useless.\n\nSpirit Visage-Provides nothing for a team benefit. Big benefits of the item is MR and HP for support, ergo useless.\n\nJuggernaut-Provides a 50% slow every 60 second, as a jungler, this has been my go to item on literally every single jungler, regardless of the recommended knife for that champion, I can not stress how many kills it has managed to secure for me, its incredibly powerful, the team utility on it is insane. To have it on a support, that would be rather scary since the threat is ever constant.  Not only that, it never falls off, 50% slow is still deadly even as it hits late game. \n\nNot only that Juggernaut provides 2 of the three things your item provides, it also brings a huge addition to team fight, laning, and cleaning up. It also only occupies one item slot as oppose to your two. \n\nI'll say it again, running smite/slow will be an incredibly niche pick, but it most definitely can work when the need for it rises. If you're starting Gromp side, you get a HUGE advantage over the opposing lane with the poison damage harass, in addition to the slow effect of smite. \n\nAs it stands, exhaust is largely useless again AD caster since their damage comes in burst before you can get the exhaust down on them. Looking at some of the more popular champions in the preseason, AD casters have been getting incredibly more popular, Lucian, Graves, and Corki seem to be the trinity of ADC at the current moment, with Ezreal being another popular pick, of those four, three have damage tied into burst of which, you need to have incredibly fast reaction to negate their burst with exhaust.\n\nDon't believe me? Look at some of the current Challenger/Plat/Masters games that have been played, you'll noticed many supports are running ignite again over exhaust now, specifically because of the reason I mentioned above.\n\nIgnite falls off hard, smite does not.\n\nI would also like to remind to get the slow attachment, it only costs around 700 gold, hardly inefficient in the slightest. You can just merely buy the base component, then upgrade it to juggernaut in the later game, the same way supports do that with sightstones.
