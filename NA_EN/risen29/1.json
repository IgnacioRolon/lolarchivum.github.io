Seems like too much of his value is tied up in his ultimate for him to win so consistently. Unless it's really just that powerful and braindead to execute. It covers the whole bridge and goes so far that you'll either root the entire enemy team to be pounced on or force them to retreat entirely from the turret. But if your team can't follow up, or you use it at a bad time, you're just a potato sitting around in lane for 2 minutes while you wait to try again. \n\nSion, I'm having more trouble figuring out. Is it just that his passive is that powerful in a 5vs5 clustered ARAM environment? You might be getting rewarded for suiciding into the enemy team with your ultimate and then pounding out a kill or two after death. I don't think his ultimate by itself is particularly powerful in this environment. \nHe's probably helped by the fact that his Q is a stupidly long range and easy to hit poke, unlike most juggernauts - but I don't think that alone is going to carry him through ARAM. \n\nI'm also surprised that Xerath's winrate is not higher. I personally would prefer getting Xerath over Ziggs in ARAM.\nXerath has the highest pick rate though. So obviously people think he is the best for this, but either they overestimate his value or people just aren't good at mechanically executing on him. Maybe a ziggs is easier to hit stuff with.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-04-03T23:43:01.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why are Sion and Maokai in the top tier winrates?\n\nAll Maokai has to do is max E, and throw his saplings in bushes. Minions will aggro them and they will more than likely hit a champion. All you need is two AP items to really chunk a squishy with his E. Even then, the base damage alone is good enough to deal decent damage to squishier targets.\n\n As you said his ult covers the entire width of the map. It will more than likely hit someone.\n\nSion has CC, damage and damage mitigation out the ass.  And he can use his Q in a bush and no one will see the indicator unless they have vision of him.\n\n>I'm also surprised that Xerath's winrate is not higher.

Especially his ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-03T22:54:55.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try encountering one of them in ARAM and you will understand.\n\nMaokai has more or less infinite sustain, and the amount of spam going around feeds his passive very rapidly.\n\nHis WQ is a great way for catching unsuspecting fools and throwing them into your team, or preventing people from escaping. It also interrupts nasty abilities or combos.\n\nSion is just a giant disruption that does way too much damage, nothing special going on there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2018-04-04T01:37:54.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maokai has those saplings that he pollutes the bushes with; makes entering them dangerous.  And it could be Sion's poke making him invaluable...\nAnd Ziggs is probably a more annoying opponent than Xerath given he can execute towers.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-04-04T01:51:54.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Executing towers is more of a minor perk, but not the main reason he's winning more.\nZiggs and Xerath are two of my favorites to play, and I can say in situations where the enemy is relentlessly pushing and looking to hard engage our team a lot with all-ins I would rather have Ziggs than Xerath. And, in ARAM, that describes the situation you face most of the time unless everyone on the enemy team got lucky with long range poke champions. \n\nFor many reasons:\n\n-Ziggs can output more sustained DPS more quickly at max range by spamming Q. Xerath has to charge up to get his range and the cooldown is higher.\n-Ziggs is able to spam Q and E in a way that actually helps deter the enemy from engaging. And it's easier to spam it out while you fall back and kite.  \n-The downside of Ziggs is that it's harder to hit at long range without being dodged, but this is somewhat offset by the ARAM map funneling people into a kill zone so you increase your chance of hitting someone. In normal games, this is also offset by the fact that the enemy team is diving yours, so you are more concerned with DPS than you are with range.\n-Ziggs has an ultimate that is better for instantly turning a teamfight in your favor. The ARAM map makes it easier for him to get the maximum impact out of it everytime he casts it. Xerath's ultimate takes longer, prevents you from continuing to fire, can miss easier, and leaves you vulnerable if you try to cast it near the enemy. \n\nXerath I normally prefer for standard games. For his CC, stronger waveclear, and his ability to more reliably burst enemies from max range in poke situations. I still think I'd prefer him for ARAM, although I may not do quite as well as with Ziggs. It's more of a preference thing, I like having more accurate long range poke and kill potential. I also know I can hit with it. \n\nI still find it hard not to attribute most of Zigg's superior winrate to the ease of use of his kit, when compared with Xerath.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2018-04-03T23:47:34.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are about 20 Marksmen in Aram , the number of champions is 130+\nSo the chance of having an adc in your team isn't high , you will mostly play against ap carries which can be countered with 1 MR item\nbesides , in aram Maokai can go full ap and still tanky as sh*t with tons of damage , Sion too","replies":[]},{"poster":"PatientPoet","date":"2018-04-03T23:03:11.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks in general are pretty OP in ARAM if you know what you're doing. The only exception of course, is if you get a team that sits under the turret the whole time to avoid poke but then you'd probably lose that game anyways by default.\n\nWhat makes Maokai uniquely strong in ARAM is his ability to deny use of the bushes via E spam. This is on top of all of his other strengths which the above poster already listed.
