Up to 10 seconds of invulnerability for your entire team. \nNow, I don&#039;t care how stupid your team is, as long as you time that ult right you should win every key teamfight. \nThe only reason hes never been nerfed is because hes trash at high elo or in competitive. Countered by an item buy that dispells his ultimate if cast on him. But low elo will never do this. \n\nHots has a few supports that heal a lot and have clutch save powers. Its not as braindead easy as omniknight, but considering the lack of players actually playing support in low elo, sometimes just by picking a hard healing support you&#039;ve already won. Your team might be nothing but four potatoes bumping into the other teams potatoes, but if your potatoes are being healed and saved at the right time then its not difficult for the teamfight to turn in your favor. This is aided but the fact that hots is nothing but teamfight brawling 24/7 with little macro strategy or laning to speak of. Plus, unlike LoL, healing is quite effective in HotS as a means of turning a fight around. \n\nI am unaware of any LoL supports that are powerful enough to give even low elo potatoes enough of a boost to actually carry games reliably from the support role. \n\nMaybe Sona could at her best, before all the nerfs. You ouput enough healing and movespeed that it was significant enough to give your team the edge in a potato vs potato aram fest bumping into each other down mid. \n\nThe only people I know of who have climbed out of low elo from support did it by being a carry support who roams, invades, and makes plays that dont involve support style abilities and roles. You&#039;re not really playing a support role at that point, you&#039;re playing a carry role on a support champion. \n\nIt would be like building omniknight for damage and carrying the game as a attack damage carry. You are no longer carrying as a true support. When you carry using your support abilities, then you can legitimately say you are a support that carries.\n\nIt seems like all of LoLs non-damage focused supports are designed around the assumption that your team is competent enough to leverage the small advantages and windows of opportunity you give them. \nThet dont really enable you to impart large enough advantages that even clueless potatoes who have no clue what you're doing for them can still come out on top.

He is probably the closest thing LoL has to a potato-saving low elo support. Him and Janna are the two contenders for that. But Janna doesn't see to have a good winrate until silver. Only Taric remains viable in bronze. \n\nAlthough when I last tried playing a lot of support at low elo, Taric had not yet been reworked. So I think it's time for me to give it another try with him.\n\nI think Sona was about the only one that truly worked regardless of whether or not your teammates had any game knowledge. But not after her numbers were gutted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-04-07T20:09:57.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP you must be joking. \nPlease go read threads in this forum about ADC being overpowered and shit.\nNow understand: Who got buffed to get us to this point?

You cannot reliably carry a game in low elo using a support whose success depends on the dice roll of whether or not your ADC is good.  \nYou need a support that can win teamfights for you even when your ADC is terrible.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-04-07T21:00:46.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose Nami does have a decent winrate, but I am puzzled as to why in bronze. I don't usually see her healing as that good in a teamfight. It's not a Janna ult. She's got a lot of knock ups and speed boosts/slows, which when taken together will grant your team positional and time advantages. But that presumes your team is competent enough to take advantage of those. I don't see it as an effective way to carry potatos without a clue.\n\nI suppose, on aggregate, you'll win more than you lose over time thanks to those marginal advantages being throw around each fight - but we're trying to talk about carrying a match, not aggregate marginal winrates over time. \n\nCarrying low elo implies having a very substantial winrate to carry you out of it quickly - based solely on your own superior performance in that game making the difference. I would be surprised if Nami can do that, as she seems too team dependant for it to work. Taric is, I think, the best hope for that. \nJanna is questionable. I think she has enough power to really mess with teamfights in a way that can carry potatoes, but she still depends more on her team having game knowledge than Taric.
