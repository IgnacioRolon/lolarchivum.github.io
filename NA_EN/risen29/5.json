His views reflect some others who have left. And I find that, even though I'm not anywhere near his level, the game is less satisfying and fun than it use to be for the same reasons. \nI'll link the video at the end of the post but I am going to give some bullet points of what he said so you don't have to watch a five hour video.\n\n\nHe's masters level. Streamer. Coached 1200 different players over the years. Even traveled to Korea to make Diamond 2 with masters MMR in less than a month from unranked. He also almost got hired as a playtester at riot. \nI have always felt like his analysis of what it takes to win in soloque was the best of anyone else on youtube. Not just because he knows what he's doing but because he's able to analyze and articulate concepts in a way that a lot of top players aren't. Which makes him a better teacher. \n\n\n**Overview and summary of conclusions from streamer’s video:**\nProblem 1: The newbification of the game, and the removal of individual skill expression from the game.\n---Every game goes through this phase where they try to make things easier on newbies. Newbies whine about dying to X because they aren't good. Rather than expect newbies to just learn and get good, X is nerfed. \n---Increased passive gold gain makes it harder to tell the good players from the bad. \n---They keep taking away skill expression that allows people to solo carry. The point is not that any one particular change is a problem, but when taken as a whole they all point towards riot's goal being to raise the skill floor of the game and lower the skill ceiling, constantly taking away the things that skilled/knowledgeable players use to get an advantage over their opponents. \n--- Laning is boring now. Easy sustain in top lane with stuff like Resolve and Doran’s Shield makes laning phase non-interactive and a waste of time. If he takes those two things, you can be the best top laner in the world but you'll never stop him from just passively farming. He invented the smite top tryndamere strat so he would actually have a way to impact the game when facing all these passive farming top laners. He would go kill the jungler, proxy farm, and take jungle champs after pushing his wave.\n---Whenever one dimensional playstyles and tanks become viable, skill expression goes away. \n---Winning lane doesn't even matter anymore. Laning is a waste of time. \n---It's harder to be a playmaker in this environment. And you're rewarded less for it. Punished too hard if you fail. High elo games are just about farming and not dying until it's time to do objectives or turrets. \n---Outplaying people doesn't matter much anymore for determining the outcome of a match. \n---Taking risks is not as rewarding. You're better off avoiding fights in most cases. \n---You're losing your ability to have control over the game. All roles feel like they have no individual agency to win the game. \n---You're also can't come back like you use to. It takes 40 minutes to lose a game that was already decided early on and the whole time you feel like you have no agency over the direction of it. It's not only unfun but it's bad for your streaming audience. \n---All of this is why LCS is so boring. \n---You use to be able to just laugh at the idiot troll on your team because you had confidence you could carry them anyway. But now all you can do is resent them and get angry at their stupid decisions because they are a barrier to your victory. (I wonder if this is why many people say the game feels like one person can lose you the game but one person can't win the game. Kind of like HotS; when you take away people's ability to solo carry then your team is only ever as strong as your weakest link. And if you have a really weak link then all the enemy team has to do to win is just not be as as incompetent as the weakest link on your team).  \n\n\nProblem 2: How they balance. And the attitude towards competitive. \n---Your gameplay pattern is never safe. You learn something, you master it, and they pull the rug out from under you constantly. \n---Riot doesn't balance objectively based on what is actually overpowered and what isn't. They balance based off how players feel. Newbs cry and feel bad because they don't know how to counter something or can't be bothered to change their playstyle. So the game is changed to make them feel better about being bad at the game. \n---Riot's balance team of top players doesn't have the final input on balance changes. Too many departments, with too many different levels of skill, have too much input on how the game is balanced. By trying to balance the game to be easier for bad players they are removing the skill expression from the game that allows good players to shine.\n---Riot postures themselves as a serious competitive game but really they are a casual game pretending to be a competitive game. \n---The playerbase also is not that competitive either, even in diamond/masters ranked. He regularly has that one guy on his team who wants to troll, or doesn't care about winning, or wants to try something he's never played before in ranked. And this is at masters level. This isn't good for streaming either, to have so much of your time wasted. It's frustrating because he is serious about wanting to get better and win but too many at that level of play don't feel the same. (This probably wasn’t as much of an issue until the game became harder to solo carry). \n----After coming home from the Korean server he was disappointed by the low quality of gameplay on NA. And it sucked having 70 ping instead of 7 ping. \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLOG9YE3BE\n**End of summarizing conclusions from streamer’s video.**\n\n\n**Now, the following is my personal take on it:**\nAlthough I am not anywhere near his level, I do feel the impact of a lot of this and it effects my desire to continue playing. \nI definitely feel like winning lane doesn't mean what it use to years ago. Winning lane moderately doesn’t mean anything. You either need to crush lane and roam to have an impact or you need to find a way to roam without winning lane. You can even completely lose your lane but it doesn’t mean anything as long as you can snowball bot lane by roaming.\nIt also feels like comebacks are not realistically possible like they use to be. You can’t stall things out and farm up. You can’t meaningfully mount a defense anymore under turrets. \nI definitely feels like sustain is too easy and nullifies a lot of the advantages you would otherwise get over your opponent in trades. And the late game sustain of ADCs nullifies skillful poke or makes them immune to skillful assassination in many cases. \nI am also surprised that people would play a champion for the first time in ranked. As someone who seriously wants to win and climb, it's annoying to have people trolling in ranked without a serious intention to win. \n\n\nA similar processes of newbification is why I lost interest in HotS. I didn’t really like the game’s lack of carry potential until I discovered splitpushing with the playstyles some heroes offered (You can't play anything like Sgt Hammer, Abathur, Lost Vikings, or Azmodon in LoL). In a game of shared levels and no items, strategic macro and pressuring lanes was the only way to have control over the course of the game. But eventually they stripped away the strategic elements of the game to be 100% teamfight brawler and made all the specialist heroes I loved playing useless. (I love pushing style heroes. Even since the original early days of Dota, I was always drawn to the ones that could push relentlessly). They basically removed the siege/push class from the game outright and I left, never looking back. Even though it was a fast and simple game, it still had enough strategy that I found it fun. When they took out the strategy and individual carry potential, there was nothing there left for me. \n\n\nI think what hits the hardest in LoL, though, is constantly feeling like the rug is pulled out from under me. Anytime I find a champion I like it gets nerfed into the ground until it’s either unplayable or simply not as fun as it use to be because they gutted what made it fun in the pursuit of balance. \n\n\nI played viktor before the LCS discovered him and he was my favorite champion. Now he's an unplayable mess. \nAzir was my first favorite champion, but LCS loved him too, so now he's a joke. \nTeemo? Nerfed into ground. \nKassadin? Another one of my first favorite champions. Now completely unplayable. \nI liked the old Fiora and Gangplank but their reworks robbed me of the playstyle I use to enjoy (I enjoyed fiora's all in 1vs9 carry potential, and gangplank's crit rune splitpush style). And I paid real money for the champions and skins. Now they sit on the shelf, unused. Because even though they may be good or viable they are no longer the champion I paid for.\nSwain. No longer fun for me after the rework. Completely different playstyle. Not the champion I bought. Wasted money again. \nMalz. Just not as fun as he use to be with void spam pushing down a lane. \nTalon. I like the rework conceptually, but he just isn’t that viable anymore. \nI have one champion right now in mind that I want to try to main, but I am certain it’s only a matter of time before they get gutted and nerfed to. Even though they aren’t a high winrate right now. Do I really want to waste my time like that?   \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Jhynx","date":"2018-04-14T18:41:37.893+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":8,"body":"I'm honestly speechless to how much our opinions on this game line up.\n\nYou nailed it with this post, i cant disagree with anything here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2018-04-14T20:03:58.314+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":2,"body":"With all due to respect but \n\n> I enjoyed fiora's all in 1vs9 carry potential\n\nis unhealthy.

I might be alone on this, but I much like the old WW over the new one.  Mechanically he was simple, but if you were really good with overall strategy in teh game, you had a lot of map control and his ult wasn't even his best skill.  I have only played him a handful of times now, and I do not like his newer kit.  He is still one of my top 3 champs in playtime even though I have played him only like 5 times total since the rework.  Even when people were saying he was weak, I was still doing really well as my play style is more about map control than burst and kill everything.","replies":[{"poster":"wiimaster4","date":"2018-04-15T16:54:26.622+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh i love new ww, feels way more skill expressive and enjoyable.

These are champions who previously had very straightforward kits that relied more on your ability to position and strategize, rather than landing skillshots, have now, ironically, been _dumbed down_ by shifting the aspect of skill towards landing abilities. \n\nRiot seems to want to get rid of champions with simple kits, because they just aren't \"modern\" enough. Each new champ that comes out has more and more overbearing abilities, with passives half a page long and a slew of complex effects just for the sake of complexity. You can see this clearly with Zoe, Rakan, Xayah etc. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind a champion having a complex moveset, but with the reworking spree Riot has been on, it seems like they're hellbent on removing simpler champions from the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2018-04-14T19:23:50.627+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":9,"body":"Almost forgot Neace existed.

You learn something, you master it, and they pull the rug out from under you constantly.\n\nI wanna specifically get into this part because I find interesting parallels because I grew up in the FGC. Bear with me because this is a semi-long post.\n\nIn the FGC, your play pattern was never safe. Ever. Since Day 1. You were always victim to patches, version updates, etc. Now, the one thing I'll say these had over league/dota/etc. is that you could go back to playing Championship edition rather than final HD remix. But your competition would move on and you would be left dipping your feet into shallow tournament pools comparative to whatever the new hotness is. And this isn't a character specific thing either, as entire systems would be added or removed version-by-version.\n\nThe major difference, however, is that the FGC accepted this. The FGC realized that this wasn't something that was going to change and you had to stay on the top of your game. It's why the FGC has crazy figures like Daigo Umehara who routinely bounces back and adapts or SonicFox who somehow always figures out how to perform amazingly no matter what game he picks up.\n\nNow let's look at a game that _has_ never pulled the rug out: Smash Melee. Smash melee might pull big numbers but the tournament scene is rather stagnant in both characters and players. A new player isn't as invested in picking up melee because it's insanely hard to compete against someone with ten years of experience, skill, practice and muscle memory. It's why the top end of melee sees a huge amount of the same players even to this day. If the FGC was the ultimate in evolution, Smash was the ultimate in stagnation.\n\nNow, again, maybe this is me coming from the FGC, but I feel no qualms with the rug being pulled out from under your or myself. It sucks, sure, but that's life. You shouldn't be crying when your Zero lightning loops are taken away from you in the new Marvel vs. Capcom game. You need to adapt and overcome. I'm sure there's someone who will try to be cheeky and say \"NU I CANT RITO WUNT LET ME\" but that's a whole different can of worms. There's also a reason why there's a mix of old and new in the pro scene: Guys like Doublelift can adapt and overcome even after all these years yet there's still a place for newcomers, so long as they can adapt as the game changes.\n\nIn truth, his problem is more with games as a whole than league. This is the direction gaming is going: Patches, fixes and major updates that drastically change the game. But without getting into every aspect of his argument (Some I agree, some I disagree), the big one for me is that he's upset gameplay changes. Unfortunately for some and happily for others, this is just how we're going forward as an industry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2018-04-14T20:06:16.676+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":9,"body":"> Riot's balance team of top players doesn't have the final input on balance changes. \n\nThat's what i been saying for ages, it doesn't matter that there is high elo players on the team when the brains of the department is some hardstuck gold/plat player and is clearly biased to the role they main.\n\nEdit: once again low elo adc/support mains downvoting the truth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2018-04-14T19:54:19.264+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":8,"body":"I agree with everything except the last part about rework.

Fiora, Gangplank, Swain and Talon turned out fantastic. They have clear strengths and weaknesses and all feel very fluid to play.\n\nMy comments aobut Fiora/Gangplank/Swain were not directed at the design quality of the reworks, but on the fact that they are no longer the same champion. The reworks no longer support the playstyles that I enjoyed them for.\nSwain cannot play as a true draintank anymore.\nCritplank was gone even before the runes were reworked because his rework no longer supported that style. Not having a movement speed buff makes him less effective as a split pusher. And I find his barrel minigame to be boring and tedious.\nFiora may still be a strong duelist, but she doesn't have the all in pentakill potential she use to when she's ahead.\n\nI bought all three of them specifically for those playstyles. Now I no longer play them. \n\nTalon's rework, as I said, I think was conceptually good - but that's because they didn't really change his playstyle. You still play him as a roaming diving assassin. He just operates differently. And had his AoE nerfed. So unless you were really into AOE bomb Talon you probably aren't that disappointed. My problem with Talon's rework is that he's just not as viable. He falls off into an abyss unless you snowball before 10 minutes. The risk is too great and the reward not really worth it. Old Talon had more mid/late power and more potential to make a comeback. He was also easier to use effectively in teamfights when behind. Mainly because it was easier to dive from longer range and you had more AOE damage. Now his dive is so short, his burst so delayed, and he has to sacrifice damage to gapclose, that it's very difficult to stay relevant in a teamfight unless you were already way ahead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rαy","date":"2018-04-16T01:18:00.051+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so ridiculously true in every aspect and I hope Riot will take notice of this thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GraveGalius","date":"2018-04-15T13:27:59.170+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a jungler, i miss season 4 League, everyone was OP when ahead and useless when behind, the game wasn't perfect, but surely was fun. \n\nIn season 4 as a jungler you could play double the amount of champions you can play now, mostly due to lack of mana sustain, now you can't even play some champions cause they don't have the damage or the mana to stay in the jungle, some champions are even abandoned because the jungle items don't give anything or enough to be useful in the game (diana dmg, fiddlesticks dmg, pantheon mana problems, maokai mana problems etc..).\n\nOn one thing i completely agree with the guy, champion reworks should only be done when a champion mechanic is old and doesn't go with the game style (Yorick for example), but reworking champions or skills only because they're too strong (Fiora, Akali, Katarina, Rengar, LeBlanc) makes them un-fun and unplayable (Fiora is still fun imo, but not like she used to be).\n\nI mean, no one played Rengar for 2 years only because he was absolutely boring to play, and imo he still needs a full revert.\nAkali is not even played anymore cause is too hard to land the damage you need to kill someone.\n\nRiot in the course of the years removed items and mechanics of the game (like spellvamp), reworked entire items and most of these changes were completely unnecessary.\n\nLeague of Legend is a Team-based game, we all agree with that, but for how the game is now that means that if you are fed you're not rewarded, you must play around bot lane, you can't play around mid, top or jungle because even if they are fed they can't carry the game (especially jungle) and that is frustrating as hell and is making most of the community not wanting to play anymore, me included","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elkington","date":"2018-04-14T21:25:20.156+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"The funny thing is these issues have been a thing on SR for a while, they've just been exascerbated over the years in an effort to make games faster and more exciting.\n\nDominion removed well over half of the problems of SR, which people would have finally seen had it not gotten removed due to obscurity.

He gets a free pass in a lot of mid lane match ups now and it comes down to how he plays the skirmish and pick game.\nVik still has the easiest wave clear in the game and nothing really has changed in his kit besides numbers.

I don't care what elo he is, or what regions he's gotten it in. He's a biased player and his opinion means **nothing** if he thinks an entire class of champions can't be viable without taking skill expression away.\n\nTanks will ALWAYS be viable. They are probably the **most viable** class in league at all times. They're not going to carry. You're not going to have a lot of agency over an individual match as a tank. You are, however, going to contribute more to your team than your lane opponent in most of your matches, and as a result win more than 50% of your games.\n\nThis guy has a wrong opinion because he's a high-mmr player that goes on smurf accounts. Obviously for him, tanks aren't a great decision, because he knows he can solo carry almost any team in lower elo. However that's the whole point - tanks are viable at helping you win games when you play reasonably well for the elo you're in. You're not going to get an 85% win rate on a tank climbing on a smurf, when you might pull that off on a carry. However if you main tanks and don't make macro decisions that are worse than your elo, you'll probably win 51-55% of games overall. That's **viable** and doesn't take anything away from skill expression.\n\nJust because he, as a carry top laner, can't figure out how to beat a tank consistently, doesn't mean that skill expression is being removed. It means **his skill expression is lacking.** He can't figure out how to beat it, so it must be OP. Right... that's the exact mindset that we use to recognize silver players, so why does a Master player have that mindset?\n\nI read a few more comments and while nothing topped that one, there were other dumb comments too.\n\"---Winning lane doesn't even matter anymore. Laning is a waste of time.\n---It's harder to be a playmaker in this environment. And you're rewarded less for it. Punished too hard if you fail. High elo games are just about farming and not dying until it's time to do objectives or turrets.\n---Outplaying people doesn't matter much anymore for determining the outcome of a match.\n---Taking risks is not as rewarding. You're better off avoiding fights in most cases.\n---You're losing your ability to have control over the game. All roles feel like they have no individual agency to win the game.\n---You're also can't come back like you use to. It takes 40 minutes to lose a game that was already decided early on and the whole time you feel like you have no agency over the direction of it. It's not only unfun but it's bad for your streaming audience.\"\n\nResponses to these ridiculous comments:\n- we're in a season where average game length in Korea Challenger at one point was under 15 minutes. How could laning not matter?\n- It's not a bad thing that it's harder to be a playmaker. That **introduces** skill expression. If it was easy, everyone could do it, and how could you be better?\n- Outplaying doesn't matter anymore? Except he just said you're punished **too hard** when you fail. He didn't fail, he got outplayed, and that outplay **clearly mattered in his eyes** because he thought he was punished too hard\n- Taking risks **is more rewarding**, it's just that the risks are largely reversed now. The risks people take are baiting him into taking a risk, and having an ally nearby to turn it. He's getting outplayed, and blaming it on the meta rather than his ability to adapt.\n- Losing control over the game is again his problem. If he's getting a lead, he's not bringing it elsewhere. It sounds more from his other complaints though that he's not getting a lead anymore, which no doubt he won't have control then. There's no doubt that there's still loads of control from  good players in this game. The difference is that the controlling player isn't going 17/1/0 and carrying 1v5. The controlling player is going 9/1/8 and helping his allies get up 8 kills and letting the whole team dominate and win. I can't tell you how many times you see a Lee Sin or whatever gank lanes, and the laner will blow flash-ignite and it will be a certain kill (one auto from dead, you're a ranged laner and enemy is in melee range) and Lee Sin will take the kill when he's already 4/0/0. He falls off. I just blew my summoners. You want to win, let me carry with you. A 0/0/5 mid laner with no summoners isn't going to solo-wreck their lane opponent when they come back. This is a team game, and people **wanted** the ability to beat the one guy that popped off, **because more often than not he didn't get fed because he was good, he got fed because his lane opponent (or whoever he killed) was bad.** It's about 4 good players carrying one bad one, not one good player winning 1v5 where four of his opponents were just as good as him, because he went up against 1 bad one.\n- **You can come back.** This one almost beats the tanks being viable comment. It's ridiculous to feel this way. This comment **contradicts every one of those previous comments.** If laning doesn't matter, then you must be able to come back from a big laning deficit. If it's hard to be a playmaker, you must be able to come back from someone that made some early plays because his lead isn't enough to make plays easily and consistently still (and he'll get cocky and die for it). If outplaying doesn't matter to decide the outcome, then all those earlier outplays that put you behind shouldn't make it too hard to come back. Risks aren't rewarding? I guess all those early risks to get a lead must mean nothing because it's easy to come back. You're losing control over the game? Guess it's easy to come back. This comment is so dumb it's unbelievable.\n\nHonestly, all of these \"high elo\" players whining about the state of the game have one thing in common: they fail to adapt. Yes, the game has changed a bit. None of their assessments ever seem true though. You're not going to win by going 6/0/0 in top lane and just staying top all game. This is a team game. You can't have it both ways, where your ally can feed like mad 1v1 and you're able to make up for it by coordinating and taking down the fed opponent, but also you want to be able to carry 1v5. **That's not possible, ever.** Either a solo-fed player can carry, or he can't. These guys all want it to be that if they're fed they can carry, but if it's an opponent they can't. Not realistic. \n\nGet ahead, and bring that lead elsewhere, and you'll do well. **In any elo.** The top players are still consistently at the top with ludicrous win rates. You can't tell me there isn't something they're doing right that other top players aren't. \n\nThe washed up guys are just whining because their time has passed and they haven't adapted to thrive in the current environment. It doesn't mean you can't thrive in the current environment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iamthegoatofwar","date":"2018-04-16T12:03:07.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss old gangplank.
