Xerath, a notoriously immobile champion, at least has a stun and more reliable/stronger slow on quicker cooldown. Your Q shield isn't going to do anything but delay your inevitable death either in most cases. \n\nI want to experiment using him as a tank mage. It could be fun, but perhaps is of questionable value.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-03-03T04:26:57.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Initial testing has shown that the bruiser Q build does work as an effective lane bully, and can be good mid game, but starts to fall off hard against anything with MR. But there's not a lot of late game with that build. I wouldn't want to play this build unless I was sure my team was capable of taking advantage of the early mid lane win I gave them. At this elo, they often aren't. So I have to go for late game builds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lilpokfluf","date":"2018-03-02T15:50:57.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would've thought the new liandrys  and rylais buff would've helped him out.

Even though people can walk out of R's ticks R still has INSTANT damage when cast and its AOE. \n\nAt 2+(1/2) items he will start to out-damage all other Mids in the game with his AOE nukes. At 3 items... it doesn't matter if Aftershock and Ult ticks are not hitting... the initial blast of any combination of your spells just DELETES. Also, Q has a TWO SECOND cool down and with a Lich Bane it deals unmatched amounts of Godly damage.","replies":[]}]}
