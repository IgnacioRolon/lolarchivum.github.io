You're missing the entire reason why teams have an ADC in the first place. It's not just some arbitrary duo role you can shove anything into just because they do well in a paired setting. Fundamentally you need something that scales their damage well with auto attacks to have unmatched late game damage that can be delivered safely from range. Mordekaiser's rework doesn't fulfill that fundamental need teams have, so there's no reason to take him bottom lane despite having a kit purposely designed to do so.  Nor is there really any need for a support when he's not that vulnerable in a solo situation. And the late game payoff isn't there to justify devoting the team resources to it. \n\n--------------------\n\nPyke, likewise, doesn't fulfill enough of the fundamental functions of a support to be good at this role and truly called a support. \n\nSupports do some or all of the following to a high degree: \n1. Protect the ADC during laning phase.\n2. Set up kills for ADC during laning phase. \n3. Peel for and/or protect their team in teamfights\n4. Set up kills for the team in teamfights. \n5. Are force multipliers for their entire team. (ie. their abilities, when used properly, make a team much stronger than the sum of it's parts). \n\nPyke only does #2 and #4 to an extent, but doesn't even do it better than other options available. \nAlthough the ability to cause an enemy to be out of position is why he is labeled a \"controller\", subclass \"catcher\", and not an \"assassin\" (assassins don't have any abilities like this), the fact is that his passive and three other abilities do nothing at all to facilitate the controller or catcher playstyle. He's designed as an assassin first and foremost with a minor controller element thrown in. \n\nBecause of this, pyke cannot optimally or even really effectively fulfill the role of support for the reasons you actually need a support on your team. \nHe will likely only have success in scenarios where you could have taken any other assassin to the support lane - ie. You get some early picks and get your lane fed.\nI mean, I can do that with Talon - but that doesn't make him a real support. Talon might fulfill the minor role of helping peel for the ADC in lane phase, but the real victory condition here is an assassin victory condition - kill lane, get fed, roam. About the only thing Pyke has going for him mid/late game is that he can CC more than Talon in teamfight contexts. \n\nPyke would have an assassin victory condition if he had more damage himself. But he depends early more on his teammates for damage. \nThat's why many are saying he belongs in the jungle. There his minor catcher abilities combined with his roam abilities will be better put to use, letting a stronger support be the support. But it's typical for a jungler to rely on their teammate laners to help them secure kills so his lack of damage doesn't become a liability as long as he can CC and hook the enemy for his teammate during a gank.\nThe problem with Pyke is that he was probably designed purposely to have bad clears as a way of arbitrarily forcing him into the support role. The only way he'll stay support is if his clears and early dueling are so bad that he just can't hack it in the jungle. Because he just doesn't belong in the support role unless he has no other options left. His lack of early DPS will give him no viable way of playing anywhere but support, but he will be inferior to most other picks in that role. So pyke will really only be played support by people who just want to play pyke, but have nowhere else to put him - it will have little to do with him actually being a good support.

Merely stating something doesn't make it true.\nYou have not established by any reasoned argumentation why what I say is only an opinion, rather than a factual analysis of the game's design.\n\nThe fact is we have analysts and coaches like LS who say, in their expert opinion, that Pyke should not be played support because he'll be bad at it.\nHe can state this because he understands at a fundamental level what teams need from their support, and Pyke doesn't fit the bill.\nAccording to LS, Pyke has a kit better suited to being a jungle based \"catcher\", but whether or not it's viable depends on how well he can clear. \nHe suspects that Pyke will only be played support if Riot has set up Pyke's numbers in a way that prevents him from clearing the jungle in a viable way. Otherwise you'd never see Pyke support.\n\nit is the same reason we can factually state that mordekaiser is unable to properly fill the role normally taken by marksmen, because he fundamentally lacks the tools and attributes necessary to fill that role in a team composition - and you can't afford to have a team without those tools and attributes or you will fail. Some of us could have told Riot that would have happened before the rework ever happened, because we understand what teams needed to have in order to be functionally competitive. You can't put an \"ADC\" label on a champion and expect it to work if that champion can't meet the basic criteria necessary to be the team's ranged ADC. \n\nThe same goes for pyke. You can't just call him a support and expect that to work out if you don't give him the tools people actually need from a support in order to have a functionally competitive team.\n","replies":[{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2018-06-12T05:20:08.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your cut and paste response does not apply to every comment....yes what you posted is your opinion....and what i said is a fact....i have seen some very good Pyke supports.\n\nSo talk about logic all you want...seems to me you are just looking for debates.

He&#x27;s kin to Thresh/Blitz/Nautilus rather than he is Soraka or Sona.\n\nYou misuse the riot class terms.\n\nPyke is a controller class, subclass catcher. \nSame for blitz and thresh.\n\nNautilus is a tank class, subclass vanguard. \n\nSona and Soraka are controller class, subclass enchanter. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nControllers are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.\n\nCatchers specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile and immobile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down.\n\n\nSlayers (formerly \"Assassins\") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.\n\nAssassins specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put them themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage._\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nLet's see where Pyke's kit fits in those parameters:\n\nBase form - Assassin. \nMelee, but squishy. Must put himself in harm's way to execute targets. \n\nPassive - Assassin. \nA defensive trick to avoid damage. \n\nQ - Catcher. \nOpens up opportunities for allies.\n\nW - Assassin.\nInfiltrates enemy lines. Mobility. \nUnder some circumstances maybe you can call it a defensive trick. \n\nE - Hard to say this is catcher. It's more like a situational form of assassin CC, which some do have (Ekko, Rengar, Nocturne, Eve, as examples). \nA difficult and weak form of CC that requires greatly exposing yourself to harm in order to pull off. \nTheoretically can be used defensive or for opening up opportunities, but in practice it's delay and melee range activate make it one of the poorest choices for either of those roles amongst any support. Even mages offer better peel and offensive stun options than Pyke. So I can't really say this represents catcher style CC, even though it's a bit better than other assassin CCs. \n\nR - Assassin. \n\n\nThe problem is that they have so heavily weighed him towards the assassin side of things that he can't actually fulfill the roles a team needs from a support. \nHe ends up being in the support position more because of how they have limited him from being an effective assassin, rather than because of how effective they have made him at being a catcher. Ie. He doesn't have as much upfront damage, so he depends on taking advantage of the damage his allies do. This means he can't solo lane.\nAnd then his poor clear speed, and defense not working on jungle camps, he ends up being prevented from being a jungler not because he doesn't have a kit suited to it but because they arbitrarily made him bad at it to force him into only one role being playable. \n\n\n\n> Jungler jumps out of the bush at your ADC. Q to rip him off then dash over him for the stun.\n> \n> He excels at this with his yank+stun.\n\nNo, the reason he's suited to jungler is for more reasons than that.\n1. Because as a solo laner he can't output the best damage, but as a jungler he can still playoff the damage of his teammates.\n2. His W gives him mobility and invis for ganking that junglers dream of having. \n3. He has tools for enabling his laners to secure kills. \n4. More importantly, because he doesn't do #1, 3 and 5 for his team, and barely does #4, so he just isn't a good support as far as team compositions go. These issues don't hold him back in the jungle. \n\nUnfortunately, they didn't allow his abilities or clear to be useful for jungle camps because they probably realized he would go jungle if he could. \nIt's the same problem when they designed mordekaiser - they made his abilities only function at full capacity when played in the ADC position, not even the support position, arbitrarily limiting his potential roles as a way of forcing people to do what they envisioned with him. \nThey are trying to force feed an assassin into the support position where he doesn't belong because they didn't understand what team compositions are really looking for when they assess what a support needs to bring to a team. \n\n\n\n> He can&#x27;t shield or heal anyone, but he does have peel.\n\nI just outlined why he doesn't really have peel that qualifies as support level peel .\n\n> He&#x27;s not an enchanter, but he does offer strong peel/hard CC with a clean up ult.\n\nHe has some of the weakest peel in the game aside from champions that have no CC at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-06-12T03:42:25.662+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I found your logic to be flawed.

You can only get away with this in the disorganization of soloque, but the higher up you go the more you get punished for it.\n\nIn that sense brand is no different than an assassin support. They still play like mages of assassins, they just do it from the support role. They don't really fulfill any of the actual functions of a support role. So the point is not that you can't win doing it in soloque, but the point is that doesn't make you an actual support just because you queued your assassin or mage into the support role.
