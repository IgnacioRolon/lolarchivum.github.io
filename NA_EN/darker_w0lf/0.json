Third day being stuck at 33 percent, 99 percent, 7 percent and Unspecified Errors.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been fiddling with this ridiculous patcher and program for dozens of hours now and I don't understand why my League of Legends will not download ontop my laptop. It's becoming increasingly frustrating and the lack of clear answers or fixes for a problem so widespread is even more disturbing. I am in need of assistance. What the heck is going on?\r\n\r\nI'm stuck 99% since last night at 9 pm, its 11:33 am est time right now.\r\nI'm using a hardline internet. I've tried silly things over and over like 'erasing x y or z folder' and 'changing location (NA to Oceania and back) and reinstalling...etc etc.. Nothing has worked.\r\n\r\nRight now my patcher is sitting at 99 percent with 0 files scanned [upgrading your client step 1/1)...but I haven't gotten any 'error messages' yet like I was getting for the past few nights (I only made it 99 percent without an error because I switched my location over to Oceania -)\r\n\r\nThis entire process has been an nightmare and it makes zero sense to my why its so incredibly difficult to install a relatively simple game without it cracking up with so many errors over and over and over and over and over and over again.\r\n\r\nWhat the heck am I supposed to do right now Riot? What is the fix for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T19:28:52.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate that you waited for a bit to make sure the patcher can continue doing its thing without interruption.  After 33% your patcher is going through the process of downloading updates.  Getting stuck at 99% can suggest an unstable connection that's trying to backtrack and pick up missed info.  You should run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection to the patching servers are solid.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
