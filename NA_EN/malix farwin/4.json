You die once in lane its over. You can be dove, jungler can come to your lane and blow you up. Theres no coming back, your tower can easily be taken after one gank if you don't have tp.

So it have to be something else. Maybe you have to work on your Makro game. Maybe you bait teammates in bad situations where you can survive but they die. Maybe you can't close games cause you are an KDA-Player and prefer fights over objektives. Maybe you should use pings more to guide your team to victory. Maybe you are toxic in chat and lower your team moral? Maybe you give up too early?\nAsk you this questions.\nBecause technically you seem to be a good player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2018-11-11T08:54:25.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every bot lane between Bronze-Gold will either go 3/15 or 15/3 by the end of the game.
