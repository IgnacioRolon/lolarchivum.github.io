I do.\r\n\r\nThe boards were filled with less ragey and hate-filled posts,  the discussions were meaningful and commenters talked about the issues and possible solutions CIVILY. All in all, the balance boards became a more positive place to discuss change and balance rather than a canvas on which to paint with venom.\r\n\r\nYeah a lot of the ideas shared weren&#039;t implemented and so forth, but at the end of the day i believe no one truly believes or expects every change suggested should and will be followed out. We just want to know we&#039;ve beenheard.\r\n\r\nWe know Rioters read these posts, but the lack of even simple responses cause a buildup of frustration from talking to seemingly a brick wall to turn into venom and hate to the Rioters that do rear their heads.\r\n\r\nTo the Rioters, please come back and grace us with even basic responses to let us know that we&#039;ve been at least heard. That&#039;s all we really want at the end of the day. The boards function so much better when we have the validation of at least being ackowledged.\r\n\r\nTo the players, when the Rioters do show their heads, dont take that as an opportunity to lash out and attack them. You are driving them away when they try to come back, and we know when they&#039;re here, at least attempting to communicate with us it feels so much better. Even when youre still mad at Stashu or CertainlyT,when they do show uo on the boards take that as an opportunity to talk to them no matter how frustrated you might be, dont just attack them and drive them away.\r\n\r\nI remember how everything worked better with basic common courtesy between the two groups. And i want that again, because this game and its community deserve better.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-10-18T22:04:32.105+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"One thing I find particularly difficult about having meaningful discussion with players on G&B in a way that leaves players satisfied is that I often find it difficult to create change at a pace that satisfies the demands of players. To give an example of this on a current hot topic, I have popped into a few Morde threads since the Juggernaut patch a few months ago to give small status updates on him, but they were basically to the extent of \"We're still looking into him\" or \"We're trying to get him into a decent spot for worlds.\"\n\nIt's clear to us that not everyone is happy with Mordekaiser's current state at the moment, but we also don't have a definitive update on him at the moment. What that leaves me with as far as communication options with players on the subject is one of two things:\n\n* Pop into threads every now and again and say \"No update yet!\"\n* Leave those threads alone until I (or any of the other Reds) have something material to say on the subject, with the implicit understanding that we're looking into it still, per the most recent conversations.\n\nI can totally understand why neither of these is a satisfactory response to players, because if they care enough to come to the boards and talk about it, they probably want action, and in neither of these cases can I (or anyone else, really) create action in a way that is going to feel fast to players, and that's just because changes take time to make, test, and ship.\n\nIt's certainly possible that the first of the two approaches to the subject is preferred by more players, but I also pretty frequently read that players get frustrated when they feel like I'm blowing smoke at them just to placate them.\n\nAnyway, that's my thought on the matter. If anyone has an opinion or related input, I'd love to hear it.","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-10-19T01:05:44.321+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Not everyone is happy\"?

I don't think that would actually do anything. If all Riot says is something along the lines of \"we're looking at the problem\", people are probably still going to be pissed, and if they aren't they will be in a week when they're hungering for specifics of what is going to happen to their champion. Just the knowledge that something will be changed at some point in the future isn't going to be reassuring for long, particularly if Riot still leaves open the possibility of going in a different direction than what the old Morde mains want. I really don't think that just giving some basic hope will actually do anything for anyone's mood.\n\nI remember how it was for me after Skarner's first rework. I asked Riot to confirm that they were looking at him and would address our concerns, Riot said exactly that, it made me feel better for a day or two, then I was back posting angry messages again a week later because I wasn't convinced anything meaningful would happen. It just doesn't help as much as people think it will.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-10-19T01:29:22.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a really good point on the whole issue of popping in just to say that there hasn't been any progress and how that's a bad way to handle it.  So instead, could you have someone directly involved in these areas pop in and give their two cents or talk to them and report how the conversation went?  It's a little sad to see you be one of the only Reds to drop by and talk about things, especially when the conversation isn't one that you have anything to add to.\n\nSo here are my suggestions on what to do about Morde in particular.\n\n1. Get someone in here who's directly involved.  CT, someone on the balance team, into an AMA or similar forum where they can discuss Mordekaiser with the community.  There has been a very significant lack of communication in this project and it's left players who really liked old Morde feeling unheard and uncared about.  Please don't pull another Cassiopeia here.\n\n2. Be willing to make significant changes.  Mordekaiser is not going to be fixed with number changes or a change to his champion title (who thought that would be a good idea to basically declare that the rework was such a failure that he's no longer the Master of Metal?).  If all else fails, please consider reverting the rework and using the ideas behind the changes for a new champion instead.  Morde is simply not healthy as he is and should not be left in this state to be nerfed and forgotten.\n\n3. Try to keep us updated.  Encourage the team to appoint a member who can check in every week or so to let us know how things are going.  Even a \"Not much to report this week\" would let us know that you guys still care.  Regular updates would do wonders to make sure that the disconnect between player and designer doesn't become an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BetweenSkill","date":"2015-10-19T19:23:49.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for replying, it's awesome :)\n\nBut yeah, I agree with some of the other posters on this in that just a few words to keep the hope alive is better than nothing. It just keeps the brick wall from forming and turning Rioters into evil masterminds working in the shadows and players from being just a blanket of hate and rage. \n\nI may be only Silver 1 currently, but with about 2500 games total under my belt I feel I have decent understanding of the game, and passion for certain champions. Any feedback, even if it's just \"yeah we hear you\", gives us that validation that I feel most of the posters on here are asking for above all else.\n\nAnyways thanks for taking the time out of your busy day to respond to this thread, and I look forward to your work on the Marksmen!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-10-19T15:45:46.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not a third option...\nHave a dialogue with the playerbase so we can move changes in the right direction, as opposed to just spit-balling changes and hoping to get it right?

You can't give us any information, specially not information you don't have, so why not just talk it over? Let us tell you what we were sort of hoping for and what we think is a good direction for him, obviously you don't need to listen but im sure there are a lot of great ideas out there. Its things like his Title change to \"Lord of Death\" with no community feedback being addressed, im pretty sure no one like it. Now most people do not like any change, but honestly the title is just so bland and generic, plenty of better names like \"Sovereign of Suffering\" or \"Overlord of Pain\" that ive seen on the boards. Someone else put it like \"Mordekaiser is already the Lord of Death so changing his name to 'Lord of Death' is like changing it to 'Mordekaiser the Mordekaiser'\". Something along these lines, the title could have been discussed, either you say \"Nah we like this one\" or possibly a better idea comes up and then everyone is happy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penguin in Space","date":"2015-10-18T19:41:57.051+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Customer service is often more over looked than the service itself.

He did an amazing job of being open with players and discussing things he wanted to discuss without being condescending or otherwise insulting them and that brought out a lot of the better side of this community.\n\nAnd regarding CT, I was one of the players who tried to get a civil discussion with him the last time he popped on the boards to talk about Mordekaiser and his 5.18 changes.  His replies basically amounted to \"I couldn't have known this was coming\", \"It was someone else's fault\", and \"I know better\", none of which were encouraging.  I tried to keep it civil and make sure others did the same, but he went and disappeared before any real discussion could take place.  We didn't attack him or drive him away (many of those who did were downvoted into oblivion), we just wanted to know the answers to some questions regarding his reasonings and how we could move forward.
