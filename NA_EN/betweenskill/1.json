I'm not using this post to bash you about that. I just want to know why our connection with you guys has gotten smaller and smaller with good points from entire fanbases being ignored. I've made three posts about this, on three different accounts, and each time it's reached the top of the boards, but not one response from you guys (Even when I see Meddler responding to other posts at the same time).\n\n\nEdit 2: I apologize for my non-productive tone when addressing some of the Red's directly. I got caught up in this post and overlooked them when rereading this monstrosity I've created. And so I've now become one of the toxic assholes here I hate, just by simply not thinking about how I was talking. Sorry Rito :/\n\nI'm no longer addressing my complaint as player to developer. Person to person.\n_**\nAndrei \"Meddler\" van Roon,\nHi my name is Aidan and I'm a freshman in college who has spent the past 4-5 years of his life loving this game and putting close to 8000 total games across all accounts (i just recounted). I'm in a Game Design & Development program and I love discussing the finer aspects of game design and game theory. I also love fishing and rugby. This game inspired me to become a developer, to create a game as good maybe even better than this (that would be nigh impossible).\n\nI am a person, and so is everyone else on here. So are you. Except Canustus. He's a sneky snek. \nDon't ignore 98% of us. We want to be heard because we care, because we are people like you. We don't want essays to every single post made, but Red Responses being the exception specifically on Gameplay boards is a bit insulting which is why many people inappropriately turn to toxicity and venom. We just want to talk. \n\n\n* \n\n\nMonths ago I made a post about communication between the Gameplay/balance/update team and the boards, and more specifically, the profound lack of it.\n\nThe recent post about listening to player feedback about updates (regarding the visual changes to Fiora) came across to a lot of people I know as basically a giant slap in the face. Not only did Riot state that they listened and cared about player feedback and how they _**FEEL**_ about a champion, but they are stated how they learned a lot from it and how they respect player opinion highly. That if it didn&#039;t feel like a huge gain to the game/champion etc as a whole then it was a failed update.\n\nThe story and lore team basically butchered what many original players loved about League&#039;s unique backstory and setting and have basically given almost nothing back. So many champions are left with a few sentences of &quot;lore&quot; (I hesitate to call it that, it&#039;s a sad excuse for it) and I have not found a single person who isn&#039;t confused/upset about it. \n\n_**HOWEVER**_, I still see the art team and story/lore team responding relatively frequently to the boards, About half of the posts in Red Tracker usually show up in that board (for me at least). People at least feel they are being acknowledged there.\n\nThe rare few times I see a Red respond in a Gameplay and Balance discussion is to pop in and make a funny joke or agree with someone&#039;s funny anecdotal but so rarely among the rare responses are they to a post actually discussing GAMEPLAY AND BALANCE. \n\nMonths ago I was one of a few people that made fairly noticeable posts about this exact topic, and Rioter&#039;s posts increased dramatically (from almost nothing to at least 1/5 of the discussions posted which is fairly reasonable). They were simple or they were detailed responses, but they made us feel heard. Yeah, the boards population is smaller than the entire game population, but most of the people who post and frequent the boards are here because they are the extremely passionate ones who want to see this game continue to be the (most of the time) amazing ride it has been for a long time to come. \n\nBut after a week or two the Red posts died down, and now they are even less than they were before that. And now I&#039;m more pissed, and less understanding than I was before.\n\nIf Riot cares about player feedback and how updates feel to the players then I have some questions that I hope will actually warrant responses.\n\nRiot Repertoir (mispelled sorry): Why is Kog&#039;Maw still been basically shafted? Put his W on his passive like you did with Graves&#039; autos, and make his W a unique steroid (like make his attacks unblockable or ramping damage like MF&#039;s used to be). His damage is way too low for someone who has an incredible amount of risk and reliance on his team to output any of it.\n\nRiot Stashu: What the hell happened to Cassiopeia? We were promised updates on her and on the progress of the updates and nothing. Who she was as a champion was demolished lore-wise and gameplay-wise, and now after all her nerfs her gameplay pattern is just downright unfun for everyone involved and boring and just plain bad.\n\nRiot CertainlyT: I know you get a lot of hate on these boards, most of it unjustified. You make really cool champions, and unique kits. Some may be unfun to play against and sometimes feel unfair, but for the most part they are relatively balanced. WHAT THE HELL happened with Mordekaiser&#039;s update? I did not see ONE post supporting Mordekaiser&#039;s rework, not ONE. EVERYONE said it would be either terribly trashy or terribly toxic. And look what happened. Mordekaiser mains have either quit or downright are miserable, his solo lane is detroyed. Old Lore: stomps across the land unstoppable and unkillable by himself, not with a frigging support. He is the definition of feast or famine, and is incredibly more toxic for everyone to play since his rework than before. i have not seen this much universal hate for a rework, well, ever. Even Karma&#039;s/Cass&#039; reowork had less hate spewed back at Riot\n\nMarksmen update: ADC&#039;s now all build the exact same items. diversity is WORSE than before the itemization changes. It&#039;s nothing but crit on everything and I have not seen a single phantom dancer in any game I have played. Maybe I missed one, or it danced out of sight. What used to be the quintessential ADC damage amplifying item is now virtually gone.\n\nAD Assassin item: Really? AP mages and even assassins are hugely nerfed because of how much more AP items cost now relative to AD casters/assassins, and you&#039;re giving AD assassins yet another way to deal even more damage earlier? I don&#039;t think even Anivia will work against Zed now lol.\n\nThis is everything I&#039;ve seen. From my point of view and from other&#039;s. Do you see how much hate there is? I&#039;ve played this game since it first came out, and I truly have never seen a preseason more dysfunctional than this. More counter-productive to what players are asking for than this. it hasn&#039;t lasted this long with the same issues being ignored or changed FURTHER away from players want. \n\nYou value player feedback? You dare say that an update has failed if it doesn&#039;t feel like a large gain and then continue to spit in our faces? I&#039;ve supported Rioters, I&#039;ve helped pay your paychecks and I&#039;ve helped defend you guys when everyone is raging and calling you guys &quot;stupid pieces of shit&quot;. You aren&#039;t stupid pieces of shit, but you are acting more and more arrogantly. \n\nWe just want to be heard. We want to be listened to like you like to make a big deal about how you do. Respond to us, give us feedback. Tell us how our ideas are stupid or bad (cause most of them are). But stop ignoring us. \n\nWhen Jagex ignored its large playerbase (yet again) and went ahead with a big update (EOC) because they wanted to, look what happened. Their damage control was literally going back in time 7 YEARS to avoid losing more than half their players. \n\nI want to be told that my ideas are bad, why they are wrong, what you guys are planning on doing. It takes 30 seconds-15 minutes to make a decent informed post (probably even shorter for you guys, you have all the information at your fingertips). That&#039;s almost nothing, even in the middle of a workday. Because it should be part of your work. It IS part of your job.\n\nYeah the boards are a toxic place, but you&#039;re being paid from OUR wallet&#039;s to keep this game running. And when you show up and start posting, almost all of the toxicity evaporates quickly because it&#039;s mostly the build up of months of being ignored.\n\nAnd if you come on to these boards and make a post, and it gets overwhelmingly downvoted and/or there&#039;s a huge outcry, maybe there&#039;s something wrong with what you are proposing. From your own words, if player&#039;s don&#039;t feel like they are gaining something big, the change is a failure.\n\n&quot;Now that the new year is upon us, we&rsquo;ll be pushing for more communication and transparency in the coming months.&quot;\n                                   **_Give us some basic interaction and that will be Leagues above what we are receiving now._**\n\nTL;DR: \n\nI&#039;ve seen companies start acting like this towards their customer&#039;s, and I&#039;ve watched every single one of their games wither and die when they refused to change directions. I want this game to succeed like any of us, Red or player alike. But this is a partnership of trust between the two groups, and right now we feel like we are being cheated. If you want us to be happy and enjoy these changes, then listen to our feedback and/or at least give us shoutouts to know we are being heard. \n\nRather than upvoting or downvoting, I want to hear what you guys think!\n\nThank you.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Pasta Help Desk","date":"2016-01-06T16:21:22.417+0000","up_votes":98,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot has read your comment and asked me to relay this message. \n\nPatch 6.0 Zed and Lee Sin are getting buffs.

My biggest frustration with this game is the champion updates. There is zero consideration for what already exists when something is updated. When you guys mess up, you say how sorry you are and how much you learned (I.E Fiora, Trundle, Karma, Cass) then keep doing the exact same thing, because there's a refusal to consider the merits of what already exists and player investment to what exists when changing it.\n\nI literally dread reworks despite having loved the Sion rework (at first before repeated changes) and the mechanical side of the Fiora rework. \n\nWhen Cass was reworked, Stashu communicated and talked and posted, then buffed her into massive OPness. When people took to her he disappeared then nerfed her to a point where she's still mechanically frustrating and dramatically underpowered.\n\nWhen Morde was reworked, zero communication was had, regardless of the method used to try and start conversation. It ended terribly, and there's still no communication. All we've heard is that there's basically a \"**** it\" approach being taken to Morde.\n\nSona's was a rework that changed a playstyle that riot didn't like but admitted wasn't unbalanced, despite the fact that players enjoyed using her, and turned her into and unbalanceable nightmare that can never be allowed to be strong. Ever.

In one sense, you guys have the power to communicate on your terms. However, your response, which illustrates a mindset riot has, seems to forget one thing about business - \"the customer is always right\"\n\nThat phrase doesn't mean that the customer is actually always right, it means that if you're in a business who's paycheck gets written because a customer purchased a product or service, then you better treat them like their opinions are valuable. If I walk into a retail store angry about a defective product, they don't say \"Your comments seem passive aggressive sir, I think I'm just going to walk away and not deal with you\". That would be unheard of and asinine, because that isn't how you treat a customer. \n\nRiot, and judging from your comment you as well, simply doesn't understand this. Sometimes customers are going to be passionate or upset about a product or service that you messed up, and if you want people to continue being customers, you should address their concerns anyway politely. You have the right to treat your customers like they are beneath you having to speak to their concerns, but don't be surprised if your customers hate you in return, or take their business elsewhere. You guys might be so cocky that you think you can treat your customers however you want and they will keep playing, but remember that with great pride comes a great fall. \n\nBefore you say \"but league is free!\" to justify you treating customers like they are beneficiaries of charity, lets all put the cards on the table. League is free as a business model, not as a charity. League chose to be ftp with microtransactions as a means to make money, not to be charitable, and they have made a butt load of money doing it. These players are who pay your salary, regardless of your companies business model, don't ever forget that. \n\nYou probably won't read this, but if you do, understand that it's time to start treating the players like they matter to you instead of acting like you are doing them a favor by having a game.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-07T21:21:55.529+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":9,"body":"I agree with the \"customer is always right\" sentiment, but generally I'd say that my decisions about which posts I respond to are the ones where I personally can provide the biggest value to players in a way that involves meaningful discussion, since having a meaningful discussion takes a fair amount of time.\n\nMaybe we should have people on Boards hired specifically to put out fires on a regular basis or specifically addressing complaints, but most (if not all) of the Reds you find here aren't exactly retail salespersons trying to placate angry customers.

We understand you don't like us being upset, but we just want you guys to understand why we are upset, and address that specifically. There was a great opportunity for discussion within that state of the league thread/announcement...thing, that seemed to be Riot patting itself on the back (sorry to word it that way, but it was a \"we feel we did good\" when that sentiment isn't shared as widely as you might believe). There were plenty of concerns brought up there in less...aggressive manners and still no real responses there. \n\nWhy are you guys at Riot so afraid to have someone tell you that you are wrong or something isn't working? If that isn't the case, then good (though the actions and sometimes lack thereof paint a different picture), but we've never been shown anything different. The outright refusal to revert bad reworks/nerfs/buffs (outside of small outlier cases if we can both be honest), going quiet after quite a few not very good reworks, but only ever addressing that by saying how you feel x,y, and z were good, but not commenting on the frustrations brought up by ignoring Cass for example (coming back to her in 6 months, I'm sorry to say, isn't actually addressing the now long standing issue). \n\nI've been around for nearly 6 years, and active for almost all 6, and I am losing faith in Riot in large chunks every 3 months it feels. I just want to be able to talk to my friends about this game again (even the ones playing it) without feeling like I should defend it to them because of all the randomness that goes on, or just flat out act like I don't play it sometimes so I won't have people mock me. I love this game, but I really don't like how it is run anymore, and that makes me pretty bummed. At some point you guys over at Riot gotta remember, you guys run and make the game, but we are here too, and should be just as big a part of it, not boxed out and ignored unless we show up with flowers kissing your feet from start to finish of a post (or more so, on Reddit, because as we all said when this board was created, Reddit is where most of the discussion is had and longer responses given, despite it being Reddit, and not your own forums <_< but just beating a dead horse on that one).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BetweenSkill","date":"2016-01-07T19:04:28.063+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"let's not jump on the I hate Rito bandwagon, that wasn't my intent with this post.

The part when OP stated that Riot became more arrogant is a sad thing, but has it's foundation. It's interesing that EXACTLY you came here first, because you are the only one I can clearly recall having one of those moments. It was in the Quinn PBE feedback thread, back like 2 months ago. I'll paste the relevant part:\n\n_\"To all the players upset that they cannot turn into Valor and fight anymore, I am sorry that that was so important to you as far as playing the champion goes, but that aspect of these changes is just not going to change. Truly, I'm very sorry if that ruins the champion for you, but I'd prefer to be forthcoming about the fact that it's not going to change than leave you hanging waiting for an answer forever. I hope you can find enjoyment eventually in this new version of the champion, or that there is another champion out there that can give you a similar feeling to the previous version of Quinn, but if not, I understand.\"_\n\nThis was something I could instantly recall when I've read this accusation of you guys becoming arrogant. You basically said here that \"We will go through with the changes, like it or not. Deal with it.\".\n\nYou guys have to realize that people love your game, which you are responsible for! You personally are at an especially delicate position considering that you have the really tough task of CHANGING existing things into something (hopefully) better. People get attached to certain things, if you change something significant, people will ask questions why you do that and want real answers. I would if  the champ I had several hundred games with suddenly gets changed into something else.\n\nPlayers want you to change things to get better and they want to help. Or at least want answers. The sincere thing they want here is that you guys make good adjustments/reworks for the \"Immobile Mages\" project. You were not really listening to the community at the previous 2 updates, despite that there were clear warnings that some of your ideas will not fare good. Later, you guys admitted to those mistakes, but would be much better if in the future, those mistakes would never happen in the first place, IMO.

A bunch of people got upset about that update I made to Quinn's PBE thread before she released, but I do think in that case being honest and direct with players about what could and could not be changed was the right call. Players want lots of things, and rightfully so. They care about the game and want it to be the best experience possible, as do we.

I can't tell you how many long, excellent Cass posts there have been, but I can tell you how many of them got substantive dev engagement about her state: *zero.* Red posts about the state of Zyra since her \"huge buff\" AI tweaks still not following target priorities as stated by a dev: *zero.* \n\nIn general, I feel there's a lack of explanation about problems or balance decisions that feel obviously incorrect to us. For example, it was not hard for players to see that Teemo was being dumpstered, but Riot claimed to be buffing him. That played out exactly as players expected, and there was no follow-up engagement about it at all. Thankfully we at least got reverts on most of the nerfs. \n\nZyra's plant AI debugging was sold to us as a buff so big it would need to be monitored; a buff so big that buffing the ult knockup after a 2 second delay from 1 second to 1.5 seconds could compromise game balance. Despite many calm, well-reasoned posts requesting clarification and follow-up about the plant behavior (some even my own), all we got was radio silence.\n\nRight now it feels obvious that AP items are too expensive, CDR choices are lacking, and mana regen is too slow for the current pace of the game. There's practically a consensus on this, which is why you're seeing FQC artificially inflating the status of several mages.  So when those problems feel *obvious* to players, it's baffling to see an item in the works for AD assassins who are already thriving or even oppressive.\n\nWhen I look at my own post history, it's like a chronology of a player's transition from a thoughtful contributor into a bitter, toxic fuck. I think that's a natural byproduct of having champs nerfed out from under you for no reason (see: Teemo, Katarina). Part of it, however, is that the Riot silence is interpreted as complete indifference to the issues, regardless of how patient, rational, frequent, and documented a QQ post may be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Vulcanator","date":"2016-01-07T19:59:08.296+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Y4sgQ4zT,comment-id=0030,timestamp=2016-01-07T18:17:20.890+0000)\n>\n> It can be difficult to have meaningful conversation with people when their opening statements toward you are immediately negative, accusatory, or passive aggressive.

This, what we have right now in League, is Riot's Cataclysm.  They need to be extremely careful right now and do what Blizzard never did and actually pay attention to the playerbase that built them up.

We hear you guys don't like snowbally games, so we have a system for minions to push faster when you're ahead so you can capitalize on your lead.

If you want to be ahead and have the stronger minions on your side, git gud lololol. \n\nOr the mastery system...why?  Why did a healthy and balanced system need an update like this?  This was by no means an improvement.  It's not just that they're cookie cutter, in fact, the masteries are the sole reason certain champions were nerfed when they were otherwise completely fine, some of whom (Karthus for example) were healthy and balanced before AND after the mastery update.  Then there's champions like Zed, who were annoying, but balanced...the mastery update came, \"wow he's strong, let's buff him and introduce AD DFG,\" and now we wait for the eventual \"we've noticed how strong Zed is with the new item. our bad guys - who could have seen this coming?\"\n\n\nWe see it coming.
