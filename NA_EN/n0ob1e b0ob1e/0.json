I know this has nothing to do with my connection or router or computer because it never happened before. When it said attempting to reconnect, I switched tabs and opened up google in a browser and everything was fine. Checked my internet router, it was fine. I was just wondering if this issue had anything to do with an update or if the client malfunctioned. Basically, everything on my end was fine, I just thought it might be something on your end that went wrong. Riot Help. Any thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T23:13:52.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection can degrade overtime, and settings can change with each update to your OS.  Even if your router is fine or your net is not immune from issues getting to specific servers.  You'll want to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this and rule out possibilities towards a fix.  Let me know if that clears things up.","replies":[]}]}
