You can't just make it melee-only, either, because Kog and Kayle like the potential on-hit itemization too.\n\nThat on top of the fact that the Phantom Hit effect was always hard to balance to begin with...","replies":[]},{"poster":"cope moment","date":"2016-11-03T00:25:42.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it'll make kayle an ABSOLUTE MONSTER  while still being unappealing for any other champ.
