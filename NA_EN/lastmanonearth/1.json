I get into 1 game with two Kaynes and the game can&#039;t even render one of them without massive frames lost. This is the only champion by correlation that has issues with rendering. He needs to be optimized asap because if this continues, we will need 8GB of graphics memory just to play one stinking game of riot hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-08-06T19:44:01.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"time to buy a new toaster.","replies":[{"poster":"LastManOnEarth","date":"2017-08-07T01:26:58.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to play crysis on my machine, oh wait I can.
