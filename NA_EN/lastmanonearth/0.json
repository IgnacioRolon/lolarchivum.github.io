Each team handles their own bugs, so it isn't just one team who tackles everything, which makes it hard to speak to how other teams work in terms of bugs that are coming in.\n\nThe goal isn't to leave anyone in the dark. Speaking specifically to the Mac issue - it's not something we wanted to occur for so long, but unfortunately, the fix was code--based and pretty intricate. That, and we wanted to make sure the fix was verified and testing thoroughly before pushing it out.

I've seen the boards posts, and I 100% agree that it sucks not being about to play with sound. \n\nTo clarify a bit here, this isn't something gameplay tackles. This is a tech issue. \n\nOther teams do look at issues, although they may not comment on every post (and some lurk due to not having a Red name to post, which is a personal choice). That said, if I see something that's not for my team, I do make a point for forward it, as do other Rioters, such as Exgeniar. \n\nIn relation to the Mac issue specifically - \n\nOn PBE it looks like things were working with no issues, we had folks testing it there. (Testing on PBE is better than testing in-house 'cause it's a cooked build, and more similar to what we would push to live) Based on that, we were fairly confident that this issue would be resolved.\n\nHowever, that doesn't appear to be the case. (Obviously.)\n\nFrom what I understand, we will be making a post in Help & Support soon, looking for more information from you guys to help us figure out what the heck is going on. In addition, they should be giving an update with any additional information we have on our end.\n\nAgain, we understand it sucks. A lot. It's not our intent to make Mac players have a crappy experience by any means. As I've mentioned, there was a fix on PBE that did work, so the question now becomes why did it work on PBE v. live? That's what the team is working on today. \n\nThey have been working on this issue daily.
