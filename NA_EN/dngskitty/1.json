I got demoted to d4 at the start of preseason with the incredible dark harvest being so op (it was fun to play against zyra brand and losing, really fun). So i was like 85 lp into d4 and then they merged d4 and d5. \n\nThe problem started there. I coudnt play some supports because you would see some op combos and i kept going down because they just deal so much damage :(. \n\nIt feels really bad because i know that I am good. I don't know what to do in this elo, it just feels so bad and frustating to predict what the ennemy team will do and to have no power to do anything about it...

The game has evolved so much since its inception that roles and playstyles are more varied than they used to be. I personally don't think that's a bad thing. \n\nThere are tank supports, enchanters, mage supports, and now {{champion:555}} . If you play your champion well, their strengths should multiply.

Has to be too close to harass, and it's very difficult to land all three spells twice in a row just to evenly trade a lane opponent who just has to dodge one of those six spells to win a trade. If I go mid and don't miss a single spell, then yeah I'll win the lane. But if I'm off just a little then I'll probably lose, whereas my opponent just has to land maybe one skillshot to get the same results. \n2. Very gankable but not with the range that xerath, velk, and lux has to play safe. \n3. You either use spells on minions to go even in lane dominance or you harass, whereas someone like TF just has to Q the wave, maybe throw a red card. Brands are always out cs'd mid (BRAND HAS THE SECOND LOWEST CS NUMBERS OF ALL MIDS, despite not being a roam/ assassin champion like LB who has the actual lowest) or have the wave pushing towards them (unless W+E is used on the wave a ton, which causes mana problems and Brand is one of the most gankable mages). \n4. Brand's best rune is DH because of how easy it is to proc on him. In mid you'll proc it half as much (or worse depending on match up) whereas in bot a Brand will get the most DH stacks of anyone in the game. \n5. AP doesn't scale well on Brand, putting a lot of his power into his passive which doesn't need massive item spikes to do damage, and is amplified a ton with the easy to buy magic pen items and rylia's + liandry's. Going mid for extra farm to get those extra cs numbers (43/44 for all mid champions in terms of cs though) isn't worth the extra menial ap item. \n6. The only reason Brand has a 50% WR mid is because of his amazing teamfight potential. He probably has the best damage potential of any champ for grouped team fights. That being said, his teamfight potential isn't greatly increased by going mid rather than support. In fact, it's probably better to have a mid for the enemy team to focus on so that a Brand can actually get his combos off in a teamfight, or if he's focused hard, then the mid won't be focused then can do the massive damage instead. \n\nMy proposed changes includes nerfs to his damage, buffs to his CS and better AP scaling: \n\n1. Brand's passive burns minions for an increased amount to assist in CS. \n3. His autoattack burns minions (only minions) for an extra small amount of damage as well. \n2. His **base damages are all decreased at every level** but has much better AP scaling (making him weaker at every minute of the game until around 2 magic items, in which he becomes stronger than previously). <- this alone would lower support Brand by 3% winrate, but alone would trash all of Brand's early game making him the weakest around, so the other proposed changes are needed to assist in lane harass/ CS. \n3. He has slightly longer range on E. \n4. Similar to Ryze, it would be great to give Brand some mobility like an MS boost or shield on landing an ability, or even just a small base MS increase. Brand is the only champ that requires two spells to land a small stun to avoid ganks, but if either of those abilities are ever used to help with CS then you're screwed. So it's either always have wards up everywhere, try to go even in CS, or lose CS but be prepared for a gank. I would love to have a simple gold card to throw out or a long range single spell stun (Xerath) to help against ganks. \n5. Ignoring only #4 but keeping the only 3, perhaps reworking his kit interaction to make him more viable to play midlane would be an option. This is a more difficult change though and not just a small number push-around. \n\nWell, that's all from me! This will probably just get downvoted because it has Brand in it but I think these are some really viable solutions.","replies":[{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2018-12-27T21:44:53.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now this is a comment coming from a guy who actually played brand in both positions and understands his problems, great comment!\nI do agree with 90% of what you said, but the one and only thing i'd like to disagree, and disagree heavily on is this:\n\n> His base damages are all decreased at every level but has much better AP scaling \n\nWhy? His Q when maxed does a measly 200 base dmg, his E when maxed does 150 base dmg. Some LEGIT support champs does have better base dmg, let alone tanks. The biggest reason why he is soo good as support is his poke dmg. Back quite a few patch ago rito bumped his burn dmg from 2% up to 4%. That should be nerfed, and made it so that if you apply a new blaze stack to an already ablaze target the previous blaze stack remaning dmg is applied as a bonus. That way his poke is nerfed but his all in is not weakened that much. Other thing is his 12-16% stacked blaze. Either make it scale from lvl 1-11 instead of 1-9 to make support brand weaker, while also increasin the ap ratio, or flat out nerf it and heavily increase its ap ratio, along side with the rest of his kits ap ratio.","replies":[{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-12-27T21:57:12.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TomiMan7,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AKb4FNyE,comment-id=00150000,timestamp=2018-12-27T21:44:53.896+0000)\n>\n> Now this is a comment coming from a guy who actually played brand in both positions and understands his problems, great comment!\n> I do agree with 90% of what you said, but the one and only thing i&#x27;d like to disagree, and disagree heavily on is this:\n> \n> Why?

There are a lot of super bad support players out there and instead of forcing them to play their worst team slot, you choose that slot for yourself to improve your win rate. That's how the logic goes. I have succeeded multiple times with Varus, Kog'maw, and Jhin support as examples but they are marksmen. It's honestly not much different from me getting matched with some super greedy support player except now I'm expected to not kill too many minions.\n\nWould you rather protect and spoil the support who's supposed to be the one doing the protecting or would you rather be the support yourself and protect your ally? People are using burst damage champions to threaten the enemy to get them off their lane partner. You should be asking yourself why is threatening more effective a deterrent to killing your lane partner sometimes than actual preservation attempts. Simply put, just as you cannot trust supports to protect others, you also cannot always trust a bottom lane player to use the protections given to them. You cannot always trust them to punish the enemy mage when they overextend. So players pick a champion that can do some punishing themselves just in case that is necessary. Many support players, if not most will only ever take blue income item. Why? Because it's the only income item that results in damage dealt to the enemy champs when triggering its income gain.\n\nIf there were fewer new players playing bottom/support then you wouldn't see so much distrust among the support players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MorgManBasher","date":"2018-12-28T04:49:55.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So basically you want Riot to remove something that's been part of the game since forever because you personally don't like it\n\nI been a \"support\" main since season 2, we are a playerbase like everyone else and we enjoy doing damage even when we aren't meta.\n\n{{champion:9}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"RedEve","date":"2018-12-28T06:26:36.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like Vel'Koz man,  being played support since 2014 (and who knows how long)- even when his win rate at support was shit in S6- Even when his support pick rate has always creeping near his mid pick rate.\n\nNo idea why this topic was brought up like \"Vel'koz & Xerath\" support is new BUT BE CAREFUL MAN even when **Riot puts the damn champion in the support orbs** they'll still say they're not supports! **Gotta heal and shield to be counted as a support!**\n\n**Remember that people won't accept Pyke as a support despite being designed as a support and Riot's literally trying to keep him to the support role, despite have good CC and an ult passive that shares gold** ~ still not real support btw! ~Even when [The Last Roadmap says Pyke support](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/2018/04/champion-roadmap-april-2018/)\n\nPut it short, gotta play the most boring shit in the bot lane otherwise remove the champion.","replies":[]}]}]}
