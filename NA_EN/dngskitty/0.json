I think someone who had been maining Zyra *mid* for three years probably has a better handle on what to do against a Fizz in lane, but even for them that sounds like an awful matchup. \n\nThat's sort of the nature of League. If someone is popping off, there's at least one person on the other team having a sub-par game. I usually try to mitigate the bad vibes by thinking carefully about what I am going to do the *next* time I get stuck in that matchup. Come to lane lvl 1 with a null magic mantle, potentially. It sounds crazy, because I'm sure that start doesn't have a high pick rate, but if that's what you have to do in that specific matchup, you do it. You can't always rely on statistics. \n\nAnd never feel bad about getting crushed by a matchup you've never played. Sometimes it'll happen to you, and sometimes it'll happen to your lane opponent.

So Zyra should mostly cc instead of damaging champions when it's risky. And also use your cc abilities more accurately, hit them more risk them less. \n\n2nd. **How to Recover**\n\n>Get gold. Use non cc/mobility abilities more for minions and save your CC or Mobility abilities incase of ganks. and be adding objectives into your win condition; like drake and Herald. Those Will help you and your team have an easier time. Winning\n\n>Increase your map checks,\nIf you have a missing Assasin or missing champion that can kill you, Mark them as a Champ that can kill you and move away from them.  Also Pink wards can help slightly. \n\n**How and when to fight back from behind**\n\n>**Always have the advantage in a fight. That is how**\n\n>That is the main point. Below are examples, of what that it looks like. \n\n>2v1 them Have the higher Numbers\n>Use your abilities when they waste theirs\n>If they chase you run away, if they run into your team, let them.\n>Poke without trading health\n>If you're behind and can't fight, run away. If you can poke without getting hurt do it.\n>Guard your Carry\n\n\nThat is all\n\nOf course you may have mistakes while doing some of these but as you play the game you'll do these things better and do very well. \n\nI'll even share a Greek Proverb\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16gtkEgNN7vyxjOrFPWre_3s7yesqIel1/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nP.
