Unfortunately this happened right as the servers went down, and I was unable to use the in-client report service. I know there used to be a way to open a support ticket to report a player on the website.. But I haven't been able to find it. Is there still a way to do this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T18:58:19.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you happen to miss the chance to report a player through the game client in post-game lobby, you can always send a report via a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (pick any category, but the first one works best). \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessAmbition","date":"2016-09-19T00:08:14.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
