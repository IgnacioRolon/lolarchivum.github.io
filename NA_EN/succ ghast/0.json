They said since ADCs made or broke the game, tanks and other laners stalled until late game where all the fighting would happen and the main strat would be who could protect their ADC from enemy damage better.\n\nTo fix that, people gave ideas of ways to increase damage so that games wouldn't go so late, and make ADCs mandatory. They also complained that mages lacked any sort of agency in the game. Towers were easier to take with AD then with AP so that made mages a weak pick when considering the actual objective of the game. Thus they changed towers to be hurt via mixed damage and inadvertently made them weaker.\n\nThis is legit the result of what the community clamored for.\n\nScuttle changes affect junglers mainly.
