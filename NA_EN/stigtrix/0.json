Good job!

You would also have the opportunity to add the armoured glove that is displayed in the splash art, but which is _not_ in-game. That is to say: I would not mind added details in addition, but if I would have to choose between the two, with the low cost in mind, I would choose VFX.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Jedahs","date":"2017-03-08T06:31:11.812+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the encouragement :)\n\nThanks to everyone’s feedback, we evolved our mindset when making chromas.  Instead of aiming to provide color change options, we now look for ways to create “skins for skins”.\n\nBefore we begin, we try our best to give each sets of chromas a sub-theme.  Instead of giving the clothing new colors, we look at the base thematic and see if we can dive deeper into the sub-themes in that alternate universe.  \n\nMy personal favorite set is the Dragon Slayers.  We asked ourselves, if the dragon slayers fought and slew different elemental dragons, what would the armor look like after they took the dragon parts and crafted armor out of them?  What would the scales look like for each elemental dragon?  An ancient earth dragon's body overgrown with moss or a powerful black dragon with magma seeping from the scales?  How would the fight have gone down?  Did they rip the wings or chip a horn in the fight?\n\nWhenever it makes sense, we also try to hide little easter eggs in the chromas for players to find.  The onesie sets and Amumu cakes gave us some opportunity to do that.  Have fun finding them.

I saw the green Braum one in-game for the first time the other day and did a double take. The green scales on his shield made him look like he almost belonged in the elderwood set with Hecarim. You guys turned what used to be a rather 'meh' project (chromas overall) into something people actively enjoy. Keep up the good work!\n\n(deleted and re-uploaded the comment cause I'm an idiot)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-03-08T08:31:15.868+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I totally agree.\nChroma's have SO MUCH potential to be absolutely awesome.\nBut a lot of the time, even after the skins team decided to Revise how they do them, we ended up with some pretty mediocre results.\nI was really bummed out with the Dragon Slayer Xin Zhao ones, they were just poorly done and plain. I also didn't appreciate them being on such a poor release skin.\n\nThese ones of the other hand are actually impressive, fun and unique, and despite being done a release skin, they are actually still worth it.\n\nI hope we see this continue, and for the team to seriously push it when it comes to skins and chroma's instead of ALWAYS clinging to the classic assets like in the past. (Even recently in some cases)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"StigtriX","date":"2017-03-09T10:49:04.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do feel Dragonslayer Xin needs some more contrasting colours on some of the chromas though, and that some of the spears are too close to each other in colour. **Obsidian** and **Sandstone** need to be further away from each other in colours overall. What I find most problematic is that the cloth at the end of the handle near the spear's head has the same colour as the armour for all versions, which looks really bad and does not make the weapon stand out enough, which could translate to visibility issues. Ruby is the worst offender here, where the skin ends up like a red blob. I really like what you are going for, you just need to improve upon it a tad more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"K0SMOS","date":"2017-03-08T20:54:52.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now the question is can we have a skin for a skin of a skin.\n\n\nWe must go deeper. \n\n**Skinception**\n\nStill love the new chromas definetly an upgrade.
