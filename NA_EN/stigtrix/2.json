Is it really that hard? Pentakill Kayle looks really good, and you pulled it off with an all-black skin, just with some clever use of lighting and dark grey to make the different parts very easy to spot. I do not like the purple, blue or brown used for Karthus, Mordekaiser, Sona or Yorick. They look like members of other bands with other images, especially Sona and Yorick. The style is there, the colours are not. It does not feel like a band with a common theme.\nStyle: 10/10\nColouring: 2/10\n\nBring them back...

SHE looks better. Fine. But blue/purple isn't black, and her splash clearly doesn't represent her in game skin colouration.

I think it is a little close minded to think every metal band follow the black colour. Like, grim tones? Ok, mostly the case.\nBut only black? How about we accept we are in 2017 and a lot of metal bands use different color and you don't need to make every member in black to make them look metal?\n\nDark blue seem like a very good way to make sona more than the \"Metal goth girl\" stereotype.\n\nBut could it be darker?

We had a discussion around the color of the dress after we debuted her on PBE. We saw feedback both for and against the color change, which is why we wanted to get together and take a look at her again. \n\n**TL;DR after our discussion:** We're going to roll with keeping her dress as-is\n\nBasically, this is what we would have made Pentakill Sona look like if we had designed her based on the standards we have today. \n\nWhen we were working on her, we decided a blue tint was better because this is a semi reflective fabric, whether it's velvet, satin, or taffeta, the black would be reflecting color off.

Desparado Cassiopeia is the most egregious offense when it comes to dramatically changing a skins colors.

She is all black, save for some very dark grey and some neat highlights where there is not actual metal. Why can't you do the same for the rest of the skins? I would be fine with Sona's skin if you gave her a black dress with blue or purple highlights in the form of reflections, but you chose a blue dress. It looks out of place. You simply fail to deliver on the theme. I am extremely dissatisfied with your direction. It is as weird as making a Shadow Lord Shen skin, and have it bright pink. Do you not see the problem? It is too bright and colourful. The dress looks good if one views it objectively, but it does not fit the skin theme, and thereby looks bad in that context.\n\n**_When we were working on her, we decided a blue tint was better because this is a semi reflective fabric, whether it's velvet, satin, or taffeta, the black would be reflecting color off. Also, the dark, dark blue separates everything and makes her an easier read in game; her etwahl and chains don't blend into her model and muddy things up from game height._**\nThe problem is that It is not simply a tint, but an all blue dress. I get no impression that black is involved at all. As stated above: why not use highlights in the form of actual reflections instead of all blue? It would make it more interesting too. And if you want to separate everything better, why on earth did you choose a hue for the chains that is so close to her dress'? They should be greyer or have the same kind of shiny highlights that you used for Pentakill Kayle's wings.\n\n**_I realize this isn't the answer everyone is going to be hoping for, but I did want to provide some context, as having things change without any kind of reasoning (especially when it's something you like) sucks._**\nYou could at least make some all-black chromas for the Pentakill skins? That way you earn more money and satisfy all.\n\nWhy do you choose to make a change that goes against the theme? That is my question, because I know the artist team is skilled enough to do some changes that maintain both the black theme and clarity.","replies":[]}]}]}
