I have a lot of hate for some champions, and some champions that I even wish Riot would just delete, but even then I don't feel that the game itself is completely un-balanced.\n\nI like the tank update, it gave champions like {{champion:113}} who was considered kind of bad some love and even if she is a little bit strong atm, I'd still rather take her at her current state now (or hell even her old Cinderhulk state) than seeing {{champion:104}} {{champion:64}} in every game basically carrying the game themselves.\n\nNow what I feel about balance after this recent change? {{champion:113}} is a little strong atm but she is already getting nerfs on pbe which I feel is fine. {{champion:154}} I feel is fine for now, I haven't seen him enough to really say for sure, and {{champion:57}} I haven't seen as much either but personal feelings would be that his ult goes way to slow imo.\n\nOne change that happened that I don't really like was honestly the change of {{item:3026}}. I was some one who actually liked to build it on mages, or some tanks and feels that this was a bit strange to just remove and then basically turn it into an ADC item. I mean...I kind of understand what Riot might of been thinking doing that...Since Tanks might start to show up a lot more, ADCs will become more important now because they need them to fight the tanks since most mages can't really do that to well. Also with {{item:3102}} being turned into a Mage item, the ADCs missed out on that option for their defensive item and since GA/Banshees has always been the only 2 main defensive options that ADCs had in the past, GA being the more common one, they probably assumed it was best to basically make it made for ADC.\n\nSo I guess I understand the reasoning for the change, though I feel it was a bit weird to to that change during a patch that {{item:3153}} is still really strong, and some of their crit items got cheaper, but I don't really have any problems with the ADCs right now but more concerned at how much stronger AD Mid laners will be now that they'll have {{item:3026}} on top of buffs to the AD of {{item:3812}} {{item:3074}}.\n\nActually I do have a complaint/concern with this update. I actually don't like the change to {{item:3301}} line. Yes the missing mana is cool and the quest line idea is interesting, but my problem is actually with the picking up the coins idea. It makes it much harder for you to try to play back and catch up when you are losing the lane. I don't know if the enemy team can see the coins (I think they can) but if they can, then it just makes it way to easy to get zoned out of going to get that coin to stack it up, especially if they're bot lane has strong CC. I had a game where we were getting pushed in most of the lane phase, and the enemy bot lane was {{champion:51}} {{champion:143}}, I was not going attempt to try to grab a coin that is away from my turret past those 2 as a {{champion:267}} when they already had a strong advantage over us.","replies":[{"poster":"GeckoHD","date":"2017-05-07T21:18:46.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i understand your point, but what i am traying tonsaybis that, some times it looks like riot doesnt respect their own game, and just make random changes cuz is fun and it is, they make a lot of good changes  but their mistales are so dumb and notorious that all the good things get insta deleted.\n\nAn example yhe berf the new amumu pasive cus it was broken AF and taht k i like it is a coherent balance decision BUT buff syndra ult for no reason, they know that 9 balls is excesive but they did it !!!!\n\nOther example the make vhanges to poro king in the past months and now is so much fun to play that mode but in other side the just their best game mode ever URF and they make it ARURF the worst game mode ever made is just so stupid that everytjing is random cuz you get a shit team and get completely fucked by a stun team (lux, morgana, ryze, soraka, veigar)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-05-07T01:49:15.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first:\nRiot sold all of the company to Tencent, but without the money Tencent provided in the first place, LEAGUE WON'T BE A THING or at least not in the stage it is in now.\nsecond: \nThe meta is created by the League community, in Riots eyes, the meta does not exist, the player should be able to play whatever they like in whatever way they see fit.\nThird:\nWho's for you to say how Riots running their company? they didn't ask for your opinion, did they? how bout go work for riot and tell the boss that \"YOUR FUCKING YOUR COMPANY OVER\".\n\nbtw\nget\na\nlife.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fed by Snu Snu","date":"2017-05-07T00:24:49.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to ruin your game: Sell your company to Tencent.","replies":[]}]}
