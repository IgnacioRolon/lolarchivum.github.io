Nothing happened. So I tried again and I get nonstop bug splats. I can't even make it to the log in screen. I tried the hextech repair tool, I tried repair tool on the client, I even did a full uninstall / reinstall. Yet still clicking Play either does nothing, or it's a bug splat. I checked all my firewall settings. I've followed all the guides. Please send help or I can't save Gotham.","replies":[{"poster":"B099Y","date":"2017-02-23T19:53:47.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been trying to launch the game myself and have been unable to do so.
