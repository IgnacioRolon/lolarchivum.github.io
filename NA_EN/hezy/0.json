Highest pentaill rating in all ranks. Then there is Nasus, Tryndamere, Mordekaiser, Yorick, Jax......... We will just say top laners except Shen pretty much can just shove down their lane. Normally with Mordekaiser i have top turret down in roughly 8 minutes, depending on the enemy ofcourse..... Enemy jungler camping top tends to happen too, but that just results in a double kill (again depending on the match up).... His only real downfall is if the enemy top has a lot of range lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyBabyJesusZ","date":"2017-04-16T19:33:57.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pick tahm kench\n\npress w on a teamate\n\nthrow into enemy turret\n\n\n\n\nnow u can carry anyone on ur team :)","replies":[]}]}
