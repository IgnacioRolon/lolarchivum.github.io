I love to read the articles when they come out, and i watch the games whenever i can. unfortunately, i work in the foodservice industry so i dont get to watch games that often. also, i check the esports page everyday in hopes for a new article. im sad to say that there is never enough for me.  that being said, i would love to see a lot more articles written, as well as an audio version of the games broadcast so i could listen to it while i work. I would also love to listen to talk shows or podcasts where LCS and league in general is discussed. \r\nI have recently began learning web design as i am planning on a future in IT. So with everything in mind, i was just wanted to get some feedback from some other LCS fans out there to see if yall want the same things that i want? which is pretty much just more LCS news and broadcasts. \r\nIf any Riot admins read this, could you tell me if i could start my own LOL Esports newspage on my own or if i would have to get some endorsement or rights from riot to do so?\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Does anybody else want a lot more LCS to read about/listen to/watch ?","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-30T13:20:47.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are tons of resources out already that cover it and with 4 major leagues(NA/EU LCS /LCK/LPL) and a bunch of emerging leagues (LMS, CBLoL, LJL, CIS, etc) there is never a time when you can't games to watch, but I do like the idea of making them easier to find (mainly the not so popular contests and/or regions).\n\nWith sites like Surrender@20, ReignofGaming, OnGamer providing content, and then steamers/aficionados like Thorin,  Monte, Travis, and quite a few others providing videos of interviews, region specific/pro-scene discussion and just an abundance of material everywhere. Not to mention stats pages like lol.gamepedia.com / lol.leaguepedia.com with a community updating individual game stats. The entire thing is a very bustling progressive machine.\n\nI enjoy the idea of more content to view. From what I understand, as long as you are not attempting to directly market off of Riot content with your site, and declare it as just a community site. You shouldn't need any rights or endorsements from Riot.","replies":[]}]}
