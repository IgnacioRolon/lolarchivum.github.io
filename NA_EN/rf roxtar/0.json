The player you are retaliating against probably *wants* to see you get upset. When you get into an argument you are just creating new problems for the other players, and the trolls will just egg you on even more. The best thing to do is just mute them and report their behavior.\n\nIf you are having difficulty not responding to these people, I suggest muting them upon entering the match by typing \"/mute all\", or moving the chat window off the screen so you can't read it.\n\nPunishment also has 4 tiers, and are typically administered in order;\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban\n\nExcept in extreme cases such as hate speech and death threats, you'll get them one at a time in order. It takes 3 months for your next punishment tier to drop down *one* step. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI/d/p7scKW1K?comment=00050000000000000000\n\nI suggest reading this material for more information on how you are expected to behave, and how reports work;\n\nhttp://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work\n\nIf you would like to contest your punishment with Riot, you may submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), but Riot will not remove a punishment unless it was done in error.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.

Now-a-days you just have to mute and do less communicating when arguing. I'm sure you aren't a bad person, but it is hard to grasp league code of conduct when it comes to reportable offenses. Stay positive, stay kind and I'm sure you can get back up to 30 and work your way to being a up to date account.
