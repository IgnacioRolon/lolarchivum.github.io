Some of you might look at my name and wonder why I do not enjoy my main role anymore. I have been thinking about it alot as well. After all, this is the role that made me understand and play this game better over the past months and also a role that I really enjoyed considering the fact that I love helping teammates through hard battles. But heres the problem that I have discovered, I don&#039;t feel, except for the limited wards that I can place for my team, that I help the whole team. I am almost only helping one role: the adc.\r\n\r\nNow, you guys might think im just stupid from that statement, but please, I would like you guys to try to be open minded and let me explain my thoughts and then write your opinion on the matter at hand. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, let&#039;s talk about what is a support. A support is a class that is focused on, not hurting the ennemy, but making your allies live. They have alot of abilities that increases the survability of the team. In mmo&#039;s, they are the one focused because of how well they keep the team alive. I have only played league competitively in the world of mobas, but most of the time the support is ignored, unless you are playing someone like soraka. This alone can explain one thing:\r\n\r\n The support characters are not impactful enough to be worthy of damaging abilities\r\n\r\nNow why is the support not focused? Simple, they have less abilities then in mmos. However, because of that the support characters are very limited and need careful planning on who to help. This is understandable. However, that makes the role feel really dull because who is in danger the majority of the time? The adc. To be honest it pisses me off a little because I can&#039;t have the luxury to help my 3 other teammates who are fighting. The mage also needs backup. Yes they do have cc&#039;s but that doesn&#039;t mean they can&#039;t be supported. Same thing goes for the frontline, their characters might have more survability through cc, defensive items and self shields and buffs, but that doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t need help. Sadly, the cooldowns and the restriction of 4 abilities removes the ability of the support to be able to help the others. Then again, this is a teamfight scenario, but most of the time, if the support sees the mage and the adc in danger, the support will choose the adc.\r\n\r\nTo complement their lack of spells, we support players have to buy items that help us increase our ability pool. However, I rarely see myself thinking of my teammates when it comes to buying a support item, but im mostly thinking about my adc. If I see that the ennemy has a burst team, I will tell myself that I need to buy a locket to defend **my adc**. This is a sad truth for atleast me. Also, support items are focusing on the adc, compared to the team. Ardent censer, zeke harbringer, mikael crucible and knight vow are most likely made for the adc. Im not saying that you won&#039;t buy it for only the adc, but it&#039;s focused on this role. The two items that seems to be focused on the team are: redemption and locket. \r\n\r\nRedemption - this is honestly one of my favorite items because it let&#039;s me heal my entire team. It seems like im helping everyone compared to the one role that my role is supposed to help. Redemption is Imo a step foward in the support itemisation progress.\r\n\r\nLocket of the iron solari - The new locket, as much as I understand the purpose, feels weird. The big shield is really useful but the range radius of the item is too short. For that reason, i end up only shielding my adc and my mage in alot of situations and because of that, I build it with my adc in mind and not my team. It is, however, a item that is really team oriented and I may just misunderstand its potential. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s talk about a subject that is interesting me, why can&#039;t the support help other lanes and have to be caged withing bot lane when it&#039;s the laning phase? Yes we can roam, but that&#039;s about it and most of the time it&#039;s only going to be mid lane because top lane is too far and with the time you get there, the adc is going to whine about losing cs while you try to help other fucking teammates to succeed. They are oppurtinities of course, but im talking about most cases scenario. Obviously, the support has to stay bot lane because the adc is most vulnerable role in the game, having no or little cc and not alot of sustain or self defenses buff. However, most of them have escapes. But, let&#039;s make two adc solo in a lane and put the support mid lane, what is going to change? Yes some adcs are vulnerable to ganks such as jhin and kow&#039;maw but if you take vayne by exemple, she can easily solo in a lane as long as its 1v1. Not only that but the adc is going to get more exp and scale faster. That doesn&#039;t mean its the best idea I&#039;ve ever had, if I even had a good idea in my life, but that could be something interesting. What if the support laned with the teammate in need and could rotate around the map to help their teammates instead of being caged in one lane? Mid having trouble because the ennemy support or jungler helped? go lane a few minutes with the mid laner so he can get back up. In the meantime, the ennemy support will help other teammates. this will make the support role feel more dynamic and more impactful. Then again, this idea will have it&#039;s flaws.\r\n\r\nThis was a long text to write and im sorry for those who have read this all the way. I am ready to be criticized and having to handle insults, but I would like you guys to give me your two cents about the support role and my idea of it.","replies":[]}
