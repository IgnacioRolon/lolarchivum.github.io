Today, it was the day that this challenge of mine has finally been a success. I have never been so happy in league for a long time, especially after getting hacked recently and almost losing my account to him. \r\n\r\nI just want to send  a message to any inspiring One Trick Ponies and support mains out there (while also sharing my happiness with you guys) to never give up. You will have up and downs, but every rank is reachable. Sometimes, you will hit a wall and fall down, but life is not about how you fall, its about how you get back up and go further until the next obstacle. Some people will call you trash, some will call you cancer, but you must ignore them and push on. Believe in yourself and stay humble. \r\n\r\nAlso, when you&#039;re tilted, dont go in a playing streak like I do, it usually never ends up well.\r\n\r\nFor once, I am proud of myself in league. {{champion:267}}","replies":[]}
