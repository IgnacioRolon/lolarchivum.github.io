No info to offer right now, but you may have to wait for the server to get the message that your match is finished.  Hang tight!","replies":[{"poster":"Aura Shadow","date":"2017-09-21T18:20:56.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey not sure if this helps, but anyway, After I skipped the stats, I went to my match history to see if it counted and it said I got a victory. I even clicked the match and it loaded all the post game stats, however it's still saying I'm in game (ghost game). So I'm not sure what the issue is, but at least some part of the server recognizes that the game ended.","replies":[]}]}]}
