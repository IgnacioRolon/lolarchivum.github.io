This semester I am currently taking a course in Business Plan Development and I was fortunate enough to have assembled a team of 4 other people who thought my idea had potential. We are now developing a business plan to start a business with the idea that we'll generate revenue through teaching leadership principles utilizing video games. One of our products that we will offer will be a half-full day event in which we plan to use a MOBA to help teach communication skills, emotional intelligence, and other leadership principles on an application level. League of Legends is obviously one of the most (if not the most) successful MOBA's in the genre and we have therefore singled it out as a potential to be utilized for our teaching purposes. So my real question is, what sort of process would I need to go through to try and get your permission to utilize the game as a teaching medium and what sort of costs would be inherent (royalties, etc.)? While I may be a college student at the moment, I hope to make this plan into a real, viable business one day and I would love to utilize League to do so. \r\nThanks for your time and consideration,\r\nTyler Brockinton (a.k.a. T-Brock)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T01:46:38.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're planning on using this as a teaching material and not profiting from it, you should be good to go.\n\nOnce you start bringing profits and revenue into the picture, it'll be a much more difficult process.
