(This is probably just a waste of time but I was told it would be worth posting on the boards.) \r\n\r\nIt would also be great if it was clarified in client that the 3 refunds are your only 3, so hopefully my idiocy isn't repeated by people in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T23:45:23.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each account is only provided with those 3 refunds, so unfortunately, I cannot provide you any additional refunds, sorry. :/\n\nAlso, I wanted to mention that the new client has the functionality you're hinting at, where it specifically states how many refunds are available, as shown below:\n\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/21265954c5b84358b1be3f4eee41b31f.png\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
