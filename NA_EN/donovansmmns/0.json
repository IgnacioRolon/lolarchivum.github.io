So i was on the updated client and my friend told me to start up the legacy client to play one for all, when i clicked legacy client it deleted my alpha shortcut and league in general. I thought nothing of it and so i went to download league again but everytime I try to start up league it crashes and says \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working\" and it force closes my client! I need somebody to help me ASAP as i have been trying to fix this all week :( Thx &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T02:36:33.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This *may* be related to the live incident that's ongoing right now, but I'd recommend launching League as admin to confirm this isn't a permissions issue.

It's never a permission issue for me. It _usually _happens sporadically around patch dates..  Some days there is absolutely no way league will launch because of that error.
