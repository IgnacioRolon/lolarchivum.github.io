I don&#039;t think the Targon event and this Aurelion Sol teaser is a coincidence, since Aurelion Sol is a Sun dragon and the Solaris from Targon are praying sun and stuff like that. Also, on the event page, we can clearly see that they included kind of slots filled with champions belonging to the Mount Targon. There are 5 slots, but only 3 champions (Leona, Pantheon and Diana). I&#039;m pretty sure they are keeping an empty slot to place Aurelion in here, don&#039;t you think. Whatever. Give me your opinion on that ^.^!!\r\nPost-Scriptum: Excuse my english if I made mistakes. My first langage is French.\r\nOh and, better nerf Wukong","replies":[]}
