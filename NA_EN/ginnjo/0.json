I believe each 10 coins grant you an extra gold up a maximum of 5. So whether if the quest tells you to do it or not, you should be saving if you're winning matches. What's worse is when everyone gets the same quest to collect specific passives. By everyone focusing on the same thing to complete their quest, it actually messes up everyone in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"UnstoppableMaybe","date":"2019-07-10T23:54:36.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct, and missions that require players to chase the same champions globally all around the world is absurdity, and has to be a compromise, to make them missions players can look forward to. Perhaps by having them (not removing them completely)...but make each handful of \"the champion specific\" mission types, be a different champion requirement every \"x\" number of players, so thousands of players aren't trying to do the same thing all around the WORLD! It's definitely frustrating when everyone has the same mission, so everyone is constantly taking what everyone needs lol! While League of Legends programming is sloppy and mediocre at times, at least it's still a fun game.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/teamfight-tactics/hQfi7EQT-poll-vote-to-ban-boring-mission-from-tft-reach-lvl-6-before-draft-share-round-11","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Makarakarn","date":"2019-07-10T22:32:04.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean it's only one game you have to do it for the mission, and I did it first game no problem.
