When he is behind, he is totally useless. His damage is not anything special either and he is not a &quot;hyper-carry&quot;. There is almost no reason to pick Ezreal at this point besides the fact that he is pretty fun to play. \r\n\r\nIt is disappointing that he has sat in the trash bin since the beginning of season 3. It is even more disappointing that there are no planned changes to his kit as part of the marksmen update. The recent .5 AD bonus ad ration on his E is nice, but does not really make much difference. It does like 100 more damage late game and you usually use it defensively. \r\n\r\nEzreal&#039;s core problem is that he brings nothing to the team when behind and there are better adc&#039;s when ahead. He takes more skill to do less than almost every other adc. Riot either needs to add utility to his kit, increase his base damages, or add %hp scaling to his kit so he is less useless when behind or make his poke/kiting better to stand out more from other adcs.","replies":[{"poster":"fééd l0rd","date":"2015-10-21T23:40:38.113+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tristana is better in every point. she does everything better. i was telling this others for a long time. you summed up how useless he is if he cant snowball (which is hard cause he is weak early).","replies":[{"poster":"manbreeze09","date":"2015-10-21T23:46:27.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people build tear on ez, so even if you get a kill early it doesn't matter that much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShaftyMegee","date":"2015-10-21T23:38:15.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, at the moment he is overshadowed by pretty much every adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-10-21T23:56:31.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:6}}\n\nDon't lie.

He gives others AS with his W, his E is an escape, and his Q make his CD's less on top of doing some pretty good damage. The only thing they can really do for him is to reduce his mana costs and add an AD ratio to his W. His W used to be an AS slow, which is what made him a top tier ADC back in S2. Pick or Ban through world's! But that got removed and he suffered some small nerfs too, but it was mainly the AS slow removal that hit him. He came back for some time when his Q was buffed by 10% AD and 20% AP, plus the Trinity Force buffs, but he can't poke like Corki, he does hybrid damage, and he doesn't benefit from Crit like other ADC's do. He usually has to go with a BT and BotRK with his Trinity Force so he can at least sustain on top of doing good DPS with AA's and Q's. But that doesn't do as much as, say... an AA from Cait. \n\nI'd say to buff his Q, but I feel like it might put him over the edge, though a 130% AD ratio Q wouldn't be too bad given that's his only physical and his W doesn't have an AD ratio, plus his E can't be used aggressively a majority of the time.

Having an excape on E and the CDR on his Q don't really benefit him at all when he is behind, especially his team. The AS buff on his W is really weak compared to other utility adcs can bring to the table.","replies":[]}]}]}
