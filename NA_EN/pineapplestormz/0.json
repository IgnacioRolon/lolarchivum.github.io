But i still didnt play with them. I went to get more info about the seaon 3 rewards &amp; part of the text said that :''Keep in mind that for 5v5 and 3v3 tier rewards, you need to have won at least 10 games with the team to qualify.\r\nEnough with the exposition, letâ€™s show off the rewards!\r\n\r\nNow does that mean that if in didnt win 10 games with the team till the end of the season I wont get my rewards!? \r\nThanks for the answer &amp; sorry for my bad english lol","replies":[{"poster":"Blazer san","date":"2013-10-06T19:52:12.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im getting the same message","replies":[{"poster":"Blazer san","date":"2013-10-06T19:55:24.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still think its crap that there is no icon for this years championship, not only the sucky finals and shit legacy skin champ thresh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KnightCheckmate","date":"2013-09-24T19:17:01.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since a red is viewing this thread, I also have a question about the team rewards.\n\nWill you get rewards if you played in all the games on a team, but the team has less than 10 games total? In other words lets say 5 people get together and play and win 5 games...would they need to win 5 more to qualify for rewards?","replies":[{"poster":"Cypherous","date":"2013-09-24T21:18:58.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as i know the 10 win restriction would still apply, 5 wins would be half of the wins required to qualify and you would need to win 5 more games on that team to qualify for the rewards","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-25T21:22:34.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cypherous is correct!  Each player on a Ranked Team needs to earn 10 wins each.  If the Ranked Team only played 10 games, and they went 5-5, then no one will earn rewards on that team.  Once a member on that team has 10 wins with that specific team, that member will then earn rewards based on the highest ranked achieved of the team.\n\nI hope this further alleviates some confusion!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cypherous","date":"2013-09-24T09:26:41.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct if you do not have the required number of wins with the team you will not get the rewards they do for that queue","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-24T18:15:37.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To build on Cypherous's comment here (because it is spot on), keep in mind that if you win 10 games on that Ranked Team, you will earn the highest achieved rewards that the team earned.\n\nFor example, if you started playing when the team was Silver 1, and won your necessary 10 games in Silver 1, and the team then earned Gold 5, you would also earn the Gold 5 rewards.\n\nHope this clarifies everything!","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Eclipse","date":"2013-09-25T01:24:38.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also assume that applies within queue?  If I play 10 wins with a team in a 5's setting and we get silver, and 3 of those members go and place in gold in 3's, I will only be silver?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
