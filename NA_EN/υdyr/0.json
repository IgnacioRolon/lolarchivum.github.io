I was told in another thread that it isn't game-breaking so it isn't getting fixed anytime soon. The bug happens when Orianna e's someone and they die or leash the ball before it quite makes it to them, this creates a fake ball indicator (this can stack to 3+ indicators) and can also turn the ball invisible until death. With the ball invisible and having multiple indicators it is near impossible to keep track of its location. I have experienced it in at least 3 different matches before I stopped playing her (one was even with a rioter I mentioned it to).","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-04-28T22:39:22.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the extra indicator to disappear in one of my games.\nIf the same champ that made the extra indicator dies again with the ball on its way the indicator disappeared for me.\nWas ARAM and was with a Malphite so I had plenty of chances to try him dying with the ball lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
