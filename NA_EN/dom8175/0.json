So i stopped playing in fear of losing and getting demoted before the season ends. However i checked my profile a few days later and it said -3 LP. Will it still give me the Gold 5 rating at the end? Or will it give me silver?","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-11-05T04:26:42.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you are still Gold at the end of the season you'll get rewards for being in Gold even if you have -LP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T21:56:50.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having negative or 0 LP at the end won't demote you! You should feel free to stop playing in that queue, since *actively losing* games at 0 or negative LP could cause you to drop! If you stop now, you should get Gold ^_^","replies":[]}]}
