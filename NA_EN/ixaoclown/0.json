A yuumi was on a Pantheon and he was like 40/5 and unkillable. And if we did kill him, Yuumi would jump to the next and keep them basically immortal as well.

So definitely not. And if you fudge up hourglass or have used it on something else you're 100% boned. Sure theres some stuff thats equally as bad maybe, but those have semi realistic counters other than praying you can hourglass on time, or even have it up.\n\nAlso god forbid if ur an AD champ. You just lose. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2020-01-30T16:56:05.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:11}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} are 3 champs who need to be removed from urf","replies":[]}]}
