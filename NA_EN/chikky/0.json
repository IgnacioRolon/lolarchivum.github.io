I tested it in a custom game and when my target was ablaze and near minions the ultimate would not bounce. My other team mates also noticed it wasn&#039;t bouncing when it should.","replies":[{"poster":"klez2","date":"2016-02-09T05:49:02.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm. If my passive is already applied, usually with E, and there are minions near the enemy champ, and I use my ult on the enemy champ, it should hit the champ, then hit the minion, then hit the champ again, and so forth. It does not do that. It either hits the champ then hits random minions or simply disappears after hitting the enemy champ. I understand the range of the ult bounce and the fact that it will disappear if it cannot hit a new target but the new targets are well within range. I also understand my ult will not prioritize champs if the passive is applied by the ult itself, the passive is already applied, usually with E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-08T17:52:37.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chikky! \n\nThanks for the report!

It's quite rare but occasionally it fizzles out when it should not. i.e. when minions or other champions are nearby. I think it decides where it wants to bounce before it actually bounces and then if that target moves out of range it fizzles out regardless of other nearby targets. not cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaoBushido","date":"2016-02-06T15:51:14.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=N6e0adtA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-05T01:00:52.499+0000)\n>\n> We're aware of this issue and you should see a fix soon!
