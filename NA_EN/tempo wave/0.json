First, did you check to see if you had any chests available to earn by looking at your profile (in the legacy client)? It shows cooldowns for earning chests and how many you have available to earn. Next, did you earn an S-, S, or S+ grade in a match? If not you, was it someone in your premade group?\n\nThere's a lot of great information from others in this discussion, so please let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HotBrazilianGF","date":"2016-11-28T20:05:09.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to add to this. If you Que with a Friend who earns S- or higher, you will get a Chest so long as you have not gotten a chest on that champion. So you can still Queue with a champion you can't S rank with, so long as you queued (Key word there, needs to be a friend you got in line with) with a person who earns an S- rank or higher during the match. LASTLY, you must own the champion. \n\nTo be clear to. You ALWAYS get a chest if you meet the requirements, but you will often get a Key Fragments also, so don't panic if you see the message for a key fragment only. You will get a chest as well if you meet requirements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rick Yiordan","date":"2016-11-28T04:34:10.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get chests from getting an s- to s+ grades on a champion you've never played for the season. So being a one trick pony by playing only Yasuo for the whole season will only get you about 1 chest.\n\nFor example: In Season 6 if you got an s on all the champions you'd get around 100 chests, and now that season 7 is coming around, you get to play all the champions again, getting an s on all of them will grant you a chest once.","replies":[]}]}
