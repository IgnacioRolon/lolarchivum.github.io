Normally, this is not a severe issue and is only a second or two. This most recent game, however, i was booted from the champ select because i could not 'lock in'. This is the order of events that transpired.\r\n\r\n      I decided to edit a mastery page before it was my turn to lock in a champion, but i did not finish before it was my time. I clicked save, and exited the gui and proceeded to click lock in. I did not get any message about my masteries being saved. As I clicked the lock in button, it disappeared briefly and reappeared. Confused, I pressed the button over and over, to which nothing happened. I THEN got the message AFTER i had left the lobby \"your masteries have been saved\". Because my masteries had not saved, the game refused to acknowledge my attempts to lock in my champion and avoid dodging. \r\n\r\n     As we know, multiple dodges lead into leaver buster timers that punish players for leaving matches or champ select. Happening just this once is not extremely major, but if it happens more frequently, this could lead many to players accidentally dodging. I am uncertain if I am one of few or one of many who have a delay after editing masteries during champ select, but nonetheless, this is frustrating and should not happen. \r\n\r\n     Does anyone else experience any delays after changing a mastery page during champ select? Also, this is my first discussion, so i apologize if this not the correct location or badly written. i tried to involve as much information as i could.","replies":[{"poster":"Butterfingarz","date":"2016-11-16T20:04:22.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had no other issues after closing and relaunching the game yesterday. \n\nToday I ran the hextech repair tool as well as the NCSI Netalyzr. The only noteworthy things that showed up was some minor packet loss (i usually only got 3/4 packets back after running the ping test through the hextech repair tool several times to be certain), as well as netalyzr telling me -\n\n\"Your ISP's DNS server returns IP addresses even for domain names which should not resolve. There are several possible explanations for this behavior. The most likely cause is that the ISP is attempting to profit from customer's typos by presenting advertisements in response to bad requests\".\n\n I flushed my DNS, but according to your guide, there wasnt any more for me to do at this time. So far, no issues yet. This was the one and only time i have ever experienced lag within the champ select this severe. It may have been some variable that i had no control over, but if it happens again, i will contact you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Butterfingarz","date":"2016-11-15T05:08:42.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"update >>> i again got booted from the champ select and it had nothing to do with the masteries in particular. i did not click the edit masteries button and it did not change anything. i could not lock in. it seems to be extreme lag causing this issue, and not from the masteries not accepting directly. i also nearly couldnt ban a champion, as i banned who i wanted to at 15 seconds, but only responded at the 6 second mark. i am going to reboot and try again.... i normally have fine internet, with 59-60 MS response time, and never issues in the champ select. i understand its preseason and there are bound to be bugs and such.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T05:57:56.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing a rather *poor connection* to the servers.
