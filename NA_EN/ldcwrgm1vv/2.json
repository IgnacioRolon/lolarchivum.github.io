MF easily sells skins.... There are people who tell in the forums \" i bought all SG skins last year and I will buy all of them now too!\" and this is pathetic and disgusting. Riot only thinks about rich people. But whas about the poor ones who only rarely can afford a skin? I won't buy that one which I don't like just because this is new and there is no better.... I already have the Waterloo skin for MF and I appreciate it because it was a gift from my dear friend. So I don't desire for another MF skin. But if I would, I definitely would not choose SG.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-08-09T14:31:53.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare you compare MF to J*.
