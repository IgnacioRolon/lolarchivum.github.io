I'm not sure if intentionally banning someone that another player intended to play is against the rules as you can easily say you weren't paying attention or had to do something last minute and then came back and quickly banned without seeing someone else intend to pick x champ. So it's a bit of a touchy subject similar to feeders how you can't always tell if they intended to feed or not. But one thing I tend to do personally is never show which champ I intend to play because I know the potential of a troll teammate who will intentionally ban my intended champ. Usually happens to me especially because if I get a role of adc and I intend to pick nidalee, since it's unusual to have nidalee as adc, people on my team will intentionally ban nidalee so I can't use nid as adc. Or say someone doesn't like taric support and I wanted to play taric support, so my adc intentionally bans taric. That's why I just never show my intended champ.

This guy tho first banned a OTP lux (his name had OTP lux in it's name) who said in chat, don't ban my lux pls. Sec later he bans lux. Well, as you said, it is still possible it was an accident. Well, someone dodges and we get in lobby again. This time adc is hovering kalista (I think she is the only one hovering a champ). Kalista is pretty much never played and therefore no one usually bans her. Well, guess what. This guy bans kalista of all the champs he could've banned and somehow it's also the rare game a kalista is on my team. It's pretty obvious now this isn't an accident. I think even the support can't deny this isn't an accident. \n\nAlso, if you look at his profile he had lost most of his recent games with predator and smite/ghost on every jg game he played. I think that a ban for trolling and griefing would be preatty easy to hand out here. \n\nYea, I usually don't show my off-meta picks when I play it for the same reason. In this case it was teammates that were getting targeted and even if it didn't affect me I didn't want this guy to get away with it. Judging by his games he likely got a lot of reports anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"overpoweredscrub","date":"2019-08-23T15:23:53.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snowbrand,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KnAn2UKI,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-08-22T23:47:45.278+0000)\n>\n> Yes, that's usually the case.

But that alone is not enough proof since riot has nothing to check champ select bans with players intentionally banning other intent champs. That's not something established as reportable yet. That guy can always argue that he didnt do it on purpose even if he actually did. Trolls can int and say \"mb\" or \"oops\" in game and die 4 times before 5 minutes of the game and they will not get in trouble as 4 deaths is not something to be banned about, yet it can cause a huge set back for your team with someone dying 4 times to the enemy. Even if what you said is true, there's no way riot can see that actually happening. I doubt that anyone from riot is going to go look at that guy's past champ select actions and watch him intentionally ban intended champs that his teammate picked, if that's even possible for them to go back and watch. Your best bet is to say what you told me to riot in a support ticket, explain the situation with the same amount of detail you've just said, and see what they will do. Most likely they won't do anything about it, but what do you have to lose? Where there's a will, there's a way.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowbrand","date":"2019-08-23T19:29:26.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=overpoweredscrub,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KnAn2UKI,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2019-08-23T15:23:53.311+0000)\n>\n> If you want to talk about what I personally think, then yes the guy definitely was trolling.

I feel like it should be reportable if you are obviously banning peoples champs (a OTP lux that wrote in chat not to ban it and next a lobby with a kalista, the only one who was hovering and she is never banned and he bans it again), forcing people dodge justt because you want them too. I agree it might be hard to get a ban for it, like I guess if he banned a yasuo because he doesn't like having yasuo inting on his team, that would be enough of a reason.  I might not really like that attitude, but if it's straight up trolling as in this case it should be bannable tho somehow. \n\nMaybe riot can't see the game lobby tho, no idea how it works tbh!\n\nIn this case, I think it should be enough evidence for riot supp too anyway. I was gonna report him, but since for reasons you named, I thought it might not be highly prioritized and thought I would report it later when I got more time anyway. Guess I forgot to save the page with the players name, lol... But judging by his matchistory I hope it's likely he will get reported and banned sooner or later.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-19T23:12:51.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't.
