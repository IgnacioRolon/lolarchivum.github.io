The system is not strict because of \"toxic premades\". The system is strict because for years, since Tribunal days, the community has told Riot they want toxic players removed from the game. If you are being banned, it's because your behavior is deemed toxic by Riot based on what the community has decided.\n\nYou've parroted all this bullshit about being \"baited\" by premades - that's your lack of self control. You've said things that don't make sense about how reports always matter in the same post where you say that \"negativity\" is different from toxicity (they aren't, by the way - negativity is toxic.

Once a single player reports, it engages a review. Multiple reports do not stack, nor do they increase the likelihood of a punishment. \n\nSecond, all players are held to the same standard. By having an automated system, this is a good thing. While a team of Rioters would have their own biases and opinions, the IFS approaches every single chat log in an identical manner.\n\nThird, mute and report them. Being able to mute someone does not justify being allowed to flame (which some people think), but instead is a justification as to why you are not allowed to flame back. You can press a single button and have a perfect defense against anyone flaming you.\n\ntl;dr: Premades do not have increased reporting power. Stop harassing your teammates for doing poorly, stop flaming people who flame you, or otherwise you'll end up permanently banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-07-07T20:52:11.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, Karen.
