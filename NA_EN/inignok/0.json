I attempted to play a game on Saturday night, after already playing 2, and had my client freeze during the champ loading screen. I attempted multiple restarts to the client but was unable to log back in until my team had already remade the game, which I completely understand.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't follow is how I have now been placed in a 20 min Leave Buster que for something that wasn't my fault. I fully realize that people probably claim something similar to this a lot in an attempt to cheat the system. And in fact, I fully own my earlier AFK issues in Season 7 as I had a number of events pull me away from the game in a tight succession. What I don't understand is what happened to the 5 minute Leave Buster que? Am I destined to forever be stuck in a 20 minute Leave Buster for anytime I have an unexpected/unplanned AFK situation or client crash? Does this ever reset back to the 5 minute version?\r\n\r\nAny clarification would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n-Jeff-","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-05T23:57:52.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason it increased to a 20 min LPQ was due to the system detecting a history of leaves, and the previous LPQ hadn't had enough time to fall off your account I'm guessing. If you get a 5 game LPQ but continue leaving games for any reason you run the risk of getting hit with longer penalties to help push you towards troubleshooting the main problem. \n\nIf your client keeps freezing like that and causing you to be marked as a 'leaver' when you never meant to, I'd start off by running a quick repair.
