Extra points if the player admits in the chat \"I queued as support so I could skip the wait time\", which you would need to mention in the report as well. \n\nIf none of that happened, or at least a trade was enacted (people can trade roles if they want to), then it's not reportable. Off-meta picks are not reportable either. All it depends on is their intent. \n\nA support picking Nasus can still be viable, but a \"support\" picking Nasus, taking smite, and staying in the jungle forcing the original jungle out of their position is not viable and can be reported.\n\nWill it be immediately punished? No. \n\nBut it can flag their account for review, and if they continue this behavior it can get them punished.\n\nAgain, what matters is the intent of the player, so it's best to try and be descriptive as possible when you file that report.","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2016-10-20T18:20:07.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> A support picking Nasus can still be viable, but a \"support\" picking Nasus, taking smite, and staying in the jungle forcing the original jungle out of their position is not viable and can be reported.\n\nDo you have a quote from Riot?\nWhere does it say support can not take smite, or support has to go bot lane, or support can't double jungle?","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-20T18:34:34.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keyword is \"forcing original jungle out of their position\". The point is the intent, not the playstyle. \n\nObviously a support can take smite if they choose to, but the point is the intent of the decision to take smite. This is why describing the scenario is important when filing a report. It gives Riot a better idea if this was _disruptive_ behavior because the player didn't want to queue in as jungle for a longer time, or if it's just an odd play-style. The same goes for intent feeding. Feeding itself isn't punishable nor reportable, but feeding with the intent of purposefully giving your enemy kills, or just wanting to die to tower over and over (running down mid for example) is and is considered disruptive to the game.\n\nIf you queue in as support, yet take smite and clear the jungler's camps before they can, and they specifically told you \"please stay out of my jungle\", does that make you a team player? Not really. Did the player give ample warning they wanted to duo jungle with the jungler? Did they pick out of spite of having their champion banned? Or did they pick because they don't want to support, but they want faster queue times so they take other roles despite being \"support\"? \n\nThat is why there is a text box for players to describe what happened. \n\nThere would be no point to have determined roles to queue into if people could just take whatever they wanted into whatever lane. That's pretty much blind pick, which a lot of players hated when it was the old system when it came to pick order. The new champion select system doesn't prevent you from playing whatever champion you want, but it does expect you to play the role given to you that you queued up for. \n\nObviously this isn't a for sure case since it's harder to prove intent. But it can be reported and possibly punished if the player has a history of stealing roles from other players without **consent.**","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2016-10-20T19:00:35.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please Riot quotes.

The current position meta was discovered by players to be the most effective when soloqing, but that doesn't mean you can't ever play out of it. \n\nHowever, everyone has to be considerate towards others if they don't want to have a duo top or a roaming support. Just like they need to be considerate of how you like to play support or who you support with. \n\nOff meta lanes still work, but I find they work better when the team communicates over coms and they're going into the match with that in mind. Coordinated play is easier to pull that off compared to solo play, hence why for Champion Select it allows you to pick a position so you can somewhat coordinate with strangers who don't know you. \n\nYou can still roam as a support, I do that myself and I also invade sometimes, but remember that your allies won't know your strategy unless you tell them. If they dont agree with it they don't have to partake in it, and vice versa. \n\nUsually most players are fine with changing things up as long as you ask politely. I even played Jhin support after asking my ADC if he was okay with that. He was and we won the game pretty hard, so being polite for off-meta things usually helps. Same for laning and strategy. But if a player is uncomfortable with that they should still have the option of not having to do it. \n\nHence why NCS was created. Less time calling positions and arguing, and more time discussing strategy or possible off-meta choices.","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2016-10-20T22:41:36.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">  You can still roam as a support, I do that myself and I also invade sometimes, but remember that your allies won't know your strategy unless you tell them.

That's a bit ridiculous :P That would mean every Bard player would be banned since Bard has to roam to get chimes lol. \n\nIt really just matters on your intent as I said. If you have to roam as a support (going mid to help your ally, warding jungle, etc) you wont ever get in trouble. What Lyte was talking about are specific cases where an ally purposefully disrupts the game because they didn't get \"XYZ\". Such as lane stealing. \n\nRoaming as a support is not lane stealing in any means. And if you did get reported for roaming it would be thrown out since that is a legitimate strategy and is accepted. If anything, non roaming supports are more annoying, this coming from a jungle main. Having that extra help with lanes is a godsend, so long as the ADC is competent enough to handle being alone for a minute or two lol.\n\nTB was okay.

I work on the team that updated the report boxes. We thought that \"Negative attitude\" was a bit too vague, just like you're saying. So in 5.22, the \"Negative attitude\" category will change to \"Unsportsmanlike conduct\". Ultimately, we tried to position \"Unsportsmanlike\" as a more specific option with a description that refers to negative (if not abusive) chat and verbal or gameplay griefing.\n\n----------------------\n\n> [Slumber Jack (NA)  - 12 months ago](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/91KpPj1j-report-options)\nThe report system will continue to see more updates that will better help cover issues like gameplay toxicity (beyond intentional feeding), and the version you have now will not be the last. As for instalocking/lane stealing specifically, we should be seeing a pretty significant decrease in toxicity due to pre-game shenanigans/disputes with the introduction of the new champion select.\n\n---------------------\n\nBeing polite and giving warning still doesn't mean anything if the other players do not give **consent** to you \"taking\" their lane. That is the whole point of the new champion select screen. Lane stealing was a huge issue before Riot implemented it, and like I kept saying, it is reportable, but does not automatically get you punished. Hence why people should use Unsportsmanlike category when reporting (with proper description to what happened), because it's still a big no no to lane steal, but again, it usually not an automatic punishment, much like intent feeding. \n\nIf you say \"Hey can I have jungle?\" despite being support, and the jungler says \"no\", then you cannot take his jungle position. If you take smite and essentially act like a jungler despite the queued jungler saying \"no\", then you are acting negative and disruptive towards the game. If you say \"Can we duo jungle?\" and the jungler says \"Sure!\" then you can take smite and clear the jungle since you received the jungler's consent to play that. \n\nForcing others out of their lane is not sportsmanlike and is the whole point of the category. They may not be talking, but they are griefing and making the game less enjoyable due to not getting what they want. \n\nWhile Riot wants players to have fun and try new things, you have to be considerate towards other players as well. And yes, there is a meta for positions, which while it changes over time, it still exists for a reason. You can still try new things, but other players may not want to. You cannot force them to, just like they can't force who to play specifically, or take specific summoner spells. \n\nIt's all about being polite and considerate towards others. Which includes lane positions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-10-20T16:13:46.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing against the rules of picking an \"off meta\" champion.

Just reporting \"Unsportsmanelike conduct\" because he went Yi jungle despite being support doesn't tell Riot much. But writing \"X took Yi and smite into the jungle after their champion was banned despite being support\" will tell them a lot more about their behavior and help in future cases against that player.\n\nGames 2 and 3 are unfortunately okay. It sucks being in that position, but they didn't steal someone's role. They played horribly, and didn't build correctly, but being bad and playing off-meta is not legitimately reportable, nor punishable. \n\nAs for your question: You can \"roam\" in the jungle as an ADC if you want to, but remember everyone still has to be polite and professional about this. If your attitude is negative while doing it, or purposefully throwing/disrupting the other players while doing it, then you can get reported, and possibly punished if you continue that behavior. Being bad does not get you punished, but being rude can. If you queued up as an ADC, but harassed the jungler by following him and taking his camps while he's there all game, then that can be disruptive and a poor show of sportsmanship. But if you're an ADC and in the jungle taking farm that's not really punishable. Even if early game.\n\nSure, it might annoy your jungler, but as long as you aren't purposefully disrupting the game then you'll be fine. Same is said for a Nasus support or Garen support.
