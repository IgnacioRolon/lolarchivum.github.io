It starts with 40 stacks and increases infinitely. So it's actually even better than Feral for people who only farm jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoHunter1337","date":"2014-11-08T19:12:25.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > > > good thing they are removing it next season.\n> > > > \n> > > > so we cant have little kids thinging stacking=winning.\n> > > \n> > > No. The passive has been moved to the AS enchantment for jungle items.\n> > > \n> > > So you can still enjoy stacking that flare :3\n> > \n> > it has a limit in the new one. up to 30 stacks i think?\n> > \n> > at least kids will stop stacking it once its over.\n> \n> No, it doesn't.
