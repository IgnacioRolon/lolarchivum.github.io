TBH though your attack range comment is fairly invalid, besides his spell casts, he has one of the lowest ADC auto ranges in the game, at 550. Quinn, Jinx (Minigun), and Xayah are the only ADC's with a shorter range, and jinx can increase hers with fishbones. He's tied with Corki, Draven, Ezreal, Kalista, Miss Fortune, LV1 Tristana, Twitch and Vayne. He's outranged by Varus, Ashe, Caitlyn, LV2+ Tristana, Jinx (fishbone), Kog'Maw (with W active), and Twitch (with ult). The biggest downside with Jhin is he has no real way to force fights. all you gotta do is bait and poke him, force unfavorable fights (right as he reloads or just after Q, bonus points if he does both), and generally force him to fight on your time. He's unique because his windows of power are huge, but his downtime between is the weakest in the game to compensate. its essentially a .5 second window of opportunity every time he makes an action that you can punish, but any other time YOU will be punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-01-01T21:48:16.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind Jhin outside of lane phase.
