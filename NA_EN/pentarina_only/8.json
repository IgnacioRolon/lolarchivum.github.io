I'm not saying that Katarina is OP, but I think it's a little much to say that she is under-powered. \n\nAlso, look back at my original comment. No where did I say that she was an easy faceroll champion.

However, as you replied to Pentarina Only who said that Kata takes skill and you seemed to generally disagree with him I thought you'd also disagree with her not taking skill. But if that's wrong, then we all agree on this matter and can be happy about that.","replies":[{"poster":"Hay5eed","date":"2016-01-03T20:25:10.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile Azir has a 20% winrate and people STILL whine that he is OP","replies":[{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2016-01-03T20:52:29.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see people whining about Azir at all.
