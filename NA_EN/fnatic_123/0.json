Now lets get to the meat of the ever so heart wrenching situation I wouldn't consider myself a toxic person compared to other league player but I do have my moments and I would accept full responsibility if that's why I was \"PERMABANNED\" for saying anything that would put someone down but the fact that League didn't even give me an email telling me as to why my account was banned is really killing me right now I have friends who I play with everyday when I get home from work and today I had to tell them I got Perma Banned, which was really embarrassing and to me I think kind of killed our bond with each other because we cant even play together anymore since all they play is ranked and draft pick :/. Now I understand some of you guys may say just go make a new account and start over. I Spent over $400 on this account and at this point I'm thinking about just quitting in general. All I ask is for my account to be unbanned and an adequate explaination of why my account got banned in the first place without warning ; I have never Broken any league rules. I don't know if I can be banned for something someone else may have done on their account (I do share my computer with 3 of my friends) who all play league also but none of them are toxic and I watch them when they play also so I'm still stooped as to why I got banned Please anyone help. - FNATIC 123 {{champion:63}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T04:01:52.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks you saw this perma without any kind of context at all. From what I can see, this account was punished due to potential hacks or exploits being used in game.

But my buddy told me not to even try to dispute this claim because of league's stance on perm bans even live support didn't think about helping this is just a bad situation if league did a (thorough investigation?) then they'd see that my account was clean on my side of the ip address.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T05:08:46.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was actually able to check your account for compromise as well, just in case you were hacked and this was done by the hacker. I'm not seeing any signs of compromise since all the logins are coming from the same location. You're welcome to have our account recovery team investigate further for any signs of compromise, but without evidence of hackers, this will stay. We're not able to go in-depth about hacks/scripts since the people who make them could simply adjust their code so it doesn't get caught again.","replies":[{"poster":"FNATIC 123","date":"2018-01-19T05:22:05.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok well no that's cool I just wanted a thorough explanation I will try to take it up with the account recovery team then thanks for replies atleast someone cares to help.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-19T03:14:03.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you don't know the reason for your ban, you could [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and request this information. They'll give you as much information as they are able to, though in some cases, they can't give specifics (such as 3rd party program bans). It may also be possible that your account wasn't banned, but possibly locked as a security measure. I can't make any assumptions as I don't know your exact situation. If you believe you were wrongfully banned, you can dispute it with them, and may even have your ban lifted. I would suggest waiting until you know the reason why your account was banned and trying to recover it before making a decision of whether or not you'd like to continue. Good luck with the ticket!","replies":[]}]}
