This is the thread where everyone and anyone experiencing **lag every few games** are welcome to join me in my research and create awareness so we can get a proper reply/sticky post from Riot. Let's start with me shall we?\r\n\r\nThings to note about my journey:\r\n1. I have followed up with Riot support about 3 times. It finally came down to me using WTFast trial. A VPN does seem to fix my lag, but at the cost of increasing my ping by 20 and paying $5-$10 a month for a VPN (That's too much money for me). There are quite a few free VPNs out there, so I highly suggest you do your own research.\r\n2. I have contact my ISP about 5 times. Unfortunately, I can't get past level 1 tech support. Although, I do like the refresh signals they keep sending out to me. Every time I contact them, they say, \"Oh, it seems your signals are configured improperly. Let me fix that for you!\" The same exact _solution_ from them 5 times in a row. Interesting right?\r\n3. Yes, I am aware there are multiple devices connected to my router. Actually, 8 devices in total. All under a 56mbps download and 5mpbs upload speed. **HOWEVER,** I have turned off the wifi-function on my router and made it so I am the **ONLY** device utilizing the Internet. I still managed to pull a win in a normal game with 300ms-1.200ms (lol XinZhao).\r\n\r\nSo, I have decided to take it upon myself to fix the issue. And by myself, I mean **BRING TOGETHER EVERYONE WHO IS SUFFERING :(**\r\n\r\nI play League on a consistent 30ms. Or, at least I _used_ to. Ever since patch 6.6, I've been having very unusual lag issues. Fortunately, I've located the part of the issue.\r\n\r\nFrom the 10 minutes of googling that I've done, if my sources are correct (http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/how-to/read-traceroute)\r\ntldr: \r\n1. Each IP address after the first is a relay node. Usually the first node is your home IP address, then the ISP, then nodes all over NA, then the last 2 nodes are Riot-based nodes.\r\n2. High or fluctuating ping on the first few nodes _after the first_ are the cause of my ISP.\r\n3. High or fluctuating ping on the middle-tier nodes are... unknown (help me here)\r\n4. High or fluctuating ping on the last few nodes are Riot-based nodes, as the last node is the IP address of the LoL servers stationed in Chicago.\r\n\r\n**In conclusion**, based on my tracert report, it seems that both my ISP and Riot are having node issues. **Also, a gaming-based VPN is a current workaround**. What confuses me is that the lag we are all experiencing is _random_. As if, some games don't even use the nodes shown in my traceroute. It's very interesting. ~~And by interesting, I mean painful to watch an Annie slaughter you to death without you being able to react even if you had a Quicksilver Sash because it requires fast reaction times + low ping to make use of it efficiently.~~\r\n\r\nHow to fix? Idk. Let's make noise and hope someone replies.","replies":[{"poster":"Queen Marceline","date":"2016-07-02T11:42:09.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This new patch is giving me huge lag issues in Pennsylvania ðŸ˜•","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hana Song","date":"2016-04-11T22:55:08.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hihihihi!

D:\n\nHey, I'm also playing from Europe, Central Europe to be exact, before the patch, my ping was ~140, now it's 200. I have checked several places (home, dorm; so different providers) and the increase is about the same in both. So I imagine there's some routing issue? A fish ate an undersea cable? Although I asked my Portuguese friend and he doesn't seem to have any issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-11T22:23:02.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo,\n\nThe reason your ping will change if you F4 enough times is mostly like routing changes.\n\nInternet connections usually go like so (if we assume your ISP doesn't contain the entire route to where you're going):\n\nHome\nNeighborhood routing node (usually within a few hundred feet/fourth of a mile)\nPrimary hop onto your ISPs network\nYour ISP network\n3rd Party Contracted ISP (to fill in blanks/coverage)\nNode directly near resource\nResource\n\nIf you can F4 multiple times and find a different routing path, probably means there's network load balancing issues. If a specific node is reaching a general traffic load limit, the system will route incoming data to a new path in order to reduce future load on that specific node to allow it to fall back down to normal traffic levels. \n\nAs for why our nodes near Riot Direct are so high is odd, pretty sure network engineers are on it if there's a problem. I'll ping to make sure it's not flying under our radar. \n\nLastly, VPNs! VPNs change a lot of that route. Basically from your neighborhood routing node to the node directly near resource can be completely different. It's why testing for packet loss or general inability to connect has testing a VPN as a good step. \n\nHopefully this provides a little more light on it!","replies":[{"poster":"TheCoolNoob","date":"2016-04-11T22:35:42.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we did it boys.\n\nwe did it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY","replies":[{"poster":"zarakisempai","date":"2016-04-11T23:51:20.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheCoolNoob,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=dZjP5KuV,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-04-11T22:35:42.427+0000)\n>\n> we did it boys.\n> \n> we did it.\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY\n\n^^ we did! im glad they replied back.
