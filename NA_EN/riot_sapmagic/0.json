Last week, we started rolling out the first batch of Ranked changes to live—Iron and Grandmaster tiers, the removal of Division V, Ranked Armor, and new placements. Most of the features are live and working well, but we’re still working through a handful of issues. Today I want to give you a quick update on those and let you know when you can expect fixes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##**Issue: Some players are experiencing low LP gains and/or high LP losses.**\r\nWhen we added Iron and Grandmaster, we bumped many players up from Division V to IV, which affected LP gains. We also experienced a glitch where some players saw a dramatic increase in LP gains, allowing them to get a couple divisions above where they _should_ be based on their skill. We corrected this, so it’s not happening to anyone else. But since some players now have an inflated rank, they’re seeing larger LP losses and smaller gains than they usually do.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, later today we’re planning to switch Ranked over to newer tech we’ve been using in other queues to prepare for position ranks next year. When we do that, some additional players may experience unexpected changes to their LP gains and losses.\r\n\r\n**Answer:**\r\nWe know this doesn’t feel great, but discovering these issues in Preseason helps us ensure they don’t happen at season start. These issues **_will correct themselves because of the season reset_**, so the current plan is not to make changes. If you’re experiencing a different issue that’s still related to LP, hit us up in the comments.\r\n\r\n**Status:** Resolved, No Changes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##**Issue: Returning Ranked players get a provisional rank of Iron IV after one game.**##\r\nThis is due to a bug with the changes to placements. Returning Ranked players—that is, players who have ever had a rank—should be seeded based on their past rank/MMR.\r\n\r\n**Answer:** \r\nWe’re planning to correct this in 9.1, so returning players who play placements after that will seed based on their MMR. Starting next week, players who completed their placements in 8.24 and ended up miscalibrated (e.g., Bronze rank but playing in Platinum or Diamond games—sorry Rush) can open a ticket with [Riot Games Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) and one of our agents will help make corrections. For players who **don’t**, that’s ok—the issue will correct itself during the season reset.\r\n\r\n**Status:** In Progress (Target 9.1)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##**Issue: Players smurfing on fresh accounts seed in Iron and climb too slowly.**\r\nWe made a change so new accounts seed in Iron to improve the onboarding experience of Ranked. This had an unintended side effect for some smurf accounts where a player’s rank and MMR could desync (e.g., Bronze rank but playing in Gold or Platinum games), making the climb feel very grindy and unfair. Sorry CoreJJ.\r\n\r\n**Answer:** \r\nStarting new accounts with no prior Ranked games in Iron helps avoid new players seeding in Silver and demoting rapidly to Iron or Bronze. The climb for smurfs will a bit more grindy as a result, but at the same time we want to avoid smurfs playing in Gold or Platinum games while still in Bronze. We’ll be accelerating LP gains for these players so their ranks and MMRs stay closer together. After the season starts, we’ll add even more mechanisms—things like the ability to start with some bonus LP after promoting and more aggressive division skipping—to further increase the speed at which these players climb.\r\n\r\n**Status:** In Progress (Target 9.1+)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##**Issue: Players are able to see provisional ranks on third party sites.**\r\nWe’re aware of an issue where players are able to see your provisional rank through third party sites. \r\n\r\n**Answer:**\r\nWe’ll correct this by the time the season starts so that provisional ranks are private and only visible to you.\r\n\r\n**Status:** In Progress (Target 9.2)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##**UI Bugs**\r\nIn a few places, players have reported confusing or broken UI elements:\r\n\r\n- **[Fix for 9.1]** The profile tooltip displaying past rank is incorrect for some players\r\n- **[Fix for 9.1]** The profile tooltip currently says “Past Highest Rank” - we’re planning to change it to “Last Season’s Rank” reflect what it is: your highest ending rank of all queues from the previous season\r\n- **[Not Started]** When clicking a different player on the ladder on the Ranked dashboard the summoner name is not displayed\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in my previous post, if you’re seeing other issues that aren’t captured here or you just have feedback about how things are going so far, let us know in the comments. We know these issues are inconvenient and we’re focused on fixing them as soon as possible. Thanks for all your help and feedback, and we’ll see you on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"EmiIy","date":"2018-12-13T02:11:16.241+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I play placements on a fresh account in pre-season will my placements in season 9 be based off of my pre-season MMR or will I still be placed into Iron by default?","replies":[{"poster":"HawkeyeKid","date":"2018-12-13T02:13:33.475+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EmiIy,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=XqxKvJ4p,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2018-12-13T02:11:16.241+0000)\n>\n> If I play placements on a fresh account in pre-season will my placements in season 9 be based off of my pre-season MMR or will I still be placed into Iron by default?\n\nWould like to know this as well.

First of all, if you're a smurf but you're not doing it to hurt low elo (i.e. you're trying to climb to some target rank as fast as possible), it's much more of a grind than it should be. Look at poor CoreJJ, carrying diamond players as Bronze I. He'll be at it for likely way longer than he should be.\n\nThere are also matchmaking issues, however. For instance, it would still affect duoing, since duo eligibility is determined by rank, not MMR.\n\nImagine a bronze I player with diamond MMR. If he'd like to play with his fellow diamond friend, he... can't. And it'll be a hell of a grind before he can. Yet if he chooses to duo with his actual bronze friend, matches made are at very high risk of being unfair. Who should they play with/against? How do we handle such a large skill discrepancy? If they average the MMR and end up playing in Gold, I think the diamond and bronze duo would typically be at a significant advantage. \n\nThese are niche cases for sure, but I think it's clearly in the best interest for both smurfs and the matchmaking system in general that visible rank more closely matches MMR. And in these cases it could indeed go so far as to impact the in-game experience.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Marcrake","date":"2018-12-13T02:07:14.562+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfs with high winrates reach silver or bronze and joing queues with master players i lterraly played one game all master and one bronze 2 player","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pharrøw","date":"2018-12-13T01:19:12.915+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was Silver 1 when the season ended with MMR good enough to get 21lp on a win and 16 on loss.

I frequently read your twitter posts. It's nice to see someone at Riot trying to keep a close contact with the community. Anyhow, let me tell you my experiences with the ladder changes.\n\nI was Platinum 1 when the changes hit, roughly gaining around 20-21 and losing 18-19 LP before the change. I'd say that means I was right where I belong. After the changes my gains changed to 24-26 and my losses to 14-16. This felt pretty normal. I mean, if those at division 5 got bumped up to 4, that means that those already at 4 before the change now had a higher average MMR compared to those that got bumped up. They should now gain more and shortly reach division 3. Same with div 3, with a bunch of players swarming into division 3, those that were there from the start should now shortly reach 2 and so on. \n\nNow this was probably not the case but it felt like the most logical answer to the increase in my LP gains. \n\nSo I ended up with like a 7 game winning streak and got promoted to diamond (which would've happened either way, with or without the changes to LP) took like a 1-2 day break from ranked and then BAM! +15 LP on my next win. Tried again and boom, +14 LP! Lost my third and poof, -24 gone just like that. Won one more, still +14. Lost the next but got loss prevented so I assumed that this change was due to a server issue. Ranked queue went down after that so I was like okay, it'll probably work properly once the queue is back up. \n\nDid it work when the queue was back up? The answer is of course NO! +13 LP on my next win and now I'm here, wondering what the hell is going on. The more I win, the less I gain. \n\nSo what's my question?\n\nWell, is it safe for me to play ranked now or will I gain like +3 LP and lose -2903454230986087345603857325?","replies":[{"poster":"TopperH","date":"2018-12-13T07:06:48.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamond has always been weird like that.

I was Platinum 3 seasons in a row and I took a 2 year break, and won 3 games and lost 1 and sitting in Iron III 62lp. Don't mind the rank for three more weeks, but I DO mind not being able to duo with my friend on the one week he has off to play and for us to grind MMR up. Also all my games when OP.GG have been against Gold 1 to Plat III players. MMR estimated to be between 1775 and 1900. Not 1100 Iron.","replies":[{"poster":"Baumkuchen LP","date":"2018-12-20T14:59:37.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screenshot of my post: https://gyazo.com/c7e6ff88ade483b377b4b72b7b4056e2\nScreenshot of the answer: https://gyazo.com/a40e93f4a2d58549c9592370c4cdcf1b\nI was bronze 2 at the time i wrote the ticket and they modified my rank to g1, because i send them screenshots of my match history which convinced them. I hope it works out for you too but i think u need to finish ur placements before u send a ticket.\nI hope i could help you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Father Fang","date":"2018-12-20T16:22:36.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long did it take for them to get back with you and to have it changed?

Just finish ur placements and then ask them^^ Personally i never had a bad experience with the support.

So neither can do anything and the issue will not be fixed or touched until the season reset. \n\nI still climbed two divisions with the minimal LP gain, but I feel snuffed as I could have pushed my rank further, had I not missed out on ~60 - 80 LP.
