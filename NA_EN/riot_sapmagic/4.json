This week, we started rolling out the first batch of Ranked changes to live. It can be disruptive whenever we make large changes to the game, but Preseason gives us some downtime to work out major issues before we kick off the season for real in January. Today, I want to give you a quick update on how things are going and what issues we&rsquo;re currently looking into.\n\n&nbsp;\n---\n\n##Master+ Tier Locking\nGrandmaster and Challenger became locked with the patch as intended, but we experienced delays in setting all Master players to 0 LP.\n\nStatus: Fixed\n\n##Issues with LP Gains/Losses\nSome players experienced unexpectedly high or low LP gains and losses after the patch, which could have resulted from the changes we made to tiers and divisions. We made some changes we think will help, but we&rsquo;re watching how things settle, so please keep reporting issues.\n\n**Edit: We are still seeing issues with high LP losses and low LP gains for some players. We are currently investigating.**\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\n##Low Placements for New Players\nSome of these issues may be related to the issues we experienced with LP gains and losses. I also want to clarify the intended behavior for placements since it&rsquo;s changing:\n\n- If your account has never played a game in a particular Ranked queue, your initial rank after one game will be in Iron. You can climb higher throughout placements by winning games.\n- If your account has played Ranked in the past, we&rsquo;ll seed you lower after your initial game so you can settle into your climb and have the chance to prove your skill. This is similar to how the system worked previously, but you only saw your rank after 10 games. Whereas now you&rsquo;re seeing an initial rank after one, meaning it&rsquo;s a bit lower than you might expect.\n\n**Edit: We're still seeing placement issues specifically for players who did not play in Season 2018 but DID play in previous seasons and we're investigating them.**\n\nStatus: In Progress\n\n##UI Bugs\nIn a few places, players have reported confusing or broken UI elements:\n\n- **[Fixed]** Players were not seeing LP gains and losses on the scoreboard\n- **[In Progress]** The profile tooltip displaying past rank is incorrect for some players\n- **[In Progress]** The profile tooltip currently says &ldquo;Past Highest Rank&rdquo; - we&rsquo;re planning to change it to reflect what it is: your highest ending rank of all queues from the previous season\n- **[Not Started]** When clicking a different player on the ladder on the Ranked dashboard the summoner name is not displayed\n\n---\n&nbsp;\nIf you&rsquo;re seeing other issues that aren&rsquo;t captured here or you just have feedback about how things are going so far, feel free to hit us up in the comments below. We&rsquo;ll provide additional updates as we have more information about these (and other) issues in the coming weeks. Thanks for all your help and feedback, and we&rsquo;ll see you on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"AngryLuck","date":"2018-12-07T08:07:43.024+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't queue with my friend anymore, even tho we are 3 divisions apart after dia 5 was removed.

I'm playing League from 3-4 years, in season 6 I did the placement and I was placed B2, since there I never played ranked. But honestly I can say that in these years my knowledge of the game improved a lot, in normals usually the system match me with high silver-Plat. Yesterday, for curiosity, I did one ranked game in Flex and in soloq to see what rank the system will give me and I got Iron IV in both queue(I lost the flex and won the soloq).\n\nThe only thing I can do in Iron IV is just ruin other players experience, because in that rank there will be new players that don't have a lot of knowledge of the game. I don't play rankeds, I don't like the atmosphere that is there, so I will not ruin new players experience, but you should consider this problem.\n\nSorry for my English.","replies":[]},{"poster":"coolguy14","date":"2018-12-13T10:15:43.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started playing this account as a smurf but off role a couple of days before div 5 being taken out, before the update I was gaining around 20-23lp per win and losing around 15 or so but after div 5 was taken out and I was put up to div 4 which I then started gaining 12lp per win and losing 23lp per loss.\n\n This is still happening to me, I've played so many games and win streaked quite often and am only gaining 15-16 lp now and still losing 22ish lp..\n\n Will there be any type of compensation for this in the way of extra lp gain? Or is it really just not worth playing ranked at all? \n\nAlso I know opgg is not completely accurate about showing your account MMR but it says my MMR is around silver 1 when I'm silver 3 now, so it doesn't make sense to me that I'm still gaining next to no lp.

I have been playing league for six years,and my experience with the ranked system has been terrible. I have posted forums as suggested by a riot support person on a ticket I started on this matter,which got deleted. All I want to say and bring up is, there needs to be more time spent in the game rather than someone hitting level 30 and going into ranked,and getting matched with people that have been playing for years. I have been told and showed pictures  when you could see wins, how a person with 300 wins is matched with people with 1500 wins. This points out that one person has spent time IN THE GAME. This should be the focus,not MMR that isn't matched up correctly AT ALL. I've dealt with people saying \"Oh this is my first ranked\". An article posted on Google also stated how there was a and I quote \"We also noticed that we were missing the mark in terms of milestones and goals, especially at Bronze, Silver, and Diamond, where you can improve substantially in terms of MMR without ranking up.\" You guys were definitely missing it. I only bring this up because I care. I also hope to see the punishment become more strict. The link below is the article on the statement made on ranked. I am happy to hear that it was at least noticed.
