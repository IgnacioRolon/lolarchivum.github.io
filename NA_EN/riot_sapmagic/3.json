This week we’re testing the season reset and next week we’ll test that we can revert position ranks without losing your progress if necessary.**\n\nHey everyone, Ed “SapMagic” Altorfer here on behalf of the Ranked team. Today, we’re rolling out **position ranks** to PBE, so I want to give you a rundown on what you can expect leading up to season start. I covered the other Ranked changes on PBE in a previous post, so [feel free to check that out](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/BrJf3dhk-ranked-changes-coming-to-pbe-for-824-91-and-92).\n\n\n#Wait, you’re making changes to Ranked?\nYes! Back in April, we laid out our plan to overhaul Ranked, which includes clear feedback during placements, better matchmaking, more accurate ranks, milestones and meaningful goals regardless of skill, and new rewards for deep and ongoing engagement.\n\nIf you want a quick (or...not so quick) refresher on our previous posts, check out the links below!\n\nPost 1: [High-level goals and overview](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/04/dev-updates-to-ranked-for-2019/)\nPost 2: [Summarizing your initial feedback](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/QTXRJ9fj-what-we-heard-on-ranked-2019)\nPost 3: [Addressing feedback and adjustments to position ranks](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/06/dev-addressing-your-feedback-on-ranked-for-2019/)\nPost 4: [Laying out our plan to do regional previews of position ranks](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/08/dev-position-ranks-in-2019/)\nPost 5: [Talking about new tiers and placements](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/09/dev-diary-new-tiers-placements-in-ranked-2019/)\nPost 6: [Discussing how the top of the ladder is affected](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/09/dev-top-tier-changes-to-ranked-for-2019/)\nPost 7: [Outlining the three-split season and new split rewards](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/10/dev-diary-rewards-and-splits-in-ranked-2019/)\nPost 8: [Answering more questions on rewards](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/10/dev-more-on-2019-ranked-rewards/)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Rzfb8zR.png[]\n#Position Ranks\nPosition ranks is all about giving you a matchmaking rating and rank that matches your skill in each position you play so we can put you into more fair games no matter which one you queue up for.\n\nWith position ranks, there’s no overall rank, so you’ll get LP each game for the position you played. Some of that LP will splash into all your other positions since if you’re climbing in one, some of that skill is transferable.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dODarTs.png[]\n#Placements\nFor position ranks, all the changes we made to placements still apply. That means you’ll play placements for each position you want to rank up and you’ll receive a provisional rank after one game. You’ll need to play eight games total in a position to unlock its rank, with Autofill games counting toward placements for the position you played.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/yPx6oIz.png[]\n#Rewards\nWe’re also testing split rewards on PBE. You’ll earn points toward rewards every time you win a game and you’ll unlock rewards as soon as you have enough points. For Split 1, here are the rewards you can earn:\n\n- **Summoner Icon - 150pts**\nYou earn a split-themed icon designed to be worn alongside your Ranked Armor.\n- **Ranked Armor Upgrade - 250pts**\nYou earn a visual upgrade to your Ranked Armor that dynamically matches your tier and lasts for the rest of the season. \n- **Dynamic Emote - 500pts**\nYou earn a split-themed emote that dynamically matches your tier. We’re still working on making it update when you rank up, so look for that a little later this cycle.\n\n#Position Ranks Switch\nSince we’re planning to [preview position ranks](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/08/dev-position-ranks-in-2019/) in a couple regions at season start, we will be tracking both position ranks and current ranks. That way, if there are any issues, technical or otherwise, we can switch everyone over as soon as possible without you losing any progress.\n\nTo make sure that switch is working as intended, we’ll be testing it next week. That means, at some point your position ranks will be hidden and we’ll display your legacy rank. We’ll make another post before we test that functionality.\n\n#Give us your feedback!\nBecause there are fewer players on PBE and most don’t play regularly, it’s tough to test legitimacy or matchmaking quality. As a result, you probably shouldn’t expect the high stakes climb you’re used to on live.\n\nWe still need your help testing everything going live today though, so please jump in and play some games. Let us know what bugs you find and feel free to share your thoughts on any of the changes, whether it’s about system rules, UI, or art.\n\nThanks in advance for all the help making sure this is a stable and awesome experience, and as always, we’ll see you on the Rift!\n\n**Edit: As of today, we're testing the position ranks switch, so position ranks is currently set to off. It looks like it worked well, but we did discover a few edge cases we want to fix in case we have to use this functionality on live. Thanks for hanging in there and we will re-enable position ranks after we have done some more testing.**","replies":[{"poster":"Brezzerious","date":"2019-01-10T00:41:03.953+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"As a master-diamond player and a player since season 3 I find positions ranks will just bring more problems than the actual ones that they intend to fix .

I went thru all of the posts that were strictly about the positional ranking (including this post on the boards) and what I saw is nothing but pure negativity towards the idea. 1-2 positive comment next to 10s if not 100s of negative ones. Either you need to give glasses to the person who said that we like the idea or you need to fire that person altogether.\n\nI'm sorry, but if this change goes live, a lot of people will most likely quit playing ranked (or League altogether), including me. Riot made a ton of bad stuff over the years to help cover the other bad ideas instead of removing/fixing them. You tried to make role picking reasonable with autofill instead of removing the feature. (which is fine, probably even better this way) The balance folks ruined the smart part of the game by taking away everything related to vision (pinks revealing stealth, green smite, sightstone, etc.) just because esports wasn't good enough. I'm basically the second support as a jungler, I should be getting autofill protection for every single game I play as jungle.\n\nBut this update is different. Ranked with these updates was bad, but still playable. But when this goes live on EUNE, the amount of people who int autofill games (which you don't take care of, since the report system is a pile of trash for anything other than chat) will at least double.\n\nYou asked for the opinion of the community, you got replies from every region indicating that they don't want it (including NA which has a lot less inters compared to EU), so please man up and say that okay guys, this was a bad idea, we're scrapping it.

I want explain why that might not be the entire picture:\n\n- Reddit and boards are communities that tend to bias toward certain qualities (mostly western, etc), so they don't provide a clear picture of our entire player base even though they're large. As a result, we have to look at additional data from surveys to understand how players feel about things we're working on\n- Players are significantly less likely to post about how they like a feature. As a result, oftentimes neutral-to-positive sentiment gets under-represented compared to negative sentiment to a large degree\n- Hopefully we've shown through posts like [/dev: Addressing Your Feedback on Ranked for 2019](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/06/dev-addressing-your-feedback-on-ranked-for-2019/) that we're definitely listening and making changes\n\nAll that aside, we want to test out position ranks because we really think we're onto something. Right now, it's super frustrating to play off-positions because those games feel less winnable. As a result, even if you otherwise _want_ to play multiple positions competitively, you feel like you can't because the games won't be fair and your rank will suffer. When we look at win rates for off-positions and how frequently players play off-positions in Ranked compared to other queues, we can see those are real problems.\n\nPositional matchmaking and position ranks gives us a shot at fixing those and giving players a lot more transparency and insight into how good they are at different positions. We totally agree there's a chance it won't work out as intended, which is why we're testing the ability to revert position ranks in case of any major issue, technical or otherwise. \n\nWe're not afraid to scrap work if we make something that's genuinely bad, but we believe position ranks is a legitimate upgrade to matchmaking and the Ranked experience. We're open to being wrong, but we plan to see how the previews go before concluding it's not feasible.\n\nThanks for your feedback, really appreciate you taking the time to write it up.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2019-01-17T02:06:04.127+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"All that I ask, is do not repeat the dynamic queue year.

You got that part wrong. I wasn't talking about the people who feed because they are legit bad at the role they got filled into.

Say I'm hardstuck plat 4 on both mid and supp. I can't think of a way to avoid this abuse:\n\n- Play poorly on mid so the system thinks I'm bad at mid\n- Queue up for supp and climb until I reach P4.\n- Switch to mid for easier matchups so I can climb higher than my actual skill. \n\n> I talk about the people who see support next to their name and lock in cleanse-ghost nunu because they are autofilled and just want the protection as soon as possible.\n\nI'm sure there are some people like that. However, I would also guess that a lot of these people decide to int *because they see it as a guaranteed loss already*, so they might as well get it over with more quickly. I also remember Riot saying that when you're autofilled in particular, you'll get bigger LP gains (not losses) in your main role, compared to the normal splashing.\n\nSo, I hope that these players will think, \"I'll get a decent amount of LP in my main role if I win, and I'm against worse players this game so I might actually have a chance even though I'm autofilled, so I guess it's worth trying instead of playing disco nunu.\" I guess we'll have to see whether \"less consequences for trolling\" or \"actual possibility of winning\" is a bigger deal.\n\n\n> In my other comment to Sap, I told him that this idea could work out decently if the folks that are responsible for the report system were to do their job and take care of people like these f**kheads.\n\nAmen. For inters, I've taken to reporting them both postgame *and* in a support ticket. It's pretty effective (lots of instant feedback messages).\n \n> As a jungle onetrick, I always try to prioritize someone if I know they are autofilled.\n\nInteresting. When I know someone is autofilled I usually prioritize other lanes, since they're not on comfort so they're unlikely to carry even if they get fed. (Of course I'll also adapt as the game goes, if it turns out they're good at the champ but just don't know how to play the lane, for example).\n\n> You can feed in my games, I don&#x27;t mind. AS LONG AS YOU ARE LEGITIMATELY TRYING! But you can&#x27;t help someone who decided not to care during champ select.\n\nI think this is a pretty common sentiment. For me, weird as it sounds, I actually prefer inters to people who are **both** inconsistent *and* don't communicate (either or is fine).\n\nWhen someone is inting, they're consistent. It just means I'm playing League on hard mode. It's like playing Dark Souls. I'm probably going to get my ass handed to me, but at least I know what to expect, so I can still judge whether I played well.\n\nWhen a teammate is inconsistent *and* doesn't communicate, they're impossible to play around, and that's super frustrating to me (note: You can communicate with gameplay, too. If you press W and run forward on blitz, I know exactly what you're trying to do, even if you didn't ping or type a word).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"angelskies","date":"2019-01-10T12:05:15.835+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Many problems to this system.

But when you're playing ADC, the way you play the game is way different than playing other roles. You're playing like in \"ticks\", you adapt yourself to those ticks which represents your attack speed and your moments of doing damage and your moments of position yourself. No need to talk about kiting and priorize autoattacking over skills, so I'm now much more accurate using autottacks, but less using skills.\n\nWhen I get filled in Mid, I'll be facing an opponent that is used to use skills, to think about the value of those skills more properly than I do, and he's not playing with the \"ticks\" mindset that I'm playing with.\n\nThat's gonna result in a huge disadvantage against them.\n\nOf course we don't know the exact difference between your \"filled\" rank and your \"main\" rank. Let's suppose ie you're Platinum 1 with ADC and Platinum 5 with the filled roles.\n\nI'd find myself having a hard time playing against a Platinum 5 \"main\" midlaner if I'm getting filled.\n\nAnd I'm considering a role that I played a lot, if I get into jungler, a role that I never liked, the difference would be much higher.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot SapMagic","date":"2019-01-17T01:25:35.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of factors that will be different between players depending on their amount of experience in a position, how long they've been playing, etc. We bundle all those things together and look at things in terms of your win rate.

The problem with having a system like this is that many people sometimes want to change their roles or even get autofilled only to do really good and want to play that role a bit more. If people wish to change roles, they have to go through an entire grind all over again in order to get to their regular rank. This type of change will kind of force you into having to play your main role even if at a certain time you do not wish to play that role. For example, long ago back in season 7 when the tank meta was strong (before conqueror) and my main assassins couldn't do much in this said tank meta, I was playing a lot of sejuani jungle despite being a mid main. If this system is implemented, theres not much point in trying to climb with sejuani as my rank won't really be affected and I would have to play a whole lot of sejuani in order to get where I want to be. I'm not high elo, so I don't have decay problems, but thinking about those people who are meta abusers and change roles quite frequently based on meta won't really be able to climb due to decay in the roles they aren't playing while a certain meta is going on. Those players will also have a rough time, and I don't think these changes will really help anyone. Theres also the fact that when you get autofilled, you really don't have any incentive to not troll considering that it won't affect your main rank. So I'm asking to please not add the position ranks, everything else is a great change except for this one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sangy","date":"2019-01-10T14:37:57.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you can now rank in multiple roles can challenger players now get into challenger 5 times with each role or is only their highest rank shown?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot SapMagic","date":"2019-01-17T01:18:43.737+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Position ranks turns off at Master+ and you have a single representation of your position on the ladder.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jheff","date":"2019-01-10T10:09:23.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So about this role swap.
