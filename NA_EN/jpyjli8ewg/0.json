I understand she will be 25% disccount at release  right?\nI see the skin is there now in patch 5.4 and it says UNAVAIBLE.\nWhy isn't she avaible for purchase yet? I waited kind of long and I'm being frustrated that I cant play her.\nDoes anyone know when she will be avaible for purchase?\n\nI will really apreciate any answer from you guys. My RP is siting there for so long waiting for the skin...","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-02-25T14:53:33.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patch notes just say she'll be released in 5.4, not that it will be at the start of 5.4","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-25T18:31:08.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's available now! :]","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoinPop","date":"2015-02-25T13:45:32.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My theory, riot went home for the night and are waiting until they come back to work in the morning to release it in case anything bad happens when they do, either way just wait a while longer","replies":[{"poster":"jPYjLI8Ewg","date":"2015-02-25T13:49:42.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hmmm thats a good theory :D .
