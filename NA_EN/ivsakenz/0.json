But unfortunately, not every position is equally popular, so we have to get people to fill in for those positions to make sure matches happen in a reasonable amount of time. Without autofill, finding matches would not only take longer, but they’d end up involving a broader skill range, as we stretch our search outward to find the 10th player we need. Our goal is to strike the right balance between making you wait for a game and making the fairest games possible, and autofill is a necessary part of that balance.\r\n\r\nWhile we probably can’t ever fully do away with autofill, we are looking to make changes to improve upon the system. We’re currently testing out “autofill parity” in some regions, which means that when we make a match with an autofilled player on one team, the opposing team also has an autofilled player so the matchup feels more fair. As soon as we know these changes are going well (hopefully within a few months), we will roll them out globally. And if it’s not going so well, we’ll roll it back and try again.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce these initial changes are in a good place, we can even try to get both autofilled players facing off in the same position. No promises here though—forcing autofills to be in the same position can make queue times explode if we’re not careful, so we’ll be doing a lot of testing first.\r\n\r\n- RiotIAmWalrus, Game Designer\r\n\r\n\r\nThis answer just goes to show how out of touch these devs are...\r\n\r\nHow is there any difference in including a bigger skill range and autofilling someone jungle who does not know the position?\r\n\r\nZERO..  just because you are highly ranked on your main position means nothing, maybe some laning skills like last hitting and zoning can transfer to other lanes.. but there is nothing about laning that teaches you how to jungle..nothing about it..\r\n\r\nand they have this grand attitude like we should just be glad to get into a game..thankfull they put the almighty autofill system in or we would never be able to play..\r\n\r\nI call BS..I can not think of a single person who ever said, I would rather play a 25-30 minute game and lose horribly because I have an autofill inting then have to wait a few more minutes for a match..\r\n\r\nthis \"GAME DESIGNER\" needs to get a refund on his degree because it obviously does him zero good...","replies":[]}
