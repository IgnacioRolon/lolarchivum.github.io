Suddenly i got disconnected from the server, and i cannot reconnect back. Restarted my internet, everything seems fine and working, but it still won't connect. FInally decided to just quit the game since it won't reconnect.\n\nBut somehow after i exited, i did not get redirected to \"reconnect\" page and got booted straight to the lobby. Checked my game History, and that game doesn't even appear ( and i could even start a new one, play button wasn't grayed out and i tried queuing, it works fine ). Relaunched the client several times, but can't log in since it won't connect to server. Chrome, Explorer, and even other games works just fine. Any suggestions ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T03:35:14.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh sounds like that game you were in had some kind of hiccup and crashed unexpectedly. It's pretty rare when it happens, but when it does, everyone will be booted from the match but unable to try to reconnect. You shouldn't be getting any penalties for having left that match at all and you should be fine to requeue!","replies":[{"poster":"Yuugenshu","date":"2017-07-14T07:30:08.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see, but it seems like i got another problem. I cannot connect to the chat services, and my profile won't load. Picture link is attached below.\n\nAlready checked my firewall, everything is fine, but it still won't load. Do you know any fix for this ? Sorry i'm not that knowledgeable about computer. And also, Thanks for the reply before.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/b4xT7v\n\nEdit :\n\nI can still queue and join a game, but i cannot chat in the queuing room, nor can i chat in the post-game lobby. Tried to login with another account, works just fine. **WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED TO THIS ACCOUNT !?**\nAny help would be very much appreciated, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T22:14:48.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might be your network having some difficulty getting connected to the chat servers specifically (they're actually different servers).
