The first download for the launcher went well, it was around 1.5 gigs. But then, after i got to the current launcher screen and continue the download, the size is over 16 gigs. Like, what ??? In total that's over 17.5 gigabyte ??? Why is it so big ?\n\nIn my previous pc it shows only something around 7 gigs, is something wrong with my laptop or the number is just inaccurate ? because i don't have that much data plan...\n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T01:33:04.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That download might sometimes show a higher total file size than normal, but it's not to worry. It looks larger than normal due to the time that it will need to reorganize and apply patch files. \n\nIf you're worried about a data plan on your internet package, you may have better luck trying to download the game on public wifi or at a friends house if possible.","replies":[]}]}
