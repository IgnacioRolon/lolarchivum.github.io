My net is stable, and my ping to the server is just like usual. I have to wait so much longer just to pass the login screen, and in the few times i managed to pass it the lobby will fail to load 50% of the time ( only the borders, everything like friends list, overview tab, profile is pitch black and unaccessible ). Tried restarting my net, tweaking some settings in my computer but it doesn't work. Any advices ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-09T17:42:55.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, the details you're describing here sounds like a pretty serious connection problem that's degrading.  All of these services need to reach different servers: The authentication to login, matchmaking to use the lobby, and a stable connection to load assets so it's not a black screen.  I highly recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this and tune up your settings.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
