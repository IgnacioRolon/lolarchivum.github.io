Unfortunately this is not the case. The behavioral systems have to make sure that someone is actually trolling before it can actually ban them. How does it find out about specific types of trolling? Through player-made reports. Obviously the system isn't perfect (there's always room for improvement with it) and players can sometimes slip through the cracks from time to time but gameplay trolls do get punished as well. In case you don't believe me [Here are](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken?show=rundown) two examples of gameplay trolls being banned.

Obviously as the game grows so too does its playerbase, but from what I've seen Riots ways of encouraging people to reform has actually gotten better over the years. Not only because the systems they've implemented since they started have gotten better (Tribunal was a good start, the Instant Feedback System improves on that system), but players also have more incentives to reform now than they did before with the implementation of Mystery Gifting and Hextech Crafting.\n\nNow with that being said obviously the IFS could still be improved and yes Riot could still do a better job at helping people understand why they were punished. I just think it's silly to claim that Riot is doing nothing to help curb toxicity when we have proof that they are (i.e. numerous Riot posts on the subject, a dev blog discussing Prisoner's Island, multiple people complaining about their \"unfair\" punishments, etc.).\n\n>even with the resources of a 1.5 billion net worth. you can probably create the most articulate security/toxicity control program with that money. but what&#x27;s riot&#x27;s priority? &quot;TWO THOUSAND MORE REPORTS?

This is untrue-the skins team is different from the player behavior team. Also, Riot is fully aware that there will always be people who only care about making others miserable, but they're also aware that people will have bad games from time to time.\n\n> laughable and utter garbage examples. two examples compared to how many reports coming in? compared to how many trolls/feeders/afkers/flamers ruining our games? no wonder this game is the cancer that it is. what i&#x27;m more interested in is some actual fucking data that riot is actually working to solve this.\n\nYou claimed that Riot doesn't ban griefers. I provided two examples that prove otherwise.\n\n> i&#x27;ve tried mute. i&#x27;ve tried report. i&#x27;ve tried every possible thing and it doesn&#x27;t work, hence the numerous amounts of posts in PB&amp;M that continues to grow. i&#x27;m repeating myself -- and no, multiple reports work. which is why i have a 25-day ban from merely 3 games. done by 3 different premades. which i don&#x27;t really care for anyways, since i started playing SC2. a game that you can actually enjoy and has competent admins that fixes problems.\n\nThere's no such thing as a 25-day ban. There is a 25-game chat restriction yes, but the only bans are for 2-weeks or are permanent. Also I read your ban complaint thread: you constantly called people autistic, claimed that someone had downs and just constantly whined and complained about your teammates using whatever insult you could think of whenever they did something you didn't like. It doesn't take a genius to tell that that kind of behavior is definitely punishment worthy, and whether or not a premade reported you is purely coincidental and nothing more.\n\n> what is this? the fucking SIMS? take care of your problems yourself since the **store** hasn&#x27;t done shit for 5 years.\n\nI said and I quote: \n\n>or alert an employee or a manager if they're the ones who keep bumping into you on purpose.\n\nYes you can ignore it or try to solve the problem yourself, but if you know that they have no intention of stopping with the harassing of you or others then that's when you need to alert the people who are actually paid to handle it rather than make the situation worse yourself.\n\n> what a trash quote that contradicts my predicament and hundreds of other summoners. he can&#x27;t even manage his team, even worse the game so why should i believe anything that comes out of that clown&#x27;s mouth?\n\nYou were punished based on your behavior alone.

It doesn't take a genius to tell that that kind of behavior is definitely punishment worthy, and whether or not a premade reported you is purely coincidental and nothing more. \n\ni think \"whenever they did something you didn't like\" is a fucking understatement. sure i was defending myself. but team was intentionally feeding. team was taking my cs because they didn't get their role. team was flaming me. what they were doing was ruining the game experience of other players. wait, isn't that what riot calls \"unacceptable\"? yet they are still playing the game without consequences. GOOD JOB riot! you punished the person that was calling shit, shit! and the shit that continues to be shit is still playing your shit game!\n\n> Yes you can ignore it or try to solve the problem yourself, but if you know that they have no intention of stopping with the harassing of you or others then that's when you need to alert the people who are actually paid to handle it rather than make the situation worse yourself.\n\nhere we go again, repeating myself. you keep saying the word \"alert\". so should i mail a letter the size of a fucking billboard to riot about this? cause they sure are silent about it. the people that i have reported are still playing, even at this moment.i told you that i've done everything i can. and it's not working. stop giving solutions that don't work.\n\n> You were punished based on your behavior alone.
