And I just wanted to let Riot and the community know that I am very pleased with where he ended up. He's a fun and satisfying champion to play, and his personality and theme are well-designed and well-implemented in his kit. I realize there still may be some work do be done (like making R a good evolution choice, and maybe some power tuning), and I don't know how he'll do in the new jungle, but overall I'm happy to see him in a healthy, fun, and competitive place. Thanks Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"metaworldpeace10","date":"2014-11-03T03:02:41.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha'zix is healthy to play against?

But I'm referring to his last big nerf.  After that, damage wise he's been the same, maybe a little less on the spikes and q, and his viability hasn't changed either.

Kha'zix recieved huge changes in patch 4.9. These changes are what put him in such a good spot.

Was returning from being out of country for 4.9.  Guess I missed it.  I'll admit to missing it and being behind, surely.  Thought his last big hit was in s3, which I guess is when I thought 4.9 happened.  Nonetheless, thanks for that.  I apologize.  \nCheers!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2014-11-03T01:21:52.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Wth.. They didn't buff him.  They nerfed his void spikes some\n\nThey didn't mash him into a gooey paste after zapping him with an electric fly-swatter either.\n\nRiot has a pretty long history of blasting assassins into Evelynn tier when they have a decent showing in competitive play. Like Evelynn, that was nerffed so hard she got garbage tier nammed after her for a few years.\nRengar was nerffed into no-mans land (until his triple Q was discovered and widely used, then he was nerffed again). LeBlanc was nerffed pretty hard despite having one of the worst win-rates when she did get popular, Kassadin was finally nerffed pretty harshly, Diana fell pretty far from where she started, Yasou just took a pretty big nerf, and Talon even took a noticeable nerf despite never actually being a top-rate pick.\n\nKha'Zix, Zed, Fizz, and Lee Sin are about the only assassins that have really evaded that thus far. Fizz actually got a buff to compensate for a Lich Bane nerf.\n\nKinda surprised Fizz hasn't gotten hit that hard, but Zed seems like the poster-child of what Riot wants an assassin to be, and for whatever reason they seem to be committed to tweaking Kha'Zix into a healthy spot with love-tap nerfs rather than overnerffing him.\n\n--------------\n\nKind of didn't expect Kha'Zix to remain relevant up to Worlds, but he maintained being a really solid jungler for the entire season and arguably one of the 3 strongest assassins in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Featherztorm","date":"2014-11-03T03:53:07.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say top 5, Rengar being top 3.  But I see where you guys are going.  But I was more so replying to OP about his statement, but after re-reading it, I misinterpreted it.  I felt he was implying that he got some buff during S4 when he didn't.  Thing about Kha, though, is that due to his nerfs, he's a lot harder to keep viable than Rengar, who took arguably one of the BIGGEST nerfs in a long while.  I, too, am surprised to have even seen him in worlds, but there's a reason he wasn't picked in any of the finals matches.  Again, all understood now. Thx.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hOrnn","date":"2014-11-03T18:04:59.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nerf khazix","replies":[]}]}
