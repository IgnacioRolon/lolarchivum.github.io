I can't launch League anymore after I updated my OS to Windows 10. I can launch the Patcher but when I click Play it disappears like it's going to launch the client but nothing happens. I've literally tried everything that has been said in the support sections to no avail. I've reinstalled it multiple times, repaired it multiple times, ran it in compatibility mode for every windows OS that I can, ran as administrator, reconfigured my DNS settings, etc. It did this before after I initially updated to Windows 10 but I got it to work when I ran in compatibility mode, but now I can't. Can anyone help me? I can post logs if need be.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-18T18:01:41.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo,\n\nYou tried manually deleting the entire directory where League existed before you went to Windows 10? You may also want to check to make sure you've got the proper permissions as admin to run it, and also verify that when you uninstalled it, you removed all previous possibly registry entries with a program like CCleaner or something similar.","replies":[]}]}
