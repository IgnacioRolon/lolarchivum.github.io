Ivy is 17 and she&#039;s had some sort of thyroid issue lately that has been causing her to lose weight, which is really bad because she&#039;s always been really scrawny to begin with.  Apparently she&#039;s all skin and bones at this point and it doesn&#039;t look like she&#039;s ever going to get any better.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had plenty of cats come and go over the years and it&#039;s always depressing as fuck when they die.  I was in high school when we got Ivy, I pretty much raised this cat.","replies":[]}
