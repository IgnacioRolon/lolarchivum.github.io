I&#039;m way more forgiving when a Xayah fucks up, and my own mistakes seem to be forgiven as well.  Maybe it&#039;s just because I see Xayah as a character rather than another player, and it&#039;s harder to get mad at a character.  Or maybe the interactions just make playing alongside a Xayah more enjoyable.  Either way, it&#039;s doing something positive.\r\n\r\nI know Riot is starting to roll out VO reworks, and I&#039;m wondering if adding more robust interactions similar to these two would help foster better teamwork.  it certainly seems to be working here.","replies":[]}
