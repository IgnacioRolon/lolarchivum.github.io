I don't feel like you should** virtually ever** have to build defensively when you won laning phase heavily, and still get nearly/fully 100%'d. That is just poor balancing. Just something needs to happen about his E IMO, thats where a lot of his problem lies. Tons of mobility, invulnerability/AoE damage, in combination to his short dash... its AP fiora if you will.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-13T00:15:22.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban him, then.
