The answer to this is sure: \"but dude, this will leave too many gaps, like how do we account for boosters? how do we balance quick climbing, or \"going down\" . Here comes my next point\n\n- **lane mastery matchmaking** : You already have this system in place, it's right there in the game where few know how to find it. You give a score and account for a number of parameters for lane prowess. So you compute a 0-1 scale mastery that is ever-changing and visible. This will have 2 outcomes: people will try to improve their actual game, not just chasing kills and ofc in matchmaking. \n\nHow will people then not abuse this by having one max lane mastery and 0 in others and they will matchmake? If the difference is too big and he is not autofilled, the game accounts the lane mastery+(abuse rating 0.5-0.8 scale)*diff(max lane mastery- lane mastery) .\n\nWhat about the player pool? +2 and -2 div will mean a player pool of 5 divisions. Master + Challenger should be locked together + if it passes a certain time to account lower division (like: 5 minutes passed, consider D1, 10 minuts passed consider D2, etc)  \n\n- **angel system**: when the game detects a player is performing poorly, then to engage with that player with a pop-up to give him hints on how to improve and to serve as a sort of a 'tilt barrier' and some videos he can watch on topics he needs to improve","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-08-20T07:51:35.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much better would a +2 player be vs  a 0.

You want to change the distribution Model so I want to know what are you using for that.\nHow much better does your system expect a -2 vs -1. -2 vs 0? Etc.

How can it be used for MM?  \n\nSubjective judgment is looking some one and going they did X Y and Z very well, that's 8/10 points! So that would be observing for context of each game by holding up a standard of how closely did some play to the correct move all game.\n The problem doing this is if you don't have the ability to watch and grade with the context of individual games subjective rating wont work well because 1500 damage on an adc in game could be a game winning result due to short game time compared to 2500 in game B which would be low due to say game time.\n\nNow you can try grading on a curve. Take average stats and individual stats to check for positive or negative gap.  But average stats in league are gonna to skew and population and popularity will constantly be shifting your expectations.  You also have a very real issue, not all champions need the same metrics. So you cant run it by just Role averages, how does some one with 0 CC or 0 healing generate those values?   I hope its self evident why you'd have to account for champions individually.\n\nSo if we get to the idea that winning = skill and who your playing = how hard it should be to win or lose?  Thats Elo.  Its not subjective. It does not care about gameplay, just the results of a game. Did you win or lose. Who are you playing.\nBut you don't want to use that and you think it will not work? \"Remove Elo/MMR.\" So my attitude is if that's what your asking for.... remove Elo/MMR then replace it with an Elo/MMR.

But the current one is definitely not working. It hasn't worked for years, but when solo carry was more impactful and the games where less snowballing skill alone could save games which made teams less relevant than today. Now, people can see the flaws of the MMR system, especially in lower than diamond leagues, where the \"population\" is huge compared to the end of the \"league\" \n\nNow you question is how does the system generate the values, the system already gets those values \nhttps://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/2018/august/stats/Stats_Combat_EN.jpg\n\nAre those parameters absolute and clear? No, definitely. But they are the best you can get without AI. A further study from big data Riot gathers can reveal other parameters in the future.\n\nSo why rely on them then? Because they are the league average, let's call them Skill Performance Indicators (SPI).\n\nWhat is the +2 and -2 div ... it's the player pool. Why this pool: \n- SPI don't work on the whole pool as a player in Bronze might have it easier to hit better SPI\n- Because if the MMR doesn't exists anymore then you need a player grading system, and that remains solely the league structure.  \n- A 1 division pool is small and can lead to big que times. Same with +1 and -1 division. +2 and -2 is indeed a little stretch but I think Riot can play with these numbers. \n\nWhy keep the SPI in the first place? Because while the division is an average skill indicator the game is structured in 5 different roles with at least 2-3 playstyles for each role. So you need a deeper grading for better matchmaking.\n\nAlso,** very important**, the SPI must be based on pool average otherwise you can have skewed results favoring underperforming and disfavoring overperforming, something you don't really want. You want good players to climb, and bad players to demote. You also need a way to track him swapping to abuse the system, I called this abuse rating. You simply track how often he swapped with his lower positions and how big is the difference. \n\nSPI should be calculated based on Challenger best median values over 20-50 games \n\n\nHow will the system works abstractly: \n\nLet's take John, he is S1.\nFirst the pool is created: S3 S2 S1 G4 G3\nFrom this pool, the games compute the average pool SPI for John's selected positions. \nThe SPI scale is 0-1.\nLet's say John has a jungle SPI of 0.2 and an ADC SPI of 0.3. The pool average SPI is 0.4 and 0.5 for these positions. John occasionally has and abuse rating of 5% of his matches, so his abuse score is 0.05. His highest rating is the top with 0.4 SPI. \nBecause  John has an abuse score of 0.05 this means 0.05 * 2 (&lt;- a constant that Riot should use to adjust the abuse prowess) = 0.1 (the score is capped at 1)  of the difference between the highest is added to other SPI. So his new SPI are Jungle: 0.2+0.1*(0.4-0.2) = 0.22 and ADC: 0.3+0.1*(0.4-0.3)  = 0.31\n\nNow let's return to the system. A quick recap: Jungle SPI: 0.22 , ADC SPI: 0.31 and Average Jungle SPI: 0.4 and Average ADC SPI: 0.5 \n\nThe game now creates a team. He looks for other people with John SPI for Jungle since is his primary role. But because of John's SPI being bellow the average for league, the game will look to matchmake him with someone who has a better SPI than John by a factor of a difference. The constant should be adjusted by Riot after field test. How will that work:\n\nJohn Jng SPI: 0.22   -   person to matchmake John should be at least 0.22+ 0.4 _ (&lt;- average jng SPI) _ - 0.22 * Skill Gap Constant (let's take it 0.25) =0.22+ 0.18*0.25 = 0.22+ 0.045,  so the game will search around  0.265 with a small variation (let's say +-0.005 or +-0.01, i dunno, these should be tested in field)\n\nThe game has a hard time to find a jng in those values, tries on ADC. Computes the ADC SPI and finds one. \n\n\nVoila, you'll have the whole team nearly balanced. \n\nFor further balance, they can factor the fact someone is below or above the median SPI and try to balance the number so that each team has the same bellow and above players \n\n\n\nHope this clears the air. Imho this will be a way better system. Not saying there aren't other better ideas out there, but Riot should make their mind and implement one already","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-08-21T23:19:51.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aight.

An improperly-designed skill rating system could encourage players to impede their teammates. As another example, consider a system that increased skill rating according to the number of times a player healed themselves. This creates an incentive for a player to repeatedly injure themselves so that they could be healed. In general, the more control that a player has over a quantity, the less useful it is for skill rating.\n\nA lot of folks are going say Nah dismiss TS 2 because it was generated using FPS games.

Matchmaker takes into account your account stats, not champion stats. This can cause huge discrepancies. \n\nSo the goal would be two fold.\n1. Tighten up MM.\n2. Taker into account champions.\n\nNumber 1 will be a product of 2. So you can't know what a player will pick. But if you instead apply the same logic matchmaking uses to match players AFTER the picks and bans you can generate an MMR modifier. Essentially it'd use account stats to match, and champion stats across both teams to rate the final impact on your MMR. \n\nWhat this will do is tighten up the swing in either direction from mismatches resulting in slightly better MM. But it will also be less punishing on players who justly feel the match is hard to reach in regards to winning, and also more rewarding if they do. \n\nThe result in better mm would likely be small, but the loss or gains to MMR might make people feel their MMR is more in their hands despite massive imbalances that are indeed out of Riots control as you don't know what champion players will play.\n\nSorry for any typos, am on phone.\n\nP.S. Thanks for participating in the forum, it's much appreciated. A lot of us have a lot of thoughts that we feel are never heard. Even if it's not your job, we appreciate the dialogue. I've worked in gaming a long time and a little communication goes a long way.","replies":[]}]}]}
