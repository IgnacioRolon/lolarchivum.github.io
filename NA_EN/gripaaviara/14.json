I try to keep calm but the unbalanced silver matchmaking got to me. \nOr situations like unranked lvl 30 player that barely plays something vs a G4? \n\nI already got chat banned but I can&#039;t stop the rage and toxicity and fear I might get banned soon. \n\nI simply feel I&#039;m the laughing stock of the matchmaking and this joke turned sour","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-06-10T00:31:24.626+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing this game for 10 years.\nI've dealt with everything from players wishing cancer on me and all my families, to where they simply wish me dead because I didn't pick a tank, or told me to take my own life because I didn't pick ignite to even where they wanted my address so they can murder in my sleep.\n\nI've dealt with players intentionally fed because I said \"Gj, you got em\" and they took it completely wrong and muted me before I could explain to them what I meant by it. I had players who intentionally fed because their support had Targon and told them not to take the CS because they wanted to their CS score to be top notch. I had 9 players making insulting me due to my art hobby and harassed me nonstop on personal pages I had to delete, telling me how terrible it is and that I shouldn't proceed to do it anymore. \n\nI've dealt with a lot in this game. But I've always found the mute function work in my favor.\nI've learned not to share anything personal about myself, and I've been stuck in a tier I can't get out of. Not that it's my team faults.\nIt's just I've come to terms that it's where I belong. But I can't complain, I still get rewards if I work for it. \n\nJust use the mute function. Truly, it does help.\nI simply learned just to try and enjoy the game itself and do my best. Because reaching a certain tier doesn't mean anything really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-10T00:34:50.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have self control and realize it's only a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-06-10T00:44:10.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"crappy players can be on your team, they can be on the enemy team. Match making is pretty fair in those regards. \n\nWhat you are experiencing is the feeling of negativity which lingers in your brain more often. If you took notes of how your matches went, who were good and who were bad, you'd probably see that the enemy has 20% more bads than your team. But because of how negativity lingers, you think that you get more plebs in your team all the time.","replies":[]}]}
