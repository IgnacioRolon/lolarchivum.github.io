Or that jhin does one shot lol\n\nYou implied.\n\nAlso, given how rageblade and how Jhin in general works, Jhin doesn't only 1 shot people after full stack (I mean he trades sustained DPS (let's not talk about bursts per seconds just yet) for 1 shot after all), it just makes him 1 shot better. And it's not like AA'ing 6 times before running into fights is some big price to begin with, it's basically not that much different than Dark Harvest.","replies":[{"poster":"SooFr0sty","date":"2018-04-11T14:18:49.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how I implied that but that's besides the point.\n\nDark harvest has a 300s timer once you hit enough stacks which is the same time this jhin build is up and running.\n\nThe issue with rage blade is that stacks last for 5 secs and his reload is 2.5 which means he has to find a target to hit in 2.5 seconds.\n\nThis is not ideal depending on who he wants to hit. \n\nAlso the whole he can stack off minions. Depending on if he uses his q or stattik shiv to clear the wave, yes I know the damage was nerfed, he may not be able to stack on a wave. And that doesn't even include any teammates wanting the wave. \n\nI'm just saying it takes a lot of pieces coming in to place to happen and is not as broken as it sounds.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2018-04-11T08:54:49.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it doesn't, because he can stack on mere creeps","replies":[{"poster":"SooFr0sty","date":"2018-04-11T09:05:38.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not like blood thirster shield, it's hard to keep stacked, especially on jhin.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JustaNewb","date":"2018-04-11T00:17:07.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guinsoo would be ashamed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2018-04-10T20:54:42.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes","replies":[{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2018-04-11T00:14:35.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-10T20:57:54.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hail Rageblade.","replies":[{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2018-04-10T21:38:05.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, wth, how they hotfixed irealia, yet there is a champion that instakills most of the team in 1 shot from high range with autoattacks","replies":[]}]}]}
