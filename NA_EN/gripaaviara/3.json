But extend this to higher losing streaks and not followed by win steaks .... Voila. You get huge differences. Like now, I'm after a losing streak and get 16-17 / win if I win 2 lose 1\n\nThis right here is the proof the system is skewed to throw you down unless you are very good in a division to get constant win streak (basically a smurf)\n\nA good ELO system has the same points over the n number of games no matter the way the win/loss are mapped\n\nIt amazes me how people are content with this.

It is a corrective system to mitigate the impact of slightly varying skill levels in matchmaking and get people to where they belong faster.","replies":[]}]}
