Ok that would be fine except they are all more mobile/have better escape mechanics and they are allowed to get {{item:3142}} . They are all way better picks\n\nOn top of that (except Quinn), they all have bigger HP and more resistance than Nidalee. You can say, well she has heal, well that heal is trash since it basically forces you to change to normal form and it takes roughly 1.5 sec to do all that with cast, that&#039;s kinda lame.\n\nWhy are AD assasins and some assasins allowed to have so much damage without hitting the skillshots involved\n\nI&#039;m not saying buff Nidalee, but other assasins need to be tonned down","replies":[{"poster":"KoreanEzMode","date":"2018-07-30T13:55:41.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"zed must hit all his skill shots in order to do even do significant damage with his R...Plus this hitbox of his Q's are so small that he must be accurate with them or else he just wasted his R..Nidalee has Massive burst damage, Landing Q is decent damage, but it's mainly  used for its mechanic of allowing her to Pounce from a larger distance, her real damage combo is her cat form W+Q+E...each assassin is different and their kits are unique to themselves...Nidalee can snipe people with her Q then Move in for the kill with her R+W and do massive burst. Nidalee can build {{item:3146}} {{item:3116}}..she has plenty of tanky dmg options and still make her bursty...just play her more","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-30T16:19:59.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how can you miss 3 q's after you use his ult lol. then his E and ignite you are basically dead no matter what.","replies":[{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2018-07-30T20:19:07.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, Zed ulti+auto+e (hard to miss) = dead with just {{item:3147}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
