Proceed to melt him and gtfo before his team can do anything.\n\nTip #4: \n\nPLAY ANY ASSASIN\n\nWait for Veigar to use cage.

I can 1-shot-him with Zyra. I am dead after that, but he is too. Had 3 weeks ago a normal with a diamond Veigar in vs team wich was quite \"unfair\" in terms of matchmaking. WeÂ´d  won anyway because I focussed him in 3 important teamfights. Flash, combo, dead [both of us because I could press my combo fast enough before his R reached me]. Then there was a 4 vs 4 after in wich my team could win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2018-03-19T21:33:38.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is elo relevant when it comes to counterplay?","replies":[{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2018-03-19T21:34:20.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple.
