This was the patch they altered his kit, and not in a healthy way.\n\nFirst, they gave his w a persistant slow area, which gives him _**zoning**_ (why? he didn't need it) and a much easier time in laning (giving him semi-waveclear that he never had before). They did this because they thought nerfing his stealth to camouflage would need compensation but...\n\nHIs stealth is in many ways is better. They decreased the activation time at all points, increased the duration by a ton, and gave him movement speed towards champions. That's a lot, when his stealth functions almost the same. (The only difference now is a detection radius, that, as an ADC, almost never is a problem. Only in clutch situations was old stealth a savior, and you still had to wait 4.5 seconds of being clobbered to get into it, not to mention pink wards as a counter).\n\nAll in all, they compensated twitch too heavily for what they thought making his stealth camouflage would need. HIs laning phase no longer is as miserable with his w changes, and his stealth duration and ease of entry means he's a lot harder to both keep track of and also lock down. \n\nI wish we could revert him to pre 6.22, but that would be hard as stealth mechanics are different now. Idk, but I will say as a main that he has it a little bit too easy. It's just I think we're all stumped on what to nerf.\n\n(Although I wouldn't say he has \"such a strong early game.\" Like he's not as miserable as before, but that statement is just wrong)","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-10-17T14:30:08.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally wish they played up his Assassin nature with the stealth elements and pushed those elements further but at the cost of his inherent team fighting power via his ultimate.\n\nI think as a marksman, we already have enough team fighting gods like Xayah for example.

It's perfectly acceptable for a Twitch to dominate as much as he is now because he's a solo q predator who scales incredibly well with massive long ranged AOE damage... However Shaco, another solo q nightmare who lacks both range and AOE gets beaten with the nerf stick the second he looks out of line?\n\nI mean come on, both of their play patterns are toxic to an extent but while Shaco had to get reworked, then nerfed, then nerfed AGAIN because he was bursting people from stealth too consistently, Twitch gets to skirt by consequence free while doing much the same but from farther away and to multiple people at once?

They mostly have kits that make them auto harder, auto more, auto safer, etc. The issue in my opinion is that because their main role involves auto attacks it's hard to put them in a good place without making them suck at their job, so it would help to give ADC's more things to do in their kits without overloading them.\n\nAshe is a good example with her utility keeping her relevant even if her damage is lacking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2017-10-16T13:38:15.274+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":9,"body":"Upvote farming simulator 2017: ADC edition","replies":[{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-10-16T16:58:31.436+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":7,"body":"Yeah because complaints about Twitch being overpowered for over a year CANNOT be genuine complaints anymore, it must be an \"upvote farming simulator\".\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2017-10-16T18:54:37.556+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"Not saying that twitch isn’t OP but complaining with any constructive reasoning is not the same as “nErF tWitcH1!1”\n\nAnd I’m more like this\n\nhttps://media3.giphy.com/media/l0MYCY14qJvUXO4eI/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-10-16T20:59:34.231+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> complaining with any constructive reasoning is not the same as “nErF tWitcH1!1”\n\nJust like complaining without giving any constructive reasoning is not the same as wanting upvotes. Some people don't want to be famous on the boards, they genuinely want Twitch to get nerfed. If you watch GripaAviara's profile you'll see he's not 24/7 on the boards commenting and jumping on bandwagons so commenting \"Upvote farming simulator 2017: ADC edition\" is completely bullshit.

Twitch could certainly be healthy as an assassin if he couldn't be a tank shredding hypercarry as well because of critical strike. Have him build stuff like BORK Lethality etc that actually falls off late game, instead of having ADCs have a guaranteed late game just because crit is a thing. I say this as an ADC player,if you just hard removed crit from the game even if you made the class unplayable even in bot because then at least we could create a healthy balance state from there.\n\nIf you remove crit and delete Ardent Censer (even with just aspd and onhit the item is cancerous on Rageblade Kog and Varus who don't need to build crit at all) then you have a healthy starting point to fix the ADC class once and for all (personally what needs to happen with ADC is in exchange for a massive loss of sustained damage, they to be less reliant on peel and teamplay except for a few outliers)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-10-18T01:59:33.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe instead of a time on his ult, maybe make it autoattacks? this way he can be an assassin but can't provide dps such as xayah","replies":[]},{"poster":"brokensafe","date":"2017-10-17T07:27:23.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty interesting yet true","replies":[]},{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2017-10-16T22:40:57.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention his passive is hidden OP, considering he often deals more true damage than a Vayne if he gets any remote gold lead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-10-16T20:55:39.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"The best way I think to nerf twitch would be to give him an extra 10AD and decrease his steal radius a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WDG Devour","date":"2017-10-16T22:21:02.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Twitch is perfectly fine.
