Fights should last at least double as they last now. This is the most fun part of the game and it&#039;s all so flashy and instant it&#039;s unsatisfying in most cases, win or lose. Now you either burst or get bursted. The best fights are at low levels, where people actually last more than 2-3 sec.\r\n\r\nThey need to think about this: remove a part of the mobility (flash for ex), increase endurance for all players and make fights last longer. This will make games better in all ELOs:\r\n\r\n- low ELO: it won&#039;t be as punishing to get a little out of position, it will decrease feeding and fix a part of the snowballing issue\r\n- high ELO: it will emphasize strategy more and skill expression by being able to manage resources better and it will be more obvious than a quick reflex, making players utilize the skills more than just 1 one-shot skill combo\r\n- competitive: fights are the best part. Nobody wants to see farming. And fights are scarce in competitive. Making them last so a few seconds is often anti-climatic \r\n\r\nAnother benefit would be tunning ADCs to finally be DPS, not crit burst that are now and make kitting way more important. Also, Assasins can be tunned for having higher than average damage, but not be the one-shots that are now punishing low hp and clearing the battlefield","replies":[{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2018-09-09T01:02:53.037+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know right , one shots are so annoying","replies":[{"poster":"HollowMimic","date":"2018-09-09T08:31:20.467+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"One shots from shadows are even more annoying","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smashed Hash","date":"2018-09-08T18:36:17.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like the changes to the Jungle makes the Jungliers feel rushed having to clear camps, instead of getting in-lane early-mid action and really strut their champ.","replies":[{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2018-09-08T20:01:21.297+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"But previous jungle interaction was far too oppressive with jungle lane pressure available far too early prevnting the lanes themselves any opportunity for personal skill expression and this is coming from a jungle main.","replies":[{"poster":"Smashed Hash","date":"2018-09-08T21:09:39.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2018-09-08T19:08:11.220+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"Nerf all damage by 15% then go from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaBooosh","date":"2018-09-08T19:44:16.531+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":20,"body":"Disagree.\nThat will make mages much less impactful in team fights and ADCs the main(if not only) win condition.\nBack in the old times.

AD carries aren&#x27;t really that impactful early on.

Right now I feel like ADC and mage are in somewhat of the same boat, two sides of the same coin. The difference I see generally is that mages tend to have longer range or be more ability-based, and tend to not have a lot of escape, but rather CC to lock down/get away. ADCs are usually more focused on auto attacking, have decent range still, but not every ADC has mobility. Some do, but some are just pure damage dispensers.\n\nOverall I think mages and ADCs are just damage, just of different types, and both can suffer from the same problem that the high damage brings. If either one gets CCed once later on, it's an opportunity for practically anybody else with decent damage to come in and just finish the job, and when I play squishy carries, it's not rare for me to feel like there wasn't a lot of outplay available. I hate the feeling of just being bodied 2v1 and not having any way to really defend myself, which is why I usually gravitate toward tankier champions (like top lane champs) personally. Those are the champions I feel like it's most common to be able to turn around a 2v1 with, and actually have a say in those fights. I don't think it should just be that the carries are the only ones able to do damage or anything and just go back to the times where you just babysit your damage and win, but I think it's a serious problem when you're finding yourself in situations where people just coordinate an attack on you and there's no way to realistically fight back. Whether the solution be to make CC cooldowns longer so picks are more valuable/uncommon, damage overall being lowered, or whatever, something needs to happen where it doesn't feel like one class or another is just useless against any enemies with a brain that can gang bang them.\n\nI won't say that problems don't exist from having the damage lowered, I haven't thought super in-depth of the topic yet, but I can say from personal experience from playing league for years, that it definitely feels better to me playing most of the other non-squishies simply because of the fact that I don't get blown up. I can handle being destroyed because I made a mistake, but when it feels like I couldn't have done many other things to prevent it, that's where the game just feels like it's not fun anymore to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dingding123","date":"2018-09-09T01:04:46.341+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually...\n\nThey were only played around because they were cheap to maintain, alongside supports.  They could miss out on xp and still be effective, and were good at sieging.\n\nThe better team realized that everyone that isn't the marksman should instigate or peel, **not because their marksman was amazing but because they were otherwise irrelevant in the fight**.  Marksmen not named Vayne didn't have the lategame fantasy they do now; in fact most marksmen bought a straight-up tank item as a 5th or 6th item and often included a Bloodthirster in their builds as well.  They consistently opted to not be squishy lategame over being nothing but a glass cannon, because the game's damage scaling wasn't nearly as ridiculous as it now is with Runes Reforged..._just look at all the % bonus damage and free damage everywhere..._\n\nOf course, this was all way back in seasons 1-3.

Even then people still tend to take flash on such champions. This even if you don't think you need flash to win a lane you want it just to cancel out the other players flash. Hell ults are considered worth it even if they didn't hit so long as the flash was forced out. Name another summoner that's considered an positive trade to getting flash out? heal maybe? Difference is heal wont nullify a gank with near the same effectiveness as a flash. The only summoner spell that isn't defeated by flash when you consider they can use it as an easy out under unfavorable circumstances is ignite. Also just imagine if there was a set of items in the game that gave flash as an active. Tell me this wouldn't be insanely meta to anything that can use its base stats.\n\nHow about playing champions without flash/built in flashes for a week then say it isn't OP. Lose lane after lane, fail time after time all because you don't have flash. The only reason it doesn't seem OP is because everyone can and does use it. Its OP, but its a fair use kind of OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Neptunia xoxo","date":"2018-09-11T07:07:31.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Boatwhistle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yA5XNihb,comment-id=00130000,timestamp=2018-09-10T22:51:53.746+0000)\n>\n> Well technically it is broken.\n> It is so valuable only a few champions can afford to not take flash and its only because they have abilities that have the same effect as flash.
