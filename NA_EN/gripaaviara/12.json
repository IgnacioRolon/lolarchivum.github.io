Holy cow how does a hypermobile champion like him get to have so much damage at so low CD and so much sustain when you add his 2x escape spells and a zhonya","replies":[{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2018-03-30T12:49:02.961+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO, part of the problem with Fizz is that his kit just doesn't have all that much counterplay in lane. If his numbers are high enough for him to 1-hit someone, he can repeatedly do it basically every time his ultimate is off cooldown, even if the target is under tower. But if he can't 1-hit people, he can't really do his job.\n\nI feel like there should be something I can do to respond to Fizz once I've been hit by his ult. Right now, I'm literally just sitting there waiting to die, since the entire rest of his kit is basically undodgeable, and can 1-hit almost anyone other mid in the game. \n\nRiot could give the E more visual clarity, and lower the speed or hitbox or something, so that players have a real shot of avoiding it (without flash).\n\nOr Riot could lower the hitbox or projectile speed on the ult itself, because it really is very easy to land at the moment. If the ability is going to continue being this much of a death sentence, Riot should probably give dashless champions a fair shot at dodging it.\n\nI mean, as much as players hate Zed, Death Mark is a good analogy. It's a very scary ability, and Zed can absolutely snowball in lane. But it does feel like you at least are still playing the game when you see the X come down on you. You're not just seeing there waiting for the end. You can still outplay Zed through his ult.
