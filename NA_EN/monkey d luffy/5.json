That's why some bugs (like the Dark Star Thresh and Challenger Nid FOW lag bugs) weren't detectable on Pbe but went live.\n\nPbe is also a smaller overall sample, so problems with specific computers and such are less likely to get picked up and fixed.

I mean it's gonna ship Live anyway in a matter of couple patches and someone will have issues regardless. It's just impractical to have it done so late instead of just optimize it beforehand on some people.\n\nBut then again, the New Client in itself is a clusterfuck with propably no hope of reaching the level of optimization the Legacy Client Update had since their definition of \"optimization\" is removing things that make the application enjoyable to use and then splitting it into \"Normal\" and \"Low-Spec Mode\" with the latter looking like the Alpha Client with it's lacking polish.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-05-09T17:02:50.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if it auto sends thorough reports; for useful reports people might need to use the HRT and send them in a ticket.\nWhen I've found issues/bugs that's what I've had to do since Alpha.\n\nYeah, for sure.  There were a few hiccups for me during Alpha and many people went back to the old client because it was more familiar.  What did make it easier for the testers that stayed was that they added \"submit a bug\" and \"client feedback\" buttons to the bottom of the client though.  I used those a ton; much better than a boards thread.\nI guess people just don't like change, we probably both know that :P\n\nIdk, after using the new client for so long I went back to the old one for a last time to mod my item sets before the  retirement and it didn't really seem more responsive or anything.  The click sound for buttons also seemed hella annoying after not hearing it for so long.  I have a relatively new comp and I use low-spec mode.  \"Normal\" has some process in there that makes my fan go crazy; I actually have no idea what it is.

Specifically there is something they did between the Alpha and Beta which runs some process which makes my fan run.\nDuring Alpha I ran \"normal mode\" all the time with all animations no problem.\nI haven't found out what it is specifically.

Heck, anybody working in science will tell you the same thing. In all cases you make one controlled release at a time to ensure that any changes or complications can be monitored and repaired before moving on to the next. \n\nIf you make 6 changes at once and something destabilizes (which 90% of the time some thing _will_ destabilize), you have to pull the entire stack out and add them back in one at a time to see what caused the problem anyway. That just amounts to time (and money) wasted. It's much healthier to implement one at a time and do each one right than it is to lump everything in at once and pray that it works out. In most development fields, lumping everything in is considered the lazy way--not the other way around.\n\nBesides, it's better to have a fast fix than a long one. If something you added takes down your website (or your client in Riot's case), you instantly halt any and all revenue while that site is down while simultaneously pissing off your customers. That risk has to minimized and those repairs should be kept simple so that you don't lose revenue.
