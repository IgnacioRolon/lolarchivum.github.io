I will retell the argument to make it easier to break down (Don't worry, I won't be changing the message at all).\r\n\r\nSo suppose there are 10 players, 5 on the enemy team 5 on your team, for you to rank up you have to be the difference.\r\n\r\nLet's say we represent the enemy team's skill with numbers:\r\n\r\nThe enemy team:\r\n\r\n1+1+1+1+1 = 5\r\n\r\nAnd then it (the argument) would proceed to say, now you have your team:\r\n\r\n1+1+1+1 (4 Players excluding yourself) And then you have to be the difference, so if the enemy team is 1+1+1+1+1 And your team is 1+1+1+1 but you're +2 then you should win, because you're the difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final part goes on to say that there will be the game which is unwinnable but if you stay consistent you will rank up since you're always making a difference.\r\n\r\nThis whole argument has some good points but it's false.\r\n\r\n1. It will never be 1+1+1+1+1, It will be something more like 0.5+2+0.3+1+0.2 \r\n\r\n2. It implies most of the time everyone will be around the same skill level \r\n\r\n3. It excludes games with afks, trolls, etc... These games happen more than you'd think, you can't rule them out.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your team is 0.5+0.5+0.5+0.5+2 But their's is 1+1+1+1+1 Then guess who's in favour to win? them. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome of you will say, that's why you have to be + 3 or +4\r\n\r\nTo which I reply: Yes it's true, you'll rank up if you're good enough, but if you belong in your rank, are maybe a few ranks higher, there's a good chance you'll have an extremely hard time ranking up, which is why I get annoyed when people use this argument.\r\n\r\nThese days you can't be +2 you have to be + 3 or +4, you have to be better than the rank you're trying to achieve to even have a hope of achieving it, if you're trying to achieve the rank you deserve then it won't come easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo tl;dr because I'm only interested in discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave an argument against my argument? Please post it because if I'm wrong here I'd like to delete the thread.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-30T18:53:27.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Inb4 the obligatory elitrash and plat players saying \"get good baddie\".\n\nChances are, none of them have ever dealt with the randomized horror that is S6 low-elo matchmaking, unless they are just smurfstomping through it in a couple days. \nI remember being able to actually climb steadily back in season 4.

Guess what... the game is constantly changing and either those players stopped learning or quit playing awhile and fell behind or were boosted to begin with or just playing worse than they used to. Doesn't matter how you ranked up in low elo in the past its still the same shit players as before. If you just played {{champion:11}} devour build then yea.. I guess the game changed a little for you. But not really since you can still farm and gank and get a similar item. Idk i have friends who were gold the last couple of season not in gold this season. But they also stopped playing for a long time and no longer pay attention to changes like they used to. You have to grind a rank every season and if you struggle from one season to another its because your skill changed.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-30T19:30:08.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no \"soft reset\".

I have been playing since season 1 and ranked since season 2 I know exactly what your talking about. And I don't understand what people are bitching about at low elo since I literally have 3 accounts oddly enough all currently in gold 4 at 0 lp. I personally don't understand how its a struggle to rank up in bronze or silver as it seems very easy to me. But I have also adjusted to the changing metas and champions I play and what builds I use. \n\nI am not saying DQ hasn't hurt ranked integrity, nor has it made the solo queue player experience better. But I am saying Its not as bad as these qq threads try and make it sound. I play with people all the time who were plat last season or gold w/e last season and watch them get stomped and wonder how the hell they were that rank to begin with last season. I just shrug it off since it has been that way all season. \n\nAlso how is there no soft reset each season lmfao? Starting to wonder if you have played more than one ranked season.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NoRunesMasteries","date":"2016-08-30T19:20:16.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every game is easily won, it just takes a team of elo minded players to cooperate and work as a team instead of individuals who only will see them for one game of the year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-08-30T19:04:50.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you considered that s4-s2 is where your skill level currently is?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smalltomahawker","date":"2016-08-30T19:14:05.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get your post.

I assume you know that but just saying its based of your mmr and the divison + lp is just a numbers thing to help motivate players to climb and give them an idea where they are on the ladder. MMR is all that actually matters. \n\nI don't get the argument still. Yea your right... mmr is not going to be perfect for various reasons but number one being IT WOULD TAKE LITERALLY A DAY TO FIND A GAME TO GET EVERYONE TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME MMR OR 1+1+1+1+1. \n\nIt gets worse the higher elo you get since there are less players. I can already see more random ass match ups in Gold compared to silver. But its still not a huge deal. Games are still fairly even most of the time. \n\nBut really to rank up you need to beat higher ranking players. If you can't consistently then yea you going to stick around the same rank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-08-30T18:56:11.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the argument is saying is that if you're better than your current rank, you should average >50% winrate over a lot of games, and you should climb.\n\nNot that you'll win every game or that your team won't suck sometimes. You can lose games and still climb. For every game where your team is consists of .5s to the enemy's 1s, you should have another game where your team consists of 1s to the enemy's .5s. You being a better player allows the chance for your team to be at an advantage. ","replies":[]}]}
