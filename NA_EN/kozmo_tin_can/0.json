As a first step, I recommend enabling [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode in case the aesthetics during champion select is causing too much stress and freezing.  Otherwise, this can be caused by a degrading connection so going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help.
