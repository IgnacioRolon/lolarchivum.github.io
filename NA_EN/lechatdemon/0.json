I recently bought a riot points prepaid card in Europe, Greece (i myself live in Albania). I asked the staff of the store if they knew whether this card's code could be used for all servers or was it for EU servers specifically (there were other cards in boxes where it was specified on the box that those particulate cards WERE server restricted while the one i got did not specify such a thing) and he said he wasnt sure but they were told (i guess by riot representatives) that the cards provided in the store were indeed restricted for EU servers. I intended to use to for my NA account but bought it anyway, since i could still use it for my EUW server. On the card is written in Greek \"no value until activation at the cashier\", so the staff at the cashier activated it for me.\r\n\r\n When i got home i tried to use it on the NA server first and continuously got an error message \"Epay redemption is not available at the moment. Please come back later.\" every time i tried. So i thought it couldn't be activated on the NA server after all. I went and tried it on my EU West account and got another error message every time i tried (the file I linked here), telling me that the store cant process that right now and to try later and providing me with a link to support.riotgames.com. And the final touch, the support website is. not. working. I get an error message saying the site can't be reached and to check: Internet connection, check proxy and firewall, run windows network diagnostics. It only shows this error on THAT site.\r\n\r\nI am left with no options, please, someone help. I've never purchased riot points before, all the skins i own are gifts from a friend or hextech chests. I have no other means of getting riot points in my country. All i want is one skin {{item:3072}} {{item:3170}}  {{champion:412}}  and maybe pay back my friend with another. Thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-30T23:26:52.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll definitely need you to reach out in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if there's something we can do to help out.

Im sorry to bother you with an issue that may be wrong on my end. Should i look for something on my firewall or antivirus that may be preventing the website from opening, since the error tells me to check \"Internet connection, check proxy and firewall, run windows network diagnostics\" and ive done the other 2? I just tried using a different pc and its the same, something to do with my internet connection maybe?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T21:07:00.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.. maybe a quick network reset could fix this. Go to your modem and/or Router, pull the power plugs on both, then plug them back in after 60 seconds. Restart your PC, then see if you can access the page now.\n\nHopefully that does the trick!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
