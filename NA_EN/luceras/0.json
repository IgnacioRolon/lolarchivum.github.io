I mostly play adc and mainly Draven and Jinx, sometimes Lucian although I&#039;m not really good with him. Today after the patch i got 6 skins with some random price reduction. I got Slayer Jinx for 1080 RP (20% off). It&#039;s also a legacy skin so do you think it&#039;s worth getting?\r\nThanks!","replies":[]}
