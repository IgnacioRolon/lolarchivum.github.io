When I try to install League, I  run into the same error over and over again. Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable x86 won't install. I've even tried to install that by itself and get the same error. I system restored the computer and  then factory reset it. I've tried everything I've seen in the forums about it, tried the \"work around\" links (which no longer exists apparently) and just pretty much tried everything people have come up and told me to try. Am I missing something crucial? Is there anything else that I can do, or are there any work around links for this that still work? \r\nThe error reads:\r\nError 1935.An error occurred during the installation of assembly\r\n'Microsoft.VC80.MFC.type=\"win32\".version=\"8.0.50727.4053\".publicKeyToken=\"1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b\".processorArchitecture=\"x86\"'.\r\nAny help at all would be super appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T17:35:14.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this error can be common for new rigs or reformats.  Basically, Windows is missing features or products required to complete the installation.  Usually, a Windows update to the most recent version can fix this up.  You can also directly [download the package here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387).  If the direct link doesn't install either, you may need to hit up [microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us) or wherever you purchased the PC to find out what's going on.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"OddVeig","date":"2016-10-16T00:51:59.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm trying to see if my windows will force update now, but I did try to download the package by itself as well, but I just continue getting the error. I'm taking the laptop in tomorrow if I cannot make any headway with it tonight. Its brand new out of the box, as well so it could be some files missing from the update or just faulty in its software entirely.","replies":[]}]}]}
