We're aware of an issue with older Harrowing content not displaying in the Champion Details page and are working on a fix. This won't affect your ability to use these skins. :]\n\n**EDIT**: This should be resolved!

How is it possible? how not even check my friends gift history to check that they sent me some skins that im missing. how is it possible not have a record of wheni bought rp (and i bought ALOT) and what i did with those rp. I understand the issues that riot can have, but me missing skins that i bought LONG time ago too, that randomly dissappear and get an answer \"I CANT HELP YOU\" its pretty much scamming. Can u help me?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T01:01:40.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BellaLuvsAceeres - \n\nThere are a couple reasons content may have been removed from your account.\n\n1) If a player participates in Refer-A-Friend fraud to acquire IP or RP, then any champions/skins gifted with this IP or RP are removed.\n\n2) If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you don't believe this is the case, I may suggest [opening another ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), explaining you don't believe the scenarios above are the reasons you're missing content on your account. Unfortunately, I don't personally have access to accounts, so I won't be able to take a look at purchases or info related to your account.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
