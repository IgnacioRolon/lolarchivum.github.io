It's really frustrating to play with one of them since they always run it down mid, thus making the game unnecessarily harder. And because I still encounter them it made me think if Riot Games actually took measures against those kinds of leveling bots.\r\n\r\nLike if someone always has a negative KDA, nearly no items at the end of the game and got to lvl 30 only playing co-op games, it is surely suspicious that that guy is using a bot, isn't it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T02:41:39.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The facts you gave in your second paragraph do pretty much always equal a bot, but it'd be pretty shitty if we banned someone for suspected botting and then that was just their playstyle. You can help us track down those botters by making sure to report them in the post-game though!","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2017-07-18T23:02:19.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been going on for months and still no decrease in activity.
