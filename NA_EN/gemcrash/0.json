This is a case of definitely wanting to be safer than sorry.\n\nIt's more than just formatting.\nThe thing is I  got this **\"temporary password\"** instead of a link to the password-changing page.\nI've never seen this feature of \"reset password before changing it\", I tried to look around and didn't find a possible way for me, or for any player, to \"reset my password to a temporary password\". \nWhich is why I'm suspecting this isn't from someone who's trying to steal my account.\n\n\nI'll do my part to secure my account, but still I need know under what circumstances will a \"temporary password\" be given?\n**This is important to me because I've lost my access to some of the e-mails I used for my alt/smurf accounts years ago, if Riot randomly resets my other accounts' passwords I won't be able to retrieve them**\n\n**Also if I didn't make myself clear, the second picture is unrelated to the first password-changing, I changed my password another time just to see how a normal password changing process will be like, and it's completely different from the first e-mail I received**","replies":[]}]}]}
