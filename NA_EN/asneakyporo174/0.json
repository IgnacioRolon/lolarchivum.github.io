I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get a league tattoo for a long time, seeing as it means so much to me. I couldn&rsquo;t decide what to get because I just wanted something simple and nothing spoke to me. The other day though I was playing Xayah and I noticed a quote that used to pass by over my head. &ldquo;Once there was magic everywhere or as the Vastaya say.....&rdquo; and she goes on to say it in Vastayan. I decided that&rsquo;s going to be my next tattoo because it represents my view of the world as a whole and not just league. The trouble is I can&rsquo;t seem to find the exact spelling for it :P people just usually put &ldquo;xayah chants&rdquo; and I would really appreciate if I could hear from you guys so I&rsquo;m not putting a mis-spelled quote onto my body forever. Thank you! ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-06-23T17:32:09.676+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exact spelling is:\n\n[\"Once, magic was everywhere, or as the vastaya say: Om upo sa't.\"](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/ad/Xayah.move33.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20170422022652)\n\nAlso good candidates for tattoos, IMHO:\n\n[Tavern brawls just seem to find me. ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/88/Xayah.move16.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20170422022607)\n\nor...\n\n[Okay.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/d9/Rammus_Select.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20121127014815)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-06-25T17:18:00.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey slagle, was hoping if I could make a quick Nunu plug.
