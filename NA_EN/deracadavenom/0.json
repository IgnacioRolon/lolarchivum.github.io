His last five minute wait time was also for crashing, but he just waited it out. Once again, he crashed during loading screen. We weren&#039;t even in a ranked either! I think he rage quit the game... Haven&#039;t seen him on since then actually.\r\n\r\nSo I was just wondering if this is a justified wait time or a mistake. If it is something that is non revokable that&#039;s okay.
