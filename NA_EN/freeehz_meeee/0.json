I am going to try playing on other accounts with my chat off and discipline myself to not wanna turn it on(even though it feels weird to play without communication in a team based game, but whatever). So lets say i come back from my ban and have chat turned off for months, then 1 day(lets say 4 months later) i decide \"maybe i should turn chat back on\" and i just lose my shit on a guy who is trolling. Am i pretty much just getting the permaban? Or does the system take in that I haven't been mean in chat for a while and acts accordingly?\r\n\r\nI guess basically, is my account going to get permaban the next time i get punished no matter what or how long its been?","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2020-02-18T21:20:51.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until your punishment level drops, any breach of the rules will warrant a permanent suspension.\n\n _In general_, it can take anywhere from 1-3+ months for your account health to begin restoring. If you want to play on another account to practice neutral/good behavior, that's a good idea, but just be aware that your punishment level will not decrease while your account is inactive. You have to be playing on the punished account for progress to be made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-02-18T21:59:10.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account can return to good standing but it takes time, good behavior, and games.\n\nTwo of the three won't do it - playing 100 games per week doesn't mean after a week or two you'll be back in good standing. On the other hand, going 4 months and only playing 100 games over the whole 4 months likely wouldn't cut it either. There is no set criteria - it is fluid and based on your behavior in those games over that time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Totalwanabe","date":"2020-02-18T21:28:03.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're asking for yourself good chance it's already underway","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-18T21:09:25.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any further infraction of any kind is an immediate permban, after a 14-day.

That is no guarantee, but I've had friends make it this far from 14 day bans, then get a 10 game chat restrict.  So its very difficult to do, that account is probably gonna get banned at some point when you slip up next.  So just get over that fact and realize its already gone.  Then it doesnt really matter when it happens.\n\n My advice is make a new account, and stop spending money on ALL accounts.  That way when the bans inevitably happen, you wont really care.  This is how I deal with disgusting automated system and RIOTs lack of interest in changing the system.  Its not gonna change, cant change myself, and I don't really want to anyway.  People Im toxic to in this game actually deserve it.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2020-02-18T23:51:49.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor restores much faster than punishment levels reset.
