It&#039;s odd but anywhere from one of them to the entire team will just sit in the fountain. They WILL not come out again for the rest of the game. It really makes things less fun. Has anyone else run into this? It definitely wasn&#039;t always the case, as I can remember games goin easily into the 40mins.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-27T23:06:37.895+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Riot did say they wanted bots to behave more realistically..","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-03-28T07:20:42.887+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the bots is probably raging at the other bots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2018-03-28T01:07:41.534+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this happen a few times and I think its a result of the bots roaming AI bugging out , they're not able to fully decide which area of the map they want to roam and defend. My guess is because of all the improvements they've made to the Summoners Rift AI, the Twisted Treeline bots are suffering because the maps are vastly different.\n\nI've had them run out of the fountain and into a lane, even though were were pushing the nexus. Their detection and roaming AI's have been buggy for months, and I think its just as simple as Riot hasn't become aware of it yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2018-03-28T14:03:37.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think around 5 of the bots also bug out like that on SR. I know Jhin, Taric, Yasuo, and Shyvana can all bug out and either stand still in lane or the fountain and several of the other bots can just run it into your team while you're in their base.
