I have a windows 10 PC and league was working perfectly before I decided to reset  my PC as it was slowing down; I ended up resetting it twice. After that, everything was working properly but when I tried to play league, it would almost always crash instantly when I loaded into a game. If it didn't crash, it kind of lagged but not really. My FPS seemed bad although the performance indicator said I had 60 FPS which is what I normally have. Also my sound seemed buggy and the game just felt clunky. Since I play on the KR servers, I thought if I played on my NA account, there wouldn't be a problem but the same issue happened on NA. Please help me someone T.T I just wanna play league again :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T23:31:50.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like some the recent Windows 10 Anniversary update may be causing issues for you.

But fps is limited to 60 or less (normal to 120), 'buzzing' sound, and the complete collapse of the system after 10 minutes of play (only frozen buzzing sound and images). It all started after the latest **Windows 10** update(why I even tried this system). This happens only in lol. And another thing, when you persistently turn on and turn off the sound I get a normal fps, and when I stop after half a second is like all of the above! And yes, Lower priority queue...\n(I reinstalled drivers for sound and graphic card Nvidia 920M 2 gb)","replies":[]}]}
