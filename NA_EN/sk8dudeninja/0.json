I used an old account to help him get a feel of the game and see if he wanted to join or not. We played about 5 games and honestly it was awful and a lot different from when I started league of legends, the chat was a battle ground of insults from lvl 30 bronzes trying to play as smurfs so they could brag in chat saying how bad the enemy was or how &quot;good&quot; they are. It turned into a full out war when our {{champion:122}}  tried to explain pretty complicated things to our {{champion:86}} who isn&#039;t understanding ANY OF IT. \r\n\r\nSO WHAT THE SOLUTION TO IT? WHEN A NEW PLAYER DOESN&#039;T UNDERSTAND COMPLICATED THINGS\r\n\r\nSwear your {{champion:22}} off and bully the hell out of him\r\n\r\nI tried to get Darius to lay off trying to explain to him hes new but ofc I doesn&#039;t help one bit\r\n\r\nThe lower levels are full off just the MOST CANCEROUS part of league and I can honestly say after those few games my friend isn&#039;t convinced league is worth his time and he said and I quote\r\n\r\n&quot;I like the game and all but is everyone that plays this game like that?&quot;\r\n\r\nRiot, Please in anyway you can, please save these new players from the torrent of insults  so they can actually enjoy the game for what it&#039;s worth","replies":[{"poster":"Iageri","date":"2016-08-16T17:32:09.017+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't take new people in pvp..

And yea, don't worry about that stuff, people are jerks, best to just ignore them. If I could say one thing, play bots lots. When I was level 30 I played mostly bots for a long time, with some normals every now and then with friends or alone (mostly got wrecked until I started playing normals more often). The nice part of bots if you can learn basic mechanics with different champs, or even practice with ones you know. The only problem is bots don't act like people, playing some normals is good but be prepared to get your but handed to you, that's part of the learning curve of this game unfortunately.. play lots of ARAMs too - it's more casual and you get to learn how other champs work, and it helps you teamfight a lot because you're always having to dodge abilities. The more you solo, the more you'll get matched with people close to your skill level... ranked has a different match making. So they can talk about their silver elo or whatnot but at the end of the day they are similar skill level to you. When I hit level 30 I played normals with my buddies a decent amount, you learn faster because you get destroyed... it's just a bit less fun but I put up with it and I still remember the first game I got fed as Kat while playing with my buds. :)   \n\nIf you have questions or want to chat or anything just add me in game!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-08-17T00:03:33.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know there's a new player problem with a game when the only real solution is \"enter with a group of friends and only play with them\".","replies":[{"poster":"Iageri","date":"2016-08-17T02:27:30.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said...

I guess my friend was curious at this point and unmutes them both and I don't know what was said, but my friend simply responded with \"I really am new, and I'm trying my best.

He's good at the game, though, and he's carried our teams countless times.\n\nWhen people got on his back, I just said what I could to honour the truth to have his back. Like, didn't try to get myself part of the debate or the flame war - just could say something like, \"Don't mind him. He's good at the game, but sometimes he's a bit reckless. He's carried a lot of our matches.\"\n\nI found, getting involved in the back-and-forth debate / flame war to try and prove who's right or wrong just leads to waay more hatred and discord. If they'd keep on going at it then, though, that's when I might mute him, and so would my friend. It's easy enough to recognise who is going to be really hateful and unreasonable, and in my opinion, it's fairly simple then to just mute them - because there's actually no point in listening to that, since if somebody is that hostile and unreasonable, then it's unlikely that anything they say the whole match will be decent.\n\nI also promise it is not actually _as_ common to encounter people who are **truly** unreasonable in League of Legends, so I hope your friend decides to stick around. He could even learn something about staying calmer in his regular life, if he approaches LoL as something of a learning ground for dealing with difficult people. That's what I did, and today I am much more untiltable than when I started. A lot of people are just venting when they type \"wtf\" or \"omg\" but they're actual decent guys who you could befriend easily. It's just that we only got to see them in their moment of frustration.\n\nIt's both a challenge to remain calm, but very, very worth it, if your friend decided to treat it as an actual place to learn composure too. It's not wonderful, since it'd be sweet if it was like the Olympics where the majority of people had esteem for each other. But even with that, it's not _terrible_, since we can still learn a lot and grow.\n\nYour friend's lucky to have you looking out for him, so he doesn't have to go at it alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papa Slothy","date":"2016-08-16T18:55:31.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to try and level an alternate account to spam solo queue (cause I generally just play w friends for fun) and I still haven't finished, not cause it's hard but cause EVERYONE is so toxic, it's insane","replies":[]},{"poster":"YJRBqwXJcS","date":"2016-08-16T22:09:57.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sk8dudeninja,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c3clInij,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-16T17:21:47.809+0000)\n>\n> Today I possibly saw the worst side the league of legends community. \n> \n\nyou mean the regular side?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-08-16T20:59:37.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mute them.

Granted, more of it was screaming about how OP any given thing was, along with the ubiquitous, \"call mia (insert insult here),\" nonesense, where all deaths that could be blamed on teammates not calling mia, were.\nApparently it was your teammates job to do map awareness for you.\n(I guess because we sucked, we assumed that we couldn't be held responsible for mistakes like not looking at the minimap?)\n\nThe complete intentional feeders were rampant, along with the HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE spam.  There was no real sense that reporting would do anything, so the serious diehard trolls were out in force.\n\nIt moderately cleaned up around 30.  I've got a couple lower level accounts, and to be honest, the game is a lot calmer and nicer than it was, and people who say it isn't either weren't there, or have rose colored glasses an inch thick on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2016-08-17T04:35:01.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With all these posts...

Because if you did, thats the problem. He should try it by himself, on a new account of his own, then he will be placed versus either super bad people or new players and he will have way more fun. If this old account used to be yours and is already lvl 30 then it already has a hidden MMR.
