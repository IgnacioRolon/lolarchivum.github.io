He still shows as unavailable if you attempt to purchase him directly from his champion page though for whatever reason.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-05T16:24:11.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's fixed in the Champion details page as well now, seems to be a little slow this morning! :]","replies":[]}]}
