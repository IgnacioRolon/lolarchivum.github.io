So i'll have to reset my client. After resetting my client and joining the game again it only shows the League of legends Logo and the blackscreen, followed by a window with \"unable to connect to server please check your network connection\". I have tried a few things to resolve this problem but none of the following worked:\r\n1. Allowing leagueoflegends.exe through firewall\r\n2. Disabling Firewall while ingame\r\n3. Changing compatibility mode into windows vista or XP\r\n4. Running the league client as administrator\r\n\r\nIf someone knows any other solutions, please post them under this forum. I've lost alot of ranked games due to this problem \r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nEkaliblue","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-27T18:46:31.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a pretty unstable connection issue that's failing to reach our services, further affirmed by the black screens that can't grab assets.  The firewall steps can help, but it's important to focus on improving your connection as a whole.  My suggestion would be to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and get back in.
