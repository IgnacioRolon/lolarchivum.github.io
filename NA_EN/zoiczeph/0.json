In my mind, that implies Summoner Level 6; however I am currently Level 30 on my account. Is there a special leveling system for boards that I'm unaware of? I tried looking for information on it, but unfortunately there is a lot of unhelpful discussions that drowned out any that'd be useful.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\n~A Silly Summoner","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T02:53:30.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes if you hadn't used your Boards account for a long time, it will have fallen out of sync with your Summoner profile.
