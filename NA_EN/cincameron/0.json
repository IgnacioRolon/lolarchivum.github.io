He can not survive in this meta unless he builds as a bruiser but then can not have a high damage output since his AP scalings are not as high as they used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-15T06:53:52.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kassadin maybe need better base damages in his spells.","replies":[{"poster":"CinCameron","date":"2015-05-16T14:55:56.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is true, but since he's melee and has to get close and is usually focused, he needs some form of defense other then a pitiful spell shield.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NÎ£Q","date":"2015-05-15T06:47:00.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now he needs complete rework. His passive is a joke, his Q does nothing in late game, RE combo is still bugging, and the W isnt good exchange for jumping in risky situations.","replies":[{"poster":"CinCameron","date":"2015-05-16T14:55:02.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does not really need a rework tbh... his main problem is that, since he is a melee mage, he needs to have higher base damage on his Q and E or get his defenses back up... when they removed his MR per level pre season 4, it was fine since he still had good AP scalings so he could be played as an assassin. Messing with his scalings and his ultimate screwed his season 4 rework over. He needs his MR per level returned or his scalings back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"One Bind Morgana","date":"2015-05-15T05:04:16.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"agreed\n\nand it's definitely not because i main him\n\nhue\n\nedit: iirc his scaling on q/e (main assassination tools) have always been 70%.  the problem with him is his q/e bases are piss poor.  WHICH WOULD BE FINE.... if riftwalk still dealt 120 + 80% ability power, but it deals something like 60 + 1% maximum mana which at full build is like a loss of 500+ damage","replies":[{"poster":"CinCameron","date":"2015-05-16T14:58:40.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His Q did have a 70% scaling for most of the time he was played, but his E had higher base damage and 80% scaling at one point during season 3, which made him have a strong engage. His ultimate did way too much damage toward the end of season 3 when they increased the scaling and gave it a mana regen passive.","replies":[]}]}]}
