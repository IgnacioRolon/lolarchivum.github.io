High with 0 issues. Now I can't even do very low without constantly 200+ ping, and I'm in Canada.\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not going through your shitty support who have literally never solved my problems and respond with the most cookie-cutter sentences even though I've sent over a dozen support tickets. Did I mention they're also consistently bad at responding in a reasonable length of time?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T04:26:34.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patches only change local files inside your League directory, they're *extremely unlikely* to affect your latency (ping) to our servers. Big changes in your latency (in this case, 200+) are usually a result of incompatible network configurations or problems with your route to our servers. Before we take a look at your network routing, I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings are good.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues with your latency after working through those steps, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
