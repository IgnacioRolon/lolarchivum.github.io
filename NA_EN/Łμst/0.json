It leaves you more room to farm(especially early) but that also puts pressure on other lanes. In every game I play, I see bot rotate mid(or occasionally top) after taking first tower. Generally the losing bot lane will follow, because if they don't then they're going to get another tower for free. One solo laner can't defend against 4 other champions. One solo laner and a jungler can't defend against 4 champions either. So they're going to need at the very least a 3rd champion there to help defend. Especially since most junglers currently played don't have much(if any) CC. The support also isn't going to be getting any gold in a lane without enemies unless they're using {{item:3096}} or {{item:3097}}. {{item:3098}} only works if you hit enemy champions or towers with it. You'll get at most 3 procs on a tower if you manage to push to the enemy tower, but you'll be open to ganks very easily with your tower missing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Done25","date":"2018-10-12T23:29:07.983+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because staying bot is a really good way to get murdered by the enemy jungler over and over again","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-10-13T00:17:50.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, all the answers here are correct, but this one is probably the most important.
