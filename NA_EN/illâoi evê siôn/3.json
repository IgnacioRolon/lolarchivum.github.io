At 100, consumes all charges to remove all crowd control debuffs and grant Slow Immunity or very high Slow Resistance for a few seconds. Charges decay slowly while you can move unimpaired and rapidly when out of combat. 90 second cooldown.\n\nChain CC will always exist and perma-slows will always pop up every once in a while even if Riot tries to squash them. A great option to help players deal with them while they figure things out is to give us counterbuy options. This version is intended for Fighters as they struggle the most against these issues. Tanks and Marksmen with Supports will just survive, Assassins will avoid it with their mobility, and Mages and bad Marksmen that get caught will die like they&#039;re supposed to. Meanwhile, Fighters can&#039;t do their jobs.\n\nThe small block passive is to solidate the item as a defensive buy and it retains more of its value the less Resistances you have, so it&#039;s good on a class that stacks a lot of Health.\n\nSo they next time Gnar kites you into the grave, or Morgana and Sejuani chain you for 3 years, you can buy this item and have a window to turn things around.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2018-02-18T14:11:41.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nYou think Riot are even considering fighter items?  They still haven't even bothered to throw up a placeholder keystone on the PBE yet and its been like 3 months now.\n\nNot a bad concept tho, I like the item.","replies":[]}]}
