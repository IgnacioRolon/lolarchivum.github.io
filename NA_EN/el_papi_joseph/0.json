When Gnar transform he has a phasing thing that happens. When the animation of the phasing happens, whether it be mini to mega or mega to mini, my eyes are giving me signals that I could get a seizure from it. I really love Gnar and I'm not asking to remove it. I'm just wanting to let League know that it's a serious problem for me. {{champion:150}} I hope you can respond to me, Riot. If there's something I can do in via game settings to stop it, let me know. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-12-11T17:31:50.920+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey joerorowesmio, \n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. The last thing we'd want is for our content to hurt our players. ;-; We take reports like this seriously. I'm really sorry this is happening for you. \n\nIn this case, changing your video settings wouldn't fix this - from what you're describing, the transformation VFX are too loud/flashy, which is causing you to be on the verge of a seizure. \n\nI'm in the process of collaborating with the pod who worked on the Super Galaxy skins to see what we can do to solve for this. I'll keep you updated. \n\nAgain, thanks for calling this out. \n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}\n\n\n**EDIT**: Don't look at the animations again, but from memory, can you pin point what piece was causing the issue - flashing of VFX/wobbling? What types of visuals are likely to cause seizures for you? I'd be super helpful to narrow things down so we can make a fix based on that! :3 \n\nFor the sake of solving this ASAP, feel free to hit me up on League (Riot KateyKhaos), or on Twitter, @KateyAnthony. I'd love to pop a fix in for next patch, if at all possible!

I remember waiting for my red to spawn one game. My ADC was Pulsefire Ezreal and my support was Sona (she was using an oriental looking skin). Ez started spamming his laser  emote (alt+2 I think; the one were he talks about power levels) while Sona was spamming an animation where she started playing her instrument (it sounds like tun..tun..TUN). For some reason it made me feel really disoriented after watching and hearing at the animations for about 3 seconds. I had been playing for a long time and was tired, but if I reacted that way being healthy I think maybe something like that could be dangerous for other people.","replies":[{"poster":"Rabblerouser","date":"2017-12-13T17:23:34.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being tired is one thing that can trigger seizures for a lot of us epileptics (no worries, I don't go into grand mal, petit mal only).

I think it's awesome!\n\nAnyway, I'm not someone who suffers from seizures, but, I would like to help out if possible. I am an old Gnar main, and have played MANY games on him, but I have never used the SG skin, so, it is quite easy for me to spot differences in it as to say Snow Day that could possibly be triggering this.\n\nIf I am to guess, I would say it is right before any transformation. The yellow circles surrounding Gnar seem to go off in a way that could trigger somthing. However, what is worse, I would say, is going from Mega back to Mini. There seems to be some kind of flicker that reminds me of old fluorescent light bulbs, which I do know can easily trigger seizures.\n\nHere's the video from Skin Spotlights to hopefully point out what I mean.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5xh1beAoMtE?t=145\n\nHopefully this helps!\n\nEDIT: Also, right after you transform to Mega from Mini, you seem to have that same flicker I mentioned.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-12-11T23:46:22.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \n\nAs I'd said, we don't want a shitty player experience, especially when it has the potential to harm someone. :c \n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to run through the skin.

While trying to maintain the original artist's work, I balanced out the colors that might be causing vibrations.\n  -I've removed the orange vertical-moving rings. (This is because I wanted to stop the complementary colors from switching out so much from blue/orange)\n  -I've also changed the full-screen effect color to blue so that it's more cohesive with the rest of the transformation. (This should be easier and calmer on your eyes)\n\nWe hope this solves the problem for you, but let us know if you feel otherwise :)\n\nHere is a \"not-super-high-quality\" GIF to show the adjustments made.
