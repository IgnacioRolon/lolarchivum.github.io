I have never seen some survey from them, which to me, is a total excuse to cancel soloQ.\n\nThe only reason solo queue hasn&#039;t been released yet is because they know that nobody in their right mind would pick that shitty new queue over solo queue. They should just release solo queue already and admit that dynamic queue was just a stupid idea. It seems to me riot is proud of dynamicQ but they destroy the entire essence of compatitive play for the amateur players.\n\nAnyways, WE care about distinquishing ourselfs from team players, since soloQ players are relatively more skilled than players that only do teams. Right now, soloq only players have a harder time to climb than soloq (2-4 man premade) people do. Why the living F do you want to group those together for the same, fking rewards?\n\nIf we go on like this, a platinum 1 SOLOQ ONLY player will be more skilled than a diamond 2 dynamicQ user.. Nice system, boys.\n\nI quote socratis here;\n\n&quot;Hey guys, we know there are a lot of players who are really passionate about solo queue. We&#039;re not trying to be dishonest or dodge this topic. Radio silence on this the past couple months has been painful, we know. We hoped to come out with a direct answer to this, but working through the problems players are facing on live now (consistency around position select, queue times and matchmaking for high MMR) is taking longer than we initially expected. We did a bad job at managing expectations around this and deserve the heat we&#039;re getting around that.\n\nThat being said, solo queue does not directly address either of these problems and could suffer from the exact same problems. We&#039;ll be honest: there&#039;s definitely a world in which solo queue doesn&#039;t return, but we&#039;d rather keep it on the table as we work through these issues before making a final decision.&quot;\n\n360 downvotes already. Nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-03-23T15:34:02.115+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":22,"body":"This needs spread everywhere so it's public.  No more of this random \"data\" Riot apparently collected and refuses to share.  Riot, swallow the pride, accept this was a bad idea, and return solo queue.  Yes, Dynamic will fail because of this, but understand that everyone saw this coming...including you, which is why you don't want it back - you're afraid that _The Future of League_ isn't what you want it to be.\n\nThat being said, last I checked, your company manifesto still states that you're aspiring to be the most player-focused company in the games industry.  Either that should have been edited a long time ago, or you could go back to that mentality.  This isn't singling your team out either; this applies to multiple departments, but that's another topic entirely.\n\nEdit:  Huh, Dynamic is still showing a 37% approval.  How about that?

You mean the claims that they themselves admitted to 100%. It is also 100% relevant as your whole point was to try and use cherry picked facts to say the poll was bad, while completely disregarding the other side that was actually much worse, because Riot at least admitted they cherry picked (without using that exact wording). \n\nYou have a VERY clear stance and side, otherwise you wouldn't have bothered posting an argument to the post and poll, and you tried providing specific facts to backup your side. I made a counter point that riot did the same tactic but worse. You respond again trying to act as if my points aren't valid, when they are. \n\nWhen someone counters a point of facts with a point of facts, it is just silly, and further proves bias to respond with essentially \"yeah well, your point isn't relevant\" just because you don't like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2016-03-23T20:10:11.236+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't play ranked, I have no preference for either queue. My concern is with making sure that in this one thread people are informed that strawpoll is insecure and the sample size is too small so they can better use the information gathered here.\n\nAccuracy of facts and statistical relevance are my goals. I hadn't even heard of the first poll until somebody on the boards brought it up because I don't interact with League or Riot outside the boards and I'm assuming they hosted it through something external, so I have no idea what the numbers are nor do I care. How Riot managed their poll, for better or for worse does not excuse attempting to pass off this insecure, low sample size excuse for a poll as real relevant data. If anything that makes it worse that the summoners who are invested in showing riot's poll was a sham and didn't represent the players would allow their data to be mishandled in much the same way.\n\nI will seek out a source on Riot owning up to not handling the poll results properly, which I expect won't be hard to find, since it was so recent.\n\nEdit:\n\nSo far I've found Lyte's initial announcement of the poll over in the Dev Talk board (where Lyte addresses concerns regarding question format and the sample health) and some misc stuff over on Reddit.

As it stands this poll can and should be thrown out because strawpoll is extremely unreliable.\n\nI suggest a petition for Riot to actually release the real numbers behind their surveys or to have a public survey for the boards and reddit to participate in where we can see the votes the whole way. Including only votes from say Level 30 accounts would mitigate the issue where one person can vote multiple times that strawpoll has, even though I still don't know how we would handle smurfs.

That is like saying someone is referring to the heads side of a quarter that is relevant to the tails side of the same quarter, but when someone mentions tails, you say it isn't relevant to the discussion.

I don't agree at all with the poll or the \"facts\" we are being lead to believe they represent. I am and have only argued in this thread that you can't simply act as if this poll is the most pointless bit of data when, again I will repeat, this whole discussion was started by Riot doing the same thing, but without it being public outside of what they told us, which prompted a player (in this case the OP) to start a poll trying to prove the opposite (despite the flaws, that isn't the point I've been trying to make, but you are stuck on that for some reason).","replies":[{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2016-03-23T22:25:09.944+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think you've been arguing with the wrong person, like maybe you mixed up some earlier comments up in the chain or something.\n\nMy very first comment, the one you initially replied to was \"Strawpoll is unreliable and I don't think anyone should take it seriously\" basically.\n\nI didn't take sides and I didn't even mention the other poll, that was you.\n\nThen I corrected you saying that I never took sides and just provided additional context to the poll for people that may not know strawpoll is pretty bad.\n\nThen you started in on me being biased this and 100% riot admitted that about some poll I had never even heard of.\n\nFor the last time: I came here to add context with my initial post about how unreliable strawpoll is.
