In the New beta client it was having trouble logging in and once it logged in after many attempts, it would not let me create a lobby to play with and it would come up with a trying to reconnect window. I then re-installed the old client and It's been crashing once the game starts to load after character select. Is there anything I can do to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T03:55:35.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the latest crash after champ select, are you seeing a specific error such as a Bugsplat or was it just throwing out general *network connectivity errors*?","replies":[]}]}
