Should I still get a low priority?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not joking about this to try and get out of a 5 game low priority. I was just playing an URF game with some friends as Tryndamere, game just started, I go in to initiate a level 1-2 fight and BOOM internet goes out, 15-20 minutes later after waiting for it to come back up, it does. I sign in to league, and see the 'You have been placed in a low priority queue for 5 games.' And it really pisses me off because this has happened enough to where its 20 minutes each time I queue for the next 5 games. I was wondering if there was a way Riot or I could get rid of this without having to wait a total of 1h 40m in queue time for just 5 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Lıght Skın","date":"2017-08-14T20:47:36.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot's system makes it impossible for them to get rid of that for you, that is extremely unlucky for you and i would seriously think about contacting your internet provider and telling them that you are not okay with your internet cutting out. Something along the lines of, \"I do not pay (set amount of money) a month to have my internet shut off unexpectedly all the time, fix the issue or I will go to a different provider, etc. etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-15T02:56:38.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't have gotten an LPQ after having only left one game due to an internet outage. Our system does take into account that someone might have some issues here and there such as internet or power outages, which is why a single AFK/Leave won't punish you. It looks like there's been a recent history of games being left/afk'd in, which would have been why this was placed.","replies":[]}]}
