Such a minuscule improvement to the odds aren't worth the stress. It's much less stressful and efficient to move onto the next game. You never know, your next 10 games could all be wins so how  would that one game really matter in the long run.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-21T18:16:39.862+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe you are not used to play from behind.\n\nI had quite alot of games which went downhill and we still managed to win in the end.

Thing is, in those matches my team was clearly better. I've learned that a 4v5 is just as winnable as a 5v5. The only thing that really matters is which team has the hardcore feeding shits. \n\nAny game that's a come back or a win from a seemingly huge disadvantage was never actually hopeless. If you team isn't mentally defective then there is very little chance you'd lose. But if a game starts off with your team just inting it up, then it's pretty clear which team has the shit players. There is no point in playing those out. The vast majority of the time it's very easy to tell that you have a team of down syndrome sub-human trash.
