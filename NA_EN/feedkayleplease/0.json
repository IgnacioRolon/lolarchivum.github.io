However, you can't get teammates banned for playing poorly or being bad. Think about it and look at the bright side! Its possible that you could be getting those 4 teammates on the enemy team sometime. If Riot started banning players who played poorly then all the divisions would slip down a pedestal. Meaning, Gold would turn to Silver, Silver to Bronze and Bronze? To Iron. Not sure what happens to Iron players though. \n\nMy point is, bad players are as important to you and everyone else sitting at a higher ranking as the Challengers are for competitive gaming. Everyone comes together to create the ladder. Supposing you had the power to ban players who played poorly, you'd end up banning like 50% of those in your own elo  (Average 50% win ratio) and everyone below. And that won't help you, if anything. It'd make it harder for you to climb up. {{sticker:leblanc-funny}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T09:07:10.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for reminding us that there's always someone out there who is suffering more.
