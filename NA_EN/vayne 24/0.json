I queue up for a ranked game and accept the AFK check. The sounds and animations of entering champion select all happen but then the screen just goes black (see link) instead of showing the usual stuff. It&#039;s not just a problem with the visuals because I cannot click on anything either. And it&#039;s not a problem with entering the game because I can hear all of the champion select process while I&#039;m stuck not able to do anything. I hear the timer, I hear all the bans, I hear everyone pick their champions, and then eventually it&#039;s my turn to ban or pick a champion and then timer runs out. From there everything returns to normal and it goes back to the queue up screen and says that I dodged the game. This has resulted in me losing a promotional series, losing a bunch of LP, and getting multiple 5 and one 30 minute penalties. Only once did this happen two times in a row. The other times I queued up right after it happened (and after the dodge penalty) and played a game with no problems. \n\nAnyone else having this issue? \n\nP.S. I am using the new client on NA servers.\n\nEdit: I posted this because this happened to me like 10 minutes ago. Immediately after posting it happened a 2nd time in a row. Really causing me serious issues here.
