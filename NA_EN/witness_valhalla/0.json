This isn't the reason why you're in low priority queue, though, as games during a quick patch like last night aren't recorded or should end in a draw. I looked into this and found that you've recently had a trend of disconnections, which is why you were put into low priority. \n\nIf you're experiencing technical issues that are disconnecting you from game, please give me more details about what happens so I can provide a proper set of steps to resolve it. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
