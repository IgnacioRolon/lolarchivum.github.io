(Buy a ward save a life)\nIt's not the support's job to ward the map you have a part in this too~\n\n6- Disable all-chat (Trust me it helps)\nDon't talk to them... Just don't... Look at rule #2... Nuff' said.\n\n7- Play more draft or ARAM\nIn my book: Draft>Normals simply because there is no fighting over positions and ARAM is a great way to play multiple champions! (Knowing how champions work can make you able to fight against them better)\n\n8- Before going in rank (or even normal) make sure that you are in a good mood!\nGoing into a match with a frown on your face has almost never a good ending... GG@20 \nPlay you are happy, and if you lose more than 2 games in a row... just stop for the day (or if it's morning stop until after-noon)\n\n9- Build to fight the game, not your lane\nIt's important to know that if you are going against an AP that you might not want to go full MR because the enemy team might have 4 AD and 1 AP, know what you are building.\n\n10- Don't leave & Don't be Toxic\nLeaving matches is a bad thing you can do to you're team and to yourself\nbut being toxic is the worst thing you could do, why?\n-Losing the game\n-Bad mood afterwards\n-Being reported\n-Losing more games\n-And many more side-effects\n\nFollow these simple rules and you should be fine to become better at LoL~\nGood Luck & Have Fun!","replies":[{"poster":"EnderForHegemon","date":"2015-02-06T02:56:19.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MZG Sir Taco,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=2ENT60q3,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-03T16:21:26.882+0000)\n\n> 3- Don't play unsafe (Going too deep, chasing too far, etc)\n> Better to be safe than feeding!~\n> \n> 4- Know your limits\n> Don't go in the enemy jungle alone if there is no wards, don't go 1v3, don't go 1v1 if you have no vision (It's a tarp)\n\nThis is so horribly backwards and contradictory that it hurts my eyes.\n\nI'll start off by saying that I agree that feeding is basically a bad thing, and that you should try to avoid it, but I don't like these rules at all. \"Better to be safe than feeding\" is the opposite of how to learn the game.\n\n>Know your limits.\n\nThis is very good advice, and needs to be tested on and pushed every single game. If you never overreach, by definition you have never reached your full potential. you *must* push beyond what you think might be your limits in order to properly get better and understand the game. If you spend every game sitting comfortably below your perceived limit, you may not feed, but you will not get the full satisfaction, impact, or fun or playing to potential. Constantly you need to make educated guesses about your limits, then weigh the risk/reward of them working out. This is done at *every* level of the game. Pros *constantly* overreach, even in LCS games and at the World Championships. Every baron throw, every miscalculated all-in or skillshot. These are not bad things. These are people trying to play to maximum potential.\n\nSometimes playing the game properly, or efficiently, or even in a way that is *fun* is inherently unsafe, and I argue that new palyers need to learn this more than anyone else. Pain is a teacher that no one will ignore, and going 0/9/3 on a midlaner is a powerful lesson that will make you better at the game if you look at what happened with a critical eye. GO for the catch when you see it, don't hesitate. TRY to burst down a dragon when they're slightly out of position. Either you'll get it or you won't, and either way you'll learn something about the game. PRESS for that level two advantage against a scary lane that might outscale you.\n\nTake chances!

But knowing this guy for the past,id say about 12 year, i'd never expect something like this from him, League of Legends is kind of a 2 sided blade when it comes to it. We've had our bad moments of rage as a group and what not but i think that most of all we learned to work as a team from school to league,things only got better. Hopefully it only gets better from here on and alot of other gamers can learn from these rules and have ourselves a better community for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Renders","date":"2015-02-04T00:55:07.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the syllabus, however, I'd suggest to engage in constructive communication first and foremost.

There was a long period of time where I had all chat turned off, for instance. I've more recently changed my outlook to make it a game-by-game basis instead of defaulting to turning off all chat. Sometimes people troll, and that's simply their calling - the best we can do is limit our exposure to it but not entirely eradicate it, like you say.\n\nRanked is a whole different area for me. I didn't rank all of last season because I didn't feel like I could dedicate enough of my time to it, and feel like I was being the best team mate. I just have the mindset in ranked games that you're there to win, because there are stakes beyond just LP - such as your time, and the time of your 4 team mates. I join ranked games to win, and that completely changes the dynamic of my game experience. \n\nAs an aspiring LCS player, I'm sure that is of the utmost importance as well. Good luck on your road to the pros :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nybx4life","date":"2015-02-05T00:37:23.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add on to this, some boards (Team Recruitment) and League communities are the embodiment of this.
