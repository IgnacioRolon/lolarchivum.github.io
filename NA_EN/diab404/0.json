There could be other factors as well like a full hard drive.  This far into patching, your network is trying to grab update files but some instability might be causing it to get stuck.  The steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help tune up your connection.  \n\nWhile I know your connection seems to be fine elsewhere, you can still have issues reaching specific servers, and that guide should help clear a path.","replies":[]}]}
