If the issue persists after a restart or relog, then there may be a corruption with your update that may require a [reinstall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).  You can also test the old store by returning to the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nHopefully that will fix the issue!","replies":[{"poster":"SneakyMonkeyBoi","date":"2016-12-12T00:53:44.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-20T00:19:21.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only buy champs through the store right now.\nWe can assume the ability to buy them through the profile will be added in a later patch.","replies":[{"poster":"izak4717","date":"2016-11-21T23:59:07.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do u mean through the store ?","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-22T03:33:53.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to store---> champions and you can buy champs on the new client.\nThrough the profile doesn't work yet.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
