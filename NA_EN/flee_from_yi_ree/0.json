","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have played about 20 games on this smurf account, and noticed almost all my 5v5 matches have had bots in them. They all take ghost and heal, and usually run mid, then farm my gromp dying to it. And repetitively try to farm the jg, dying over and over. Kind of annoying. This is why players buy accounts, to avoid leveling new accounts. Very huge waste of time. \nI kind of wonder what riot does. their last patch they said they only fixed a single bug... In two weeks????? I can see how bots are running wild in this game. Idk what riot is even focusing on... Buffing tanks maybe?? That must be it. Smh, a multi billionaire company, not able to control bottling for the most part. I am no coder or w/e, but you guys should try making a program in the tutorial to catch bots.

I will buy the account. 26 bucks is slightly more expensive than two exp boost, and 2 or 3 days worth of time. Defiantly worth it thou.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-18T20:05:09.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this is why botting exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Flee From Yi REE","date":"2018-08-18T22:43:55.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, they pretty much blackmail your games. SO people who just want to smurf get salty. Like me, and just buy an account. I'd support riot, if the botting didnt get far worse since the last time I smurfed. which was nearly a year ago.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-18T20:00:42.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bots are controlled, but they cant be banned rapidly, as it would give away how they are detected.\n\nBasically, there is no way to eliminate them entirely, as long as they can rush to 30 and sell the account before being banned, it will be profitable.","replies":[{"poster":"Flee From Yi REE","date":"2018-08-18T22:54:58.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"controlled in a small way. Look at overwatch, or csgo. They ban so many people, sure the way they detect cheaters is given away. BUT, guess what. They just figure out a way to counter the people who make cheats counters. You know, kinda like chess. \nriot can do the exact same. They either are to lazy, and or dont care since they know people will still play their game. Or, which Imo. this is more likely.  \n\nI know this part is off topic, but why i think they hire shitty people.  look at who was the balancing lead, the guy who made all those shitty RNG changes in the game. Like dragons scud plants. That guy im pretty sure was the guy who \"balanced\" WoW, and ruined it for a while, same with age of empire 2. he literally had a record of being bad at his job. lmao\n\nbut, they have money to control boting more then it is. Idk, dont defend them on it.   I hope they hire better people from now on.","replies":[{"poster":"Flee From Yi REE","date":"2018-08-18T22:57:22.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mfw i cant argue. because im to shitty at using words, especially when annoyed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2018-08-19T22:57:37.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First, be sure that they actually are bots - not some child or newbie who actually doesn't understand how the game works, or a person who has a really bad connection.   I've seen players accused of botting (including myself) when there actually was a human piloting the champion.  (It is an offence under the player code of conduct to accuse a person of that in chat - just giving a warning.  Kind of insulting to do it too.)\n\nSecond, fill in the report at the end of the game giving some details as to why you think that account was botting.  Was it a case of using the well-known jungle-bot farming algorithm?  Was it a case of the champion just inting?  Was it a case of scripts being used (unanticipated dodging, auto-targetting, auto-farming, etc.)?  Be precise when you fill in the report.\n\nThird, Riot does take actions on accounts.  But they need evidence.  There needs to be consistent reports by other players.  Timestamps as to when the offences were occurring and so on.\n\nDoes Riot deal with it?  Yes.  But also keep in mind that this is also the unofficial start of botting season.  It does start to increase at about this time of year because some players are too lazy to level their own accounts.  But also know that Riot does take actions against known IPs that regularly use bots and scripting.","replies":[]}]}
