Meaning 0% battery 2/3 the Max movement speed.\n\nThis however gives you an opportunity for a steroid ability; \nYou can rework that bomb to be also an second self casting ability (she wont use battery life for casting this one no mater if casted on self or enemy). When she \"bathes\" in the liquid , the liquid conducts her life force and the boots drain  it in to a battery energy and her HP goes down; 1% energy = 4% current HP. Can be interrupted, max duration 8 sec - max battery refill 10%, the 1th and the 2nd  pull/second drain double.\nit would probably make sense that enemies that are painted by the bomb refund a little bit of energy back.\n\n\nOn the looks how ever... I don't like her a bit. Don't get me wrong I love ur idea and I really value the effort u have put in. Im just... This concept inspired me and I feel like Im on a brainstorming meting :D.\nYou need to make those boots bigger , way bigger! - League is viewed from top and the legs are often obstructed by something, you need to make those boots go up to her hips, at least from the outside (she would need room between her legs not to walk like a duck :D ) and maybe cover the hips too, the force to pull off a kick like her Q comes from the upper leg butt and the back muscles and the stress from the hit is stronger in the hip. You can even make extensions go to her back(battery pack maybe). \nAnd I imagine her to be a more bulky girl in order to pull those leg extensions, maybe bigger shoulders to indicate strong back, you know like a professional swimmer.","replies":[{"poster":"Solidsnipe","date":"2015-09-08T00:15:40.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So a couple things.\nI really value your input so really no offense taken by anything. \n\nI created Rae to be a mobile tank for utility purposes. its really depends on how you build her. I would prefer it if you would build her as a tank but if you go dmg you may get blown up when you go on a carry. \n\nHer battery resource is already a handicap in the early levels because it forces you to base in order to regenerate the power supply. so say a enemy teams see's that you have low power and takes advantage of it somehow. She is also not a champion u can rush home guards on early because its takes a lot of gold to even get the boots to the 3rd lvl. \n\nThe bomb is a jungle clearing utility as well as a hp dmg ability. Im thinking about also having the paint be the cause for the knock-ups on both her E and her Q's second hit. without it the i agree that she is very CC focused but i would also like to point out that building attack speed wouldn't be a bad idea for the bombs dmg output. so maybe Devourer or wits end would be a good buy early. \n\nWorking on this alone is tough. especially when my advisor didnt really understand how abilities came to form the games core fundamentals. When i asked friends to look over the abilities they gave me half ass answered because they didnt see it going anywhere. i really wish i could have play tested the kit. \n\nI agree that the boots need to be scaled up . the belt was difficult because i knew i had to make something that she can still move around in especially at high speeds. I see her build as more of a figure skating martial artist and less of a swimmers thick well developed shoulders or thighs. The boots themselves help with the amount of force that would be hitting the target. i imagined the boots accelerating on impact before each kick hits. I could probably even throw in a knockback after every 3rd AA if i really wanted too but thats excessive. \n\nThanks for the input again. i am saving all these comments and coming back to them if and when i tweak Rae.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riv x Kobe","date":"2015-09-07T13:30:45.791+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PanterLily,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uJheyaxq,comment-id=0033,timestamp=2015-09-07T10:07:41.624+0000)\n>\n> Way to mobile, all you need is a stun and you'll have a Super Riven on steroids.\n\nWell technically... \"If you use the ability to close a gap instead of jumping off a wall Rae will stop by attempting to ‘Trip’ her enemy stunning them for 1 second.\" So like, yeah. She's got a stun.\n\nI agree with you. She seems way too overloaded with CC and mobility, and its honestly confusing that a kit like this has enough upvotes to get on the front page.\n\nMy biggest complaint though is the size and scaling of her ult. 800\"m\"(unit) knockup radius?

It sounds like exactly the kind of kit this game needs **less** of.\n\nQ - Short range dash + knock up.  (What's the point of the two part ability, anyway?  So that the enemy can respond within the window of the first and second kick?  Can you cancel after the first kick if you only want to knock the enemy back?  What's the point of knocking them back, otherwise?  Wouldn't that make it harder for you to hit the knock up?)\n\nW - Okay.\n\nE - Huh?!  An unorthodox form of mobility?  In League of Legends?  That's heresy.  In all seriousness, this is a sickening amount of mobility.  I like that you went for an idea that sounds cool, and it does sound cool, but when people want to crucify Riven for having 2 mobility abilities this is questionable, which is problematic because it sounds like the heart of the kit.\n\nR - A third mobility ability.  Is there even a champion with 3 abilities that can displace your champion?\n\nPassive: Gives her some movement speed to boot (pun intended).  Just when I thought she wasn't mobile enough.\n\nI hate to put you down considering you put so much effort into this, but it seems to me that everyone is praising this concept simply **because** you put so much effort into it without really considering how hated a kit like this is going to be.  If people want to hang Riven for having 2 mobility skills (I'm aware there are other reasons, but this is a commonly cited one), Ekko for having an overloaded kit, Kalista for jumping all over the place... what are they really going to think of this if it actually goes through?\n\nIf Riot came out with this concept themselves people would be hurling dog sh!t at them for adding more \"OMG FLASHY LCS CHAMPION LMAO\".  Frankly, I just don't understand this fixation people have with really zany kits.  I'd prefer more down to earth, simple kits, that still manage to be robust and difficult to master.

From your comments you seem to want her to be built mostly tanky but she has a large focus on movespeed as well which makes her somewhat butt in on Hec's turf.\n\nI will say that I love the idea of her passive (Though the bonus attack speed is really bad, even a Dagger gives more attackspeed than her fully upgraded boots) and I think something else you could add to it is have it so she gets a bonus effect on them depending on which enchantment she gets or maybe the enchantments have other effects or are boosted.\n\nHer ult is also rather generic, I'd rather see something like her overcharging her boots for a certain duration during which she gains movespeed and an electric field that stuns enemies for half a second (Can only be applied once per enemy) and maybe some sort of damage debuff. Or maybe she gains a running start before slide kicking a long distance, knocking up all enemies she runs into.

Does she get Battery per-level too?\n\nSo suggestions from that:\n\nI don't see the paint as being core enough to her story to justify being a core mechanic to her kit, but I like the way it could play out. Maybe just play it up a bit more in the story, with her painting something before stealing it or something, then it would be more appropriate to take a large focus in her gameplay. For specifics, I would say that tying it to all her CC would be good. For example, her Q would keep the initial dash and knock back, with the damage much more frontloaded than your numbers, then the second kick only goes off on a painted target for a little more damage and the knockup. Her E would slow instead of either the stun or knockup normally, but against a painted target the slow would become a stun. Her ult would be targetted, and would only CC that target unless it was painted, in which case it would knockup in AoE as well. If you combine all of that with a W that has a pretty long cooldown and have it disappear after a CC is applied, but which can be cast even during the animations of her other abilities, then it would keep her from being too strong with chain CC and instead allow her to have very reliable CC popping out of fog of war with a paintball already in the air. It also gives her some more options for how to use it; if she uses it before hitting an ability then she gets CC, but if she gap closes with her high mobility and uses the paintball after, she gets the bonus damage on her auto attacks (more than 4% I recommend) for extra power and can CC later unless the target gets away.\n\n\n\nNow for her story.\n\nTo be blunt, it solves too many problems, and makes up too much information that was previously \"intentionally left mysterious\". Too closely intertwined with Vi's past, which is mysterious and not precisely explained even during the time after she got amnesia (Ekko's interaction quotes seem to indicate she was in Zaun at some point, though Riot hasn't clarified if that's actually the case, or when she left, or if maybe it's just an artifact of their new geography which plans to make Piltover and Zaun become so close together that their suburbs overlap and thus it's reasonable for people from each city to know each other really well...) and they never actually described her as a master mechanic; the only thing she ever built were her gauntlets. I'm guessing Riot already has some sort of plans for \"C\" and having this character be C would throw all of those out the window, and also waste a perfectly good opportunity to have a character with \"master thief\" as a core theme rather than \"kick stuff, disregard authority\". It's also just unnecessary, she's a perfectly fine character without also having her be the best thief ever.\n\nEven beyond all that, the Watchers are still super secret and nobody knows anything about them even within the Freljord. There is literally no reason Caitlyn would know or care about them. I know you didn't mention it in the actual lore and it could just be seen as Caitlyn recruiting a criminal again, but having that as your reasoning behind the recruitment doesn't make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Solidsnipe","date":"2015-09-07T19:03:57.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think i may mean 800 diameter, my bad on that. And i wanted the ult to act as nautilus E but the waves creating the crater would be flash-able if u see it coming. the hard part will be not being in the center of the crater. As for the \"draining,\" Q, E, R all need to be in draining mode for the abilities to work. i have draining scaling on each of those abilities so i thought it would be straight forward, so i'm sorry for the confusion. And yes its 3% hp dmg kind of like Varus's blight dmg. Her auto's get increased dmg and thats where the ability really shines. so building attack speed wouldn't be a bad idea for the abilities dmg. \n\nThe boots are cumulative and per each upgrade so you will have a lot of battery power even after the first 2 buys. you will need to go back and regenerate the battery power when you go to base however. I think i will leave out battery per level because i want there too be some counter play to the boots having a certain supply.  \n\nI like the ideas on the secondary ability effects for painted targets. it could really work with the kit and downplay the excessive CC she has. \n\nAs for the Lore, your right i was trying to solve a lot through my research. i blame the fact that i made multiple champion ideas and i didnt want to let some of the ideas die by picking one champion. The watchers were thrown in because Freljord is so close to piltover i would imagine they would be attacked first. And i wanted to use Caitlyns lore with the \"C\" just to fill out what was left behind, basically giving a purpose to the champion. but i understand your reasoning. It actually does mention in Vi's lore that she is a master mechanic, but only because she stripped hextech hardware during her young life. I created the lore before Ekko even came out so i didnt tie his backstory in because it wasnt relevant when i made the champion around 4 months ago. i also believe there is a river or some body of water that splits the two cities up and thats mainly where the rivalry comes from. The ending of the lore was actually a toss up, i wasnt sure how i wanted to end it and i decided to leave what i had because i had to move on with the character design.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXZAPXx","date":"2015-09-07T13:19:04.011+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls..","replies":[]},{"poster":"CupcakeNinja","date":"2015-09-07T06:11:59.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow... you put ALOT of effort into this.
