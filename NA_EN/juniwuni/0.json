Okay, that's fine, but my internet wasn't down or anything; I made sure and it is working fine and I could load everything. So I tried closing the game then I'd reconnect. The problem with that was I couldn't. The client offered no option to rejoin my game. I restarted the client too thinking that might work; it didn't. Even weirder, I can queue for another game, even though my account should be in a game. A game which as of this post isn't even in my match history. Going to op.gg though, I see that I'm in a game.\r\n\r\nI feel awful that I left my team when we were doing well and I can't even rejoin.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-14T20:21:04.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh it sounds like you might have experienced a game crashing server side. It's pretty rare, but when it happens you won't be able to rejoin since the game no longer exists and you won't get any penalties either. Feel free to requeue!","replies":[]}]}
