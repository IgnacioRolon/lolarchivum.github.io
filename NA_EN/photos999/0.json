Basically in a position where neither gold nor experience, can really change the effectiveness of vision. But as long as one person can buy into the vision game, it's going to continue to remain lopsided. You would have to remove sight stone, (and the eye items), the tracker's knife, and perhaps even the control wards from the shop, and rely exclusively on trinkets. \n\nMost of the other changes to the vision game are predominantly Jungle focused. First we had the Scuttler, then the Raptor smite buff, Now we have a vision plant. Mechanics like these could work when it doesn't require people to invest in a particular way.

If the vision game suddenly falls apart, that would show just how burdened supports are with providing vision for their teams, and the solution should be to make vision more readily available to all players, e.g. by reducing trinket cooldowns, increasing Scryer's Bloom spawns, etc.\n\nThe thing with removing Sightstone in this day and age is that it doesn't actually harm supports: in Season 3, doing so would've been terrible, because supports would go back to dedicating all of their gold and inventory for wards, but now that it's impossible to buy stealth wards in the shop, there is no way they can be forced to burden themselves with more vision than anyone else, bar some far-fetched Smite + Tracker's Knife setup (and even then, removing Tracker's Knife would solve that with minimal issues). If the real issue is that supports lose their identity as \"the vision provider\" (which I think is bullshit, since more often than not it's just another burden on the role), removing Sightstone would still be helpful, since it would clear the way for potentially far more interesting support vision options.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-01-31T14:33:30.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly what i have been saying!\nGlad to see someone else sees where I am coming from with this. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-01-31T07:39:55.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWceUqJY,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2017-01-31T01:34:25.853+0000)\n>\n> but they have tried to change that with free trinkets which no one uses outside of laning phase... and trackers knife which no jungler gets\n\n\nActually, trinkets only made it worse.

But int he short term, add the warding affect on Chilling smite and Challenging smite and remove trackers Knife. Warding , as is, is far more suited to be the primary responsibility of the Jungler both practically and thematically.\nSupports fall behind on exp and what little gold they have by having to roam around clearing and placing wards and are super susceptible to dying out alone since they have little means of fighting back.\n\nNone of these are issues for the jungler who does this innately though their job description and gets exp and gold via jungle camps, and has the primary responsibility of securing objectives as is.\n\nI have played Jungle so many time sand been pissed that i had no means of checking Baron or drag pit due to lack of warding means as well, so much so that I went and got trackers Knife, but then I basically weakened my ganking and dueling power by doing so.\n\nIf Junglers didn't have to choose between Trackers and an actual smite upgrade, this wouldn't be an issue, and since the smite upgrades are tied to Smite and not the item, adding the active poses no issue.\n\nIt would also make it to where more thought goes into warding botlane and the vision game botlane isn't such a crapshoot, and junglers would have to pick between warding offensively or defensively around the map.\n\nAlso, i would finally get to pick Blue trink as support again. Thank god.\n\nSupports would then spend more time doing things like lanign and protecting the team and roaming to sidelanes to help their team, and would be able to do so sooner due to the extra 800g.\n\nInstead of coming back to lane with some HP, i would come back with {{item:3114}}, {{item:3028}}, {{item:3067}}   {{item:3024}} {{item:3108}} {{item:3801}} or {{item:3105}}. \n\nThink about that for a second.\n\nPart of what makes support so unappealing is that the begging stretch of the game feels like you have to pay a fine before you can actually start scaling.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silverjust","date":"2017-01-31T09:55:25.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if the sightstone would be cheaper (only) for supports, and would also give xp while near an ally with more xp.\nThat way you waste less gold and you are not punished for warding by falling behind in xp","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-01-31T14:36:37.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silverjust,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWceUqJY,comment-id=00000000000100000001,timestamp=2017-01-31T09:55:25.729+0000)\n>\n> what if the sightstone would be cheaper (only) for supports, and would also give xp while near an ally with more xp.\n> That way you waste less gold and you are not punished for warding by falling behind in xp\n\nThat seems more like slapping bandaid on the problem tbh.

And i dont mean that in a pessimistic sense. **Support literally exists to be a second class citizen conceptually.**\n\nHighlighted the last part, because that's pretty much the core issue with the support role right now. In a team game where everyone is expected to work with each other, support is pretty much the only position that truly feels like a responsibility more than anything else. Even junglers, who are expected to assist their laners with ganks and buffs, get to feel awesome about their role, because they get unparalleled freedom of movement and a wealth of strategic options right from the get-go. By contrast, supports, who already tend to be the least popular archetype in any multiplayer game, are given the strictest burdens (they _need_ to get Sightstone, plus any other mandatory item _du jour_), the least directly visible impact on the game (they can't really push or control objectives, get kills or farm, and are asked to roam alone to ward and counter-ward), and the least amount of freedom (they're expected to stick to an ally at practically all times, and only break from that when warding).\n\nEffectively, supports are treated like servants, both by players and the developers themselves, when really they should be treated as leaders and commanders. One of the greatest fantasies of supports is that they often hold the power of life and death over their own teammates, and their plays can often influence everyone on both teams at once, and not just take one opponent out of the equation (which is a fantasy for assassins, burst mages, and some tanks). They should be the ones telling others what to do and making proactive strategic decisions, not scapegoats for the rest of their team to bully. Considering how niche supports already are across all games, they really deserve the greatest amount of pampering and privilege, not the least, and it really should not be acceptable to settle on \"just fine\" for them, when their lack of popularity is serious enough to have warranted large-scale changes to the game's queue system. Getting almost invariably autofilled into support is a running joke, but the very reason that is the case is because only relatively few players truly want to support, and the game can't accommodate everyone's wishes without significantly increasing queue times.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ChaddyFantome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWceUqJY,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-31T14:03:13.072+0000)\n> \n> This is untrue. Enchanters actually scale with AP and Wardens would much rather use the slot for an actual tan item.\n\nOn one hand, this is true, supports really do have item scalings now, and in any case it would feel significantly more fun to pick up a proper AP or tank item, rather than a mandatory extra trinket. On the other, supports still don't scale all that well with itemization, and that's an issue that needs to be addressed, not a feature. It's already too easy for supports to feel isolated from the rest of the game, so decoupling them from item-based scaling only makes the problem worse by also excluding them from a power scaling fantasy.\n\nA large issue with making supports scale has been that the stats used for that typically overlap with other classes, i.e. AP for caster supports and mages, and health/resists for tanks, and at this point pretty much every support, and not just Wardens (who are technically also tanks). Considering how supports are expected to work on sub-par gold and experience (also one of the reasons why they feel like a second-class role), any AP or tank item that's designed to be both slot efficient and affordable for them risks being abused by solo laners, as has happened before. Supports really need their own means of scaling, and that will likely require a new stat that specifically boosts their utility. The healing/shielding passive on some items has been a good start, but it's way too overspecialized, since defense is only a small subset of the many forms of utility supports can provide, and piling too much power onto that risks leading to excessive amounts of protection. A more general utility stat would allow supports to have much more of their kits scale, in such a way that most non-supports would likely not find items with the stat especially attractive, which would reduce overlap and abuse potential.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-02-02T03:23:39.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWceUqJY,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-31T21:06:12.723+0000)\n>\n** Effectively, supports are treated like servants, both by players and the developers themselves, when really they should be treated as leaders and commanders.One of the greatest fantasies of supports is that they often hold the power of life and death over their own teammates, and their plays can often influence everyone on both teams at once, and not just take one opponent out of the equation (which is a fantasy for assassins, burst mages, and some tanks).  **\n>They should be the ones telling others what to do and making proactive strategic decisions, not scapegoats for the rest of their team to bully.
