I have been having annoying FPS problems. I'm not sure why.. I use a website sometimes called \"Can You Run It\". It tells you if you can run a game. I checked to see if I could run league and it says maximum. I've been able to run all the graphics on maximum before the new summoners rift and when the new Rift Beta came out i started having problems. I don't know what it is! Even if I turn my graphics all the way down I still have FPS drops. For some reason when I open task manager it says I'm using an insane amount of memory. (look at the linked pic) Ive tried all sorts of stuff including virus scans, Malware scans, Disk cleanup, defraging my computer and allot more. I'm not sure why this is happening. Please help!\r\n\r\nComputer Specs:\r\nProcessor - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3630QM CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\nVideo Card(s) - Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 &amp; NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M\r\nRAM - 8.00GB\r\nTotal Memory - 685.00GB\r\n                         -343.00 Usable\r\nHelp please!

Some people playing on very strong computers are able to maintain a reasonable FPS, and some with very strong computers are hit extremely hard, but overall the FPS has dropped and hit many very hard since patch 4.21.\n\nI just finished a game with bad FPS and graphical glitches, because Riot does not know how to manage their resources and fix things like any other large gaming company would have already. \n\nGG. It'll be years before they get their heads out of their asses.

I have had these problems for a long time, and I don't think Riot will fix it anything soon. There is clearly a problem between NVIDIA graphics and League.","replies":[{"poster":"szz","date":"2015-01-15T00:53:14.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree","replies":[]}]}]}]}
