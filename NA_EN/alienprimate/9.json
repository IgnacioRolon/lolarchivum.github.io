Super good poke and if someone steps on a trap, sion can Q or if Sion lands Q, cait can trap. The reduced armor from sion's E mixed with cait's high early damage makes this lane stupid strong.

It's one of those nasty cheese tactics, where you both start stun, rush to lane and let the death bush begin.  You don't need ignite, though depending on how close to the bush the enemy team walks, one of you might have to flash to get the first stun.  But like any kill lane, if you don't get ahead fast, you can end up being relatively useless.  It's still just soooo fun to play though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2016-12-30T01:29:52.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well since this got necro'd\n{{champion:16}} {{champion:33}} \nSoraka can heal Rammus through whatever poke he takes while he rushes thornmail, then trades pretty much go in his favor as he rushes the ADC and taunts them for fifteen years, making them kill themself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"All Skillzz","date":"2016-12-30T01:22:23.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i faced pre reworked annie+leblanc bot lane.\ndo not need to explain why that worked.\nall i know is i was seeing grey an rushing banshee veil.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Obeify","date":"2016-12-30T01:17:56.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like When my buddy goes Morde support.
