On nearly every single loss, someone blamed my champion choice for our loss.  Meanwhile, likely the same type of person who blames an odd champion for the loss was saying &quot;that&#039;s so op&quot; and &quot;that damage&quot; when I did well and was able to kill them in 4 hits with only a single item.  Sure, I may have had a game with a score of 2/8/0 and 7/9/4 and very well may have been the reason we lost those games, but it wasn&#039;t my champion choice that caused me to lose and I wasn&#039;t trolling.  The enemy was better than me and/or had a champion that countered me so naturally, I lost.  If I troll by picking Taric top and going 2/8/0, you could at least stay consistent and call me a troll when I take Taric mid, forget to buy an item to start because I was requesting a lane swap, and then go 17/8/20.\n\nIf you care to see more stats for these games, here they are.\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2585068747/209287161?tab=overview\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2586376530/209287161?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Firethorn","date":"2017-08-31T05:19:01.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit another fellow taric player! Nice to meet you (unfortunately I don't play Taric top or mid)! I had a similar situation in a ranked game recently, we were starting to lose our lead a bit and my adc (kind of) blamed me for picking taric instead of something like lulu. Still managed to win at the end but I think some people need someone to blame when they start losing. {{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-09-01T00:45:06.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should try him in top some time.
