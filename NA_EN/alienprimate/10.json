I am fine with my placement because I know I will climb easily enough.  It is a simple question.  Why does the system place me in Silver 3 after going 8-2 in placements and then match me with high gold and low platinum anyways?  What is the point of having ranked when the system doesn&#039;t even recognize someone&#039;s rank when placing them in a ranked game?  It seems the only thing they look at when selecting teams is MMR and rank is totally irrelevant.\n\nHere is a list of rankings I have been matched with in my past 4 ranked games.  Note that I am currently silver 1.\n\nSilver 1: 1\nGold 5: 3\nGold 4: 2\nGold 3: 8\nGold 2: 12\nGold 1: 5\nPlat 5: 4\nPlat 4: 1\n\nIf the game matches games based only on MMR and rank is so meaningless then why not just remove ranked and tell everyone their MMR?\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nEdit:  I just did some math and according to that, my MMR places me at gold 3 with 75 ladder points.\n\n1x1/36+2x3/36+3x2/36+4x8/36+5x12/36+6x5/36+7x4/36+8x1/36 = 4.75\n\nThis is also what https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=AlienPrimate places me at.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nEdit 2:  I went duo with someone else who was in silver 2 and started getting matched with high silver/low gold.  I was still getting 27-28 LP for wins and losing 13-14 for losses.  This means that it makes absolutely no difference who you are matched with for how much LP you gain or lose.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-03-27T17:25:45.126+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"My gripe with it is that you can play *against* people you wouldn't be allowed to play *with* if you were creating a party. \n\nIf your MMR is on par with those Plats, why can't you queue up with them after the game?

So as a platinum player, you dominate the low ELO of bronze, well it would kind of suck for everyone else if they kept being placed against someone who SHOULD be platinum. So let's say you play several games and have an MMR of low platinum, now you'll be placed with platinum players and if you win those matches, you can skip up the ladder MUCH faster than normal, skipping from bronze 5-1 is entirely plausible. This makes it so that smurfs and really good player's can get out of games with newer player's faster, therefore making it less likely to make a game unbalanced in low ELO. \n\nWithout MMR every game would give 20-25 LP randomly, making each person have to play atleast 7-8 games in each division, with MMR it's possible to get anywhere from 20-50 LP based on the MMR of the other's you've been fighting against. making it so each person only has to play 5-7 games and doesn't have to go to each division and can skip up several to get where they should be faster.\n\nPS: Skipping works by, i believe, being 200 MMR or more above your current division and passing your promos, you'll skip 1 or more divisions.
