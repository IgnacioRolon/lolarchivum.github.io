What are you smoking?\nEven one stack makes a hugely noticeable difference in damage from combos..\n\nSomething is massively wrong with that math, whoever did the calcs was incompetent. veigar gets 4% more damage, when all his abilities have around 100% AP ratios? That is mathematically impossible.\nA lv18 veigar should have about 1000-1300 AP, even if the 24% bonus is to base AP before deathcap and his passive, it is still a couple hundred more damage per ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Golden Tager X","date":"2016-10-11T20:01:44.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only increases 4 percent because Veigar has such phenomenal base damages.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Muted Summoner","date":"2016-10-11T19:56:17.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mountain allows tanks and supports to deal more damage to objectives.
