The opposite can be said if you build no armor.  Lower armor champions will get destroyed by lethality. \n\nTo understand how lethality works, you have to understand how armor works first.  Armor becomes less effective as more of it is stacked.  The equation for damage reduction for both Magic Resist and Armor is **x/(x+100)**\n\nThis is a table showing damage reduction from each value of armor by increments of 25 armor.\n\nAR = armor\nDR = damage reduction\n%^ = percent change from the previous value\n\n> AR ------------ DR ---------------- %^\n> 0 ------------ 0.0% -------------- N/A\n> 25 ---------- 20.0% ----------- 20\n> 50 ---------- 33.3% ----------- 13.3\n> 75 ---------- 42.9% ------------ 9.6\n> 100 ------- 50.0% ------------ 7.1\n> 125 -------- 55.6% ------------ 5.6\n> 150 -------- 60.0% ----------- 4.4\n> 175 --------- 63.6% ----------- 3.6\n> 200 -------- 66.7% ----------- 3.1\n> 225 -------- 69.2% ----------- 2.5\n> 250 -------- 71.4% ------------ 2.2\n> 275 -------- 73.3% ------------- 1.9\n> 300 -------- 75.0% ------------ 1.7\n> 325 -------- 76.5% ------------ 1.5\n> 350 -------- 77.8% ------------ 1.3\n> 375 --------- 78.9% ----------- 1.1\n> 400 -------- 80.0% ----------- 1.1\n\n\nTo keep things simple I will describe how lethality works at level 18 because lethality scales by level.  At level 18, 1 lethality is equal to 1 armor penetration which lowers the target's armor by 1.  Items with lethality are:\n\n{{item:3134}} 10\n{{item:3814}}  15\n{{item:3147}}  15\n{{item:3142}}  20\n\nWith runes and masteries you can get:\n\nPrecision - 8.4\nMarks - 14.4\nQuints - 9.6\n\nThe highest lethality possible not stacking items is 82.4.\n\nFor the simplicity of not having to make more calculations, I will use 75 lethality as an example to use the chart above.\n\n\n\nMost champions have between 75 and 100 base armor so with 9 armor seals many would have right at 100 at level 18.  This means that building no armor, a lethality stacking assassin would lower the 100 armor to 25 armor changing 50% damage reduction to 20% damage reduction.  **This gives the assassin a 60% damage increase against said champion.**\n\nIf you don't believe me here you go.  Attack does 100 damage, 100 armor reduces that to 50 while 25 armor reduces that to 80. \n\n80/50=1.6\nIf an attack does 50 damage and you get a mastery that increases their damage by 60% you multiply 50 by 1.6 to get 80.\n\nA tank with 300 armor would be reduced to 225.  300 armor gives 75% damage reduction and 225 armor gives 69.2% damage reduction.  With the logic above:\n\n30.8/25 = 1.232\nThey gained 23.2% damage against the tank who already takes less damage than the squishy with 100 armor to begin with who is taking 60% more damage.\n\n**In conclusion, armor not only makes you take less damage from physical attacks as everyone knows, but it also drastically lowers the effectiveness of lethality on top of the damage reduction.\n**\n\nEdit:  A few people have mentioned true damage so I thought I would mention that there is no such thing as doing true damage when reduced below 0 resistance.  If someone is reduced to -30 resistance the formula for damage reduction becomes:\n\n2-30/(100-30) = 57% damage increase.  This damage is not dealt as true damage but rather as increased physical damage.

Also note that Taric's auto attacks do 302 damage and his E does 434 damage before reduction with this build so he is still useful for damage.  Most tanks are still able to do damage with pure armor builds so it doesn't hurt them too much by doing this.","replies":[{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2017-02-10T06:01:54.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to point a few things out.  Armor penetration can never being effective armor below 0.  Only reduction can do that.\nAlso, cleaver applies before LW.  Not sure how that factors in what armor is considered bonus, but you have that backwards on taric's reduction.\nNinja Tabi's passive is not armor, it is an uncounterable damage reduction, whereas armor is highly counterable.\nAnd last, don't look at an auto as part of a champion's total hp if you're looking at armor in a vacuum.  Health stacking is not armor stacking.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-02-10T07:32:47.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would also like to point some things out.  Lethality brought the armor below 0.\nIt makes no difference on the end result which applies first between LW and cleaver.\nNinja tabi wasn't reduced by anything, that is the 0.88 in the calculation for Talon's damage.\nHealth has nothing to do with this post.  The point was that even though Talon has the most armor shred he can possibly get, he will only do about 4% of Taric's total health in damage on an attack which is basically nothing.  This whole post was to show the extreme polar opposites of low armor vs high armor against a full armor shred build.  If you build full armor against an ad team you will take far less damage.  I'm sick of seeing people say that armor doesn't matter with all the armor shred items.  Armor will always be the best stat against AD because the fact that damage reduction can go negative and become damage amplification with enough lethality on the enemy.\n\nIf they didn't have the armor shred then building 6 armor items would be pointless as it gets weaker and weaker the more of it is stacked.  Health or damage is a better option in that case.","replies":[{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2017-02-10T13:54:46.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, you just defended a decent post that needed some revising with one that doesn't mean anything.\n\nIgnoring the ninja tabi and dominick's health passives, which have nothing to do with armor, Taric has an 8.27 effective health multiplier.\nI'll start with the reduced armor values.  727 * .7 (cleaver) = 509 armor.\nI believe that base armor is static so 509 - 83 = 426 bonus armor.\n426 * .55 = 234 bonus armor left after LDR, leaving 317 total armor.\n317 - 82 lethality = 235 armor, and a 3.35 effective health multiplier.\n3.35 / 8.27 = .4 \nTaric is only 40% as tanky as he would be if not for penetration.  Sure, he is still more than 3x as tanky as he would be if he had 0 armor, but he devoted his entire build to armor and he could be more than 8x as tanky.  His entire build is almost completely devalued.  The counter to raw damage is armor, but the counter to armor is armor shred, which is extremely easy to build.  Taric doesn't nullify any of talon's stats, but Talon nullifies more than half of Taric's.  And considering that any amount of armor only slows damage dealt, damage which always wins over time is just sped up.\n\nOrianna's is pretty simple.  Lethality alone penetrates 100% of her armor (lethality can never make a target's armor effectively negative), so her effective health multiplier is 1 instead of 1.68.  She is 60% as tanky as she would be without the arpen, and not a single bit of gold in her build is wasted.\n\nThe problem with armor penetration now is that it stacks so well with itself that it hurts supertanks more than it does squishies.\n\nAlso, armor does not get weaker as you stack more of it.  That's a misconception that I thought you would know, seeing that you wrote a page-long post about it.  The more armor you have, the more efficient building health is, but the stat itself does not get any weaker.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Backup4now","date":"2017-02-10T04:06:33.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, this person actually took the time to learn the maths.
