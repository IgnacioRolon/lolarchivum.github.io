Items begin dropping across the Crystal Scar at random using a gold value described later.  This could be a recode of Zoe&#039;s W where a bubble is on the ground of random items and anyone can pick them up that is then equipped for 1 minute or until the player dies.  The timer resets upon getting a kill or assist.  An item can be dropped by clicking on the icon on the bar and dragging it to the ground where it keeps its duration from when you had it.  There are 2 purposes to this.  This allows people to trade items to champions on their team who are better suited to use them or make room for a 7th item that they want.\r\n\r\nItem drops function as follows.  Items at the start of the game drop from a gold value of 0-500.  The minimum grows by 25 and the maximum grows by 50 every 30 seconds.  At 5 minutes the range is 250-1000, 10 is 500-1500, 15 is 750-2000, 20 is 1000-2500, and so on.  This puts the time to find a Triforce at 32.5 minutes at which time the value for the minimum stops growing at 1625 gold.\r\n\r\nItems always drop in the same spots in a similar way to how Mario Kart functions.  Just the item dropped is random.\r\n\r\nCapturing the shrines turns them into a boot shrine where stepping on them automatically equips anyone (both teams) with boots.  At 10 minutes the person who captured the shrine can chose which type of tier 2 boot it provides.\r\n\r\nThe center boss fight is easier than Xerath in ascension to accommodate a lack of items.  The buff that is dropped by the boss is to make items not expire until death.\r\n\r\nDrop frequency would be up for debate after testing.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-16T01:53:15.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically Ascension.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-01-16T07:38:20.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So URF is basically normal and DOTA is basically LoL...","replies":[]}]}]}
