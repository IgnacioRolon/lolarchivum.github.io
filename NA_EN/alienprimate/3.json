That's the decider. If it were really as skewed against Zed as you say, he would constantly be underperforming. But that's simply not the case because his mobility can overcome most threats.","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2018-12-16T08:00:38.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"REALLY depends on the players you are against.
