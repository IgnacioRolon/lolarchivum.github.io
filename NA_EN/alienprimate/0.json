This glitch makes it so I can't use any skills with keyboard shortcuts and have to click on them with my mouse to use them.  This just seemed like an issue with my keyboard at first so I thought nothing of it until it happened over and over again on different champions using different abilities even on different game modes.  I already tried the standard fixes of repairing and reinstalling.  I messed with it a bit and here is everything I have found out about it.  \n\n* This occurs completely randomly and seems to happen about 25% of the time\n* Quitting and rejoining from the client used to work but now I have to completely close and relog to fix it\n* Champion choice doesn't matter\n* Skill choice doesn't matter\n* Map doesn't matter\n* Using spacebar to lock/unlock screen works (this is set to \"Y\" as default)\n* Self casting using alt + skill works\n* Escape brings up the menu\n* Tab brings up scoreboard\n* If I self cast an ability while using a different ability that it isn't possible to self cast simultaneously, they will both activate.  This is the only way I have found to get them to work and was done by self casting Taric's W and using E at the same time.\n* No item actives work except the one I have linked to mouse button 4\n* Ping hotkeys (V and G) do not work\n* Recall using B does not work\n* Shift+right click for attack move click works\n* A for auto attacking does not work\n* Trying to change keybindings will only work if I use a combination of keys like alt+Q or a mouse button\n* I have lost 100% of the 10 games or so this has happened to me in and I will probably get punished by LeaverBuster pretty soon\n\nHelp on fixing this issue whether it is technical or through the server would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T22:44:19.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your config files might have gone a little screwy somehow, and each time you login the client grabs the screwy files again which overwrites any changes you made.
