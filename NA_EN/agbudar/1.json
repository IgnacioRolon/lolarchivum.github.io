Force him to trade and he will push the lane, all his abilities except his ult deal damage to multiple targets. Eventually he will push and just call for a gank, there is not much he can do. Dont let him hit you and poke him while his passive is down or low, his abilities cost health so until he gets WotA (or i guess Gunblade but i dont like that item on him) he cant do anything about being poked. Bait his ult then flash or dash (or just walk) away and he doesnt have his ult anymore and there is nothing he can do about it.  \n\nTo counter these weaknesses he is given damage (it was a lot in his heyday but now it isnt worth much) that is easy to hit. So if you do nothing about him he will push you to your turret and kill you at the same time without you being able to do anything about it. If you dont know how to deal with Morde then you are going to get crushed even by someone using him for the first time.  \n\nNeither of these promote healthy gameplay, either you are miserable or your enemy is miserable.  \n\nAs for building on Morde, building him tanky means he does like no damage, building him full AP could either work really well or you die instantly. I usually rush Will of the Ancients, it stops him from losing health and if you hit a big wave of minions you gain some back. After that, depending on whether im losing or winning ill get DFG or Visage/Zhonya's, obviously depends on who you fight. Then Rylais because its hilarious... Then Rabadons (sometimes ill build WotG then DFG then Deathcap then Rylais, the order depends on the game).

A champion that gets played a lot and really needs a visual upgrade is particularly significant - since they're in games a lot they'll be seen a lot and therefore contribute substantially to the overall average visual quality of the game. Tristana's a good example of this - she's a popular character, who's also really easy to acquire (Facebook or 1350IP), with quite a few visual/audio upgrade needs.   \n\n\n**How problematic is this champion's gameplay?**\n\nChampions with a lack of counterplay, that result in degenerate lane picks, that suppress interesting play etc can be rework priorities because they make the game worse overall. Xerath and Soraka are good examples of this category.\n\n\n**How much untapped potential does this champion have?**\n\nThese are characters with cool themes that aren't properly executed on, unsatisfying kits etc. Stuff that could be really cool, but isn't, usually for a number of reasons (gameplay+aesthetics+personality for example).

In my opinion Urgot's kit is very fun and there is a lot of potential with item, ability synergies and combos. If played right he is a very good lane bully and can definitely do well late game. You say here that you would like to make some adjustments to this champion so I think this is a good opportunity for me to voice my opinion\n\nI asked a bunch of league players why they don't want to play Urgot. Most people have said that it is because he looks ugly. A visual change to him to make him look more fancy and/or have more flashy abilities with perhaps contrasts of blue would be quite nice and could encourage people to play him. Something to make his play style more pronounced.\n\nWhen it comes to updating his skill set I really do not think it needs changing like Sion's did as it could potentially break the champion. He is one of the best lane bullies and also a great duelist; playing against him is quite a unique experience especially if you do not have mobility or sustain. If you are going to change anything please keep that in mind. Perhaps his role needs to be made more clear to the players so that after trying him they will not get discouraged (likewise with Yorick he has a lot of potential but people do not know how to play as him resulting in them giving up on further attempts).\n\nWhen it comes to re-balancing so that he can fit in more with the current meta I would say that his E (Noxxian Corrosive Charge) should make enemies visible for the duration since the Q (Acid Hunter) locks on no matter what even when the enemy is stealth. Having the champion visible would be a nice buff so that the player won't have to be guessing where to put his mouse when he uses his Q. In team fights his job is to focus high priority targets so perhaps more burst synergy with his ultimate would be nice on top of the current additional armor and magic resist (perhaps the ultimate could apply the same effect as the Noxxian Corrosive Charge).\n\nIn conclusion, Urgot is a viable champion in the current meta and the changes that are made I suggest small utility tweaks being added to his kit. He should definitely receive a skin update but his main role of a lane bully should remain unchanged as it is quite unique and interesting in the way it is executed. Thanks for reading and please don't break the champion.

And I sure as hell am certain that Urgot doesn't need one.\n\nUrgot is extremely fun to play. It's not a point and click champion, which was the reason that Riot gave when they were justifying reworking Sion, and Ryze and Warwick.\n\nAnd being fun isn't the only reason that justifies him not needing a \"complete relaunch\".\nFirst of all, he only needs balance changes. When he was released he was super strong, and there is a middle term between broken and garbage.\nAnd the most important reason for Urgot not need a rework is: \"RIOT has to STOP treating Urgot like an ADC!\"\n\nIf you keep trying to balance a champion to do something he isn't supposed to do, of course you'll fail. It would be the same thing as putting Gnar in bot lane, tag him as \"marksman\", and then complaining he just gets wrecked by other ADCs and thinking he needs a rework.\nUrgot isn't an ADC, and I don't understand why can't Riot realize that. Riot realized Teemo wasn't an ADC a while ago, even though he's tagged as \"marksman\", which made it possible for him to be balanced, because he stopped being looked at as being matched up against an ADC in lane.\n\nAlso, about Xerath: I played Xerath since I started playing the game. I did nothing but play Xerath for my first year of this game. I loved it, I got his two skins, and when he got reworked, my skins never saw the light of day again.\nIt looked boring before testing it, but I didn't want to complain without trying him out, but after a week of playing new Xerath, I confirmed my suspissions. Xerath became just straight up boring, no other word to describe him.\nAnyone that has fun playing new Xerath, I'm happy for you, but I'm certain you never tried, or at least played well, the old Xerath.\n\nI don't approve of reworking champions, but I understand Riot's point about it, and I accepted it. But what I don't understand is why they rework champions that are 2 years old and have nice mechanics, to leave the ones they hate (the point and click ones) wondering around for ages.\nAnd I say this because I know about the plans of reworking champions like Fiora and LeBlanc. And while Fiora, even though not old, is a bit of point and click with no counterplay, I absolutely don't understand the idea behind LeBlanc rework.\nLeBlanc is one of the most highly mechanical champions, which although strong, is not broken. Especially after the silence was removed.\nThere is absolutely no reason to rework LeBlanc, but, and every time I say this it pains me a little, but I've got used to these non-sense ideas from Riot.

His ganks are quite good pre 6 even if you just use the Q for the slow/flash burn, and after 6 you can just gank from any angle.\nGp is just a ball of stats (movespeed and attack spped boost, crits, poke until you run out of mana) and generally he has little counterplay so he needs a rework.\nYorick needs the rework because as he is he is harmful for the game. He wins almost any lane with endless poke and sustain and you can't do anything about it resulting in a bad experience for his enemy and a boring lane for Yorick. Then comes lategame and if the enemy wasn't braindead and didn't die to a poke champ Yorick will be useless since all he has is 1v1 endless poke/sustain.\nI think Eve is problematic because her invisibility forces her enemies to play a lot more passively since she could gank any moment, so if she is strong enough she will be pick or ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Zamiake","date":"2015-01-16T13:17:54.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On your points to eve i dont think that is true. All u need is to buy a vision ward cause it has true sight and place it allong the paths that get to your lane. If both an adc and support buy one and place in both bushs to their lane then she will be seen. Also they never expire unless they are destroyed. In the long term those maybe cheaper then norma wards to counter her. Its only if they are dumb enough ot only get standard wards is she a problem. Also she has a certain range that is longer then her engagable range that reveals her to all enemy champions.\n\nThe only way you wont see her is if you just arent paying attention","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-01-14T05:44:39.500+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=agbudar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qe7EEFPo,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-14T01:58:22.144+0000)\n>\n> and not the unpopular ones like {{champion:6}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} \n\nZillean is still a good pick, he was a pretty priority pick s4 competitive play.
