Sure, someone who is in lane can grab smite, but without actively killing jungle monsters, the extra gold is relatively useless. It's a complex issue for sure, but I do hope a reasonable solution is created. \n\nThe other issue with this is: When supports get reasonable gold, what's going to prevent them from just rolling into another carry?

The reason people don't like the role as much is because it's 10x's harder to carry as a support than it is any other lane, so it'd be nice if it felt like maybe we had more a One-Man impact on the game than what we have now; which in most cases is sitting back hoping you feed your laner or pray laning phase ends quickly so you can go support the best off person on your team. And if they're all doing bad? Well.. just wtf lol \n\nIdk if the solution to this is letting supports farm more, but I do think there should at least be more gold generation in some manner for supports. I honestly feel all of the starting options are sub-par in regards to gold, one way or another, unless it's {{item:3301}} but who wants to give up the shared minions on {{item:3097}} (with it's later active) or the aggro gold from {{item:3303}} with it's possible actives as well.\n\nI feel like this is comparable to raising the minimum wage of supports LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnart Even Close","date":"2017-01-01T09:26:05.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that would be the best path to take, since it would mean it would eat into the gold income of other team members.  I think a better path would be looking to give them more power out of champion combat, namely taking objectives.  Supports really can't do anything like take jungle monsters or kill towers.  The only thing they can do is buff their allies.  This takes away agency from the support player, which is part of why it is so unsatisfying to play.  Another important step would be to push the vision game further into a teamwide task rather than focusing so heavily on the support role.  Removing the requirement to purchase Sighstone as well could help, considering it eats up 800 gold of an already limited budget.\n\nThat being said, giving supports some ability to clear waves isn't a bad idea.  It's kind of sad watching supports try to fight off waves by themselves and be unable to turn them back.  Similar wave clear ability to many tank top laners would be plenty sufficient.  Not enough that they start eating up waves, but just enough that they feel like a champion and not a heal / CC bot.\n\nIt's kind of a shame that supports don't take part in the last-hitting mini-game, since it adds a ton of depth to the laning phase.  They get other jobs though, and I think that having a lane role without last-hitting is important.  Each role should feel meaningfully different.  Top lane is a more passive and typically tanky 1v1 lane, mid is a high damage squishy 1v1 lane, ADC is a low experience but high gold income high-damage ranged 2v2 lane, support is a low-resource utility heavy 2v2 lane, and jungle is a PVE and map pressure focused role.  Each role is very distinct (top and mid are the most similar, but play very differently and typically have very different roles), catering to different types of players.  Those who love tanks play top, jungle, and support; and among those, there are different options based on if you prefer a 1v1, PVE and roaming, or a completely supportive role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2017-01-01T00:21:35.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe an Item or even a new champion with a mechanic that allows them to farm then pass gold onto others?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlytherinUmbreon","date":"2016-12-31T21:11:18.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But at the same time, it feels soooo good when you actually manage to cs well with one of them\nhttp://pm1.narvii.com/5773/8b51fbbfddc90c1c462b3c0a75d15db6c6d7174e_hq.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2016-12-31T07:44:46.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3060}} : Notice me {{champion:98}} pai","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-12-31T16:08:15.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:98}} *Ignoring intensifies*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-12-31T02:53:00.254+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":">so how about we give supports more ways to contribute in their ability to control lanes.\n\nIf you can't do this as a support, _you're doing it wrong._\nGood support champions can help the team tremendously without being reliant on gold.

It is an issue where Top lane tanks and supports are very similar.  The thing separating them is Top lane tanks tend to get more waveclear/damage than supports, So when supports that can already fulfill their own role get the damage to clear waves they become pretty monstrous top lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2016-12-31T08:47:01.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3302}} \n\n:^)","replies":[{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2016-12-31T08:54:07.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is that you still need a team mate for that","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2016-12-31T09:34:49.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But you're support, meaning you should be with an adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-12-31T14:45:33.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No the support shouldn't be with the ADC all the time... that would be a waste of time as the ADC can manage by themselves at times and the support can do other more useful things","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2016-12-31T21:51:34.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be with an adc early* then stick with whoever.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2016-12-31T03:30:41.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/why-you-took-all-the-kills-because-i-need-items-to-support-you-adc-support-johnny-depp-meme.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Möral Support","date":"2016-12-31T03:47:53.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JZ Jora,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=N2eVbnb5,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-12-31T03:30:41.901+0000)\n>\n> http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/why-you-took-all-the-kills-because-i-need-items-to-support-you-adc-support-johnny-depp-meme.jpg\n\n(Lux)","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-12-31T07:10:11.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naw, see the Lich?

Put that as their number for CS so it emphasizes not taking gold from carries/jungle.. This along with rewarding it at a certain milestone, would be a pretty cool effect i think for a support role. Id get behind something like that...
