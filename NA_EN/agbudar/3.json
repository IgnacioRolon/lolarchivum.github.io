I think Teemo has the potential to be far more toxic than any of the champions you listed but Riot purposely keeps him in an unviable state.

He is \"The Swift Scout\" but in my opinion he really lacks the most important part of being a \"scout\", which is escapability. In my opinion the problem is an identity crisis with his passive and shrooms. \n\nHis passive: The attack speed buff is unnecessary in my opinion and I would prefer movement speed and tenacity instead.\n\nHis shrooms: I would rather have reduced damage in favor of more utility.  The increased range on shrooms was nice because I could toss into bushes safer, not so much because I could throw into team fights.  Right now I don't feel there is a balance between the utility and ward aspect of his shrooms and the team fight usefulness.  I would rather see the shrooms _**deal**_ _**less damage to enemy champions**_, deal _more damage to minions_, _apply a stronger slow_, and _apply a reduction to incoming damage_. \n\nThis allows Teemo to kite better, run faster, escape easier and deal less damage which in my opinion is far more consistent with the \"scout\" title.  \n\nI can happily go into more detail if prompted.
