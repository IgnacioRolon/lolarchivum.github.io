The light that hits the face should reflect from surfaces and still give a hint of light, only a mask behaves like a hole because the eye is behind.\r\n2. Graves theme doesnt fit with a white glove, plus the lines hint at his hand.\r\n3. A cracked eye on the weapon to hint us on the Jhin splash art?\r\nAnd the last one, why I fliped it, was because on his splash art he is in a mirror, hinting to us maybe that we should actually mirror this and flip it?\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? I heard Riot has a way of flipping things up with those things.","replies":[]}
