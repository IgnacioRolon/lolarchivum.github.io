(Those with full health won&#039;t be stunned.)\r\n- Yellow snow, slows enemies for 50% in an area around you. (Poros get scared too...)\r\n- Make a snowman. It requires 3 snowballs and after it&#039;s complete, it comes to life to attack enemies. Enemies can destroy it with one snowball if the snowman is not complete, if the snowman is complete, it requires two shots.\r\n\r\nThe map would look like an arena with not to many places to dodge. It will be decorated, seasonal songs, small Poros are gathered around to watch it, like in the old times when people went to the Arena! But, here everyone is happy, no one is hurt, they go back to clean the snow and come back.\r\n\r\nWatch out, some of the crowd might throw biscuits at the Poros! (Extended time with no food makes a Poro hungry.)\r\n\r\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e4/LoL_Facebook_Icon_14.gif/revision/latest?cb=20161029213743","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T01:21:39.639+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yoooooooo I've never been more excited about a player idea before xD!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-11-06T01:23:55.155+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"username checks out lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2017-11-06T01:36:51.260+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Oh god, he's coming towards us, probably to talk about Poro's again\" - Group of Staff\nBroporo:\n\"Guys, you're going to want to sit down for this one.\"\n https://i.giphy.com/media/3We9ZidJYMcVy/giphy.gif\n*Staff which was already sitting does nothing*","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T03:11:09.852+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who said you could use candid pics of me?!\n\nEDIT: This is precisely what happens every day.
