With targeted ranged abilities this functions the same as well, if Teemo Q's you right before you back, the Q will eventually hit you. If your Evelynn though and you E someone who becomes Stealthed or you Lose Vision while the E is coming out(she has a .25 second cast time on her E) the damage will not go through but the ability will also not go on cooldown. The same thing happens with all Targeted melee abilities, Darius R is a much more frustrating example, lose vision when performing a Melee targeted ability and you lose out on all the damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Ryden l","date":"2018-11-05T19:28:34.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bay B,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8EmUseKB,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-11-05T18:53:59.734+0000)\n>\n> My question then would be why when recalling, if someone autos you as you recall to base, the auto will follow you to the base?

Riot has instated a specific time window that determines whether or not damage will prevent the recall. I think it's also a 0.1 second window. Or 0.25 seconds. \n\nThey even made it public at one point because it has caused such an uproar in worlds 2015 in a Fnatic match where some instances damage stopped a back and instances of damage DIDN'T Stop the back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-05T20:16:57.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did he lose vision? he is in the bush?\nEdit: I now know this is Akali and its stupid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2018-11-05T17:30:33.522+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xaya’s Ult makes her untargetable.

My opinion (only an opinion) is that invisibility should be that and that only, invisibility. What does that mean? It means while invisible, you are immune to all targeted abilities, simply because you can't be targeted. With that said, if you're targeted before you are invisible, you technically were targeted BEFORE you we're invisible, therefore going invisible shouldn't cancel it because despite the animation time the ability was triggered before invisibility was implemented. The idea that it has the power to CANCEL abilities like it's CC seems outright ridiculous.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ez mental boom","date":"2018-11-05T18:55:04.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know you can link timestamps, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-11-06T13:43:02.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or use the handy trim tool","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l Ryden l","date":"2018-11-05T18:06:04.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens to a lot of basic attacks as well.
