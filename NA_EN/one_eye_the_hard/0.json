My apologies and please move the thread to the correct place. I received an email this morning saying my account was banned for using 3rd party malicious software. The thing is, I haven't logged in and played a game in months! This is definitely concerning, as I have credit card info on my account. I just now logged in and sure enough, account PERMANENTLY suspended. This needs to be fixed","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T21:00:30.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I'm looking over your account and it looks like someone other than yourself was able to get access and login without you knowing. Reach out to our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) by choosing \"I need help recovering my account\" and once you verify yourself as the account creator, we should be able to help out.","replies":[{"poster":"One Eye The Hard","date":"2017-08-14T12:34:46.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"One Eye The Hard","date":"2017-08-13T17:47:37.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clarify. I have never given my password to anyone and I have never followed a link from any email from Riot, fake or otherwise. I have a second account that I have since logged into and changed the password. Still though, the account that was banned was my main account. I have a ton of champs unlocked and have poured a ton of money into the account.","replies":[]}]}
