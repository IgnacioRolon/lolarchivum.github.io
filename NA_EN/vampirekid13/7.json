The only place it may exist is in your mind.\n\nI understand your frustration I really do, but kda and kill participation is not everything. If you are putting up those stats then you are doing some things right. Just looking at your last loss of 7-2-21, yea your k/d/a looks amazing. But in the end you still lost. Maybe you got caught out? Maybe you starting  team fights with no teammates around? To be honest I think your biggest problem is your build.\n\nNow keep in mid, I no longer play {{champion:32}} jungle. I don't really play any tank jungles anymore. I main {{champion:60}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:254}} jungle. But the concept of jungling stays the same. Now this account I ranked to gold maining support earlier this season so don't look up my stats on here. But I just recently hit gold on this account http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=smalltomahawker maining jungle.\n\n I understand {{item:3027}} is the new item for ap tank junglers so that is probably fine. But your other items are {{item:1402}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3512}}. Now there is probably nothing wrong with zz rot but I personally feel {{item:1402}} & {{item:3151}} are poor choices. yes... they provide great damage. But {{champion:32}} is all about getting in the face of the enemy, ulting, and then being a tanky ass unkillable machine. At least that is how I used to play him and it seemed to work great. I just personally enjoy playing bruiser junglers more currently.\n\nMy {{champion:59}} record = 20W 6L = 77% win.\n\n{{champion:254}} 19W 9L = 68% win. \n\nI actually played jungle {{champion:57}} earlier this season and my record 19W & 7L = 73% win. \n\nThe reason my account has so many games played on it is I use the account for playing dynamic queue with silver friends. I got sick of being in silver though so been playing more solo games. Anyways, the point is I am no pro or even that good at the game or jungling. But I did learn the game well enough to continuously play the game around a gold level. Once you understand the game at a certain level, you should be able to rank up to that level no matter what. I don't find jungling or playing other roles in silver difficult anymore because I understand the game better than the average silver player. While players chasing kills I am pushing lanes, taking objectives. I wait to initiate a fight until my team is ready to fight not just at random sporadic moments. \n\nYour other problem is probably ganking too much and not farming enough. I realized recently that I tried ganking wayyyyy too much rather than focusing on farming and leveling up. Ganking is great if their is a gank open and you can get the kill or the assist. But if you keep ganking and neglect covering lanes, fully clearing your jungle, pushing open lanes then you fall behind in levels and in gold. I am still not great at this, but I focused on farming more and only ganking at opportune times and my win percentage has increased drastically. \n\nTrust me, ranking up is difficult but focus on improving and learning the game more and it gets easier. In the past I thought it was impossible to get past silver 2. Now I realize how silly those thoughts were. I focused on improving and learning the game more and now I have three accounts in gold when I used to think reaching gold was impossible. And I know if i want to keep ranking up then the only way is by continuing to improve.\n\nI wish you the best on your future climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Commbustion","date":"2016-08-22T15:34:51.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My build is great for this elo, since I have to make up for damage and I still tank really hard, I also need the zzrot because If you push out a lane for 3 seconds your whole team will die because bad players will just go in outnumbered.\nI also need to gank a lot due to low elo. If I don't get then all lanes will feed. So I put them all ahead. I also find time to farm at the same time though.\nI've gotten caught out 1 time in my past 30 or so games and it was due to me trying to defend our adc that wouldn't leave a bad situation. Besides that I never get caught.\nIn team fights I either peel for my adc if he's fed and is good or what I usually do is I distract and force 2 to 3 people out of the fight And if they step up I can just drain a couple of them if they're squishy.

That's where your skill is shown, but with a shit team that keeps going in outnumbered and getting picked off so there's barely any teamfights it gets kinda hard when your team won' take in advice and they suck dick :/.

As far as the {{champion:32}} jungle build your running I am sure it can work and it looks like it has been. You been winning over 60% of your games as him so I would keep playing him. I still suggest farming a little more and not caring as much about kills assist early on. Not really sure how quick {{champion:32}} can clear the jungle these days as I have not played him in awhile. \n\nYou notice yourself going on long losing streaks? One thing I did over the last year is I stopped getting super tilted. Don't get me wrong I still get mad, frustrated, etc. but if I am feeling that way or lose 2 ranked games in a row I take a break. Its just not worth playing more until your head is back to level. Following my 2 losses in a row = break rule has helped me out a lot this season. The only time I have gone on a fairly long losing streak is when playing with friends. And that is just because spamming games all day with friends even though I know we getting tilted and whatever. In reality we should take breaks but sometimes we don't and then the 6-7 game losing streaks happen and you have that much more ground to regain the next time you play. \n\nI guess that is the nice thing about having multiple accounts now. If i get tilted but still want to play I just jump on another account and it makes the next game feel more fresh and I am not as distracted by the last game. \n\nYou have two choices my friend. Keep blaming the system and your teammates or just accept it for what it is. Your silver 3 playing with the average player base. Yea... some players good some players suck but in the end that's what you going to experience at all ranks. Some players have bad games, some troll, some d/c, some are boosted, etc. You just have to forget about that and focus on the game at hand and trying to do everything you can to win. Once you accept climbing is up to you and focusing on improving you can start playing at your full potential. It might take some time, or you might you just start playing much better and fly through gold to plat or even diamond. I know I am a slow learner so the process has taken me a long time, but other players seem to adapt quickly and can rank up quicker. \n\nBelieve me or don't that is up to you.

But if you are really 17/2 and still lose, something really bad happened. Either the enemy team outplayed you in a late game teamfight and ended up pushing to win on an incredible/lucky ace, or someone else (or multiple people) on your team fed pretty fkin hard. 17/2 means that not only are you getting a shitload of gold, but you also aren't giving it back by letting the enemy team get shutdown gold. Sure, maybe they got it twice, but with 17 kills that shutdown gold won't give them the edge they need to take you down. Another thing that is very likely is that there are also at least some assists with those 17 kills. It's actually kind of difficult to singlehandedly score every kill in the game, so it's like that if you really are dominating this hard, you have some assists where your teammates managed to score the last hit, and they probably have some assists on your kills as well. Bottom line is this: 90% of the time or more, if you have a KDA like this, you deserve the win, and losing is usually due to a fuck up on your team (usually 1 or more people that are not carrying their weight, resulting in roughly equal team gold).\n\nAlso, and this is very important: NEVER ACTIVELY TRY TO DONATE KILLS. THIS IS HOW YOU LOSE GAMES IN SOLO QUEUE. Unless you are in voice chat, just try to secure the kill. If you see a dot on the enemy, sure you can off and let your teammate get it, but unless you are 110% sure that the enemy is going to die, take the kill. Better to \"kill steal\" and have your ally get the assist then the enemy getting away. Also, there's something to be said about carrying the game on your own, especially in lower elos. If you believe you are good and that you belong in higher elo,  take the kills, take the cs, get all the gold, and carry the game solo while your teammates support you. That is how pro players get out of low elo on their smurfs.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-08-23T15:15:09.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well 90% is in low elo and 90% doesn't understand  the game. \nEven in my elo... sadly. \nBut many players in silver and gold do a teamfight, win and then walk from mid to top, bot or jungle and farm. \nWhen mid tier 1 turret still stands. \nThey do that 3 times until the enemy team scaled and starts to win fights. \nImagine he is a leblanc mid (early to midgame champ, snowballer) and his team totally refuses to push or take objectives? What are u going to do? \nTry to reason and talk to them or u can just watch how the enemy outscales you and win eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-08-23T20:34:47.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've just proven my point though with that leblanc example. Lb cant take objectives solo, and it's not even that weird to see an lb with a score like this. In fact, this is exactly what she is designed to do. So if you do this as lb, you are doing your job 100%, and your team is failing to pull their weight.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2016-08-23T04:21:04.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once went 12-4 and lost because I was Riven (I roamed but team didn't push or go for objectives after we killed their laners) and the enemy team focused me down in team fights.
