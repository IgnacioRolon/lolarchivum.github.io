Many people understand the humour and get it, but others not so much. Just wondering why that is?\r\n\r\nWhy are some people missing such a key part of personality. \r\n\r\nThe entire point of me posting anything that sounds &quot;thirsty&quot; is to get attention. Why? To play some games of league with. If you open up my posts because you are drawn in because of that, its obviously working. Marketing my friends. \r\n\r\nPlease if you have only negative things to say, refrain from replying to my posts that I make.\r\n\r\nI know what I am doing. \r\n\r\nThank you for listening to my little rant &lt;3. \r\n\r\nxoxo.
