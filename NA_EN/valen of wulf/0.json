I just had a match as Anivia and I noticed that any form of movement CC (knock up/knock back) canceled her ult. Her ult isn&#039;t a channel, though. So, is this intended or a bug on her part? I&#039;m thinking it has something to do with her passive if it isn&#039;t a bug, but I&#039;m not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-07-02T00:23:23.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia's ultimate automatically cancels if she exits range, reactivates her ultimate, runs out of mana, or is hit by any CC that would normally cancel channels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-07-02T04:27:24.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakojo","date":"2015-07-02T11:09:38.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p2INTpob,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-02T04:27:24.736+0000)\n>\n> That's working as intended.\n\nWhich is dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"M Schumacher","date":"2015-07-02T11:12:16.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jakojo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p2INTpob,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-07-02T11:09:38.766+0000)\n>\n> Which is dumb.\n\n{{champion:50}} gets to use his ult thru {{item:3157}} though cause ya know, reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-07-02T16:51:53.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult isn't a channel spell lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hibernis","date":"2015-07-02T10:06:16.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.
