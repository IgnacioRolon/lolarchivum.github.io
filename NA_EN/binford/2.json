Because i don't know if it's the problem with my cpu or location because as soon the servers moved to Chicago my ping improved greatly with me playing on 39 avg ping but after some maintenance updates in the past few patches or so Im ping has completely gone off the wall as of late","replies":[{"poster":"karuaan","date":"2016-09-26T05:50:08.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same issue!

As a first step, I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are good to go.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
