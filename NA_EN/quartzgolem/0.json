Sadly, it seems Riot needs that extra two dollars from your wallet for a 1980 x 1980 pixel art that took some guy maybe ten minutes to make.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-20T17:18:39.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a free icon on the website, why are you all complaining?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PUCK73","date":"2017-01-20T17:02:49.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not even 10 minutes they can do what they did with the first and second season and just recolor teemo and call it something else, Hell they could make 10 in 10 minutes seriously!","replies":[]},{"poster":"10SaeKki","date":"2017-01-19T20:36:39.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2017-01-19T20:32:33.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best guess would be that the icon that you can get for free on the event site is the replacement for this event. For Snowdown, the cheapest icon was worth 6 Snowdown Sweets if I remember correctly and the sweets could be bought for 200 ip each, so the cheapest Snowdown icon was worth 1300 ip and the Lunar Revel icon is free.","replies":[]}]}
