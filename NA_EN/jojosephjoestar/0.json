After a certain amount of time away from the match, the system would have flagged you as AFK since you were not there to help your team during the match. Even if your team pulls through and wins the match, it will be counted as a loss for you since you were not technically in the game. There's not much we can do here about blackouts in your area, since there's not a way for us to predict those kinds of things.","replies":[]}]}
