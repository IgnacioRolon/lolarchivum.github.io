I searched around and could not find an answer that fixed my problem. I check the account purchase history nothing besides the Anivia I bought on 7/30/16. I tried to restart the client, play a game, buy something small as suggested by a rioter in another post but nothing happened. Please help because it took a lot of time to get this amount of IP. \r\n\r\nPlease and thank you,\r\nHi Im Bam","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T20:59:50.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your IP balance wasn't sync'd after a purchase, and updated later on (usually after a relog).
