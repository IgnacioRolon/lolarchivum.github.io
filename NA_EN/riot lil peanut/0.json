I&#039;m Sanketh, a motion graphics artist on the Core Gameplay Publishing team. I&#039;ve worked on many login screens the last few years, among other things, and get asked about our techniques (referred to as black magic too often, haha), so I thought I would shed some light on that!\r\n\r\nI recorded some mograph related tutorials at work before, but wanted to make some player facing to share some of our techniques we get asked about often. Hopefully this gives some of you a sneak peak at how we go about rigging and animating the characters you see as you log in!  This example shows the basic process rigging/animating the non-layered {{champion:9}}  splash, and is a pretty quick/basic example for the sake of learning. We usually spend weeks on a login animation, rather than 1 day, haha.\r\n\r\nThis is also the first set of videos for our new Motion Graphics team channel; I hope there is more to come here soon, but our team is fairly small and we are usually pretty busy... so I wouldn&#039;t expect videos here super frequently. At any rate, I hope these videos are helpful or cool to see for you. Feel free to leave comments or questions and we will try to get back to you. \r\n\r\nThanks for watching!\r\n\r\n**Warning: This tutorial is aimed at After Effects artists, **so it might be boring and technical if you aren&#039;t one. Part 4 might be a little more interesting since I cracked open the {{champion:163}}  and {{champion:19}}  files which might be neat to look at!","replies":[{"poster":"V The Support V","date":"2018-04-26T07:09:37.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super cool to see the process.\n\nWhich is more difficult, having a forefront image/character move \"a lot\" within a loop parameter, or having the background follow the \"respiration\" of the loop?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lil Peanut","date":"2018-05-02T00:01:02.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it really depends from scene to scene. After animating a normal breath loop a million times now, that part can be pretty easy on more ordinary characters, while the background or FX might be more challenging. A good example was Swain; he's a much more steady, reserved character, but his background was a whole army carrying banners and whatnot as far as they eye can see, so that part was much harder than the character animation!\n\nOn the flipside, Irelia's screen is an example of lots of character related motion, and not too much happening in the background.\n\nHope that answers the question!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-04-26T08:40:50.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?!

I didn't cover the photoshop portion for creating the parts of the character, as I wanted to keep things pretty short. And as you said there are other tutorials around to cover the \"before\" steps. Here is one from RefractArt (Who we have worked with a few times on mograph stuff!). I'll actually link this in the vimeo page.
