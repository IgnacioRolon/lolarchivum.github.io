I left 3 games the most recent game wasn't my fault. I did not directly leave the game. I wanted to play but I wasn't even able to move or go to the shop. After the loading screen, I was about to spawn in along with my teammates but it never happened my game froze and quit and wouldn't open. After hours of trying to open league and restarting my computer I gave up and reinstalled. To 24 hrs because it kept on getting stuck. I can play now and have to wait 5 min before play. I thought it was fine if I only had to wait 2-3 time max but it keeps on repeating and I am unable to play. I just cant get into a game. \n\nNote: I refuse to re-install","replies":[]}
