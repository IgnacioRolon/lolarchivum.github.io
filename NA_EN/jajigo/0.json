The rate of toxic players, leavers, mad people who feed intentionally has raised a lot in the last few years and this is getting pretty sad. Is there a way to make rules more strict? Give people who are toxic or leave games a Permanent Ban instead of a normal one, something that makes leavers think twice before harming the whole team, or toxic players think twice before spending their whole game insulting other players. With the actual system, almost every game as at least one of these people, and they don't care about the consequences, if they get banned, they will make or buy another account and do the same thing again. Maybe bringing back the Tribunal might also be a good idea, let us help punishing the people that we hate so much, real players are much better at this than a simple Bot that scans reports for some words like \"racism\" or whatever, and often fail to punish people who deserve it.\r\nPlease think about giving your actual system a big rework, something that actually works.\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Filthy Rank","date":"2019-04-26T20:26:49.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got 2 afk 2 games ago, 1 afk the game before and people who just perma feeds (ex: a botlane 3/22 last game in gold isn't a bad game it is feeding/not caring).\n\nfor teams with no premades, lp loss should be reduced if there is an afk (with bonus lp loss for the one afk). This way people with internet issues will stop playing ranked and i won't be matchmaded with troll afk since they won't climb elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"insomniacjezz","date":"2019-04-25T17:35:09.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In your last ten games you’ve had one AFK that I could see from the game stats.
