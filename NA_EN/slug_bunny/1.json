At first, it was happening with my PBE, but I easily fixed it with the repair option. But then my live account was having the same issue, saying that there was some unspecified error. So, I tried the repair option a few times, much to everyone's surprise, it did not work. So, I went on to uninstall and reinstall it, but then it said \"libcurl.dll is missing from your computer. Reinstall to fix this issue.\" Something along those lines. But when I went to uninstall again, it said the same thing. Eventually, one of my friends offered to help, I downloaded the Hextech Repair Tool, that didn't help. Then he was looking through his own files, and said something about a folder named \"0.0.0.86\" and gave me the libcurl.dll file. But I couldn't use it, because I don't have that folder. I have \"0.0.0.87\" instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T02:51:38.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you mentioned trying the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) once already, but let's run that puppy again and this time make sure to run it with both **reinstall and clean uninstall** turned on.

I opened HRT with reinstall and clean uninstall checked, but when I looked through the task log, under the \"Reinstalling\" section, it shows \"Downloading installer... Failed.\" And that seems to be the only thing that failed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T04:00:42.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh.....well yea we're gonna need that step to work for sure.
