I thought the queue wait would only be 5 minutes since i only left one game before this one, unfortunately, it was 14 minutes long.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}\nIt would be really nice to get some information on why this happened to me, maybe i deserved it? idk","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T15:24:53.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into your account, I wasn't able to find anything regarding Leaverbuster.  It looks like you account obtained a lower priority queue through a[ queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging), which will give you a one-game timer based your dodges.  Be sure to play your games consistently without dodging, and you won't experience an extended timer.  Regarding your black screen, this is usually a network issue connecting to the server.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
