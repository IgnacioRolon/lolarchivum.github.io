Of all the login pieces, this one is absolutely my favorite. As a big fan of &quot;classical&quot; music, this one is absolutely beautiful and  I would love to know the person who composed it, so I can possibly listen to more of their compositions.  Is this something Riot has listed somewhere?  Not sure if all the music is just &quot;by Riot Games,&quot; or if it&#039;s composed by a team of people, but I couldn&#039;t find the information listed anywhere online.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"ProtoShredanoid","date":"2018-06-12T00:54:52.106+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! Thank you for the kind words. This piece was very much a team effort. To be specific, I composed the melody and a gentleman named Mr. Michael Patti, orchestrated, elaborated on and brought the piece to life.  Also, live orchestra and amazing musicians = wow. This login is probably more representative of Michael's sound as most of the logins (and personal works) I have composed on are not very \"classical\" sounding (my last two were Kaisa and the Aatrox teaser that came out today). Feel free to ask me about details if my response did not satisfy your curiosity.

There is also one on the Freljord music. These are 4 and 5 years old now (wow time flies!) but there should still be some insightful nuggets in there :-)","replies":[{"poster":"King Braum","date":"2018-06-13T11:30:45.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah okay, Ill have to check those out then, another question I had was do you think the default music will ever get an update? since as iconic as it may be, the tune has kinda lost it's magic at this point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Shaco Ever","date":"2018-06-13T02:59:51.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree - I know Riot tries to make money through merchandising, which is perfectly cool, but I don't think I've ever seen them capitalize on the SCORES of music that is generated for their application.  Some of it really is wonderful.  I could go a while without hearing the default summoner's rift music though................. kinda lost its touch after the 400,000th time :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Shaco Ever","date":"2018-06-12T23:02:11.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, hats off to both of you then!  The gameplay, the graphics, the champions, and so many other things share so much of the spotlight, but as a fellow composer I'm really drawn to the musical elements and how I can enjoy them outside of the game itself.  I really am impressed by the piece itself, however it changed from when you originally composed it to after Mr. Patti was done bringing it to life.  It's truly beautiful, and you both should be proud of what you made. :)  I found Michael's website where he's posted stuff he's done.  Do you also have one, or a soundcloud or anything?","replies":[{"poster":"ProtoShredanoid","date":"2018-06-13T05:13:21.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you again :-D I do not have a full collection of all of the League pieces I have done over the last few years (too many!) but I have released some personal music under my ProtoShredanoid name.
