Whenever I go to the client store I have to scroll horizontally to reach the rp purchase button. I know that I can drag the sides, but that also moves the client vertically. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have enough space horizontally for this not being a problem, if I was allowed to scale the client freely, but as i said it forces the client to move both horizontal and vertical at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt isn't a major problem but it's annoying to the point that it gets tedious browsing the client store for champs/runes ect.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T20:27:12.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few reports on this today, and further investigation and troubleshooting has helped to discover a particular issue caused by a recent windows update.  The current workaround may be the following:  Right click the LoL icon -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Check the \"Disable Display Scaling on High DPI Settings\" Box.  Hit okay, and you should be set!","replies":[{"poster":"LT KabelSatan","date":"2016-08-27T11:56:43.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick response! \nIt seems to have worked, as i now can see all the champs in the store\nThanks again.","replies":[]}]}]}
