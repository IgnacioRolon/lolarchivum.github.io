The problem was that it created two problems. The first is that now, everyone just cses well. Back in s3 when I started, Bronze 5 players averaged 2-3 cs a minute. Now? I see Bronze games where the players that aren&#039;t getting dumpstered are getting 6-7+. The other problem is that nobody knows what to do with it. It&#039;s great if you&#039;re getting ahead of your opponent, but if you&#039;re not playing a champion that can destroy the enemy with AoE, you&#039;re not gonna go far with a lead.\n\nThat&#039;s why I say learn good wave manipulation. Wave manipulation is a huge part of this game and it goes almost entirely under-appreciated for what it does. With csing, the best thing you&#039;re hoping for is that your team doesn&#039;t feed while you get to the point you can pop off.\n\nWith good wave knowledge, you can create pressure, and that allows you to\n-Force your opponent to lose cs and xp and/or be a free kill for you\n-Force your opponent to stay instead of roaming on your lanes\n-Force the jungler to camp your lane instead of do anything else productive (if he can&#039;t kill you, but your jungler gets a single kill, you&#039;ve already made a net positive)\n-Allow your jungler to counterjungle because you can back him up\n-Protect your jungler from invades\n-Take dragons while nobody is looking\n-Get vision while your opponent is under tower\n-Pick up free kills because you don&#039;t have to sit in lane as often\n\nEssentially, you can't stop your lanes from feeding their lane opponent in a 1v1 setting, but through pressure you can remove or diminish their chances of dying to external factors significantly.\n\nIt&#039;s OP. If you want to get started here are some easy tips.\n-The best waves to back before are cannon minions. They&#039;re harder to kill so even if your opponent pushes hard and you lose the cannon you&#039;ll get most of the remaining wave. On non-cannon waves you&#039;ll miss 4-5 minions if it gets shoved to tower.\n-These are also the best waves to roam during, for the same reason.\n-Use the regular waves to disappear from lane and get vision before the cannons come. You can also play mindgames and roam during that time but it&#039;s very risky\n-The three types of lane positions are slow push, hard push, and freeze. You want to use these to deny as much cs as you can.\n-Freezes deny enemies gold the best when you know they&#039;re coming back to lane and you either can&#039;t shove into tower hard enough or when you can&#039;t get anything out of it (likely to get ganked and die). They&#039;re also good for staying safe from ganks.\n-Hard pushes work best when you can shove into tower to deny minions. These are good for when your opponent is roaming and you cannot follow them (4 gank bot but your jungler is top). Take a plate if you can during this time.\n-Slow pushes are when you have 1 more minion than the enemy. During this time another wave will come and since their minions will have done substantially less damage you can have 10+ minions pushed into their tower at once.\n-Slow pushing this way often gets you a reset (lane goes back to the middle) or reverse push (their minions come to tower just as yours are dying, giving you 5-6 healthy minions). Slow push into reverse is often one of the best ways to play against assassin lanes.\n-These basics are super important for getting kills and snowballing in low elo, and you play around the enemy trying to use them for outplays in high elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Dedenne","date":"2019-02-09T07:01:14.620+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"If u wanna climb, visit a climbingwall or whatever they are called.

This is the first time  though I found the basis of freezing easy to understand.\n\nTo my defense I main support though.","replies":[{"poster":"DerPunkt","date":"2019-02-09T12:09:45.369+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, there is a specific amount for specific places. When you freez in middle, you just need the enemy minions to have more HP since they all arrive with 100% and you last hit them (help with about 1-10% of dmg) you need the enemy to have a few more minions so his wave keeps pushing. The gist is, you need the enemy wave to slow push against you. As soon as your minions die, you tank them until your next wave arrives.\n\nThe specific calculations come when you wanna reach a specific point in lane with maximum efficieny. You don't really need it unless you want the perfect play. You can tank 20 minions anywere in lane and wait for your wave to take the tanking over, but this will slowly grind your health down, so you want as little minions on the enemy side as possible but as many as needed to still kill your lane. The closer you are to your turret, the more the enemy needs, since your minions arrive faster (due to that place being closer to your base) so they can help out faster. \n\nI know this gets a little too much but it is a simple concept. The gist is, the closer to your turret you wanna freeze, the more of an advantage you have to give the enemy wave and the more you will have to tank since there is less leeway for you to let them push you, since the tower will start to attack at some point and break the freez.\n\nIf you wanna learn freezing, learn proper last hitting. That means not CSing, but really only taking the last hit. necessary if you are really good, even wait for your caster to already send a killing blow and just before it arrives you take the last hit. this way you make the most out of your time.\nWith this the enemy will basically always push just stand infront of the minions, don't let him get close, you now got a freez and can deny him farm. But don't trade, you dont wanna trade in a freez unless you are more than just alitte ahead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dedenne","date":"2019-02-11T22:04:28.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main trist and her E makes it almost imposaible to freeze, so i dont rlly have to learn it :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaliCoastReplay","date":"2019-02-10T02:57:31.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a skill, and you can manipulate the wave to some extent no matter what state it's in.   \n\nYou can \"push\" your own coming wave minions to the side to get a champion-sized shift in the wave center, though it's one of the hardest skills in the game to master - and you have to sometimes.\n\nGenerally, though, he's right - you can freeze an oncoming wave if it is larger, but it costs you health and resources and makes you vulnerable. It's more important to know how best to adjust your frequency of autoattacks on the coming wave, and minion-farm spells, to control your own wave's velocity versus the opposing wave - I finally learned this year to be patient sometimes and *only* use last hits, and/or to even miss a few select CS, to keep the wave slow.  The slower you can keep it in farm phase, the more waves will reach you away from their tower, and the more CS you'll get.\n\nBut learning when you want a double or triple stack and momentum against the opposing team's tower or whatnot is also important - when you're about to drop the Herald, for instance, or when you're Baron'ed up, or even just early on in certain champion matchups - champions with poor waveclear are very vulnerable to double-stacked waves early in the game.\n\nWave manipulation is the sixth sense toplaners get.  I'm sure every position gets some kind of sixth sense, but that's ours, and we get better at it than anyone else in the game usually and eventually.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ApollyonBainer","date":"2019-02-11T19:34:30.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, see I try to freeze but they always end up killing the enemy minions.

It's also about getting your powerspikes as soon as possible and nothing is worse than having to back and not having enough gold for the item you need for your powerspike, especailly when it's your own fault for not CSing properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madjack01","date":"2019-02-09T11:36:15.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rock MD,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=juUu6IXN,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2019-02-09T07:12:30.522+0000)\n>\n> I am drunk, but I&#x27;ll take an ok farmer with great wave manipulation over a great farmer with ok wave manipulation in 10/10 occasions.\n\nI'm a noob but if I understand that correctly, then the transition from being a cs monster to being a wave management monster as well is linked to the transition from being a great solo player to being a great team player since proper management leads to more team opportunities.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Papdi1","date":"2019-02-10T04:12:22.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or play jungle.

My friend taught me how to freeze mid lane so that caster minions would never really ever hit my towers in laning phase, and doing that basically assured that my tower took no damage at all while I was easily able to take down theirs, despite struggling with CS. I got back to back S's in the two Ziggs mid games I played, and sure, while I know how to play him mechanically, I ended up coping with solo laning much better than I thought I would, and even had better games than when I played him support.\n\nI always took \"just learn how to CS\" as half-hearted advice because most people see that, shove waves all the time and leave themselves exposed to ganks, when it's not just that simple.
