People do not mind when champions prices raise and drop after they have purchased them, as the deal was at that time, and that was the agreed price. But this is totally different. You not changing the runes. You are wiping them out. So unless some kind of refund scheme is put in place. You are giving people who decided to get champions in stead, an unfair advantage as they have a bigger champion selection to choose from, as they have more unlocked.\n\nBut this is not my main concern as IP is an in game currency that you give us just for playing the game. The problem comes when people have put on RP with their money, to get addition rune pages. You changing runes and taking pages away from people, is in my opinion stealing from them. It it was a game like COD, its the equivalent of selling an expansion for more content. Then taking it away making loads of money from people who can now not enjoy the content they paid for.\n\nI am glad you say you are still listening to people. Before you say i am being selfish like someone did earlier to the main post created. I actually have not put RP on for rune pages. So this would not effect me. Something in my opinion needs to be done to compensate for the players that use their IP on runes as they come at a hefty price, and they buy them to unlock more game styles and strategies. Which to take away for nothing is wrong in my eyes. What i would like to see is either there not being a limit to amount of new pages you can have. Or be able to change them like you can with masteries pre game. If this is not the case. I would advise you to keep the rune pages unlocked by players, still live in the new \"runes reforged\". As this would solve the RP issue as its is the only thing i believe that can be bought by RP on runes.\n\nHope you take what i say on board as some of these new changes may upset a large portion of your community, especially if you decide just to wipe clean, all the IP and RP that have been put into runes by player.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bots Whilst High","date":"2017-06-02T23:25:36.705+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand that you haven't decided on anything yet, I would just like the team responsible for making the decision  to consider the opportunity costs that a lot of long times players went through when deciding whether to buy very expensive runes or purchase a new champion while determining what type and how much compensation (if any), is awarded. \n\n I personally purchased several champions with RP (system working as intended I assume)  just so I could feel competitive with runes while also having a diverse champion pool for swaps/counterpicks/fun.

I wasted over 3k hours in this game. If the just go and make them free and say to the old players \"lel fk you, you get nothing\" I will feel cheated of my time and money, because I did waste a lot of it on this game. You can call me entitled or whatever, but it's simply how I and many others see it. I don't support those who just cry about new players getting them for free without even waiting for Riot to announce the compensation.","replies":[]}]}
