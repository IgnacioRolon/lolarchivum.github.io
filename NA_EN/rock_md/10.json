When it is a must or you gimp yourself, it's not gameplay.\n\nAlso, by upping her Q damage but removing her animation cancelling you can give her roughly similar damage if she gets on you and starts dropping her combo but from range she has to choose when the right time to go in is, because she has to choose between damage (sitting there pricing her passive with autos) or stickiness (just getting on top of you first). She also has actually fighter/assassin damage on her abilities again if that happens.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-08-13T15:47:57.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay i hate Riven more than any other champ but removing the mechanical skills required for certain champs? \nFuckn casual. \nI mean 90% of the roster doesn't even require any difficult mechanics at all... no need to remove the remaining part of it. \nJust because bronze-silver is where most of the community is at we shouldn't change the game to please them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-08-13T04:48:39.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah LoL \n\nLets make everything Automatic so that 150 Ping Chimpanzas can play league \n\nNo this game is balanced around 30-50 ping deal with it \n\nNo riven player would want that What you just suggested","replies":[{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2016-08-13T05:54:10.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal spax","date":"2016-08-13T09:21:09.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sofm got challanger KOREA by playing jungle with 200+ping (he is from thailand), and he used to main Lee Sin.\n\nNo exscuse, if you are good enough you will climb, no reason to transform this game in a more easier game.

The issue is it's bullshit that is only there to artificially inflate the skillcap and make it unclear to the opposing player how to outplay or counter play the Riven/Yasuo.\n\nRemove it (making the champion easier), give the champion compensation buffs that add gameplay. Boom. Champion is easier to play as and against and the window of counter play is widened while also adding more clarity to what the champion does.","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-08-13T04:51:59.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The moment when Riven becomes Easy 5% OF playerbase ll quit LoL\n\nI am just trying to explain to you how your idea is dumb ","replies":[]}]}]}]}
