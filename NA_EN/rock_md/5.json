{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2018-10-17T03:35:23.735+0000","title":"If you expect Riot to remove part of a kit and rework strong champs you're going to be disappointed","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":28,"down_votes":10,"body":"Riot isn&#039;t going to remove stuff from champions&#039; kits just because &quot;it&#039;s toxic&quot; when half the time that&#039;s what makes them enjoyable to play as. This is especially true when you consider almost all of these champs could have proper counterplay introduced through number tuning\n\nRiot isn&#039;t going to remove Yasuo&#039;s windwall (and for the people complaining about it here, it blows my mind you choose to complain about that skill when that&#039;s by far the most reasonable ability in his kit), they&#039;re not going to rework Kai&#039;sa, they won&#039;t take the summoner spells off Zoe&#039;s W.\n\nWhy? It&#039;s unique. It&#039;s the champion&#039;s theme. It doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re some unbalanceable mess it means you need to look at balancing the kit differently.\n\nFor example, let&#039;s look at Zoe. A couple months ago people were pissed because, &quot;well the W makes it so she can just outtrade you even when she&#039;s melee range, remove the damage and/or MS buff.&quot; That&#039;s just not going to happen. And again, it&#039;s not what made Zoe toxic to play against. In high elo, Zoe was toxic because in lane you space so that if someone waveclears with a spell instead of trading, you punish it and force them off the wave. You can&#039;t do that to Zoe because her skills (which, in a late game teamfight or skirmish have good counterplay) allowed her to push the wave without any interaction from the opponent unless they picked an assassin. And to top it all off, it&#039;s so hard to get on top of the champion but it was extraordinarily difficult to roam and it was difficult to jump on her. What else could you do besides waveclear and hope you outscaled? I suggested nerfing the damage from her Q and E so that it was harder for her to waveclear and oneshot before specific levels (unless you made a grave mistake), and start balancing her around her W mechanic since it certainly was one Riot DOES NOT want to remove.\n\nThis is applicable to Kai&#039;sa as well. There are a lot of complaints that Kai&#039;sa&#039;s changes will not fix her, but what are the actual problems with her? Let&#039;s look at her kit.\n1. She&#039;s a short ranged ADC\n2. She&#039;s supposed to assassinate targets\n3. She&#039;s supposed to be rewarded for good ults\n\nSo it&#039;s safe to say that she needs her R mobility, needs her invisibility, and needs burst.\n\nWhat does this leave her with that &quot;can be removed&quot;? Her shield, her AS buff. That&#039;s about it, and if you think about any Kai&#039;sa player, that&#039;s not something that they (myself included) would want to lose. It wouldn&#039;t feel good and there are better alternatives.\n\nSo you can nerf her burst, her safety, or her DPS. I personally wanted to see lower shield values since that thing is massive, but Riot wants to nerf her DPS. Why? Because this doesn&#039;t fit the design Riot had intended for her. It also makes it so that she has champions that can be picked into her (tanks) and it will at the very least force her into a specific build path to deal with her. \n\nI personally think it&#039;s a great choice because it doesn&#039;t destroy a kit that a lot of people actually love (okay and some use to collect free LP), it introduces a form of counterplay, and it&#039;s done almost exclusively through changing numbers. Not the kit itself. Don&#039;t expect Riot to destroy kits, especially when number fixes can definitely get the job done with less messy work. If you expect otherwise, you&#039;ll be disappointed.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2018-10-17T03:50:16.580+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just make everyone toxic to play against then.","replies":[{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2018-10-17T03:52:42.260+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hayaishi2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XaPmVhQM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-17T03:50:16.580+0000)\n>\n> They should just make everyone toxic to play against then.\n\nName a champion that became top tier in solo or competitive play that wasn't toxic.\n\nAnd some of those champions (mid Soraka) needed reworks, but they are few and far between.

You’re complaining about a champ who’s literally like 5th worse winrate in the game. Not my fault after freezing and zoning you out of minions, you suddenly stand still waiting to cs. Not my fault you were hugging a wall. Not my fault you were really predictable. If you think Zoe’s E is op, trust me, you can do many things with a slow with 2 seconds until sleep. You can \n> A-Walk behind minions\n> B-Walk behind Champs\n> C-Try and cc Zoe, flash, and try to juke her.\n> Did I i mention my R does no dmg, and after nerfs, my W does no dmg. My only really dmg is my Q, and my e is to set up for that. More Sparkles has been nerfed as well. But hey, lets keep on flaming Riot for creating a character when you stand still, go 0/6 in 15 minutes, and have Zoe one shotting with 6/0. What do our poor Ahri mains have to deal with? Zoe’s W comes in clutch, and makes you think hard for using it, Ahri just pressed W and watches dmg. Ahri Mains also have an ult that can do 300 dmg at least, for 3 dashes, (In total a lot of dmg) similar to flash. Pathetic, crying Ahri mains are crying about their ult being lengthened to 120 second cool down, yet they have a 3.2 second stun, (which essentially kills them) that is really easy to land. But sure, keep crying Ahri mains.\n\nYe, it's just people only remember pre nerf zoe, which was a nightmare. Honestly zoe really doesn't need any more nerfs, she could actually use a buff as long as it's to her q, she's pretty much ryze/azir tier rn","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2018-10-17T05:53:39.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> and for the people complaining about it here, it blows my mind you choose to complain about that skill when that's by far the most reasonable ability in his kit\n\nAhahahaha.

Wait it's long CD? Move to the side?\n\nThe spell is impactful for sure but there are limitations to playing around it.

He doesn't build much, if any CDR so the spell still has a 14 second window after it pops to engage on him and ruin his day so if you're not forcing it before fighting idk what to tell you.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2018-10-17T17:31:54.773+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"And they usual bullshit strikes again!

The biggest beef I have with Riot currently is that they've made flashy champs as of late, and balanced the game to make them shine. \"Woah look how cool and quick everything is going.\" Ya and look at how many champions have been benched because they aren't meta. Season 8 had a mission statement, \"play the way you want to play.\" What they neglected to include was, \"Just be aware some things are better than others.\"\n","replies":[]}]}
