Jinx always is reliant on her passive to catch up or getaway from an enemy. You sacrafice your heal for a potentially stronger chase. As it scales equally with your ability to kite champions. Maybe add in a frozen mallet and  then mobile or not they aren't getting away easily","replies":[{"poster":"nujumkey","date":"2016-06-16T22:17:09.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya i experimented with Ashe Ghost too but i fed like hell.

I've talked about this many times in the EUW boards. Riot won't do anything with Flash tough because, if they did, the backlash from the community would be OUTRAGEOUSly terrible.\n\nI would change flash from a Blink to a Dash in the first place and then maybe give it something else just to prevent a possible riot from the community (hehe).\n\nI don't think every champion should have acess to a Blink. Those types of skills are thematic to certain champions (Kassadin, Ezreal, Katarina, ...). A Dash, maybe. I'm not saying they should remove a quick mobility summoner spell, but a Blink is just too much.\nA dash with increased combat strength for a short duration (like Graves's E) would be a good idea. Also, the abilty to jump over terrain should be considered because some walls shouldn't be allowed to \"dash\" through.\n\nBut the community doesn't agree with me on that, so I don't believe they'll ever change it.","replies":[{"poster":"nujumkey","date":"2016-06-16T10:58:51.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Life lessons, never fight with the internet xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2016-06-16T08:09:41.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ghost is by far better on any champion, if the enemy team doesn't have perma slows or a lot of slows like {{champion:22}}","replies":[]}]}
