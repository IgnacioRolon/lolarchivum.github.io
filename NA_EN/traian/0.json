Usually from someone downloading something and at least I know where the issue is coming from but for the past few days I've had a steady 120-150+ latency and I can't play the game like this. I'm not really sure where to go from here but here's a traceroute if it helps any of you guys understand where the problem is.\n\nI also forgot to mention that I live in Gulf Breeze, Florida if that makes a difference.\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                           RT-AC87R-D218 -    0 |  315 |  315 |    2 |    2 |    4 |    2 |\n|                            10.188.190.1 -    0 |  315 |  315 |    8 |   12 |   29 |   13 |\n|                           172.30.30.158 -    0 |  315 |  315 |   21 |   35 |  112 |   93 |\n|           68-66-72-133.client.mchsi.com -    0 |  315 |  315 |   24 |   28 |   39 |   25 |\n|              po10.atlga001er1.mchsi.com -    0 |  315 |  315 |   24 |   29 |   48 |   30 |\n|            ae13-22.cr1-atl1.ip4.gtt.net -    0 |  315 |  315 |   24 |   30 |   76 |   26 |\n|                as1299.atl11.ip4.gtt.net -    0 |  315 |  315 |   35 |   41 |   71 |   39 |\n|                  dls-b21-link.telia.net -    0 |  315 |  315 |   40 |   46 |   86 |   43 |\n|      riot-ic-315570-dls-b21.c.telia.net -    0 |  315 |  315 |   44 |   49 |   65 |   47 |\n|                          104.160.134.35 -    0 |  315 |  315 |   44 |   49 |   66 |   46 |\n|          ae35-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    1 |  312 |  311 |  118 |  162 |  194 |  164 |\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    1 |  311 |  310 |  127 |  154 |  191 |  160 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  315 |  315 |  117 |  163 |  193 |  180 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Attention Whor3","date":"2018-01-21T21:59:42.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the exact same issue over here\nI used to have 33 ms and now is like 133 ms or little higher.\nI can't play any normal game with this ping.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} \nDo I have to call my ISP for this to be salved?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T22:32:04.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that is a bit concerning. I'm taking this traceroute over to our tech guys who are gonna poke a few people, but this might be related to how many ISP's in that area are needing to reroute many of their connections due to recent extreme weather and such. We could *try* a VPN in the meantime, as that can reroute your connection a better way, but I'm not entirely sure if this will be fixed until that node starts working better. Thanks for this info though definitely, helps us notice where there might be a real issue!!!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"traian","date":"2017-10-13T00:53:57.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The VPN seemed to solve my problem for the time being It's only on a 6 day trial at the moment and I will check back on my latency after the 6days in hope that the routing issue is resolved.
