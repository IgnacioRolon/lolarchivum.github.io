Like I watch gameplay for Kled and he&#039;s start the game Like &quot; What the %&amp;$# where am I?&quot; and I guess it&#039;s a cute gimmick but don&#039;t act like you are doing people a favor by changing graves and taking away his guitar then trying to act like super cool and cursing a lot...we still expect some professionalism from you...","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-06T21:07:46.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason they took away grave's cigar is because they didn't want to deal with international tobacco portrayal laws, which are much more strict than in the United States. Cursing you can just alter during translation, making it much easier to handle locally (if it is even an issue). \n\nThe cursing doesn't really bother me. This is a game for entertainment, i get enough \"professionalism\" at work.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragko","date":"2016-08-06T21:17:45.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cigar was just a minor point... Also cursing isn't a problem... The amount of cursing is the problem...watch the video of when they announced that they were not getting rid of dynamic queue. They curse so much in that video you can tell it's forced and borderline uncomfortable. when I first saw the video I was so focused on the amount of curses that I didn't even understand what the video was about.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-08-06T20:16:46.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except cursing isnt dangerous to your health or life (some studies actually claim that cursing relieve stress and is healthy) but smoking is health hazard.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragko","date":"2016-08-06T21:06:45.654+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be true but from a professional stance it is inappropriate. You must understand that Riot is a business...that being said a certain amount of professionalism should be a standard of expectation. Having a curse here and there is ok but when you are announcing major changes in the game and the men on the panel are going at it like sailors vs pirates. That is below that standard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-08-06T20:27:05.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"some studies actually claim that cursing relieve stress and is healthy\"\nProvided you have nothing better to say, yes it relieves stress.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2016-08-06T20:25:49.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#makegravesvape","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2016-08-06T20:49:07.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aw poor baby.

They know what they have, and they know they will not be losing business to this stunt. If it hurts that much, uninstall and disown your use of their product. Or write a formal complaint, but running around the boards trying to incite emotional response is pointless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shemby","date":"2016-08-06T21:23:15.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you man. Professionalism is very important. Some of us don't like swearing. Big whoop. If they want swearing in the game, fine, but for those of us who don't want to hear it, just give the option of a filter. So easy. I don't have to read their articles, but I do enjoy the game. If they are going to force swearing into the game, like I said, offer the option of a filter. I don't think they would want to lose business and players over something so little. We all just need to be mature about all of this though. If they make champs swear in the game, I'm not gonna whine about it, but it would be nice for them to consider putting a filter if that is what they want to do. They already offer a filter for chat, so I don't see why they wouldn't for the game. Idc if swearing relieves stress. I don't want to hear it, nor do I want the kids around the computer to hear it, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If push comes to shove, I'll just turn the sound off. Problem solved lol. Would make gameplay difficult sometimes, but oh well lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-08-06T20:28:04.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I all actuality riot is going full retard on their games \"rating\" factor. A slip like this is pushing it towards a 17+ rating, which quite honestly it needs. (Bring back the splash arts with blood and smoking.
