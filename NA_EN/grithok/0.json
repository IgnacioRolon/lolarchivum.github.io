I stay at a consistent 80 ping, which is my regular and I am fully accustomed to playing it, but usually once a game, rarely twice or thrice, hp bars will disappear, and animations will stop playing, but I can still move my champion, while no other entities move on screen. I've been thinking it's a packet loss issue, but the strange thing is that all of my input commands come through as normal, and if I am in a skype call, my partner is always able to roughly guide me out of danger.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if I could get a second opinion on the issue from anyone, because ideally I'd like to troubleshoot the issue. c=","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T21:13:04.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It honestly does seem like a packet loss issue like you suggested.
