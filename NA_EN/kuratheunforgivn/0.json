The way you guys keep stuff fresh is interesting but you guys need to change a few things because honestly your champ balancing system is horrible. I hope you take the time to actually read through this letter because this isn&#039;t just my opinion but many peoples opinion. The &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; champs with the overloaded kits need to change, when people play this game they&#039;re gonna be bad until level 30 no matter how easy or hard a champ is it&#039;s not gonna change that.\r\n\r\nAatrox- Make the heal on the W a little more, reduce the cooldown on the passive a little and reduce the attack speed and range of ult.\r\nAhri- Reduce the length of the charm or make it deal no damage, she bursts way too hard for her to have a move that makes you useless for that long.\r\nAkali- Reduce the damage on her Q and give her more damage on her E.\r\nAlistar- Get rid of the stun after the Q that leave the adc with way too much time to deal damage, increase the heal on his E.\r\nAmumu- Increase damage on his W, decrease range on his Q, decrease cool down and damage on ult.\r\nAnivia- Yeah she takes skill to play but her kit is over loaded, the E does way too much damage. The wall is too big make it smaller.\r\nAnnie- Decrease the time that Tibbers is alive and his speed, the W range is too big.\r\nAshe- The passive on her auto is op, you can&#039;t run away get rid of it or atleast make the slow alot weaker. The stun on the ult is way too long, along with the stun, slow and range it&#039;s impossible to get away.\r\nAzir- The range he has is too big, he&#039;s not that hard to play so he shouldn&#039;t have that big of a range. Make his W so that after it attacks a champ it has like 5 seconds till it leaves. Make it so that nothing goes throw his ult for the first few seconds not the until it leaves.\r\nBard- Nothing\r\nBlitz- He is main support but really riot, really. His Q range isn&#039;t even the range of the predictor, it&#039;s way too long. His ult does too much damage and his E does too much damage\r\nBrand- His W is too big and it does too much damage, his ult does too much damage in team fights.\r\nBraum- The adc should not be allowed to continue the stun passive that he has.\r\nCaitlyn- Her ult does too much damage and her auto attack range is too big.\r\nCassiopeia- Nothing\r\nCho- Reduce the range on everything and lower the damage on ult. \r\nCorki- His E is up for too long, shorten the duration of it.\r\nDarius- He scales too much, make it so that he can only ult a max of 3 people, increase the range of his hook and get rid of the increased damage you get at 5 stacks. Darius is technically my main but still this is ridiculous.\r\nDiana- Why does she need a shield that strong, weaken it. Make her ult stack up like Akali&rsquo;s.\r\nMundo- Increase the cooldown on his ult during the early game.\r\nDraven- Lower the scaling on his Q.\r\nEkko- Reduce the range on the second part of his E.\r\nElise- Reduce the range and duration on her E (both spider and human form).\r\nEvelynn- Reduce the damage on ult and reduce the movement speed she gets.\r\nEzreal- Nothing\r\nFiddlesticks- Nothing\r\nFiora- The dash cool down is too low, her W shouldn&#039;t allow her to stun, others, her passive marks do too much damage and she heals too much when ult goes off.\r\nFizz- He does too much damage everywhere, reduce the scaling on his moves. His E allows him to move way too far away and it should only be 1 hop not 2. Reduce the aoe on his E and the casting range of his ult along with the aoe it has.\r\nGalio- Reduce the cost of mana on his abilities.\r\nGangplank- Get rid of the anti cc on his oranges and reduce the casting time of his ult.\r\nGaren- His ult does too much damage, make the range on is a little bigger. His silence lasts too long, his E does too much damage and his health regen and the villain passive is way too strong.\r\nGnar- Increase his base attack speed.\r\nGragas- Reduce the distance that enemies are thrown when his ult goes off. Increase the cooldown on his dash.\r\nGraves- Nothing\r\nHecarim- Reduce the range of his ult.\r\nHeim- Reduce the range of his turrets.\r\nIllaoi- Limit the amount of tentacles she can have up at one time. Reduce the scaling on her abilities, the range of the E after it latches on to the enemy and then you half to walk out is too big and the slow is dumb.\r\nIrelia- Nothing\r\nJanna- Nothing\r\nJarvan- Nothing\r\nJax- Reduce the damage on ult and reduce his attack speed passive.\r\nJayce- Nothing\r\nJhin- Reduce the range on his ult and W. His last hit passive does too much damage, along with the 4th hit from his ult. Reduce the slow on his hit and reduce the time in between when an ally hits the enemy and until he Ws.\r\nJinx- Nothing\r\nKalista- Nothing\r\nKarma- Reduce the damage on her Q along with the slow and the length of her stun.\r\nKarthus- Make his Q go off quicker.\r\nKassadin- Reduce the strength of his shield.\r\nKatarina- Reduce the scaling on every move she has.\r\nKayle- Delete this champ from existence please.\r\nKennen- Nothing\r\nKha- Reduce the damage he can do to others when they&#039;re alone. Increase the amount of time he can go invisible at lower levels.\r\nKindred- Reduce the scaling on her abilities.\r\nKog- Really Riot really? Why does a champ need that much attack speed. Make the cap on it 3.5 attack speed. His ults range is too big and reduce the mana cost of it. The undying passive has an aoe that&#039;s too big.\r\nLeblanc- Reduce the damage on her Q and the range of her E.\r\nLee Sin- Reduce the damage on ult.\r\nLeona- Increase the cool down on her ult, if she uses E on an enemy and that enemy uses an ability to push them away then that shouldn&#039;t allow her to avoid it.\r\nLissandra- Her ults stun lasts too long and it&#039;s aoe is too big.\r\nLucian- His double hit passive does too much damage, and the ult does too much damage.\r\nLulu- Nothing\r\nLux- The range on her abilities and the damage scaling is horrifying. Reduce it.\r\nMalphite-  Reduce the strength of his shield and reduce the slow on this Q.\r\nMalzahar- Reduce the damage on his E.\r\nMaokai- Nothing\r\nYi- He does not need the passive that gives him attack speed.\r\nFortune- Nothing\r\nMordekaiser- Reduce damage on his Q.\r\nMorgana- Reduce the damage on all her abilities and reduce the range and stun of her Q.\r\nNami- Nothing\r\nNasus- Reduce the strength and duration of his slow, make the stacks per Q 3 infill he reaches 200 stacks, after 200 stacks make it 2 per Q.\r\nNautilus- Nothing\r\nNidalee- Reduce the amount of times she can jump away from 2 to 1.\r\nNocturne- Nothing\r\nNunu- Allow him to use his bite on champions, and shorten the charging time in his ult.\r\nOlaf- Nothing\r\nOrianna- Nothing \r\nPantheon- He shouldn&#039;t be able to block turret damage and reduce the range on his E.\r\nPoppy- rework her again, you made her from a squishy champ to a tanky champ that does the same bs damage as before.\r\nQuinn- Get rid of the blind, reduce her speed when she ults.\r\nRammus- Reduce the damage others take from his ult and shield.\r\nRek Sai- She does way too much damage and she heals for too much.\r\nRenekton- Nothing\r\nRengar- Nothing\r\nRiven- Nothing\r\nRumble- Give him better scaling on his abilities\r\nRyze- Reduce the scaling on his abilities\r\nSejuani- Nothing\r\nShaco- Nothing\r\nShen- He shouldn&#039;t be able to block attacks \r\nShyvana- Make her E likes rengars.\r\nSinged- Nothing\r\nSIon- Nothing\r\nSivir- Reduce the range, speed and damage of her Q.\r\nSkarner- Nothing\r\nSona- Reduce the damage on her Q and her ult.\r\nSoraka- Nothing \r\nSwain- Reduce his scaling.\r\nSyndra- Reduce her scaling\r\nTahm- Reduce his scaling \r\nTalon- Nothing\r\nTaric- Nothing\r\nTeemo- Give him more damage on his shrooms early game and reduce the damage it does late game.\r\nThresh- Nothing\r\nTristana- The range on her W is too big.\r\nTrundle- He shouldn&#039;t be able to bite turrets, he does too much damage overall.\r\nTryndamere- His ult lasts too long late game.\r\nTwisted Fate- Nothing\r\nTwitch- The range on his ult is too long\r\nUdyr- Reduce the scaling on his abilities\r\nUrgot- Nothing\r\nVarus- Nothing\r\nVeigar- Reduce the scaling on his W and Ult.\r\nVayne-  Make the duration of the ult longer in the early game.\r\nVel Koz- Reduce damage on the ult.\r\nVi- Reduce the scaling.\r\nViktor- Nothing\r\nVladimir- Nothing\r\nVolibear- Damage on his W and the regen health passive.\r\nWarwick- Nothing\r\nWukong- Nothing\r\nXerath- His range needs to be reduced.\r\nXin- His 3rd basic attack passive needs to be nerfed.\r\nYasuo- His double the crit passive and the amount of times he can use his E in a certain time period.\r\nYorick- His damage and the duration of his ult\r\nZac- Nothing\r\nZilean- Nothing\r\nZed- The damage on the second part of his ult\r\nZyra- Nothing\r\nZiggs- Nothing\r\n\r\nFor items just reduce the slow on iceborn gauntlet and the speed you get from rage blade. Thank you for reading this it&#039;s just that recently all these champs are too op and it&#039;s too hard to fight them at times.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-03-06T20:10:44.834+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf dude, wall of text much?  \n\nSpace that shit out or remove all the champs you said didn't need to be changed.  I'm not going to go through this and refute everything if it takes me a half hour to read it and find my last sentence every time i scroll up or down.\n\nEDIT: after skimming this ive noticed that its all just bs.\n\nNerfing champs that dont need nerfs (Mord, Yorick, sona, swain, synda, nasus all dont need nerfs)\n\nBuffing champs that dont need buffs (Rumble better ratios and shyvana with ganking power? are you insane?)\n\nFlat out missing information (they already nerfed trundles q bite, they extra dmg doesn't hit towers its just an aa reset like any other one,  yas e is based on individual cd on different targets not a # of times in a period, nid has infinite jumps away not 2, its just a basic ability that moves her in a direction)\n\nYou clearly don't know enough about the game to be stating what should be nerfed or buffed.  Go play half of these champs and understand how they work and are designed first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-03-06T20:34:17.928+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried writing down the things you proposed that I find ridiculous.\nBut I don't know where to start....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-03-06T23:14:21.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Yeah these are the champions I don't like, so nerf them because I can't play against them.
