Insulting and degrading me because...I didnt have a sightstone. Yeah I know I didnt have it. I was trying my best not to FEED, to stay alive so I could help THEM get kills. ANd I would buy wards  to help with vision. But again. None of that mattered.\r\nEverything I did as a support, to help keep them alive, to help get them kills by landing hooks for them. NONE OF THAT MATTERED. \r\nsuddenly it became \"You dont know how to play support\" \"you dont know how to play league\" among other insults.\r\nand I suppose those times I hooked an enemy so brand and rengar could pick up an easy kill meant nothing. \r\nSeriously..its FKIN SICK the ammount of abuse supports have to put up with. all so the rest of the team can strut around going \"Look how great I am with my kills (Brand and Rengar were both well over 20+ kills. 25 and 22 respectively) But my contribution as the support means nothing because I didnt build how -EVERYONE ELSE BUILDS- \r\n\r\nPart of the reason builds arent just \"one set of items for support, one for mid, one for top,,etc..\" Is because..and here is the shock. NOT EVERYONE IS THE SAME!. \r\nEveryone has thier own build strategy, thier own build path. and consider this a warning. If you throw me under the bus because I  \"didnt build proper\" aka like everyone else, dont expect me to suddenly run to save you when you get your bacon handed to you. \r\nI do my best to win. But I am not going to be some doormat for you to walk all over and abuse just because I helped get you fed and now you think you are 'Gods gift to league\". \r\n\r\nGet over yourself, its a team game.

It's incredibly way more efficient, and since everyone else may not always have the left over gold or item slots to buy wards, and can't upgrade their trinkets until level 9, sightstone for support is pretty necessary.\n\nPlays or no plays, vision is incredibly crucial. And you know what they say, \"one of the reasons some people can't climb out of bronze/silver is because they waste their gold income\" and as support, your gold income is already pretty limited.\n\nThis is literally the sole reason that riot put out support items, is because supports used to spend their trash gold on nothing but wards.

I don't care what your reasoning is, there is no reason to not have one. Like, people shouldn't have to ask you to do what you should already be doing, but after all if you're not building a sightstone I'm going to have to guess you're playing in bronze/silver where people don't know how to build anyways. \n\nPeople SHOULD be upgrading their trinkets, if they don't, then why should you still lack on a sightstone...? I said I'm a support main, I know alllllll to well about the shit supports always get, and everyone saying to ward the entire map. That's when i remind them i can only put out 3 and 1 pink, and if they feel like it's lacking too much then they should upgrade their trinkets. Pretty simple concept.\n\nAll i said was, I wouldn't respect you as a pretty good support if you don't have a sightstone, because that definitely means you're not getting vision coverage, and just wasting your gold. Sightstone is always my first buy when i back if i have 800 gold.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-10-25T00:49:00.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you could learn a lot from watching professional matches and reading some guides.

It's not as efficient, but we're not there to play passively anyway :P\n\nIf I were you, I'd switch to ADC for awhile. A lot of ADC players don't really ward, so whenever I play with a decent support we have incredible vision control due to my contributions (fun fact: a ward here and there does **not** impede your build.
