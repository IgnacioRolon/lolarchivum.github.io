I tried playing a few bot games and normal games and didnt see any change, Games required doesnt tick down.\r\nI can /all chat and pretty much have every functionality Back as far as chat goes. \r\nBut it never shows how many games are left and If I go to Ranked, I am still locked out due to chat restriction.\r\nSo to recap:\r\n- I am not chat restrict, I have /all chat and all privilages back, everything as if I am no longer chat restrict.\r\n- when i log in I still get the message \"you have been chat restricted for 19 games\"\r\n-Completing normal games does NOT bring this number down (I completed 3 normal games and a bot game and still at 19 games required) and I am still locked out of ranked mode due to this \"chat restrict\" that I am no longer under. But as I said, In game there is no chat restriction. I am not limited to messages, /all chat is not disabled. (in game its as if I am not chat restricted at all) \r\nWTF man...please fix","replies":[{"poster":"Slumber Jack","date":"2014-12-19T19:52:44.010+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there!\n\nI can see how this might be confusing since the punishments were issued at the same time, so I'll take a moment to clarify what's going on here.\n\n\"Chat restrictions\" and \"Ranked restrictions\" are two completely separate punishments; players who exhibit a particular level of toxicity in-game have both placed on their account simultaneously. Chat restrictions simply limit how much you can say in-game (and removes /all chat); ranked restrictions don't affect your chat, but prevent you from playing ranked.\n\nChat restrictions can be worked off in pretty much any match-making mode just by playing games with restrictions in-place; pretty straightforward. However, ranked restrictions require not only to play a certain mode (normal draft), but also require you to win them.\n\nLooking at your account, I do see you've worked off your chat restrictions; cool! However, it doesn't seem there are a lot of normal draft games in your recent history. Lots of Team Builder and Poro King matches. You'll need to start winning some more normal draft games if you want to get back into ranked.\n\nHope this clears it up!","replies":[{"poster":"ErinTheKnight","date":"2014-12-20T06:20:03.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot, thanks for taking the time to help this player, but no teambuilder matches count?

I find that weird.

After I took off 3 years I came back and found either my entire FL moved to SMITE or DOTA or they had achieved Plat3+.   Essentially when the season starts over and all the kids who paid for account will be back down low gold and below.  My point being is get your account fixed and back into rank status.  Any account in under G4, I have found is a HIGH risk area.  Most these people have \"READ A BUILD\"  and now \" KNOW HOW TO PLAY\".  If you tried to give them advice, or have a decent conversation 9/10 times they WILL REPORT YOU.\n\n2 Accounts of mine have DRAFT bans.   Most the time Im not even trollin or flaming players. \"MOST: 88% of the time i got my try hard pants on\"\nbut that other 12% is enough random reports ranging from .\nun sportsman \"  Why would you build mobis on a champion with speed boost, and passive?  He doesn't need it??? \"\nBMING   \" Dude, could you please support me?
