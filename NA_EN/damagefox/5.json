Players who follow the meta like its thier bible. Anyone who legitimately tries to win by playing an Off meta support. \r\nI just got out of a match where I went MF support. ADC repeatedly ignored pings for help. And I was told &quot;you went MF &#039;support&#039; &quot; \r\nSo because of my champion selection, I am instantly treated as a tumour to be removed and cut off from everyone else. \r\nI am really getting sick of this Mob mentality, Where if you are going against the meta, no matter how genuine your intention, the community goes out of thier way to create a self fulfilling prophecys. They will do everything in thier power to make you out what they label you. \r\n\r\nLike a player who calls you a feeder. \r\nthen spends the entire game ignoring you when you ping for help. When you get ambushed the player just looks the other way. Or feints going in and waits for follow up, only to back out at the last second when its too late for you. \r\nThen spends each death going &quot;See? see? I told you this player was a feeder&quot;\r\n\r\nYou have a player you designated as the &quot;other&quot; (feeder/troll/flamer/etc) and so you spend the entire game poking and prodding, Making sure that the &quot;other&quot; ends up exactly how you want them to. \r\nYou labeled them a troll so anything they do is twisted into a form of &quot;trolling&quot; regardless of intent. \r\nYou labeled them a feeder so you ignore when they need help and Laugh when they die because It helps validate your label on them. \r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, got hung out to dry because I went MF support. Apparently the player didnt care or know, but designated it as trolling anyways. Ignored pings for help when the enemy bot lane pounced on me (ADC had abandoned lane and ran mid for kills). ADC ignored pings for help but was happy to label me a feeder/troll because &quot;you went MF &quot;support&quot; &quot;\r\n\r\nThis falls in line with the earlier thread I made. About how Supports are treated as NOT PART OF THE TEAM. \r\nWhen they ping? its brushed off\r\nwhen they need help, it gets ignored.\r\nWhen the match is lost, its automatically their fault. \r\n\r\nI have been told by adcs &quot;ur job is to die so adc can live&quot;\r\nand yet again these same adcs will talk about how much of a &quot;troll feeder&quot; support is. \r\n\r\nSo Consider this fair warning. If you want to treat me as expendable, dont get mad and throw a tantrum when I decide Not to waste my time buying sightstone, support items, or providing vision. Its a waste if all the adc is gonna do is throw support to the enemy team to save thier own skin then turn around and go &quot;wtf support, STOP DYING! OMG Report the troll Feeding support&quot; \r\n\r\nI am a support\r\nI am NOT your verbal punching bag\r\nI am NOT your personal Lane slave\r\nI am NOT YOUR MEAT SHIELD\r\nand I am definately most assuredly NOT YOUR SCAPEGOAT.\r\nIf you dont even see your support as part of the team, then they have no obligation to provide vision for you. \r\nSo I guess the team will actually have to learn to buy more wards.","replies":[{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2016-11-18T08:27:53.699+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had ADCs that purposly let me die.

True, when they don't blame the jungler first. Seems that kind of ADC's do not have the intellectual capacity to realize that hard blaming a guy won't encourage him to do better.

Often supports can die for something as little as poor minion manipulation.

You may get shot down even if it's a really good matchup but instalocking anyway makes you no better than a troll, regardless of the outcome. Unfortunately as a support the team comes first.

This can indeed cause a problem, and can usually be rude towards your teammates who may not want that. This can also agitate your team and get blame shifted onto you quickly if you are not performing as well as a traditional support would.\n\n**However**, this mostly applies to ranked since the stakes are much higher, and players want their team playing at their best. Especially since these are random strangers who don't know your skill with said build/champ and intent when it comes to playing something off-meta or different. \n\nLooking at your match history, Damagefox, you usually play normals with some ranked. This is where I agree with you that what you're playing is not an issue and is perfectly okay to test builds and play off-meta supports that normally may not work well in. Normals are meant for experimenting and having fun, so no one should be flaming you or expecting perfection in such a game. Players should be respectful towards your choices when playing normals since that mode is meant for that. How can anyone learn what works and doesn't work if they aren't allowed to play it?\n\nHowever, in Ranked, please be considerate towards your teammates (not just the ADC) when it comes to playing something many don't normally see or are used to.\n\nI'm not saying either of you are right, but neither are you two wrong. I am just trying to point out that there are acceptable times for off-meta builds/strategies/supports, and times where you may need to play something more optimal to help your team win. \n\nAlso, keep in mind it is best to let others know ahead of time what you want to play if it's off-meta or unheard of if you do decide to take it to Ranked. I myself like playing off-meta supports (used to play Sej support and Jhin Support), but usually I try to be polite to my team and ask if they're okay with it before I select. Same goes for strategies that aren't normally seen like duo jungle or duo top.\n\nJust my thoughts though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MegaV78G87","date":"2016-11-18T14:30:37.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best bet is to find a good ADC to duo with that is okay with off meta picks for support.","replies":[{"poster":"Damagefox","date":"2016-11-18T15:20:35.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its gotten so bad I really cant trust most (if not all) adcs.","replies":[{"poster":"MegaV78G87","date":"2016-11-18T17:56:44.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Damagefox,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KpZGlG8V,comment-id=000c0000,timestamp=2016-11-18T15:20:35.033+0000)\n>\n> Its gotten so bad I really cant trust most (if not all) adcs.\n\nYeah those good players that stay with the game and are not toxic are hard to find sometimes.

All was fine until I noticed that the enemy's fed Leblanc had just respawned. We were about around where the 2nd tier mid tower is. Upon noticing her respawn, I pinged 3 times for Ezreal to back off and began to turn away from him, expecting him to follow. Instead of leaving, he chose to keep chasing Wukong, leading to his death by the hands (Scepter) of Leblanc. He then went into chat with \"wow, can't believe Leblanc is so fed.\"\n\nLike, \"wow. had you just listened to my pings and ran, you wouldn't have to worry about how fed she is.\" I'm seriously sick of no one listening to my pings when I play Support.
