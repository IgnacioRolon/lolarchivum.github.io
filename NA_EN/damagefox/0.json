The whole game revolves around them. \r\nIf they die ONCE, the game is over. If thier team dies for ANY REASON, it is automatically &quot;report for intentional feed&quot; (despite just watching 3 enemy players ambush the player) \r\nThis community will not hesitate to tilt thier team to achieve thier own desired &quot;perfect game&quot;. \r\nTeammates will sit and let thier team die just to preserve thier own KDA (Teamfight breaks out: &quot;I cant help you, I might die&quot;)\r\nPeople are so hungry for thier &quot;S&quot; that they dont even want to play the game anymore. I think thats why people are so quick to call GG after ONE death. They wont get thier precious &quot;S&quot; grade so there is no reason to play the actual match. \r\n\r\nThis toddler community is so hung up on THIER OWN EGO. The &quot;Solo carry&quot; mentality that they are happy to tilt and sabotage thier own team because THEY THEMSELVES arent the center of attention. This community has NO interest in helping new players, just tellng them how complete garbage they are and how they need to go die because they arent playing at a CHALLENGER level from GAME 1. \r\nI have on many occations said OUTright that &quot;I am new with this character, any build reccomendations?&quot; or &quot;whats the best way to use this champ?&quot; and what I get back is either silence, or &quot;Stfu noob&quot; and then later on the player will turn on me and remind me just how garbage I am every 5 seconds. After I told them I was NEW with a particular champ....they try and &quot;/all &quot;report X for feeding&quot; \r\nwhy? because I wasnt instantly challenger with them so I ruined thier chance of getting an S and therefore removed ANY incentive for them to play the game. \r\n\r\nThis community has become so hung up on thier own superiority, the disgusting sense of smugness, that if the game doesnt go exactly how they want, or presents ANY sort of challenge, these toddlers completely break down and go afk in spawn. they pull an &quot;Im done&quot; and will sit in spawn commenting on how trash the rest of the team is, who now has to work HARDER because the player throws a tantrum and treats thier BRUISED EGO like a SEVERED LIMB. These people dont CARE about working with thier team, they dont CARE about objectives. They dont CARE about Wins. \r\nWhat they DO CARE ABOUT is:\r\n- Having the most kills\r\n-Bragging to their teammates about how &quot;op&quot; they are\r\n- talking down to and demanding everyone else play how THEY want. \r\n- Taking ALL the kills and calling &quot;ks&quot; on anyone else besides them who gets a kill\r\n- reminding the rest of thier team (And the other team through all chat) just how &quot;trash garbage&quot; they are, how much they &quot;suk&quot; at the game. \r\n\r\nI am growing less and less interested in playing how or what they want me to play. Not because I am trying to break the meta or create some new &quot;flavor of the month&quot; meta. But because I really dont see any point in communicating with a bunch of spoiled, egotistical toddlers who Dont care that there are 2 other lanes on the map (Talking about the &quot;ivory tower&quot; top laners who never leave top even at the cost of thier base) and there are 4 OTHER players on the team (Talking to players who only care about &quot;All about me&quot;) \r\n\r\nSo yeah, Riot it is really time to retire the summoners code. No one uses it, those who try to use it are laughed right off the game. It is treated like a joke (a bad one). I would probably have more fun babysitting a preschool of ACTUAL toddlers, rather than dealing with the crying screaming little ego toddlers I get when I que up for a ranked match that requires teamwork and strategy. Instead I get a bunch of kids who treat the game like a call of duty free for all where the ONLY thing that matters to them is &quot;I got more kills than u&quot;. And even if the match ends in a loss, they will still brag about how &quot;look at my kills, ur trash, u just suk at the game&quot;. \r\n\r\nRiP: Summoners code - 2017","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-19T03:11:40.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So where are you in this?

But I dont sit there for 20+ Minutes, beating a player over the head with a mistake they made at  the 5 min mark and carrying on reminding them just how Garbage they are every 10 seconds. I learn best through trial and error, I am in no way perfect, I only do the best I CAN do. I have no delusions that I am some \"gods gift to league\" player. I do my best, but the game requires ALL players to work together. Not One player sit back and throw the rest of thier team at the enemy so they can jump in and clean up kills, Then tell thier teammates how garbage they are at the game for dying to the enemy team. \n\nI have flaws, I screw up. But at least I am willing to admit them, and not throw a temper tantrum after going 0/1 because I wont get an \"S\".","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-01-19T03:24:52.949+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really sucks that you have a high percentage of toxic people in your games, but it isn't fair to the decent people in the community to lump them together with the toxic people by calling the community as composed of nothing but toddlers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-19T03:24:53.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why i play ARAM almost exclusively, since season 6.
