Your constant demands that people play how YOU want, or that people play to YOUR standards. really serve as a source of frustration and division. \n> \n> Seriously, If all you care about is yourself, Please remove yourself from a team based game!\n> and get over yourself.\n\nK now for the otherside of the story. You picked zilean because you were pissed you had to support, you intentionly bomb every wave you can in hopes of grabbing CS all under the guise of \"harassing the enemy\", you build 100% ap and rarely if ever ward. The old I am too good to support so ill play some AP and disguise myself as support but really i am just going to try to carry as a support ap.\n\nyou like average 50 cs as support, you always have ignite, mostly build ap, die constantly have a 30% win rate with like 60 games as support zilean but yes keep pretending it isnt you....","replies":[{"poster":"Damagefox","date":"2015-11-09T20:48:08.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its so cute how you -think- you know me.

I play a champ who's abilities do MAGIC DAMAGE so I build AP. Its soooo cute the way you are trying to make it out like logic is such a bad thing. \nIf a champ does PHYSICAL DAMAGE...I build AD\nIf a champ does MAGIC DAMAGE....I build AP\nIf a champ does a little of both. I Build BOTH.\n\nYou really have no clue why I play the champs I do, Why I choose to play support, or the strategies I am trying to set up, so please stop trying to make these false reasonings for my actions. \nThank you and have a nice day. \nYou know NOTHING about me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-11-09T22:52:49.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The irony of this is that it then assumes that your issues over-ride his, putting you at the center of everything.\n\nNot saying the guy reacted right, but then yelling about him reacting that way and saying he had no right to will put the center around you and believing him to have to abide by your rulings.\n\nWhile that's not necessarily a wrong thing to do (sometimes you know better, they don't), but there's inherent hypocrisy in crying about them being self-conceited while being self-conceited.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Totalis","date":"2015-11-09T18:11:59.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"#bronzeVproblems\n\nalso that \"making 5 people happy and 4 people unhappy\" thing was hilarious. +1 to the troll","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-11-09T17:58:04.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait...i didnt think my ex wife played league{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ARoninInDisgrace","date":"2016-01-12T16:40:26.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how this topic has people yelling like something other than bragging rights are at stake.

Bomb is still stuck to him as she gives up and he dashes away. Timebomb goes off, Voli goes pop. Zilean (Me) gets the kill, and ADC proceeds to lose her mind over how I am \"stealing her kills\". I told her I cant control when the bomb goes off. I wasnt trying to take the kill, she just happened to chunk down voli enough (before giving up and running back to tower) that the Q was able to finish voli off. She acts like I had timed it that way or had somehow magically been able to control the Q detonation. \n\nBut that doesnt matter, she proceeds to rage, insult, and flame me, then declares she is gonna feed because I chose not to be her verbal doormat and went to help Mid. we won despite her feeding. But just another case of Entitled Diva ADCs having a fit because things arent going thier way or something happens that they (or anyone else) can controll. \n\nI am 1-1 in my series but hesitant to finish it off. For fear I will get another player like this (but wont be so lucky) and once again Lose series #11 (lost 10 promos in a row thanks to these players) \n(My first loss was from a 5v2, Our jungler quit because..I dunno, we didnt run to help him fast enough so he pulled a \"No help? Ok Bye\" move and quit, Mid just quit midway into the game, and the 3rd player quit a little later because...had to go to school or something)","replies":[]}]}
