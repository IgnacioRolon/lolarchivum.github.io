Whether they believe the stereotype of white kids being spoiled rich brats or not doesn't matter, its the fact that it is not seen as offensive that is causing a problem. There is a lot of history behind the white stereotype of arrogance, entitlement and snobby brattiness, this comes from when white people actually believed they were superior. Also, until recently although its still somewhat true, white males have the highest potential for being successful in life, so i dont think it is wrong of me to say that a lot of high class people tend to be white.
