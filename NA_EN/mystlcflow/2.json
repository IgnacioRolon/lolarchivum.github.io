Probably the worst one yet.\n\nWhile I think it's great when they enhanced the visual aesthetic (Poppy, Tristana) when they start heavily changing their lore and gameplay changes it ruins the game for me. If they want to make such huge changes why not make an entirely new champ? They all feel so clunky and less fun to play. Not all champs need to have 10 passives (Kled) and super high outplay skillshots (Yassuo).  I cringe whenever I see a \"rework\" trailer now. Aatrox literally a Riven/Swain clone.\nOnly reason im playing now is because urf is back on the pbe, once it's gone im uninstalling again. \nMissed having fun with this game.","replies":[{"poster":"MYSTlCFLOW","date":"2018-06-19T01:13:01.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah perfect examples of where it would be great if you could have a scroll bar and choose one of the two, with clear visual differences so enemies would know the difference, \n\nI agree with all these points but seeing Fizz threw me off lmaooo, took me 5 seconds, I think you're talking about his ultimate now having damage based on how far it travels\n\n\nbut yeah riot is a big enough company, if they want to update lore.. I don't exactly care but keep the damn champions an option if they aren't breaking the game, I hate how team reliant new zac is                 and I kind of miss seeing old fiora's ultimate dashing around like a Master Yi Q XD\n\n\"If they want to make such huge changes why not make an entirely new champ?\" yeah except for the most part like Zac, fizz, xin, kind of irelia? Maokai champs like that have \"most\" or 2 ability's from their old kit so I can see why they wouldn't want a new entirely seperate champion, for example old galio flashes presses R then new galio R's onto old galio and taunts a second time? XD over powered just give us an option to choose from galio 1.0 or galio 2.0, and when one is banned so is the other","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Patrozzo","date":"2019-08-29T13:34:17.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MYSTlCFLOW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mwVWBrX0,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-19T00:26:02.606+0000)\n>\n> I just feel like unless a champion had series issues there is no reason for riot to not just keep them in the game and call the new ones 2.0 for example old zac was never OP or under powered and nobody asked for a rework yet they removed what made him fun for me at least, his mobility and ability to carry games without having to solely rely on a team, he was an ap fighter who could build full ap.

Some champs had small but dedicated playerbases who learned them inside out despite them being awful, and then their inherently broken mechanics shone through and made the game hell for those playing against them.","replies":[{"poster":"MYSTlCFLOW","date":"2018-06-19T02:08:14.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did say in the first sentence \"unless the champion had serious issues\"  my personal main selfish concern is zac, nobody asked for the rework, nobody complained about him, he had a fun engaging kit and now his winrate is anywhere from 44-46%. all because riot wanted a different kit (which is completely fine but let me play old zac)\n\nyeah I acknowledge that sure there are champions we just don't want back, idk ap yi, old sion? (idk if old sion had problems or not)   but.. I mean prime example is old urgot, maybe he was weak, maybe there was no reason to play him, with the same coin there is no reason to remove him from the mains that loved him, nobody was crying that he was too good xD people who didn't like old urgot just didn't play him\n\nto be honest I played old shen quite a bit(had skins like frozen shen), Haven't played a SINGLE game of new shen xD i saw that he has a sword that moves places and said... nah","replies":[]}]}]}
