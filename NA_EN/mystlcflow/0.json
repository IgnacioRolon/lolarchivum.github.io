Suboptimal is an opinion based comparison.  What is optimal?  What is too suboptimal?  Builds vary.  Riot themselves have an idea what they think works for a champ and has been wrong before often in the past.\n\nThen you can just say \"Have the system go by what is most frequently built\".  That has flaws as well.  Look at Banner of Command... Saw ZERO play and it's incarnation was completely unchanged for the longest time until it was simply mentioned in Patch Notes about \"Yes this applies to Baron buff and BoC\" then it was super meta quickly.  It's really hard to judge because 'optimal' really means meta, and meta is based on how people feel about a champion and what they think is good.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lotus Bloom","date":"2018-07-04T03:30:50.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering that manaless champions cannot stack Tear of the Goddess, or Archangel's Staff it should be considered trolling.

As previously mentioned by others if they are still playing to win then odds are that it's not going to be punished.\n\nAs the effects of these items are the main reason they purchased Riot could, and probably should, just set up the items to where they are unbuyable by manaless champions, however I find this highly unlikely to ever occur.\n\n**-- Snippets from the League of Legends Wikia --**\n\n\"MANA CHARGE on Tear of the Goddess and Archangel's Staff requires mana expenditure in order to charge, making it impossible for manaless to charge either of those.

XD I'm pretty sure it's pretty objective that if a {{champion:154}}  gets a archangels or manamune that he's not trying/trying with a fair degree, to win the game,  I mean those items cost a lot.. and the main purpose is the mana it gives.

Look at Renekton.  He EXCELS with Essence Reaver, but has 0 mana.  Therefore, he has 0 benefit of part of its build path nor it's one passive.  I'm not sure with Archangels and Manamune.  However, it could be just someone inexperienced not knowing exactly what to do with Zac (and deciding to build AP and those items since he's some mid main who likes champs that happen to build that or is an Ezreal main).  That's the fundamental issue.  Is the person I'm doing with just inexperienced at this champ or is he trolling the team?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2018-07-04T03:11:53.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i see no reason to get either but if you wanna put urself in a worst position to win well no one can stop you","replies":[]}]}
