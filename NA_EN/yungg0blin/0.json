If you think about it logically for a toxic player its easy to be toxic someone messes up well all they have to do is type on a keyboard and they say what they want. well if they are personally talking to you maybe 1 on 1 or however many people decide to connect to the team voice chat they are likely to be less toxic. As one they will likely receive immediate backlash by one or multiple members on the team for being toxic stoping a player in his tracks or two will get an apology for bad play immediately or will with voice look at what went wrong and will try to fix it. Now there&#039;s a lot of positive and negative factors you might want to look to and I would love to hear everyone else&#039;s ideas and thoughts on the implication of league voice. including how it affects the competitiveness of matches and how it applies to low elo games along with high. I would  love to see what other people think and how it will meta in terms of champions.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-16T00:37:51.404+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are making the mistake of thinking toxic players are capable of rational thought or care what anyone thinks.\n\nIt would just be a bunch of brats screaming at eachother while some guy blasts despacito remixes.","replies":[{"poster":"YungG0blin","date":"2018-12-16T21:42:31.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think toxic people have brains as well theres multiple reasons people are toxic but the little kids and yelling wiould he hilarious","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shi∆íter","date":"2018-12-16T00:43:30.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I for one have been asking for voice chat in-game for a while now. However verbal toxicity would be too hard to punish with voice chat and people would be able to pretty much say whatever they want/be as toxic as they want with voice chat.\n\nWhich could lead to riot implementing a system where you get penalties based on how many reports you've gotten rather than if you actually typed something/said something offensive. Which of course in turn would lead to the reporting system being abused. But i agree in general, i don't like typing and communication would be much better with voice chat.\n\nAlthough with most voice chat features in games, people tend to forget how to use it properly. People breathing into their mics, forgetting to bind push to talk  and hearing all their loud ass button pushing, playing loud music etc. It has it's upsides and downsides.\n\nAlthough for now you could just link a discord chat before the game starts, as most people do if you really want voice communication.","replies":[{"poster":"YungG0blin","date":"2018-12-16T21:41:55.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do that every single game i play","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-12-16T21:48:34.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have not played any TF2 or CS:GO if you think this would do anything about toxic players. You also have never experienced people with horrendous mics or people who live in a house with tons of others. Voice chat might deter a small amount of people from being toxic but it would also introduce a heck of a lot of other ways to annoy and frustrate others","replies":[]}]}
