This is something we *might* add later on.\nOur main objective, is to keep the game play space subdued and clear. If water splashes/footstep movements is not distracting or busy, then yes, we *might* add it to the river. :)","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2014-06-19T12:33:57.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if this is a primary concern for you, I'd suggest investigating how water splashes function in DotA2--if that isn't too disruptive, then it may be worth going through with. Hell, maybe even some similar effect outside of river (kicking up small bits of dust/dirt/etc.) might be worth considering.\n\nFor me, as cool as the new map is, it feels even more jarring than before to see champions just sliding around an inch above the visible terrain. Having those small details really helps ground champions in the playspace, and if it could be done, I think it would certainly be worthwhile.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-06-19T06:34:36.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"a simple and small ripple effect around where the foot lands seems fitting to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheKillinGodJoko","date":"2014-09-03T00:13:05.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much........Never thought Riot actually checked the comments lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salidror","date":"2014-06-18T22:33:06.359+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could make it like shadows, if your toaster can't handle them you have an option to turn them off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheKillinGodJoko","date":"2014-06-18T15:37:16.003+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would make it cool and more realistic if we could see the footsteps if the champions in river but it should disappear quickly so enemy cant tell if a team is at barron or drag.","replies":[]},{"poster":"welch florence","date":"2014-06-19T02:48:54.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely a good idea, although it should only be visible if the champion is visible.

Right now the game runs on just about anything. adding effects like this would possibly exclude players.  \n\nBefore my upgrade, I was able to run the game on a 10 year old duo core duo (1.8ghz) with ATI 2400 HD graphics card getting 30-50 frames.  \n\nGame loaded fairly fast, I was usually middle of pack.  Over 1/2 of the people loaded slower than me, and I would not want to run the computer personally on anything less than that. So I have no idea what people run this game on, but it's mice with toasters I think.","replies":[]}]}
