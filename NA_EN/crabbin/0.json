Minor annoyance, which has been going on since the last patch.\r\n\r\nI have two friend groups, which we'll call A(general) and B(best friends). I prefer to have A on top, and B below. But, every day(not every client restart), the groups reset to B on top, and A on bottom. I'm not sure if it's resetting based on alphabetical order, by the default(general) group on top, or what. I just don't know why it's doing this from the last patch.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-07T22:58:36.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!

It's also possible your newly Renamed Group will or will not move.  This is okay.\n\n\n3. **Rename a second Group and also move it up or down after it repositions.**  The client will possibly again freeze for a few seconds, but the Group should now move and any and all Groups can now move without renaming.\n\n\nYou can rename your Groups back to their original names and they will stay in their positions.  Further, if you relog the client and move your groups the Client will no longer freeze for a few seconds and your groups will move as needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Haldegon","date":"2015-01-09T04:54:58.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I ran into something interesting.  I've been unable to move my groups for a bit now and it was annoying but I just tested something out. One of my groups originally was alphabetically after \"General\" so just to test, I changed the name to have it before General and it moved.  Now I can move them freely.  Once I restarted I was still able to move then around freely...Not sure why but maybe if I bring it up it may help them with identifying the issue. *shrug*","replies":[]},{"poster":"EclipseLeonaOnly","date":"2015-01-08T03:14:22.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the very same issue, except that I have 4 friend groups (close friends, other friends, colleagues, and general) and I want the general group to be on the bottom while the colleague group is right above it.
