Asking for reports is negative. Any complaints are negative. Any insults are verbal. Not grouping probably has a category. The jury is out on picking off meta/off role with the Support Nunu situation since they banned then unbanned him, amongst other issues.\n\n>The notion that if a false report leads to the detection of genuine bad behavior, then they should turn a blind eye to it is nonsensical.

If you get reported the next game legitimately, then it's a fair ban.\n\nAgain though, that all depends on how far back Riot is going here, which is a big question that needs answered. How many games do Rioters look back on when justifying bans? Is there a set number of games or is it up to the staff member to decide? If there is no set amount of games, it would leave the door open for interpretation and that's never good.\n\nWe also have another issue with the various reporting categories. Verbal, negative and offensive language are all 3 different categories. Do all players know this and/or care? I'm doubtful of that. I'm personally a revenge reporter and if you get me mad, I'm going to pick 3 categories to report you in because I can. We also do know, when you get banned, it doesn't specify whether it was for negative or verbal, even though they are separate things. Mine says \"extremely inflamatory and offensive\", but yet I didn't use swear words or use offensive verbiage. That's no report category, so I would think the verbal and negative reports counted together even though they are separate things.

People really care about what happens and people are putting money into this game through IP boosts and buying champs. Not to mention how much time this game takes. It's an investment, not a game.

It doesn't right now. \n\nRiot is also not clear on what negative attitude vs verbal abuse is, even when they ban you as they don't ban you for one or the other. They ban you under a different term, which replies than negatives and verbals stack. And if Riot doesn't know the difference, then how can the players who get to report people for 3 categories and don't care anyway? That's the real stuff we are talking about with bogus reports. Negative and verbal are very different, yet Riot counts them together and players are going to revenge report in their 3 category maximum because no one has gotten punished over false reporting for a long time.\n\nAnd as I've stated, due to Riot's tolerance being so low for bad behavior, I think 95% of players could easily be banned if someone looked through their history, if calling someone a retard is all it takes.
