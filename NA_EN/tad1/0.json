I run the 1070, with Ryzen 1600, 16gb 2666 ram and everything is on an SSD. \r\n\r\nMax settings (1080p) - 120~ FPS\r\nMin settings (1080p) - 130~ FPS\r\n\r\nTake about 10-15 FPS off the above when I play in 1440p, but roughly the same. I have disabled vsync and character lining for potential increase but it actually drops my FPS by about 5 or so when I disable those settings. My computer is already on high performance settings and the card is at stock settings (1600MHz core, 4007MHz mem). \r\n\r\nI am having low FPS issues in other games as well, but I still cannot find a solution or reason as to why LoL is only getting 120 or less FPS with a 1070.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nTad","replies":[{"poster":"Cpt Savage27","date":"2017-11-09T18:41:28.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a i5 6500 + 8g ram + rx 480 8g and my fps only go at 105 fps in minimum and max settings","replies":[]},{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2017-08-02T21:11:27.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasn't I reading something the other day on how GeForce using gsync or something so that you don't have tearing? (Ie when your frames are 400+ in league the game is laggy/tears because it's better than the game can handle). This would reduce the frames down to refresh rates of your monitor or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T17:35:13.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely make sure your drivers are up to date, otherwise you may have fps issues no matter how good the card is.

As an additional step, try capping your frame rate to see if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
