(if people are willing to pay enough) Needless to say they would be full size and in proportion to the average human (so something likes fizz trident wouldn't be tiny.\n\nhttps://img0.etsystatic.com/106/0/12880509/il_570xN.960120330_4t52.jpg\nYou can expect it to be this type of quality.\nHere are just some designs of project leonas and scorched earth renekton. These are just the shape that the sheet metal would need to be before a lot of hand work would go into them.\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/f5b7be4.png\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/0288db0.png\nEven if your weapon wasn't from league it could be from another game like warframe.\nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/22b3027.png\n\nI could also make your weapon designed as a real weapon or as a decoration wall mount.\nFor this project yi sword from globator (who im friends with) it would cost £3000 on his esty page. https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/290371277/full-metal-league-of-legends-weapon?ref=market\n\nIf you really do
