He was a strong top laner when you could build mana/armor tank for his passive, that was when I played him. And he was a permaban in what I remember to be elo hell (900-s when elo was still a number) but he seemed to have fallen out of popularity lately. Only seen 3 in the past 4 months, one which I was playing myself lol. He might be strong but I think blitz and thresh seem to be overshadowing him in the support role (based on frequency of appearances anyway)","replies":[]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-04-05T16:21:33.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people never did this, but I tended to max E on him. 320 base damage burst at level 5?
