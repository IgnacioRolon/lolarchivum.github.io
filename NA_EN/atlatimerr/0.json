Or does the xp boost stay for 30 days no matter the amount of wins?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T19:38:48.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"30 days and 30 per win are totally independent, you could technically have both enabled.  30 days don't count how many games you play, just the days so you can go all out if you feel the need.  Our [Breakdown ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752824)guide also goes into specifics about how much XP you may expect with these boosts, I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-16T06:49:11.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it was just a form of laziness, or a way of reducing memory usage, as both the days and the wins boosts have that same text. 30 days boost should be applied for 30 x 24 hours after purchasing, while the wins boost should be applied after each win without having an actual time limit. I believe they also stack, so you could get both the win and day boost at the same time.\n\nIn short, the 30 day boost should last all 30 days, regardless of whether you win 30 games, more, or less.\n\nAfter trying both of them out myself (it's been a while since I've used boosts), I can confirm that the day boost is not affected by the number of wins, and is applied whether you win or lose, whereas the win boost is applied per win, and does not affect your experience in a loss. They do work together if you have both boosts active.","replies":[]}]}
