Afterwards, I got leavebuster for 20min for 5 games. Right now, Riot is trying to fix it (which is a Riot's problem), but the system gives me penalty. Is there a way to fix leavebuster which is not my fault?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T17:27:02.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current offline error message is currently being investigated, and we have a[ workaround pinned](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Tb1fUZFV-known-issue-were-unable-to-log-you-in-because-you-may-be-offline).
