I recent invested in a Steam Vive and got Tilt Brush. Its an Art program for Virtual Reality. My friends said I should make a Poro.  SOO I painted a Poro, took a pic and was able to make a .gif (cuz tiltbrush makes that stupid easy)   its ALLL in the link.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think :3\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z1quQBQ.png \r\n\r\nI previously posted this, but Riot deleted it {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} and said i need to move it to this board, soooo HERE it is [again] {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-06-30T15:08:13.197+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love roomscale VR :D\n\nGood shape on the body of the poro, though those are quite unusual shapes for its horns - I think they're more often a tight curl, close to the head/body.  The tongue is appropriately massive, but maybe a little pointed at the end.\n\nLove your use of brushes too - was the long bristles brush not a good fit for the fur?  I could imagine it didn't convey the softness of a poro so I trust your choice :D\n\n(Also really?  Not the snowy/snowman background?  Missed opportunity ;))","replies":[{"poster":"LewdPenetration","date":"2016-07-01T01:01:13.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im still working on learning the VR hahaha. I discovered that i can have reference pics in the actual program. That will make a new and improved Poro look way better than one from memory. I discovered that there is a \"pipe\" brush that an become really tiny and can act as a sketch frame or outline of somthing. Did it for an anime character. Animals are  way way easier than people\n{{summoner:3}}   also i didn't even think about snow biome lolol\n{{champion:20}} ","replies":[]}]}]}
