Much like warmongers wanting war, there are toxic people who enjoy being toxic.

I've made posts about this, the issue here is that players refuse to move onto other games. They know they are having a poor time and not enjoying themselves, but they're addicted after years of playing and don't know what to do with themselves if they're not playing this. I speak from experience. Played since season 4, loved the game and was super hooked, played nothing but this for years straight, when the game started going downhill in my own opinion I still continued to play. I played for the few games that I managed to enjoy and just muscled through the games that I didn't which were far more common. This resulted in me becoming toxic, inting out of frustration, doing things I never would have done before and have never done in another game. I assume this is the same for a lot of others, the community would be far better and games more enjoyable if people would realize they're not enjoying this game anymore and just move on. \n\nSomething you should take into consideration is if you still like this game and if not, is it getting to you like I described. You say you love this game, but dislike the community, well the community is the game almost. Yes there's a lot to this game besides the players, but when you play, you have to play with others and work together to win. \n\nI quit partly because of the game as I said before, but also because having to rely upon and team with others resulted in the game being un-enjoyable. If I do really good but some lanes feed, then what's the point? I know my efforts do matter but it hardly ever felt that they mattered enough to make a difference. This was part of my consideration when I decided to quit the game because this directly effects the gameplay, so don't just ignore it as a separate matter. \n\nThe game won't be changing anytime soon or ever, the community will always be toxic, so look within yourself and ask if how much you enjoy the game itself overcomes the shortcomings of the community. If not, then I say look to another game, move on like many others, there are many others great games out that don't force you to rely upon others and deal with them being toxic. Get on steam and checkout Terraria, Hollow Knight, Subnautica, Portal, Rimworld, something cheap that you can get a lot of enjoyment out of and just compare your experience. I found myself truly enjoying myself for once when I tried those games and that opened my eyes to how miserable I was in comparison when playing league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faneseeker","date":"2018-11-30T20:15:23.799+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":25,"body":"Guess what, you are part of the player base.","replies":[{"poster":"rubberduckie666","date":"2018-11-30T21:27:40.126+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Faneseeker,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EUFXEbEt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-30T20:15:23.799+0000)\n>\n> Guess what, you are part of the player base.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEPrruRXoAAHi7T.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Faneseeker","date":"2018-11-30T22:35:24.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":14,"body":"love the guy that is always playing devil's advocate.

Sadly, that comes with the territory. Often, players tend to value themselves based on their games (they have to be perfect), combining this with the lack of accountability for one's actions that comes with online and you get all of this that you're talking about. When one thinks games are their way of life, the only thing that gives value to their existence, they get upset and angry when things don't go their way, and since we're online, they can take it all out on other people doing whatever they please to make others feel bad for \"ruining everything\" for them since they don't really have to face any consequences. Being banned comes few and far between and that doesn't affect them personally or cause them to change anything about themselves since they don't have to. They wait while their ban ticks down and take their gaming somewhere else. It's a hard, toxic cycle that's difficult to change since this behavior is institutionalized and normalized so it becomes a part of the status quo, the society, here. And once it gets there, it's extremely difficult to change and will take a while to change. These are my thoughts and observations on all of this in lieu of the social courses I'm taking as well as the obvious patterns that pop up. I hope it doesn't miss the mark, but this is what I've experienced and think about it.
