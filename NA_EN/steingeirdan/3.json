I really don&#039;t, you know it would save a lot of bitching from your community if you actually put time into discussing &quot;Hmmmm, after testing out the new Dark Harvest, maybe it&#039;s a little too strong. Lets go ahead and not go through with the change.&quot; You also don&#039;t seem to like to listen to your community at all anymore, legitimately pulling a Blizzard Entertainment right now. You won&#039;t fucking nerf Duskblade, you won&#039;t fucking nerf rune damage, you won&#039;t fucking nerf ignite, you won&#039;t fucking nerf any CertainlyT champion, but if you do, it&#039;s months later, etc. \r\n\r\nYou just do not give a fuck, and it really pisses me off as a player who&#039;s been playing your game for 7 years. The game didn&#039;t used to be like this, at all. Yes, there was DFG, but that was it. The game was run off of stat checking and outplaying. Now, every fucking champion, and every fucking champion that gets reworked has some god damn mobility and damage creep.\r\n\r\nGalio? Dash and Global ultimate. \r\nSion? Global ultimate.\r\nAkali? Even more mobility than she had before.\r\nirelia? Even more mobilty than she had before.\r\nLissandra? Lets give her more damage.\r\nNunu? Lets give him more mobility.\r\nVladimir? Lets give him more damage.\r\nWarwick? Lets give him more mobility.\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m also sick and fucking tired of the god damn game being balanced around professional play, and champions literally getting reworked for professional play. But hey, fuck over the other 80 million active players a month for that. Go for it, knock yourselves out.","replies":[]}
