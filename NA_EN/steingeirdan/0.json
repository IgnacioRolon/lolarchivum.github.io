The whole &quot;Well new players would just buy accounts and ruin ranked&quot; got resolved because of how the new placement system works, so they&#039;ll just get placed in Iron 4 regardless. \r\n\r\nIt would also address the smurfing problem in low level games, for it&#039;s legitimately filled with them, and are generally insanely toxic. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don&#039;t see any reason not to.","replies":[]}
