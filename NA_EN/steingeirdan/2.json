No, don&#039;t nerf it. Get rid of it COMPELTELY. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UrEJZnW.png\r\n\r\nWhile you&#039;re at it, get rid of any damage rune in the fucking game. I am sick and tired of this shit, I really am. I don&#039;t know who the fuck is instructing the balance team to make these stupid ass changes, but they honeslty need to be fired immediately and thrown on the side of the road. There is absolutely no excuse for this shit, **EVER**. I don&#039;t care who the fuck they are, they&#039;re clearly incompetent, they clearly have no fucking clue what the fuck balance is, and they clearly do not give a flying fuck about their playerbase. \r\n\r\nBillion dollar company and you seem to have 0 brain function of what is balanced and what isn&#039;t. You honestly believe that DH, Duskblade, or any fucking certainlyT champion is OK balance wise? You&#039;re fucking out of your minds, you really are.","replies":[]}
