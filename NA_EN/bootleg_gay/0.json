Being born with five eyes, he was mocked many times, but traveling eventually showed him that everyone is special in their own unique way. He claims that he can see the future using his five eyes, but out of a mixture shame and modesty, keeps them veiled behind a beautiful gold mask. Now he has joined the League of Legends to try to test what he has learned, using magic taught to him by masters from around the world, even if he himself was never truly good at it.\r\n\r\n_**Appearance-**_\r\n\tIvelo has incredibly long black hair, with golden stars hanging from it. He has a midnight blue, shoulder cape on, and a gold shoulder cap on the other. His mask is a gold star, with five holes around it for his five eyes. One eye, the top eye, it completely vertical, while the other four are slanted to match the shape of a star. He wears no shoes, and is a bit pale. His ability&#039;s use gold and dark blue particles, along with lots of dust-like effects. \r\n\r\n_**ABILITIES**_\r\n\r\n**Passive- Star Charms**\r\n\tEvery so often, Ivelo will ready a Charm, which hangs from his long hair and waits for allies to click on them. When they do, they will be pulled to him and will be carried by Ivelo for a few seconds, during which they are untargetable. Later levels lower the cooldown of this passive as well as allow him to carry extra Charms. When the Charm ends, the ally will drop behind Ivelo for enemy champions. The same champion cannot grab more than one Charm within 10 seconds. \r\n\tRange- 800\r\n\tDuration- 2/2.5/3/3.5 at levels 1/6/11/16\r\n\tStatic Cooldown- 60/45/30/15 at levels 1/6/11/16\r\n\tCharges Held- 1/2/3/4 at levels 1/6/11/16\r\n\t\r\n**Q- Five Point Blade**\r\n\tIvelo throws a star shaped blade that splits into five little bolts at maximum range, or if it hits an enemy unit. The bolts spread out, seek out, and damage five enemies, but can strike the same target if less than five are present. If it strikes a unit, the first bolt will automatically target it. \r\n\tEach bolt lowers the magic resistance of the unit hit. Stacking up to five times for each bolt. Prioritizes champions, but tries to hit multiple enemies, if present. \r\n\r\n\tMagic Damage (Per Bolt)- 10/20/30/40/50+(10% of AP)\r\n\tMagic Resist Shred- 2/3/4/5/6\r\n\tMana Cost- 20/25/30/35/40\r\n\tCooldown- 16/13/10/7/4\r\n\tRange- 700\r\n\tMissile Targeting Range- 400 Diameter from initial projectile\r\n\r\n**W- Gravity Pulse**\r\n\tIvelo winds up briefly before spinning, creating an area around him that shoves all enemy units away from him. Enemies knocked into walls or other enemies are slowed for 1 second. Minions and monsters are thrown twice as far. \r\n\t Ivelo can move while charging, and allies that grab Charms lowers the cooldown by half.\r\n\r\n\tMagic Damage- 100/150/200/250/300+(80% of AP)\r\n\tMana Cost- 80/85/90/95/100\r\n\tCooldown- 22/20/18/16/14\r\n\tSlow- 40/45/50/55/60%\r\n\tKnockback Distance- 400\r\n\tRadius- 500\r\n\r\n**E- Comet Veil**\r\n\tIvelo takes a brief moment to ready himself, then creates a large wall of shooting stars that sits for a few seconds. Allies that pass through it will gain bonus movement speed, and enemies that pass through it will take damage once while having all champion-granted buffs removed, including shields of all kinds. \r\n\tEnemies that do fact have champion-granted buffs on them will take extra damage and are slowed. \r\n\r\n\tMagic Damage- 30/50/70/90/110+(25% of AP)\r\n\tBonus Damage- 60/100/140/180/220+(50% of AP)\r\n\tMana Cost- 100/110/120/130/150\r\n\tCooldown- 30/27/24/21/18\r\n\tSlow- 20/30/40/50/60%\r\n\tSlow Duration- 0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5\r\n\tRange- 500\r\n\tVeil Width- 500/600/700/800/900\r\n\tVeil Duration- 3/3.5/4/4.5/5\r\n\r\n**R- Interstellar Rush**\r\n\tUpon first activation, Ivelo gains maximum charges of Charms possible at the time, bonus movement speed, and the ability to cast Star Jump once. Once Star Jump is cast, it cannot be canceled, and all allies attached to him via Charms will stay attached. Charms remain if Ivelo doesn&#039;t cast Star Jump, but are reset if he recasts, no matter how many allies travel with him. \r\n\tStar Jump- Ivelo takes a 4 second wind up, then launches himself at a target location on the map. He can bring with him all champions attached to him via Charms, and his landing is met with a burst of energy that deals damage to all enemies in the area. Ivelo also signals his presence to both teams, as well as announcing who will be traveling along with him. \r\n\r\n\tCharms Gained- 2/3/4\r\n\tBonus Movement Speed- 50/75/100%\r\n\t\r\n\tStar Jump Damage- 100/150/200+(20% of AP) Per Champion Traveling\r\n\tStar Jump Blast Radius- 700\r\n\tJump Range- 5000/5500/6500\r\n\tMana Cost- 200/200/200\r\n\tCooldown- 240/220/200\r\n\r\n_**Possible Voice Over-**_\r\n\tJoke- \r\n\t\t&ldquo;I can see.. uh&hellip; twice as much as you?&rdquo;\r\n\t\r\n\tDance- \r\n\t\tIvelo uses swinging motions, letting his hair twirl around. \r\n\r\n\tMoving- \r\n\t\t&ldquo;Let&#039;s carve the path.&rdquo;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Follow the stars.&rdquo;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Follow your dreams, summoner.&rdquo;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Ready for that battle.&rdquo;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Destiny? We&#039;ll find out.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\tWhen allies grab Charms-\r\n\t\t&ldquo;To me!&#039;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;I&#039;ll save you!&rdquo;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;\t\t\r\n\r\n\tCasting Gravity Pulse-\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Get back!&rdquo;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Destiny rejects you!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\tUpon casting Star Jump-\r\n\t\t&ldquo;The stars have aligned and the path is clear!&rdquo;\r\n\t\t&ldquo;Thank you for traveling star-line Ivelo!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n**_Strategy_**\r\n\r\nIvelo excels at holding ground. Using Comet Veil to block off entrance points, Ivelo threatens to weaken anyone not patient enough to walk through it. Along with his Gravity Pulse, he can keep allies safe and secure by holding off multiple angles of opponents at once. This becomes especially effective when wanting to take out towers, dragon, or keeping an enemy team split up. Sure the enemies can pass through Comet Veil, but at what cost. Movement speed bonuses are stopped, shields are broken, and to make it worse, jumps will only land them right in it. Of course, they always have that option, and the may end of simply waiting out the barrier. \r\n\r\nAs for Five Point Blade; well it makes him just as great at area control, as its&#039; low cooldown and area of effect damage, coupled with the magic resist shred, make it great for peeling for his team. \r\n\r\nFinally, his passive, Charms, help him keep allies safe, by giving them a way to get out of tricky situations, or by helping them get into a fight a bit faster. It isn&#039;t the greatest range, but since he can grab them over walls, it makes for a good safety measure. When combined with his ultimate, Ivelo becomes the master of objective control. Taking a tank or fighter with him, Ivelo can make quick work of towers, and when late game comes around, he&#039;ll be able to jump with a full team at his side, sieging towers, interrupting the enemy team, or for catching one or two enemies off guard. Granted, even enemies will see where and who Ivelo is traveling to and with, but with the right timing, he&#039;ll be able to take things using teamwork. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think of this champion concept. Note that numbers are definitely not accurate, as without internal testing, it&#039;s hard to account for them. It took a bit of time to get the skills right, but I find that he&#039;d be fun to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Xpecial Delivery","date":"2016-01-11T11:33:39.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI like your champion concept. The ideas behind the abilities are very impressive, however there is one major problem with this champion: TOO OVERLOADED. I'll explain what I mean:\n\nPassive: Tahm Kench W on allies along with (almost) the range of Thresh's Lantern\nQ: High damage (all together), Magic resist shredder, Insane Cooldown past rank 2\nW: Insane Magic damage (300 + 80% AP is too much for a normal ability), Large radius, Knock-back, Slow and basically a Sion's E on minions except in all directions\nE: Allied Movement speed buff, ANOTHER SLOW (with increasing duration this time), Does damage (ok the damage is reasonable) but REMOVES ALL BUFFS? Too much\nR: Tahm Kench ult that can carry more people, for a larger distance but also deals damage upon impact (Pantheon's Ult?)\n\nSee why this needs toning down?\n\nPersonally, I love the idea of your abilities. I had a champion concept similar to this one in mind and here would be my suggestions to make this guy balanced. Don't get me wrong, I really love this idea, but right now his Kit is too overloaded and too similar to other champions' to be a real thing. Now the suggestions might be a lot, so feel free to take as many as you want :)\n\n* Remove the range from her passive. They should be right next to her to be able to hop on.\n* Decrease the damage on Q. Make it so that champions can only be hit by a maximum of 2/3 things.\n* Increase the mana cost and cooldown of Q by a lot.\n* Greatly decrease the damage of W. Also, no need for minions to get double the knock-back\n* Remove damage from E. Debuff removing effect is enough\n* You can only have a slow on 1 of the abilities, pick either W or E (I prefer the W one)\n* Think of another idea for R. Right now it is basically a combination of other champion's abilities. I recommend a complete new idea\n* Try to make the R more of a supporting ability. Right now, this guy's 'support' aspect needs to be seen more\n\nThat's it for the suggestions. I really hope my feedback helps. Although it might not seem like it, I did not mean to come out as harsh (my friends tell me I have a problem with that). I really would like to see this champion concept shine and become a perfect one.\n\nFinally, although I really really like the lore, it kind of seems unrelated to the abilities and the champion as a whole. How do the 5 eyes fit? Which skill is knowledge-related?\n\nTo me, this guy fits more of a celestial being type of them (like soraka or bard). The whole star thing and his weird magic (buff removing is very weird XD) suits an 'alien' champion more than a human who has a lot of knowledge.\n\nAnyways, these are my thoughts on the champ. I hope you enjoy reading my feedback as much as I enjoy writing it XD\n\nCheers {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bootleg Gay","date":"2016-01-11T13:56:58.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=0oooDEATHooo0,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=rdH9yXLY,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-11T11:33:39.806+0000)\n>\n> Hey man,\n> \n> I like your champion concept.

W was also supposed to be shorter ranged, but I got a bit concerned for it. \n\nMana Cost on Q should be lowered, and I once thought of a numbers concept like Ahri's Fox Fires in which each bolt past the first dealt reduced damage. \n\nI could remove the damage from his ult completely honestly, and still be okay with it, but I like the idea of a grand entrance made by a whole team. Since it also tells enemies who and where it's going, I thought it might give some leeway. \n\nAs for the wall; I'd really like to keep that mostly untouched. Maybe remove the slow, but that's it. The buff removal is supposed to be a threat, and since he can't just target them and it has a windup (probably a range indicator for enemies too), I feel like it should mostly be used to block off entrances of make escaping harder. \n\nThank you for your helpful feedback though! I really appreciate it. Again, without actual testing, numbers itself are hard to make just right, so the concept itself is what I focus on.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to talk about the lore. I had a longer one written down, and guess what I did? I forgot the biggest plot point.
