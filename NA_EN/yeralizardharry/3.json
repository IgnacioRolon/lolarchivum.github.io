Unfortunately he is also super competitive and prideful to the point of being toxic. I've tried letting him know he needs to ignore the temptations/ inconsistencies of players but he refused to change for the most part. At the same time I still feel bad because he already spent about $40 worth of money on the game and like i said he really enjoys it, like hes a fps god and he ditched that for league lol. I'm pretty sure he's screwed but I would still like to post this anyway just in case a Riot member sees this and maybe give him another look at his punishment.\r\nP.S. he's had worse things to say but his chat log that resulted in how he got banned was like watching a old calbel video lol, didn't really seem that bannable tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T05:52:22.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't discuss other players accounts with anyone except the account creator, but your friend is always welcome to reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more context or ask exactly why the ban was placed.","replies":[]}]}
