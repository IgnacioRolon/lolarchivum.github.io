Is there a way to separate these ranked stats  on the client or is there a website i can use as I tend to try out new things in flex but usually stick to what I'm normally good at in solo queue. \r\n\r\nP.S. No idea if this effects this situation I have but I use the legacy client","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T19:11:48.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing, so it may not have all the data fleshed out for display just yet.  Be sure to share your feedback through the gear icon on the client or post it on the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards!  I don't really have a site to suggest in the meantime, as we don't have any we officially support and I'm not trying to accidentally get you flanked by spam.  :P  Thanks for the suggestions!","replies":[]}]}
