People are sheep. Whenever the cool guy in high school gets awesome new shoes, or a kick-ass headset, his friends, and in turn, their friends, and so on, tend to also buy similar, if not the same shoes, or headphones.\n\nThe pro players in the LCS, LCK and so on, are the cool people in highschool, and we are the people who think they are cool.\n\nNow how does this fit with your post? People see LCS/LCK players having succes on a champion, in this case Urgot. People think \"wow this champ is so strong, i should play it!1!!!11\"\nso naturally they spend their hard earned IP on this Urgot and queue up. they'll fail, because urgot requires some mechanical knowledge. but it's not bad if they fail, because they first have to learn how to play and what they can and can't do.\n\nnow for the players on his team, it's not fun to have a 0/5 urgot on their team. but how else do you expect people to improve? there's options like team builder, and coop vs AI games, but even then it takes some time. \n\nso in the end it comes down to a few things.\n\n1. people are sheeple\n2. people are going to copy the pro's, regardless of succes\n3. some people suck with champs they play for the first time.\n\nnow I do see where you're coming from, but it's wrong to say people shouldn't play a champ they have zero experience on, just because it might result in a loss.
