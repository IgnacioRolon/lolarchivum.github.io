Pushing your lane and gaining more pressure and control of the map, along with more CS and XP is going to be advantageous.\n\nYour jungler is most likely going to do 1 of 3 of those, If he isn't getting dragon but you guys can easily secure it then go to the dragon and ping. If he needs farm then let him farm, all the laners rape his jungle mid/late game anyway.\n\n> Your midlaner will have to sieze the opportunity and get the kill or the tower with help of jungler or top laner.\n\nRight. So leave them alone while they do that. The problem mid laners have is when the support and ADC come into lane and start taking farm and XP. Then they push the wave to the tower and the enemy mid laner defends it no problem. You are wasting everyones time. And only weakening your own midlaner. \n\nObviously come later into the mid game everyone is wandering and such but it is when the bot lane wins lane and instead of pushing there victory they decide to go mid and weaken the mid laner.\n\n> Just pushing is too much to ask from your teammates in soloQ.\nAnd even so, \"just pushing\" is still not enough if enemy ADC gets triple and several waves advantage.\n\nOh. Your whole scenario that you're giving me is basically, But what if my entire team is a bunch of monkeys? If you are in a team where every single person is dead set on farming and pushing lanes you weren't going to win anyway.\n\nNow in a normal game where people aren't as braindead as you say. The 2 top laners will stay top until one of them has a tower. \n\nMid lane will usually keep priority on keeping their own tower and wander down river for a kill or helping in any way such as at the dragon or to help bot lane if they lose their own tower.\n\nJungler will either be ganking, farming, or securing dragon.\n\nNow again, If you win your bot tower, and roaming hasn't started ward up and keep going. Do not go mid and pretend you are helping anyone but yourself by taking the CS from the mid laner, it is hard enough as it is to get CS during the lane phase we don't need you to take it from us. And keep the enemy pushed to their tower when you could be keeping pressure bot lane.  \n\nEventually someone somewhere in top or mid is going to leave to deal with bot lane, in which case the proper reaction for the team is to take the tower.\n\nBut you might ask what happens if you get stomped bot lane? Don't go to the friggin mid lane. Farm under tower, As an ADC you should be trying to make yourself not be useless.

Expecting people to sit still so you can last hit at that point is a bit ridiculous.\n\nHow ignorant is that, Thresh has the easier time with relic shield, not the hardest, because in order to get that execute you need to get in range, which often your opponent sees you trying to do and will poke you out. You should only go to the canon minions with early forms of relic shield, and you shouldn't sit next to it waiting for the hp to get lower. So when the adc gets it down to about 50% and you move in, then they use a skill to burst it, then wtf are you meant to do, you have no sympathy cause you clearly haven't been in that situation. It's not hard to last hit, but your adc can prevent you from doing so if they want to (non canon minions is different because there's usually one you can just hit quickly, but you waste a stack of the item for when the canon ones arrive)\n\nTo be clear, you can use the first two stacks on anything, and get you next one back by the time the first canon minion arrives, but after that you should save them where possible, hence it being difficult when your adc goes out of their way to secure minions, you were gonna share with them anyway\n\nLate game is different. First of all, I am talking mostly about situations where you've frozen a wave in front of a turret and are not pushing but waiting for allies who are farming jungle or still in base, you have all the time in the world to give your tank support some extra gold. Yes the item is not as effecient as others, doesn't mean you should make it harder.\n\nAnd as for last hitting, you attack animation is much slower than an adc's so what i am talking about is a wave of minions, all with low hp because of a skill just used. You want to hit 1, 4 if you're lucky, but your adc specifically targets the one your aiming for. They can kill any of them, but they aim at your one out of instinct (cause they don't want you to steal it) so you aim at the next one, and the next one, but you get 0 because they attack faster than you, even though you would wave clear faster if you split your focus and hit different ones, so it's not about push speed, it's about selfish habbits of adc's that have been playing before the introduction of FoTM or play often with mage supports and forget that your not stealing but sharing. \n\nI have actually saved charges of targons embrace for team fights and engages, because a well timed heal when the enemy flashes out of your melee range can give your adc that extra bit they need to win. I've saved lives with triple heal by killing minions (now I just play taric, it's easier) so timing and application of the item are important, but are hard if your adc isn't willing to work for you, they ALWAYS have the farming advantage, so it's not your own fault if they block you out","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-04-21T13:06:32.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh's AA is counted as ranged and therefore does not proc the execute feature on the Relic Shield items, only the gold sharing function, so he has a harder time last hitting charges than say Leona or Taric.\n\nThat being said, I agree with the rest of your post.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-21T13:20:38.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I don't play thresh, I just see him in action, fair enough, I post on these pages to learn anyway :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-04-21T02:12:23.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically once the adc gets their BFS, or once you're hanging around mid, you're probably only getting any cs if they go out of their way to let you.

Idiots top and mid losing the game, but we were so ahead bot we pulled it back, in all, it was quite even. We took mid inhib, we took nexus towers, but instead of backing, Cho tries to take nexus alone, dies, jungle goes alone, dies, top goes alone dies, this repeats for about 10 minutes (YEs ten minutes after taking nexus turrets we still can't finish) but we've now lose our inhib turret, one inhib and turret, and I think they took another before retreating.

I was support taric, struggling to hold back the seige minions alone as everyone ran passed them to baron. While trying to take baron, we lost both nexus towers, and that was while I was defending them. Everyone flames me for losing the game, not realising that if i hadn't been stunning and healing minions, we would have lost the nexus before the baron fight even ended. I was so irritated by their ignorance, that they had been messing up all game, but blamed me for defending the nexus. In the end they lost the baron fight, but by the time the enemy reached our lane to finish, two waves of siege minions were already pummeling our nexus. Taric is good at defending, but it took two ultimates and a lot of peeling for the turrets to stop the first two waves, but when the top wave arrived I couldn't do anymore (ran out of mana and had to go base, that 5 second gap is how we lost nexus turrets)\n\nSO yeah, noobs that only know how to run mid, to the point in which they threw for 10 minutes because they refused to wait for the team to go as one, so many situations where that happens but that time was the worst","replies":[{"poster":"djjomon","date":"2015-04-21T14:05:41.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You understand my pain.

It was good I choose AP, the enemy tanks (shen and voli i think) didn't both build MR cause I was support, and were almost unkillable, but when i dropped an E, W , R the hp shred was marvelous, most damage on either team, just about pulled off a win with our terrible composition.

The most pressing of these objectives is dragon.  Taking bot tower opens up dragon to be taken by your team.  If you are currently not in a position to take dragon, the 2nd most pressing objective is mid tower.  By going mid and taking their tower, you further open up dragon.\n\nThis doesn't mean that mid's emphasis goes from farming to objectives.  Instead, what you tend to have is a mid who is still in the laning phase while you have a support, ADC, and jungler who have moved on to the objectives and forcing favorable team fights (mid game) phase.  If there is an opportunity to take mid tower, you absolutely should.  But having 3 or 4 mid and NOT taking mid tower is an absolute waste of time and resources.\n\nSo if you take bot turret, you should look at drag.  If drag isn't available, look to take mid turret.  If you can't do that, then stay bot and farm as the opposing team SHOULD be pushing the lane back towards you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarterCarnage","date":"2015-04-20T20:05:04.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love your name LOL","replies":[{"poster":"Peel Your ADC","date":"2015-04-20T20:54:50.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Paying homage to the champ that let me carry out of bronze and into gold.

This whole thread is a huge lack of insight on how the game is played. You all think you're \"learning up\" bot lanes by telling them not to come mid and steal your farm. News flash, just because you want to 1v1 solo farm your lane longer, doesn't mean that's how the game should be played. There's 4 other people in the game. It's not black and white, there's no clear cut objectives. So many things can occur after a bot tower goes down.\n\nAnd no one has been able to argue with the point I made about the opposite. There's been countless threads started where a mid laner complains that \"after bot lane lost their tower, the enemy bot lane came mid, and my bot lane kept pushing, then I died 1v3 or 4 and lost my turret, then they got dragon, then they killed bot lane. HOW COME STOOPED BOT LANE NO HELP ME MID?\"\n\nJust because a bot lane comes mid, and nothing happens, doesn't mean it was a bad move. So you lost your solo xp and 2 waves of farm. I cannot tell you how many times I've pushed bot in that situation, thinking mid would be ok on tower clearing the waves and sitting back while the enemy wasted their time, only to watch him get hooked/pulled/charmed and killed. Then we're in a really bad spot pushing bot. \n\nNot to mention with Teleport meta, warding deep jungle doesn't guarantee safety. There's just countless instances that going mid is right and wrong, and staying bot is right  and wrong. This whole argument is illogical unless we're talking about ADCs sitting mid **last hitting**, purposefully stealing your farm, which is completely different.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Kaosu Desu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V6mogHT5,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2015-04-21T00:24:36.705+0000)\n>\n> OP proves he has very little understanding of the game with this thread.\n\nI agree with you there. I've been trying to explain how illogical this thread is, but no ones been able to prove to me otherwise. Just like every other cry thread, everyone looks over anyone that disagrees, and instantly \"you don't even understand!\" I dunno when having a different opinion ment you get downvoted either lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-21T10:06:11.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're being almost as single minded here. They've said several times, it's not \"NEVER\" come mid, it's let him farm or don't linger. In most cases, the support should roam and the adc push. A stalemate mid doesn't help anyone, but it typically takes one less to defend then to attack. If support and mid defend, they can stop 4 champs from pushing depending on the match up, and if they lose sight of one or two of the champs, they ss and bot should immediately back up to safety. Most problems arise when bot come mid to help (especially because enemy bot went mid), but then bot STAYS mid after the enemy have backed off, and then lose bot turret because they had to go base while the fresh bot laners pushed.\nThe other case is bot pushes too hard and gets ganked. it all comes to adaptability. The OP isn't wrong, in some ways neither are you, its not clear cut, but there are times where you don't sit mid, and there's times when you don't this post is getting upvoted by some, because they see his point, because he does clearly say, dont \"not come mid\" but let him farm or don't stay there indefinitely.\n\nI posted before, as support, typically you go mid, with your cc you can defend if the others come, and your mechanics means you don't lose out but not farming, and the adc can push. If enemy goes bot, don't chase, push and secure mid. If adc can't escape, they get one kill, you get a turret. And jungler can come so you can still protect drake. But if you chase the adc who got TP ganked, chances are you will die one by one, not get mid turret or drake. If all 4 (excluding top) go mid. Jungler should help defend while adc stays bot to secure an objective. Unless mid engages (for some reason) they should be able to hold the turret, or worst case, lose in outer turret for an inner turret.\n\nADC's coming mid (outside of fast pushing - like after a big team fight) usually come for the kills, not to help. Mid and suppot can defend fine, but adc doesn't come for defence, but usually free farm and hopefully a tf = kill. But it often results in stalemate, for same reason, 2 can defend, and the enemy adc which was losing, now gets free farm bot...\n\nThe biggest problem with most players in these and many other scenarios is adaptability and stubbornness. They KNOW how to play, so they don't need to listen to others, the meta says drop bot tower, go drake, secure mid tower, etc, they don't change their game plan for the different game flows, and these discussions often go the same way.","replies":[{"poster":"Const the Ginger","date":"2015-04-21T12:51:31.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Apollocliptic,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V6mogHT5,comment-id=00140002,timestamp=2015-04-21T10:06:11.089+0000)\n>\n> I think you're being almost as single minded here.

If you are \"unsuccessful\" at pushing the middle lane, (which is not \"their\" lane in the sense of ownership, but is \"their\" responsibility and \"they\" are held accountable when it loses), if you can't accomplish anything by staying mid BUT your opponent IS accomplishing something by moving around, then CHANGE your Single minded view, Because you are not talking about the team game, you are actually arguing for the ADC trying to own every lane. What you say and the point you get across are not the same.\n\nIf the ADC lingers (LINGERS) mid without successfully pushing, the are leaching XP AND Gold, so when they are forced to leave by the bot lane successfully pushing and farming, closing the score gold and XP difference, the middle laner, having not won his lane, is put at a disadvantage. \n\nYou clearly did not read my post, but stopped at the first line and made a reply. My post was not about ownership of a lane, or never going mid as I so clearly emphasis NEVER going mid, NOT being the discussion, the point was clearly ADAPTATION \n\nIt IS a team game, so stealing farm and xp mid is SELFISH not COOPERATIVE and I apologise for all the CAPITALS but you clearly didn't read what I said and I am using repetition to emphasis the points I ALREADY made. \n\nSo try reading my post properly if you intend to reply again, and see that I too gave examples of staying bot and going mid, but instead of SINGLE minded assertions of going mid being good and staying bot being bad, I ALSO explain how the scenario can be reversed, where going Mid is worse, and staying bot is better, where ideally, this is when you split up to truly push your advantage and capitalise on the ownership of the bottom half of the map, rather than thinking that \"ALL MID\" is the only single minded game play","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-04-21T02:33:30.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those that are upvoting the thread do not understand the long game.
