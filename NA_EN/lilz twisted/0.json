My OS is basically letting anything under the sun run on my PC right now (which doesn't have me feeling particularly safe right now).\r\n\r\nWhat are other solutions? I'm running Windows 10 with updated drivers on everything as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between now when I try to play and before when I could successfully login and play is that I moved to Japan from USA.\r\n\r\nBut I don't see how that could cause the issue..?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-01T15:30:31.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your PC settings might still have really strict security rules enabled, or an antivirus.
