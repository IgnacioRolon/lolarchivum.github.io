Sejuani is a really tanky mage with huge burst and amazing crowd control. Sejuani has the ability to do more than 50% health to entire teams, and 1v1 almost any carry late game. \n>Her kit just feels like garbage.\n\nHer kit is actually what makes her viable throughout the game and allows you to be a tanky burst champion. Sejuania has 2 moves that scale with health keeping you relevant-ish if you build pure tank. And her ap scaling and base damage is pretty good on all of her spells. adding a little bit of ap gives her a ton of damage because of her high base damage on her spells. Not to mention that her passive gives her +25 armor and MR along with 25% slow reduction.\n\n>She's like Amumu but worse in almost every way;\nAmumu better clear\nAmumu better damage\nAmumu stronger late game\nAmumu better jungle sustain\nAmumu higher overall threat\n\nThis is just generally not true. The clear times between amumu and sejuani are actually very similar, to the point where there difference is negligible. \nIn the case of damage, Full ap amumu vs full Ap Sejuani is also similar, therefore negligible. Infact, it probably leans towards sejuani. full tank sej vs full tank amumu leans towards sejuani, but is again negligible. \nAs far as lat game goes they are both equally useful if played correctly. They both provide similar forms of cc and engage.\nNeither amumu nor Sejuani have sustain.\nSejuani has more threat than amumu in most cases in my opinion. \n\n\nJust going to leave these here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxR_tj7ardE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxfUOz88pGE","replies":[{"poster":"Kurado","date":"2014-11-01T08:24:34.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Sejuani has the ability to do more than 50% health to entire teams, and 1v1 almost any carry late game. \n\nHer relative strength lies in teamfighting not in dueling. 1v1 a carry seems like such a bad idea with an AOE champ like sejuani. An exception would be if you build her as an AP assasin with DFG of course.\n\n\n> adding a little bit of ap gives her a ton of damage because of her high base damage on her spells.\n\nYou're confusing terms here. Base damage is the part of your damage that doesn't scale with AP. If adding AP gives her a ton of damage it's because of her scalings and that has nothing to do with base damage.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2014-11-01T06:47:54.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would love to see them hit her ap scaling and then give her better jungle clears.","replies":[{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2014-11-01T07:20:16.888+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I would love to see them hit her ap scaling and then give her better jungle clears.\n\nOr they could just do the second one and not the first.
