The 23rd is the final day, so if you don't receive them by then, you can submit a support ticket.\n\n> Due to the nature of this particular gift and the way it varies by account, we’re not able to simultaneously grant it to everyone. This means it may take a few days for the gift to show on your account. We’re asking for a bit of patience through next week as we pick up all the stragglers—if you don’t have it by 9/23, let Player Support know. Additionally, players using the alpha League client may receive the gift but not a notice—double-check your account before opening a ticket.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/thank-you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T22:11:41.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gifts are still being sent out to the massive amount of players, and will take some time.
