Those matches look at MMR and try to build the most balanced team it can, which it looks like this might have been as close as it could have been. If you're wanting to focus on competitive gameplay with people of your own rank, you might have a better time playing Ranked matches rather than normals.","replies":[{"poster":"StainedViolett","date":"2017-10-01T22:56:02.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"how is a plat, a silver 5, bronze 3 and 2 lvl 30s even close to a lvl 3, lvl 6, 2 lvl 30s and a silver5 ?","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-10-01T23:39:43.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because the Plat doesn't play in Normals regularly, and so his MMR in this queue is not accurate, and on top of that, he's probably premade with one of the other player. And when you have a Plat and a Silver/Bronze in the same premade, you know it's gonna be a shitty match anyway, even if the system manages to get the average level of the teams damn near the same.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-10-01T23:43:21.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Broporo, just a quick remark, but even in Ranked, you're not matched against people from your own rank, it still works based on MMR, just like Normals. If you've got a high winrate and a MMR above your current rank, you'll be matched against people from higher divisions.\n\n(Ranked matches are indeed more competitive, true, but because a/ players' MMR is generally more accurate, and b/ it prohibits Premades with too large skill differences, so the system has an easier task.)","replies":[{"poster":"StainedViolett","date":"2017-10-02T11:24:38.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even so the mmr of a level 3 and a level 30 seem like they'd be very different. if its marked as the overall mmr of each team then surely the 2 below level 10 team would have a significantly lower overall mmr than the one with full teams of 30. I could be very wrong but it does not make much sense to me","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-10-02T15:00:38.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have honestly no idea how sub-level 30 players are treated by the match-making. Keep in mind though: a lot of sub-30 can be smurfs.
