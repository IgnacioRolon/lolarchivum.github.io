Seems like they are fairly qualified to report people to me.\n\nAlso, there are plenty of characters that I am comfortable playing but don't have mastery 3 with yet, mostly because I learned them before the mastery system and now just play them every now and then to make sure I still have them down.\n\nI would be livid if I was going for one of my counter picks and the game was like \"sorry, your mastery is too low\".\n\nBeing able to vite to kick people from lobbies would be so abusable it wouldn't be funny. People would be using it to kick people because they didn't get their role or don't want to play against a certain character. Little stuff like that.\n\nAnd, as other people have said, your punctuation makes your post difficult to read.","replies":[]},{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2017-01-07T22:12:18.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy is clearly just a raging idiot.
