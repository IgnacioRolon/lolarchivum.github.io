A permanent one. \n\nNow, I'm not looking for sympathy here, or anything along those lines, but I'd like to plead my case and ask for Riot to take a closer look at my case, and potentially reverse what I believe was an unjust ban. \n\nI queue'd into a game with 3 of my friends, and the other 2 guys were in a pre-made. Nothing wrong with that. However, even after I called Top and had locked in, a Warwick with Cleanse and Ghost locked in and said he was going Top. I'd though he was joking, and he was going to take smite and jungle for us, being Warwick. I was wrong.\n\nHe walked into the lane with me, and scored a kill on the enemy, which is all well and good. I wasn't helping him because I didn't want to do something dumb and have both of us die (I was a Nasus, and minions weren't even out). He backed to base, then came back, and ran into the Vayne again, this time dying. He obviously blamed me for not having helped him, but again, pre-level 3 Nasus with 9 Stacks, I can't do much. He then began running down lane over and over again, inting. I obviously gave him some shit for feeding, but nothing I'd consider brutal, especially because he was in the process of throwing the game, we were all frustrated. My 3 man did our best, and we ended up winning the game, but no thanks to the (final K/D) 4/16/4 Warwick and his friend, who also went negative, but not as badly. Basically, I flamed the game for ruining our game, but nothing beyond what any person faces in the game, it was mostly banter. This is the dialogue provided by Riot:\n\nGame 1\nAutism the Great: lol Warwick forgot Smite to Jungle\nAutism the Great: gg\nAutism the Great: and he's in the top lane\nAutism the Great: lol\nAutism the Great: be careful\nAutism the Great: lol\nAutism the Great: oops\nAutism the Great: oops\nAutism the Great: oops\nAutism the Great: all 3 of our people are better than you two\nAutism the Great: so we might win\nAutism the Great: and your bf is 1/5\nAutism the Great: so he's getting reported for inting\nAutism the Great: this is your fault sion\nAutism the Great: you said he got top\nAutism the Great: he didn't\nAutism the Great: and now he's inting\nAutism the Great: deserves what??\nAutism the Great: I'm the one trolling?\nAutism the Great: how so?\nAutism the Great: i want some bronze logic\nAutism the Great: lol\nAutism the Great: i called it\nAutism the Great: playing top because i called it is not trolling\nAutism the Great: you kept trying to 1v1\nAutism the Great: not my fault you lost those\nAutism the Great: it's as if i wan't top with you\nAutism the Great: so there\nAutism the Great: you would've lost lane anyway\nAutism the Great: because you lost 1v1 to her\nAutism the Great: wow\nAutism the Great: that was good\nAutism the Great: for being so behind rn lol\nAutism the Great: you should try being better\nAutism the Great: nice\nAutism the Great: that was\nAutism the Great: c\nAutism the Great: l\nAutism the Great: e\nAutism the Great: a\nAutism the Great: n\nAutism the Great: dude\nAutism the Great: try doing damage\nAutism the Great: that helps\nAutism the Great: god\nAutism the Great: you're both trash\nAutism the Great: no\nAutism the Great: we were fine\nAutism the Great: if you hadn't missed 100000 autos on yas\nAutism the Great: but you did\nAutism the Great: so we're dead\nAutism the Great: you misclick\nAutism the Great: dumbass\nAutism the Great: and you did\nAutism the Great: ww\nAutism the Great: is it because you took an offmeta jungle into toplane?\nAutism the Great: with a nasus\nAutism the Great: who called top?\nAutism the Great: lol\nAutism the Great: baron\nAutism the Great: that's a good one\nAutism the Great: gg\nAutism the Great: ez\n\nThere she is. Most of it was me being flamed by the Sion and Warwick, asking for why I hadn't helped, to which I explained he took Ghost Cleanse Warwick into top lane with a Nasus, he shouldn't have expected me to all in from level 1.\n\nThis ban is only permanent because I caught a 2 week ban back in July I believe, for a series of several games in which I was a monster. I realize that. I was horrible, and nasty, and deserved every second of that ban. But I've since changed, I am a player who is competitive, but I won't go around telling people to die or %%% or threaten them. I was simply in a game with a few trolls, and I bantered with them.\n\nI know it's permanent, but I've changed since I caught my 2 week months ago. My honor has been going up, I've been earning tilt-proofs and GG's left and right, because I have truly changed as a player. For what got me a 2 week, this is like a child bickering. I truly don't think I was in the wrong with the ban, given the circumstances of the game, and the fact I have truly \"reformed\" as a player. I enjoy the game more when others enjoy it with me.\n\nSo I'm asking for a single favor from Riot, who's shown to be in it for their playerbase. Please reduce or remove my ban. Make it months, or weeks, or anything. I just want to be able to step onto the Rift again without restarting from scratch.\n\nThanks,\nAutism the Great","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T03:56:28.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty admirable that you'd admit your past offenses were wrong and understand that now. It does look like this wasn't the first offense, which shows we're willing to work with our players in hopes their behavior improves. I can see that you were arguing pretty heavily with your team, and even though it might not have been a great play for that Warwick to go top with you and taking the spells he did, remember that you always have the option of simply not responding. Attacking your own teammates like this doesn't uphold the Summoner's Code very well.\n\nTypically once an account goes through the normal punishment escalation, it won't come back from a perma. With that being said, you're always welcome to reach out to our player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get all the details on why this needed to happen, and what ,if anything, can be done.","replies":[{"poster":"Autism the Great","date":"2017-09-28T04:10:37.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the response. I understand I wasn't going along with the Summoner's Code. I'll attempt a support ticket, and see what can be done, but if I was in the long run too toxic, so be it. I may have changed at the end but in my few months of playing, I was pretty bad at points.\n\nAgain, thanks for a speedy response!","replies":[]}]}]}
