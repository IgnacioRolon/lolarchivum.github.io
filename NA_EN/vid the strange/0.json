Combine this with the fact that 4800 champions already only got price-dropped every third(?) release, and you start to see a problem here.\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are the current number of champions per price point:\r\n\r\n6300: 32\r\n**4800: 49**\r\n3150: 24\r\n1350: 21\r\n450: 14\r\n\r\nThe 4800 tier has only ten fewer champions than the three tiers below it COMBINED. Nine fewer once the next champion releases and Vi drops to 4800.\r\n\r\nNever mind the fact that the lower tiers have the lion&#039;s share of outdated/clunky champions who are awaiting VGUs.\r\n\r\nAn easy solution would be to count relaunches/VGUs as releases _(thus meaning every VGU would trigger a price drop)_ as well as reducing a 4800&#039;s price every other release instead of every third. \r\n\r\nThe 4800 tier just needs to really be thinned out a bit. It&#039;s far too bloated.\r\n\r\n_(Semi-unrelated note, but I really feel like Singed and Ryze shouldn&#039;t be 450 champions. Ryze is no longer the beginner friendly champion he used to be, and Singed has one of the most atypical play styles in the game.)_","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-02T20:21:27.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"every time there is a new release, there is a price drop.

That's exactly why the 4800 tier has way more champions than the others.\n\nThen factor in that Riot's slowing down on champion releases.","replies":[]}]}]}
