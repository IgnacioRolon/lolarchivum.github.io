The Tank, DPS and Support. The goal for me was to make unique characters for MOBA&rsquo;s that stay recognizable even when they might be different from what we know of the current character classes.\r\nMy question is; could you guys complete my survey? It takes around 2 minutes and it would help me a lot! I mostly ask if you can recognize the characters I made.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PJ8KKRY\r\n\r\nI also made abilities and stories etc. if you are interested I can also post those here!","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-06-08T15:32:45.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Done!\n\nAre you also interested in comments on the designs, by the way?","replies":[{"poster":"Pigeon Wings","date":"2017-06-08T15:39:38.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

And yes, that would be amazing :)\n\nMy pleasure!\n\nLet's get down to business then!\n\nFirst off, most of these aren't that different from things we've seen in their class (one exception, which I'll get to later), assuming I recognized all of them correctly. That's not really a BAD thing though, unless extreme differentiation was your goal.\n\n-------------------------------\n##CHARACTER 1\nI'm assuming this guy is the ADC. He's got the in-motion pose, the ranged weapon, the sharp lines, the focused expression. I actually love the lines of the outfit, but he feels pretty generic: \"superhero archer\" is low-hanging fruit as far as the ADC role goes, and this guy could just be Hawkeye with a costume change and a hair color change. There's nothing about him that really stands out regarding who he is, how he plays, or what he can do.\n\nMight be cool to try a version with white/blue hair, cold blue lines in place of the yellow, and something akin to electrical powers though, possibly firing a crackling bolt of electricity in place of an arrow. It would still get a superhero-esque vibe, but would be a little more unique than \"dude with bow.\"\n\nAgain -- not a BAD design by any means. I'm just not looking at this characters going \"I want to know more.\" I'm looking at him going \"cool archer, but I know everything an archer does already. Why is he special?\"\n-------------------------\n##CHARACTER 2\nThe support here, I think. I kind of love him. Crazy old not-quite-a-man wearing a giant fish and holding a staff with a bird skull? Sign me up. He has a lot of personality, and a fun design. My concern here is readability -- it took me a minute to figure out everything going on even at the large size of the image, and I'm not sure it would read well shrunken down to the in-game size. The glasses also seem REALLY out of place given the primitive nature of the rest of the design -- as does the super human face on a body with clearly non-human arms and limbs. I think this one is 4/5ths of the way to something awesome, and would challenge you to figure out how to clean up his presentation and to figure out what he IS. Fantastic job though.\n---------------------------\n##CHARACTER 3\nI said I kind of loved your previous design -- but I _absolutely_ love this design. It's super evocative, and CLEARLY a tank while also finding a really unique way to present that tank profile. It's also the first design that makes me super certain I know the sorts of things this character would do in a fight, which is always a sign of a good design. When I look at a character and can go \"this guy basically has giant golden scarab-beetle armor -- I'm a super protector who probably can armor up and become invincible, or go charging in with my armor as a battering ram\" I get excited.\n\nHell, I sort of want to whip up a kit for this one. It's not *perfect* (I'm not sold on the headpiece, the face is a little wonky, and I can't tell much about the person themselves from the expression (can't even tell the gender, given the feminine form, heavy makeup, beard, etc), I absolutely love this design. It has a clear, obvious profile, it FEELS like a tank, and it just looks like a lot of fun (and like it has a story to tell).\n------------------------\n\nDamn fine job overall though! Would love to see more from you in the future. Wish I was this good at modeling for my own projects! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Pigeon Wings","date":"2017-06-08T16:47:57.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhh man, this is one of the best critiques I ever got!

His design came forth from a lot of questions I saw on the forums regarding people wanting a \"Nice looking ADC, that was very simple but good looking\".\n\nI also should add I'm not very good in story writing, and my ability designs are not the best either, but all of this was made to give me a base to design the 3D models for the characters.\n\n**Archer guy: Euhir the Leech\n**\nEuhir was the son of a mercenary mother in Zaun and a rich merchant father in Piltover. His mother taught him the knife and archery, while his father thought him trade and persuasion. Unconsciously he became a very persuasive person, but still he never felt home in either Piltover or Zaun. He was too raw for Piltover, but too neat for Zaun. In an accident both of his parents got killed and Euhir got adopted by his rich uncle in Piltover that taught crafts to artists. There Euhir learned Origami. To forget his sadness he pushed himself into the art of Origami, while he tried to forget what his parents thought him. On one particular day he overheard a conversation with his uncle, apparently his parents were killed by a murderer getting revenge on his mom. That moment Euhir woke up from the shroud around him, he picked up his old abilities and went after the killer.\n\nPassive: Auto-attacks give life steal and auto-attacks on enemies also give mana-steal\nAbility: When a monster has 5% health left, Euhir can throw an arrow. The effects and gold get copied to the closest champion in range.\nAbility: Euhir shrouds himself in shadows. He is barely seen and gets a high speed boost in the river and bushes. The longer he is in stealth the stronger his passive will get. When an enemy attacks him he will get a slow.\nAbility: Euhir does a couple of fast close-range attacks, it will give him a short but high health regen boost, but it will also disable his passive for a while\nUltimate: Euhir makes an origami copy of himself that jumps to the closest enemy in range. The copy will leech himself full with health and mana and will try to return to Euhir. Enemies can attack this copy and they will steal the mana and health that the copy holds. When the copy reaches Euhir, he will receive the remaining health and mana.\n\nKeywords:\nLeech, Origami, Mercenary, Merchant, Artist\n\n**Fish guy: Murell the Bilgwater Witch Doctor\n**\nStory\nMurell is from Bilgewater, he is one of the original beings that are from Bilgewater. He has a hut in a high pillar in the water where pirates visit with their sick and wounded. To protect his home he collects and trades items from the pirates and puts it in the waters around him. He breeds fish there that are morphed with his potions. They receive random powers and protect his home this way. He also sells these fish to the pirates to protect them on their journeys.\n\nAbilities\nPassive: Near enemies he wears his mask, which makes him regenerate health faster. When no enemies are near he takes off his mask and gets a speed boost a higher speed in general. His health regen becomes normal again.\nMurell switches abilities when in or out range of enemies.\nIn range ability: Throw a fish to an ally, giving a positive effect like armor, regen, attack, attack speed, magic resist, health or speed.\nIn range ability: Throw a fish to an enemy with a random negative effect.\nIn range ability: Throw a potion on an enemy, he gets a slow that moves to other enemies that come too close. The slow gets stronger when more enemies are affected.\nOut of range ability: Throw a fish from far on the ground. Every enemy that steps on it becomes visible for a short while. The fish lies there for a short while.\nOut of range ability: Cook a potion that regenerates health fast for a short while and throw this on all friendly objects and characters. Very far range.\nOut of range ability: Put down potions that give a small speed boost when a team player walks over it.\nUltimate: The fish on his head becomes alive and jumps to an ally of your choice. They get a shield. The shield regenerates health when no damage is done after some time, but when enough damage is done, the fish disappears and returns to Murell\n\nKeywords:\nMale, ugly, friendly, healing, witchdoctor, fish, potions\n \n**Shield girl: Chepri the Scarab Queen\n**\nStory\nChepri was one of the scarab-queens in the desert of Shurima. She was known for her strong armor and her loyalty to protect her people. She still got buried with sand and was forgotten over time, because of unknown reasons. Until her armor was unearthed by a descendant of her, that randomly (or not?!) found the armor while treasure hunting the environment. Impressed by the armor, the descendant put on the armor and Chepri became alive again through the girl. Now she is two persons in one body. Chepri the Scavenger and Chepri the Scarab Queen. Sometimes the queen uses her astral powers when to defend, but the Scavenger is better in fight.\n\nAbilities\nPassive: Every few seconds Chepri gets a new scarab. A higher level means more scarabs.\nPassive ability: Rotate her shield around her, on that side she gets less damage\nAbility: 4 scarabs appear on the ground, everyone on the scarabs coming towards her get damage and slow, everyone getting away from her get a short speed boost. \nAbility: The remaining scarabs are bound on a chain, this extends her range. Every auto-attack one scarab gets used until all the scarabs are used.\nUltimate: In a large circle around her scarabs will appear and walk around randomly. Collision with enemies give the enemies a stun. When the enemies do enough damage against the scarab, it will disappear. Collision with an ally will give them a shield.\n\nKeywords:\nFemale, square and round, scarab, queen, armor\n ","replies":[]}]}]}
