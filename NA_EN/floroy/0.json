This is getting ridiculous. Do SOMETHING about this RIOT, come on. You know if there are this many bots in aram then they have to be all over the other game modes too? Right? LIke its not a problem you can ignore forever or even should ignore for as long as you have. Its been steadily getting worse over the last 2 years too. I'm about to just delete League and move on to another game.. I doubt DOTA has this many bots.\n\nDo something\ndo anything\nstop ignoring the problem\nDo something\ndo anything\nor lose clientele.\n\n\nEdit 1: 26 games in a row (this one had 3 bots on enemy team and 1 on friendly)  Its getting worse everyday.\nEdit 2: I realize maybe Riot just doesn't know what a bot looks like..\n1) they always have the teddy bear icon\n2) they hardly ever have masteries\n3) they don't talk \n4) they stand by the tower at the start of matches\n5) they follow minions to the middle of the map even if there are 5 enemies and all allies are dead\n6) they shoot their skill shots in random directions","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T00:14:01.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely not something we're ignoring, but there isn't a simple way to do a scan on players to see who is a bot. Sometimes people can also look like they're botting to some vets, when in actuality they're simply new players who don't fully understand the gameplay quite yet. The best way for us to track down bots is by having the community report them in the post game lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-15T02:37:00.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have one simple way. Search every game type for Kalista players that end every match played as Kalista with black spear in inventory. That would identify a huge number of bots right there.\n\nHere is another. I dont know what type of data you have access to, but every varus bot I have seen charges Q and never fires it. All game every game.\n\nAgain without knowing the data you guys collect I cant give any more specific examples, but I do know I could logically identify patterns in game that would translate into data that Riot could collect and stop 90% or more of these accounts dead in their tracks. You can even use the time between matches to identify bots. Many bots are run from VM's 24/7/365 and after a match ends they go through a sequence to leave lobby and join the next queue. I guarantee none of the bot software providers are randomizing or adding time to that action (due to wanting to level accounts quickly) so this alone could easily identify a huge percentage of bot accounts.\n\nSeveral years ago the publishers of World Of Tanks hired me to help them with the same type of botting issues that they had. In about 3 weeks the work I did cleared out 97% of the bots, the remaining 3% being bots I had not studied.\n\nIf players can use google to find bot software and download it for free or pay $5 to gain access to it, I could easily locate patterns that could match up to data that Riot can or does collect (such as item purchasing and movement patterns).\n\nI have a lot more insight into this having worked on a bot removal project in the past so I am more perplexed than the average player on why this is so difficult (or takes so long) to handle. But of course I have no idea what challenges their might be in Riot's technical environment.\n\nEdit: I remember one time I played an ARAM and got 9 bots. That is right, 9 bots and me.... The only good news was I got veigar up to 2000+ AP :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T03:06:56.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue here is that those scenarios don't necessarily scream \"I'M A BOT\" either, unfortunately. With the Kallista example, not everyone new to her will immediately know they need to use that item. Varus players may also be drawing their Q and then realizing it's not the best time to fire it so they save it to reduce mana cost and CD. There are just too many factors that go into whether someone is truly a bot or not, and it definitely wouldn't feel too good to be shooting off random bans to players who might just not be that great of a player yet. We have to keep in mind that not every single player is a pro.\n\nWith that being said there are still some patterns that are detectable, but along with that, every report helps as well.

Not trying to dodge any questions (I mean, I could just not respond xD), just giving my best guess without having been able to see for myself what happened.

When I look at the match history of any bot I come across, they have been playing ARAM 24/7 (which could btw. be a good heuristic. humans are unlikely to play ARAM more than ~72 hours nonstop).\nYou can't tell me they have never been reported in all those other games.\n\nThere are reports of bots in ARAM for months and years now, describing very much the same behavior we see now.

I don't know whos idea it was to put bots in ARAM but that person needs to be fired. The bots didn't used to be there and ARAM was a fun quick game when you didn't have time for Summoners Rift, great team fight skill building and champ mastery stacking. I'm reading some posts that say Riot isn't responsible for programming these bots!? I report every one of them every game, they always have a timbers icon and no spell mastery. Besides Varus charging and never releasing Q, Poppy charges R and never releases, just swing her hammer in a circle like a construction worker on crack. I really don't believe a user is out there programming bots to screw up other peoples games and what?..stack IP? I think Riot screwed the pooch and won't own it.","replies":[]}]}
