What you don't see, and what I'm responding to (in perhaps a snarky but not necessarily toxic manner imo), is two of my teammates cursing at me pretty much the entire time.  I know that I shouldn't have responded at all, and that's on me but I'm having a hard time understanding how in the world this resulted in a 10 game chat restriction after one game.

I can tell you right now that if this what's qualified as toxic, then there were perhaps 2 games where this kind of back and forth occurred. Certainly not 100 games, for sure. I know that I don't have any evidence, but most of the time I have chat totally muted.  This just feels like being stopped for speeding and being shot instead of being asked to show my license and registration lol","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2019-12-23T21:56:02.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"considering it takes quite a lot to get the first punishement (the 10 games CR) maybe you can write the support and get some more insight.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-23T22:48:13.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bot compiles the words you use that it tags every time you're reported. As you use the same words repeatedly, the system puts a higher value on those triggers every time it processes a report against you. Once your toxicity value reaches a certain point and you have enough (edit: reported) games in a variable window of time (dependant on the toxicity value), the bot triggers.\n\nThis means that your opinion of how toxic you were does not matter. You triggered the system.\n\nThe system expects that you STOP BEING NEGATIVE and REFRAIN FROM USING ANY TRIGGERS. You could do this by simply never chatting. I advise doing exactly the above instead.\n\nIt's actually easy to do. Remember that people get mad easily and you should only say things that contribute to better gaming.","replies":[{"poster":"AllHeavyNoLift","date":"2019-12-23T23:03:29.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for your input.

Does it have these specific combinations of words in its database even though the words on their own are not swearing?
