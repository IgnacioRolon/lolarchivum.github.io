The link I included are all of the specs for the laptop. This thing is a beast, and I'm not sure why while I'm playing, my FPS drops regularly; mostly when abilities are being used and lots of action is happening on the screen.\r\n\r\nI have tried lowering my settings, using borderless, connecting to my internet directly through an Ethernet cord, ending processes in the background that I don't need, and downloading applications to try and \"boost\" the quality of my gaming.\r\n\r\nI monitor my CPU while the frame drops are happening, and the graph shows it going way high, then back to normal, almost like a heart beat monitor. It's a regular pattern and it is so frustrating! I'm just trying to land {{champion:267}} 's bubbles!\r\n\r\nWhen the CPU spikes, my fans speed up very loudly, then will calm back down. I have my laptop sitting on an airflow stand so it should be getting enough air to it, and it doesn't get very hot.\r\n\r\nI really, REALLY want to use this laptop to it's full potential...because I paid a grand for it. (NOTE: all of the Adobe CS6 programs were installed so I definitely got the bang for my buck. I am a graphic designer so if anyone needs like twitch overlays or logos or something, i got you &lt;3 )\r\n\r\nThank you SO much for reading, and replying! Help me be the support main I was born to be!\r\nMuch love,\r\nJosie","replies":[{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2017-04-10T23:07:00.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'll post this.\n\nAnytime I see someone using a laptop, I always shake my head that they don't understand the limitations. I'm not saying that using a laptop is bad or you are stupid, just not informed. \n\nLaptops overheat super easily. This is a trade-off you get for the mobility of one over a desktop (Desktops CAN overheat just are less prone to it.)\n\nWhen you are playing uncapped FPS you are essentially using your graphics card to it's full potential. \nThe thing is? You don't need to and shouldn't.\n\nOnce a laptop starts overheating, it will continue to because the thermal paste compound used on your heatsink wears down. (You should be replacing this every 6 months if you are gaming on it and once a year or so if you occasionally do).\n\nThis causes laptops to either:\nGet to hot and turn off.\nWear and tear your components.\n\n\n\nWhat it sounds like to me is your graphics card is pushing hard and the fans kick on when it gets too hot, when it cools down you return back to your 120fps.\nYou said your laptop doesn't get very hot but that does not mean your graphics card isn't (You could be having really good airflow that keeps the laptop cool but the graphics not so much.)\n\nCap your FPS at 60 (or even 30) and you will notice that: It won't get over-heated near as easily, your laptop will last longer and you won't notice a terribly huge difference (120 vs 60).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T22:53:34.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With those fan's kicking in and those cpu spikes, it really seems like that laptop is having a hard time processing everything going on with league running which could be caused by overheating. Let's see if we can first troubleshoot that fps drop with our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting). If that doesn't help to calm your laptop down, we may need to take a closer look!","replies":[]}]}
