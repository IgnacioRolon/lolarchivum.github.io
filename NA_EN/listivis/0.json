When I first get into a match, my mouse is free to move between the two. When I click on the one I'm not playing on, then click back to league, it locks on league, and I have to alt tab to go back to my other monitor for side stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Listivis","date":"2017-12-20T12:50:51.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alas, I wish I had that luck haha, mine wont do that after reading your post.
