We've seen something like this happen in the past, and it was also in Spectator mode. We didn't have a repro for it originally, and were unable to find a root cause, but if it's still happening, we can certainly re-open the issue and dig a bit more to see if we can find out what's going on. This one's tricky 'cause his tentacles are particles, unlike his other skins, which makes him a special snowflake when it comes to bugs. :P","replies":[{"poster":"LordOfMayonnaise","date":"2016-09-19T23:52:42.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would a video help in finding the cause of the bug?
