I came back later and she wasn't there, so I scrolled to the comments where someone quoted a Riot staff member who said that adding her to the list was an accident. Apparently, she wasn't supposed to be available till the next eSports season, and to make up for it, she would be available at 50% off at the 2016 season.\r\nBecause of this, I decided not to buy Riot Points until Challenger {{champion:103}} goes on sale later. Now, according to the store, she's on sale for less than 48 hours and I won't be able to buy RP until after the sale is over. Does anyone know whether she will be on sale again this spring or not?\r\nThanks!\r\n-ntm1999 (Nathaniel)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-17T16:37:57.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We made a post last night about the reasoning behind this decision [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/uQERzEsh-challenger-ahri-storms-back-into-snowdown) if you'd like more info! :]","replies":[{"poster":"KrugDudeski","date":"2015-12-17T17:42:26.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I see it now!

Maybe they just said \"ahh well f%&k it\" \n\nThey did also say she was going to go on sale next year too","replies":[]}]}]}]}
