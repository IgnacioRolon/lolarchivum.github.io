I feel like i should be unbanned bc off how long i played the game for and how much i supportred it by spening over $2000+ on the game by buying in game purchases and merch i would want the community to respond to help me out here on what should be decided. I know i was toxic but people change and how much i supported the game and how long ive played for i feel like not giving me a 2nd chance would be wrong because of how long ive stuck with the game from the good times to the bad times of it. thank you all for reading this. :D \r\nMinl Doge: just lost us the game\r\nMinl Doge: that was free gold for me\r\nMinl Doge: to carry\r\nMinl Doge: ur so bad\r\nMinl Doge: kys\r\nMinl Doge: i mean good job\r\nMinl Doge: gj wuk\r\nMinl Doge: ur really good at this game","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-01-02T06:05:24.377+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

Those who have used it before that time (AKA your examples) didn't feel the need to define it for widespread use because it wasn't intended for widespread use. It's a trend because it will likely be replaced with another toxic phrase, much like how \"drink bleach\" was phased out (although with how short it is it might last).  \n\nYou're catching yourself in a chicken and the egg problem. An acronym only makes sense to use on it's own (like the OP did) if people know it. The OP assumed people would know it meant a school slogan? Or that (as other players have suggested) it meant \"kiss your sister\" - a phrase which was never used in gaming before \"kill yourself\" became a common acronym? \n\nFat chance. \"kys\" might mean something else in some specialized environment, but in gaming it's got one meaning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-10-08T18:38:25.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mlm olo mlm,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xfl0teU4,comment-id=0002000100000000,timestamp=2018-10-08T16:34:54.942+0000)\n>\n> You are making assumptions about my argument.

You are arguing for banning words, while doing nothing against the actual hate. It&#x27;s fucking hilarious how you think &quot;bad&quot; people are the only ones that can create language.\n\nAgain, this is not the point. The point is that some words are accepted as hate speech, despite the fact that they may have secondary definitions not associated with hate speech. However, because those words are primarily used as hate speech, attempts to use their \"other definitions\" are not accepted by society because society has accepted them as hate speech.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-10-07T21:16:22.126+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just absurd.
