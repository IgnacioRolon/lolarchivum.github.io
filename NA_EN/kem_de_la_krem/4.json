Post-50 it gets a bit drawn out but I've had several ~60 minute games and have enjoyed even those a lot more than these stomp fests.\n\nIt's really boring getting a tiny lead and not having to think about how to actually expand on that lead anymore.

Over time, and especially in this latest patch, the game has moved towards a faster more aggressive less strategic game-play.  Towers need to be strong enough to really punish any enemy they target.  There was a time  that if you tower dived without assistance or a pretty significant lead you would die.  I remember long ago tower diving a single champion with my entire team early in the game, we all died and that champion got a Penta kill.  The tower chewed through you if you didn't play smart and leverage strategy over moment to moment combat.  That very same game we lost every single one of our towers before taking one of theirs and we STILL won the match.  Those are the kinds of games that I play League of Legends to have.  A nice, long, evenly matched game is by far the most enjoyable because win or lose you know you had fun.  If you win you know it's because you played smart and overcame the obstacles that the enemy champions presented.  If you lose you know you did your best and you learned something about the game and working with your teammates.  If the game is short inevitably you either feel like there was no challenge or you never stood a chance.  Neither option is any fun at all.  Now towers are meaningless space holders.  Fights are mostly a question of who sees the other guy first and jumps on him.  Teamwork, strategy, and any hope of recovering from a mistake are being drained from the game, not only by this patch but progressively by pretty much every patch they've introduced for several years now.  Unless League of Legends strengthens the towers and emphasizes strategic over momentary gameplay then League of Legends will die.  Ninety percent of the people on my friends list are never online anymore at all, there were about eighty of them.  If this game keeps going the way it's going the community will transform into a legion of children with the attention spans of rabbits, and the strategic sense of honey badgers (and not in a good way.)  I see it in practically every game I play already.  Any time things start going badly all of my teammates want to surrender instead of fighting it out.  Even the team that's ahead has the gall to ask us to surrender because they're bored!  It's ridiculous.  I could go on at some length about how the changes to the game have changed the community for the worse promoting less mature players but I think I've made my point.\nAlso, the new masteries system is far too restrictive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rendath","date":"2015-11-12T19:52:08.455+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wait till we get the snowballing winions in 5.23.
