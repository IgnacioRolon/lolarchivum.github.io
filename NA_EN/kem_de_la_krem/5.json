I think Vik&#039;s Op because well he can farm very easily with his augmented laser and well doesnt fall off at all. Actually i would say he has one of the highest bursts in this game. But my question is where is the counter to play to that burst? I dont really see any in my opinion because a fed/ farm viktor can just burst out any squishy literally from full health and here;s the thing he is still good vs tanks. He chunks down tanks very fast, im like, how there tanks but he just chunks them even though they have MR. Its pretty dumb if you ask me, he gets alot of free ap and has enormous burst with no counter play i think. Idk about you but i think he is in line for a nerf because he does his job really well. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-06-17T05:04:38.114+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Every champion ramps up if you give them enough time, Viktor is no different. He's fine the way he is, he has massive burst, but pays by being insanely immobile. You gank him and set him behind so that way he takes longer to ramp up, then you close out the game before he's able to reach his peak power spike. \n\nEven still as a Jungle in this Cinderhulk meta who has ran into Viktor many times already as a tank, his burst is not enough to destroy tanks, you're exaggerating with that number. If he's able to burst a tank down completely, then that's a fed Viktor, which kudos to him then, that means he's a smart player who understands how to position himself in teamfights, you mess up with him, you're done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2015-06-17T05:51:25.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Viktor main, I agree, he's definitely too strong right now. The problem is mainly in his Q: for whatever reason, riot decided to make the majority of his Q's base damage scale with his level instead of the spell's actual rank, and the result is that he has an overbearingly strong midgame because he effectively has two abilities maxed at level nine.\n\nMake his Q's damage scale with it's rank instead of his level, and he'll be totally fine again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-06-17T05:03:47.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Oh P.S if people are gonna say camp him because he is immobile, i argue yes u can do that but he will ramp up its only a matter of time and once he does nothing can stop him\n\nand in what way is that diferent from any other late game champion \n\nits always a hit or miss ... eitheryou do good from early and it goes smooth \nor you dont do good early and you need to work your ass off for that late game power","replies":[]}]}
