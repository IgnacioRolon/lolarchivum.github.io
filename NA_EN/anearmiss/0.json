TFT should have been developed on a mobile platform, perfected and then ported as a tie in to the client.  I base this off of my week or so of playing auto chess which I found boring as hell and frustrating because of the same RNG issues folks are having with TFT.\r\n\r\nWhy? A riot mobile game that's fun would net them even more profit over time with simple graphics, gameplay and especially with their new love of microtransactions. After getting it straight on mobile platform, beyond a few tweaks and bugs, I'm sure thing it into the client would have been much easier than the mess we're faced with now.","replies":[]}
