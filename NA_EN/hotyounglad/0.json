Rules that you agreed to when you signed the TOU.  Maybe actually read through those next time.  https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse\n\nEssentially, treat the people in game like they are actually humans, because they are.

They ban people because they make money off of people constantly making new accounts and buying more RP. League will lost 60% of its player base in the next 2 years, there is no need to get upset over it haha. The game is created by beta cucks that cannot take online criticism because they were bullied throughout highschool. Do not lose any sleep over it, just buy a new account for $10 every time you get banned, make sure to not buy any RP, do not support this company. They are crooks and sensitive about their feelings, that's why they ban people on a hourly basis. Forget it and move on, I feel for you brother. Just don't spend anymore money on this company. If you need champs, just buy an account that has the champs you play. No need to buy anymore RP. God bless you, we all know that was is said online doesn't mean shit to anyone but the nerds that were bullied in highschool and use their video games as a escape from the real world. It's okay brotha, your life is better than theirs. No need to get upset. God bless, if you ever saw a Riot employee in the real world and called them what you've said in game, they would laugh it off and then go back to their keyboards. This is the only place they can find athority in life, so they abuse it. That is why the game is dying. Just find a new game if you can't help yourself from raging at the beta nerds online, I feel for you. Check out Fornite, has already surpassed league in many categories.
