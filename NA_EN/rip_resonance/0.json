I play support a lot, because it's my best role in my opinion. With playing a role like jungle or support, your teammates are more likely to flame you because they're unable to accept responsibility for their actions, or you just genuinely made a mistake. After being flamed, I'd give into frustration and anger and tell my teammates some things I'm pretty ashamed I've said, or just go AFK. This eventually lead to a ton of chat restrictions and low priority queue times that I know I deserved. It wasn't until after my last chat restriction, about a week or two ago at 75 games, that I had changed my outlook on this game. I found out that I played worse when I was arguing over who's the bigger asshole, so I started realizing that you only really need to send about 2-6 messages per game to actively communicate with your team. I eventually got my new full-time job, and play League of Legends on my days off, or after work. I learned to value the time I had to play, I didn't want to ruin the little free time I had left in my day after work or days off. League of Legends is my favorite game in the world, and I want to enjoy the time I have to play the game I love most. Yeah, there's some kid I don't know who's pissed at me that he lost his lane. Someone's gotta win and someone's gotta lose. I know I'm nowhere near the best support player alive, but I certainly know I'm not the worst, and that's all that matters. So, I've either started muting people, or just killing them with kindness and tried to make the best of my games. I do my best in every game I play, and if I lose, it's nobody's fault but my own; there was something else I should have done, or done better.\r\n\r\nI know this is a long post, and a tad bit personal, but I hope like the toxic players that do read this can reform. Toxic players are still players at the end of the day, and they've experienced just as much as any other player on the rift, but they certainly aren't enjoying the game nearly as much as you other players out there.","replies":[{"poster":"ssjx3squall","date":"2015-06-02T15:17:43.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want my chat removed.  I have 0 interest in saying anything or reading anything from anyone in any game anymore.  This community sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Eevamax","date":"2015-06-02T23:54:25.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, i go into games looking to play and win. Not to go in and have a conversation about someones day. Totally uninterested. Not to mention that most times its not about someones day, its usually blaming and pointing out obvious negative events such as \"Wow that team fight sucked\" or \"why didnt you focus the adc\". If anyone needs chat to say something, its more than likely not important. If i need to communicate, the ping system is great and easy to use.","replies":[{"poster":"RIP Resonance","date":"2015-06-04T22:24:46.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing wrong with playing to be competitive, but in my experience, giving an ice breaker generally makes the team more willing to communicate and fun to play with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RIP Resonance","date":"2015-06-02T21:47:55.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play this guy right here {{champion:201}} with champion voices on every so often.

I've tried... for years.  Just because you cant understand what its like to be plagued by negativity and want to ignore the reality of the world doesn't mean that you are right.  people are barely neutral, they are generally negative.\nIf you dont have a group you fit in with, you are worse than trash.  Thats how riot wants their community.  They use the automated systems to filter out the trash.  Even if you are just a product of their excluding community.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-02T01:36:33.247+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya RIP Resonance! \n\nThanks so much for sharing this!

Even though I am a girl.. I've had my moments. But instead of firing off I just mute people now. Because I know myself now and if I do fire off then I just end up frustrated all game and upset to where I can't focus. Granted, sometimes I don't always end up doing this. I guess it depends on the situation for me. I literally just got out of a normal game where some person was going on and on about how I am a girl, gaming, so I must be fat. I should be in the kitchen cooking and cleaning the house and no playing any games. I hate when people assume. I don't care if you're fat, skinny, guy, or girl. Just play the damn game without being a royal prick. Just blows my mind how these people stay being able to play league sometimes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-06-05T15:42:28.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sharing. I'm glad that you've found a way to make the game more fun for you and others. Don't give up on the people in game, sometimes they only need a positive person to calm them down. I think the people who say \"League has such a toxic community\" are often the people that propagate that toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-06-02T09:23:36.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"didnt read lol and by the way i enjoy trolling very much outrageous taric laughs all day.","replies":[]}]}
