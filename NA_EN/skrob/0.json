His bombs (His Q) was detonating and could graphically see his physical bomb on a creep or champion. Problem was: When it detonated. You could not see it and my other teammate said so as well. You could not see an explosion. You could only see a small bright green square in place of the explosion. It was really weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Elina Tariel","date":"2018-04-08T10:30:50.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Myself and party also couldn't see the bomb animations on Zilean.

I know exactly what you're talking about. I've got a bug logged for this, and I'll see if I can get a VFX artist on the case this week. If you're curious, the green square is basically a debug string to call out when any particular particle is missing or not hooked up properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SettDownShutUp","date":"2018-04-08T03:33:31.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping this, couldn't see the bomb's go off.","replies":[]}]}
