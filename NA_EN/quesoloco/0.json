Previously you could have forum badges that you would work towards, and that would assist with creating some traction in working with the forum set. This is what I think may help a bit with a lot of different things, rather than upvoting something, you \"tag\" it. Some tags that I think may be helpful are (some are shamelessly taken from slashdots system): \r\n\r\n* Informative (Something that brings a well thought out post)\r\n* Insightful (Something you hadn't thought about in context to the post)\r\n* Funny (Something that made you giggle!)\r\n\r\nAnd the opposite side of the spectrum, reports:\r\n\r\n* Spam (doesn't provide anything of context or relevance to the discussion)\r\n* Offtopic (when comments are attached to a post and have no relevance to the post [backpacking])\r\n* Offensive (For items that are either adhominems or provide nothing constructive to the conversation)\r\n\r\nI feel that provides a couple of different interactions that can be helpful:\r\n\r\n* Forum badges (like the in-game honor system) that allow you to get an icon next to your name for having Insightful, Funny, or Informative posts\r\n* The vote system gets removed so rather than just upvoting something, it's instead an informative post, or an insightful post; this provides a way for unpopular opinions that are well constructed aren't just lost in \"rito pls\"\r\n* The same call to action appears consistently for players (so that giving someone a well thought out post is good for both the thought out post, and the person)\r\n* Allows easier sorting, so if you don't want to see a post that's funny on a balance discussion, you don't have to.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just what I think would really make it a lot easier traction to foster better discussions, and makes it so that you're working positively, and being rewarded for giving something to the community.","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-02-19T12:38:30.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 Insightful, +1 Interesting","replies":[]}]}
