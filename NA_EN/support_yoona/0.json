The next game then becomes exceptionally hard. The next one is good. The next game is impossible and it goes on like that. \r\n\r\nLike if you go 10/3 with master yi jg but your botlane is 0/14, mid is 2/6, top afks while being 0/2... \r\n\r\nI'm slightly mad but very much annoyed and confused. Does the MMR system that thinks I deserve silver 1 purposely match me up with bad players in every other game? I sound very naive in this post and in a sense I am. If someone with more knowledge can help me that will be cool. Like I know the \"get better\" advice but some games are quite impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-06T18:52:31.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchmaking will do its best to match similarly skilled players, but everyone has bad games.
