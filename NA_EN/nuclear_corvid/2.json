Being the contrary guy I am, I asked myself the question: \"Does a character have to be inhuman in order to be an effective monster?\" I decided that, no, that did not have to be true. After all, Dracula (and vampires in general, especially nowadays) was close in appearance to deceive people into believing he was human, and yet he remains a well-used villain/monster to this day. Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees are human (or at least, were and barely changed in appearance) and remain horror icons. So why were the prior female monsters not successful as monsters (obviously, no one's going to debate Zyra and Elise's effectiveness as champions)? Honestly, it's likely simply because the focus was more on \"female\" than \"monster\", with their sexiness making them more attractive than scary. (I would exclude {{champion:69}}  from this list, given that, as a honey trap prior to her transformation, the sexiness is completely appropriate there). So, how would I approach a human, female monster champion? Well, let's look at the humanish monsters I mentioned above - Dracula, Jason, Freddy. The unifying thread is that they look like humans - but something about them is just not quite there, like a variant of the Uncanny Valley effect. It largely has to do with faces - Jason's is covered, Freddy's is disfigured horribly, and Dracula's got fangs and pale skin. So, the answer to the question is, no, a character doesn't have to be utterly inhuman to be effectively monstrous.\n\n**First paragraph TL;DR : \"Does a character have to be inhuman in order to be an effective monster?\" Answer: No, there just needs to be something...off.**\n\nWith that out of the way, let's start designing something horrifyingly human. First, we'll need something off about this girl - and for that, I'm going to turn to possession of the worst kind - the kind where the victim is not only completely capable of knowing that they are possessed, but also capable of expressing that they know, without being able to actually do anything about it. To that end, much of her dialogue would essentially be apologies, screamed in horror, as she chops people up. The rest? The voice of the thing that possesses her, just to keep things mixed up, and be a little unnerving when it does crop up. Second, a covered face, since we generally identify \"human\" with faces, and things without faces are easier to dehumanize, with glowing red tear streaks (hence, the \"weeping\" part of the Weeping Ripper). Last, let's give her a scythe, because scythe girls. And the death association.\n\nNow, onto the kit. I've drawn some inspiration from slasher movies on this one - the kind of monster that can just sort of be there, and is implacable in its pursuit of whoever earned its displeasure. The result is probably the closest you can get to a tank assassin without snapping the game in half.\n\n**ABILITIES**\n\n**Passive - Rip Apart**\n                Lucy's basic attacks apply a stack of Ripped Apart to enemies. When a stack is applied, the target takes 1% per stack of its maximum health as magic damage. Stacks last three seconds. Lucy's attack speed is always 1.000.\n\n**Explanation** - This is literally the only damage in her kit - she's completely reliant on tearing into people with her scythe to cause damage. The intent is that this will cause threat - the damage constantly ramps up, and Lucy will eventually be tearing into her unfortunate target with startling force. The limitation of once per second is to nullify any abuse with high attack speeds, as Lucy is intended to be a tank, not a bruiser or burst assassin.\n\nFYI, the progression looks like this: **Second** - Percent Damage On-Hit (Total Percent Damage): **1** - 1% (1%) **2** - 2% (3%) **3** - 3% (6%) **4** - 4% (10%) **5** - 5% (15%) **6** - 6% (21%) **7** - 7% (28%) **8** - 8% (36%) **9** - 9% (45%) **10** - 10% (55%)\n\nThis is, of course, assuming no disruptions.\n\n**Q - Scythe Trick**                                 Cooldown : 9/8/7/6/5 seconds\n                Lucy's next basic attack gains 100 range and pulls her target toward her. Scythe Trick adds an additional stack of Ripped Apart.\n\n**Explanation** - Simultaneously a tool to make her feel difficult to escape (as is the case with many slasher killers) as well as being her primary CC.\n\n**W - From Shadows**\n                Lucy gains 10%/20%/30%/40%/50% movement speed bonus for the next 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds. During this time, as long as she remains unseen by the enemy team, she can pass through terrain and units.\n\n**Explanation** - This is meant to simultaneously allow Lucy to close in and achieve what is best called [Offscreen Teleportation](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation). Also known as, \"Holy crap, how did she get there?!? Run awaaaaaaay...\"\n\n**E - Stalk**       Cooldown - 20 seconds\n               On ground cast - Lucy stands still and increases her vision range over 2 seconds. Max vision range is 1500/2000/2500/3000/3500, and lasts for 2 seconds after it reaches max distance, as long as Lucy doesn't move.\n               On enemy champion cast - Lucy begins Stalking target enemy champion. Stalk is replaced by Stalking.\n\n**E - Stalking (Passive)**\n               When Lucy enters into 1500/2000/2500/3000/3500 range of the stalked champion, she gains vision of them. While Lucy has vision of them by this effect, the Stalked champion will be able to hear a footstep sound effect that starts quietly but grows louder as Lucy closes the distance. Stalked champions deal 12%/14%/16%/18%/20% less damage to Lucy. Lucy takes and deals 7/9/11/13/15% reduced damage to champions that are not being stalked. A kill or assist on the stalked champion replaces Stalking with Stalk on cooldown.\n\n**Explanation -** The somewhat complicated \"unique\" feature of Lucy's kit. The vision from Stalk is radial and ignores walls and brush. It is also not intended to be a channel, just a stationary cast, so it can only be interrupted by casting it again on a champion, running out the duration, or Lucy dying. The vision lasts longer than 2 seconds - that is merely the time frame in which it continues expanding, which should give time to target enemies near the edges.\n\nStalking is simultaneously a tank ability and assassin ability, in a weird sort of way. Once Lucy chooses to stalk someone, she's not going to be as effective at trying to kill anyone else (though they'll find the same is true of her), and she won't change her mind until that target is dead by her hands. Also, foley effects are cool, and would hopefully heighten the sense of fear as you hear her stalking around out there *somewhere* nearby.\n\n**R - Howling Terror**\n               Lucy screams for 2 seconds, driving nearby champions to flee from her. If a champion is being stalked by Lucy, they are instead stunned for the first second of the scream and taunted for the second.\n\n**Explanation -** When I say \"flee from\", imagine that, for the duration of this ability, Lucy is surrounded by an aura that inflicts a very brief fear effect sans slow on enemies in it. Lucy can move for the duration of the ability, so she can try to keep them running for the whole skill if she can keep the enemies in her aura. Also good for denying passage through the space around Lucy, as you can't just run through it unless you're Olaf.\n\nAs for the stalked target, it's basically supposed to be a combination of being scared out of your wits (stun) and trying to defend yourself against the oncoming horror (taunt). As a side note, the type of CC the stalked target is afflicted with is dependent on how long the scream has been going on - if the stalked target were to enter the area after .5 seconds had passed, they would be stunned for .5 seconds and then taunted for 1 second.\n\nSo, thoughts?\n\nAlso, now with **LORE**:\n\n\"Sit, sit and drink. You asked for information, but that doesn't mean we can't observe these little niceties.\"\n\nThe young man, probably about 30, took the cup he was offered by the old woman and sat in the most comfortable looking chair he could find.\n\n\"You asked me to tell you about Lucy.\" The woman said, taking a cup for herself.\n\n\"Yes. I've been... hearing things. In my head. Crying. Sobbing. A warning to stay away, and then... footsteps. Always footsteps.\" The man replied.\n\n\"Then it may be too late for you, but let me tell you what I know regardless. I'm surprised you'd come to me, though. Lucy is not that old an entity.\" The woman took a deep drink and began. \"She was a human once, much like us. From Piltover. A scientist and professor. She was very curious about the Harrowing, what causes it, why the Shadow Isles did it. So she decided that she would attempt an expedition out to the isles, not at the Harrowing, but at some other time. Of course, this was scorned by most of her peers, and she had difficulty finding colleagues to help her, to say nothing of a ship and crew to get her there. But at last she found a young, foolishly courageous captain to take her out, alone, to try and research the isles.\"\nThe old woman took another drink. The young man turned in his seat, startled by a creaking floorboard. The old woman just laughed.\n\"My, but you are jumpy. Can't say I blame you. Anyway, no one really knows what happened on that expedition, save that is was a complete failure. The only thing that came back was Lucy, and that's being generous. She's... not what she was. Not a human, at any rate, despite appearances to the contrary. Some time after that expedition left, there was a brutal murder in Bilgewater. A pirate was found, strewn along 30 feet of back alley, as if something had ripped him apart, slowly, piece by piece, as he tried to flee from it. Then another, similar murder occurred. It wasn't until the third that a person was connected to these murders - a dark robed figure with a scythe, and what seemed to be red tear tracks on its face. Upon being spotted, it turned a corner and, once out of sight, vanished without a trace - leaving behind only the mixed sound of demonic laughter and horrible weeping.\"\nThe woman paused for another drink, then set her cup down. The young man could almost hear the sound she had described, having heard it so many time before.\n\"The murders stopped for a time, then re-emerged in Piltover. The first was actually a colleague of Lucy's, and she's the only reason we believe that monster out there used to be Lucy, because in her last moments, she recognized her friend's voice through the weeping and screaming and wrote her name on the ground beneath her. Though it was still some time before the connection was made. In any case, knowing who she was hasn't stopped her from murdering at her whim.\"\n\"But what is she?\"\n\"Who can say? The contrast between her actions and her manner suggest she is possessed by...something, as does the occasional change in the sound of her voice. Whatever she is now, she is incredibly dangerous and violent - and unfortunately, I believe that what's left of the original Lucy knows, and that's why she weeps.\"\n\"What do I do? Can I stop her?\"\nThe old woman laughed again. \"My dear boy, I highly doubt it. No one has survived being stalked by Lucy, as far as anyone knows. Some people claim they have, but their tales don't hold up under scrutiny. My adivce, though? Never be alone. She's never killed someone who was around other people. And always be on guard - if you can't see her, she could be anywhere.\"\nThe young man heard footfalls outside and checked the window, but saw no one passing on the street outside. If there was someone out there, now would be his best chance to get home - or at least, to a more populated area. \"Thank you.\" He said, setting his cup down and standing. \"I should go before the streets thin out then.\" \n\"Indeed you should.\" The old woman said, leaning back in her chair as the young man left.\nThe door shut behind him. Then there was silence. Then, two intermingled screams, a man's and woman's, for nearly an hour. And finally, a sinister cackle, mixed with sobbing, telling the old woman that Lucy had just claimed another victim right off her doorstep.\n\n**QUOTES:**\nNote: Lines spoken normally by Lucy are in normal text.

It's a very cool concept, and making it work as a tank just makes it more unique (although maybe a bit contrary to the concept). You seem to have gotten down a very unique play style with the kit, and the lore was a good read too! \n\nThere are two things that could use some more clarity though: \n\n- The duration and range of **Stalk**s targeted active are really hard to perceive. Is it meant to be global range and infinite duration or something like that?\n- Where do you imagine her to excell?

In other words, if you have vision of an enemy champion by wards, allies, etc. you can start stalking them without waiting for your own enhanced vision to reach that far. Stalking itself lasts until you've at least helped kill your Stalked target, so if you're unlucky, you could end up stalking the same target for most of a match. The passive effects of Stalking can basically be separated into two parts - the vision part, which only activates within V/W/X/Y/Z range of the target (what those variables are is, well, variable), and the damage reduction part, which is always active regardless of range.\n\nThe idea is for her to be a jungler (despite her lack of damage abilities), where I believe, much like Rengar and Kha'zix, her theme is strongest, and where she can make the most use out of her skills. I imagine she'd do alright top lane (where she could use Stalking on the jungler to be become incredibly hard to gank, unfortunately), or mid lane, where she could put her skills to use roaming, though she'd probably get harassed too much in a lane primarily filled with ranged champs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigBenClockTower","date":"2015-02-04T05:29:35.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I had to share here.

In regards to Darius, Jayce, and Elise, etc, those champions could *burst* while building straight tank, which is something Lucy is literally incapable of doing, no matter how far ahead she gets. Lucy will kill a level 1 champion in roughly the same amount of time as a level 18 champion.\n2. The stacks last for a fairly short duration, and it should be relatively easy to stop Lucy from just tearing apart your carry or whatever if your team's CC person can be bothered to do it. It generates threat so that you can't just go \"Eh, the tank's not worth attacking, she couldn't kill anyone anyway!\"\n3. The damage is highly predictable. You could theoretically look at your stacks and think \"Ok, there are this many stacks, Lucy is this far from killing me.\" Lucy will never kill you straight out of nowhere unless you've somehow managed to accumulate a ton of stacks.\n\n\n> **Scythe Trick** is cool. I don't have any real complaints with this one, though perhaps don't add a stack of her passive?\n\nProbably. The damage on Rip Apart used to be lower, so I was trying to compensate for something, and just never removed it because it still felt too low. (Part of this is that tanks just don't live for more than 5-6 seconds in the current environment)\n\n> **From Shadows** can be hilariously overpowered, or hilarious underwhelming. I'd suggest balancing the numbers a bit more, since right now, 50% movement speed when she's super ahead is crazy, where as the 3.5 second duration is very unsatisfying when she isn't ahead.\n\nI had originally balanced it around Udyr's Bear Stance numbers, but apparently that got out of hand at some point. Though in that vein, it's probably stronger than you'd expect, since Udyr was maxing Bear Stance last anyway, and it starts at 2 seconds. I'll give it some more thought, but it's hard to gauge without actually hand-testing it.\n\nYou're probably right on the upper hand case, though I expect that this is the last skill she'd max, so that sort of thing would be rarely seen.\n\n> **Howling Terror** is actually the weakest part of her kit, and 2 second crowd control of the types it is is almost worthless for leveling (unless range or something increases, while cooldown remains low, at all ranks, as I don't see that information listed).\n> \n\nI was a bit worried about this skill, actually. 2 seconds is long for a CC by League standards, and a 2 second moving CC zone seemed...very strong to me. I might've overestimated it, I guess.\n\nAlso, oops.
