The item effectively adds another nuke spell on top of kits that are already designed to have strong up-front damage and aggravates the \"whoa, I got one shot out of nowhere\" frustration of playing against certain champions. A good example is LeBlanc; DFG adds reliability to her assassination patterns and ends up removing counterplay (she gets to rely on her Q, E, and DFG spells for damage, and can use dashes to reposition or escape instead of making more risky plays).\n\nThe second reason is strongly tied to the first; removing this item gives us room to buff champion kits that would otherwise be overpowered if they could use DFG. The most obvious example is Ahri; more 'magey' elements of the character, like her sustained damage or kiting, end up getting washed out because she has so much power to blow up charmed targets with a DFG burst. This ends up forcing us to balance Ahri around her assassin playstyle because there's always the \"I can buy DFG\" route to consider; removing the item means we can buff her in more interesting ways while still keeping some of her burst because she can't just pick up a DFG and double down on a single playstyle.\"\n\nBIG difference.","replies":[{"poster":"asktiks","date":"2015-01-15T17:13:05.481+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"so by that logic , they will buff ap ratios across the board amirite? \n\nits BS and you know it , buffing her in \"interesting ways\" is codespeak for we don't even know where to buff, we just don't want casters one shotting people, but its ok for melee assasins to do it, just not caster assasins\n\nI expect SIX MONTHS of no buffs , no dfg, no zed nerfs, just wait and see how we get to survive this BS for half a season\noh wait I forget, DFG mages cant make flashy BIGLCSPLAYS so nevermind move along...","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-01-15T17:24:08.483+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. They will buff the champions that relied on the item to be effective.

Is the fact people enjoy using or watching certain champions who make flashy plays in and of itself problematic? No. It's not. It's not about the \"LC$BIGPLAYS\" that make Zed annoying, it's strictly his overbearing strength with the current iteration of in-game balance.\n\n> All in all, Zed is one of the best examples of what we call a \"healthy assassin\" in League of Legends.\n\nJudging by the quotation marks, I, too, can see that Riot was \"totally serious\" when they said he was \"'healthy.'\" This is sarcasm, clearly. But let's look at what it's combined with, as you said, because that's more important. You complained about this:\n\n> That doesn't mean there aren't problems - while Zed's ability to delete squishies with a button press and some smooth moves is going to remain intact...\n\nAnd Veigar can't?\nAnd Katarina can't?\nAnd Annie can't? \nAnd Talon can't?\nAnd Master Yi can't?\nAnd LeBlanc can't?\nAnd [insert other *assassins or carries* here] can't?\n\nThe point makes no sense. Riot said nothing about keeping his escape totally intact. Riot made no claims that he wouldn't get hit with nerfs that made him more balanced and fun and strategic to play as and against. Riot simply said that Zed, classed as an **assassin**, will still maintain his ability to **assassinate** squishies, as that is the primary job of an **assassin.** Furthermore, with possibly the exceptions of Master Yi and Katarina (and Akali, possibly), this means that once their load is blown on said squishy, they are left with an even **less** than optimal kill and teamfight potential. As much as those Zed shurikens hurt, after he's used his Death Mark, he ONLY has those shurikens. And as a squishy melee, he's super vulnerable to simply jumping into a teamfight without that ultimate, regardless of how powerful he is. This is a distinct disadvantage of most (not all) assassins, and it's a very clear weakness. What does Talon do once he loses his ult? Spams W until someone steps out and he can E in again. What does Akali do without her ult? Sits around and watches the teamfight from afar with minimal impact until she gets a new charge. \n\nSo yes, he will maintain his ability to delete super squishy targets, like an ADC, if they get in range and are out of position, as is his role as an assassin. Just like **all other assassins.** \n\nAs another member stated, Riot has clearly pointed out that his kit is very problematic in the current iteration of game balance. It's not fair of you to nit-pick the way they chose to word it, especially when they're doing their best to make these patch notes interesting to read rather than the pages and pages of bland documentation that they truly are underneath it all.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Wright II","date":"2015-01-15T19:32:44.231+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"finally, SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT AN ASSASSIN DOES??","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-01-16T11:26:51.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deleting carries with a button comes at a price and that has been well established in league for 95% of the champions.\n{{champion:254}} needs to fully commit to her AD build and such she will likely not find a way out after diving the carry\n\n{{champion:45}}  has one of the weakest early games in the game, also immobile and requires enemy team not to dive him somehow. bruisers should get in his face unlike Zed's targeted dash + shadow.\n\n{{champion:55}} 's ult stands in place and is sustained, it does not delete a carry with a button press.

Once again, your freaking out over the ability for an assassin to instantly kill squishys. However, unlike some other assassins, zed cannot do so with a single button press.

If you want to complain about a champ that one shots squishys with one button complain about veigar.\n\n\nSome people in this player base are just never happy. They say they are going to nerf him, admit he's too strong and your complaining about how they agree with you.

However, it is annoying when the first time in a long time mana intensive characters get an item like Morellonomicon, and they are allowed to have even a 1/3 of the spammability zed has, the item gets nerfed within the end of the first month.  \n\nIt's like they know zed is a problem, and they do nothing about it.  Which is fine, but at least don't make the people constantly having problems against him even worse against him than they already are.   I don't even feel like I have to build even a 3rd of my damage kit to actually delete people with zed.  Riven is another character like this, but for different reason.  Mainly the giant ad scaling shield/dash on a low cooldown.","replies":[]}]}]}
