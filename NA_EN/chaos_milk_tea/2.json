Why is there this assumption that a mage MUST go mid?  They are only called mages because they deal ap damage and maybe have some utility.\n\nThe problem though, is that dot/dps champions actually must deal their damage slowly as they actually deal more damage overall, making the necessary tank and objective killers. Right now they go bot to farm up, get complementary c.c. from a support, and take advantage of the fact they scale harder off gold than levels. Why arent dps mages designed to go to the duo lane?  Is it because of outdated baggage that comes with being referred to as a mage?  The only other reason I could think of is that adaptive helm didnt exist before the tank update, and that a true ap bot dps carry would be too much for the game in its previous state.","replies":[{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2017-07-11T04:00:34.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Solemdeath","date":"2017-07-12T21:50:37.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Continue, I'd like to hear your thoughts and opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2017-07-12T22:18:32.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solemdeath,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yWyeU82b,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-07-12T21:50:37.613+0000)\n>\n> Continue, I&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts and opinions.\n\nmages are not treated like adcs because they don't fill the same role. if I see you declaring ryze botlane I'm banning the shit out of it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solemdeath","date":"2017-07-11T03:36:44.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC means \"Attack Damage Carry\". A good team comp should have a balanced mix between attack damage, magic damage, and tank. \n\nIf a Mage were to go ADC, that would mean instead of having an ADC, you would have more of an APC (Ability power carry). This usually means that your team comp would be very AP heavy, dealing little AD.\n\nThe problem with this is that one or two MR items is all the enemy team needs to completely shut down the majority of your team. \n\nIf you had a proper ADC this wouldn't be the case, since the ADC would shred them if they don't buy any armour, so they are now forced to buy both MR **and** armour to survive, which if they do buy both, it would take up a lot of their build, forcing less room to buy damage items.\n\nNow, if you were to look at this realistically, in most Bronze/Silver matches a proper team comp is the least of your worries. Chances are, the enemy carries will refuse to buy anything that doesn't give them damage, so you will blow them up even if you are all AP.\n\nIf your question is why you don't see many people playing mages in the bottom lane, I just want you to know there is no **rule** saying what you can or can not play in each lane. People just aren't used to the idea of AP champions being played as ADC so they are afraid to try something new.\n\nOne gameplay related reason that does come to mind, is that the damage Mages deal can't always keep up with the damage typical ADCs deal. Most ADCs can just right click and deal semi-consistent damage early game, and heavy damage late game.\n\nMages require mana to deal damage. Early game, you won't be able to do much as you will run out of mana fast if you use your abilities a lot. This makes it very hard to win lane, as most of the time your enemy laner will have more CS than you.\n\nLate game, Mages will have sustainable mana, so they can usually spam abilities in fights, clear waves, ect. and not have a problem with mana. But they will still have a hard time keeping up with the damage the enemy ADC is doing.\n\nI could also talk about counter-picks, but I didn't wake up planning to write a 1000 word essay.\n\n\nTl:Dr: Mages being played as ADC makes it easier for the enemy players to build defensive. In Low-ELO this isn't a problem most of the time, but smart players will be hard to play against. Since Mages rely on mana, they will usually have a hard time keeping up with the damage that ADCs deal. (Unless they get fed of course)\n\nEDIT: Forgot about killing turrets, but that's also a factor.

These champions (like cassiopeia) are balanced for mid lane though, and so have to have a certain amount of burst and wave clear to function in that role which prevents them having the raw dps an ad carry would get. Whenever they DO have proper dps, they still have their burst and end up being broken. It seems that dps champions aren't meant to solo lane.\n\nMany champions have built in mana refund systems to help them farm with their abilities since they have weak autos and a low cool down to spam anyway. (Cassiopeia comes up again)\n\nAs for damage spreads, that has never been a problem for any other lane.  AP top?  Ad mid?  It is perfectly easy to rearrange the damage composition of your team to accommodate those.\n\nRight now Kayle is the closest thing to an ap dps champion, and she gets to go top because of a weird kit that has single target dps, aoe damage, self sustain, and tons of utility.\n\nI suppose an alternative solution would be to let ap dps go jungle. At the moment ad dps is able to with champions like Xin Zhao.\n\nTo summarize, my point is that the way Riot handles AP dps champions right now isn't working.  I guess bot lane isn't the place to put them since they are not very good at taking towers (though a cheeky tryndatop can fix that lol).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-07-11T04:02:47.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play mages top \n\n{{champion:127}} {{champion:50}}","replies":[{"poster":"koshkyra","date":"2017-07-11T04:37:21.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yWyeU82b,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-07-11T04:02:47.702+0000)\n>\n> i play mages top \n> \n> {{champion:127}} {{champion:50}}\n\nDoes full AP {{champion:40}} top count?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vapor Wave Vibes","date":"2017-07-11T03:24:45.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dot mages like malzahar and swain really wouldn't be good in a 2 v 2 in the early game and are too hard to farm with under turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaos Milk Tea","date":"2017-07-11T03:31:21.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My question is more so why they aren't being designed TO BE good in a 2v2 lane so they can be dedicated dot mages instead of doty bursty... things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-07-11T03:18:16.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause ADC needs to be able to get turrets.
