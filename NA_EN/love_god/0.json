During this storm my house lost power for 3 hours, and when it started I was in the middle of a normal game. I just got power back and saw that I was placed in low priority queue for the next 5 games because of leaverbuster. This isn't too bad, but it is a nuisance because A) I did not voluntarily leave the game. B) There was nothing I could do. I am asking if somebody who has the authority to, would kindly remove the leaverbuster punishment. It would really help a lot! Thank you for reading this!\r\n\r\nP.S\r\nIf this needs to be moved then I can move it, I tried Riot Games Support but did not know what request type to label it as so I am leaving this here!","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-07-19T06:07:21.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot actually never removes leaverbuster punishments.

I also only had 1 afk game prior, which was do to bugsplat D:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-20T21:09:17.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lew is correct. Even if your intent is not malicious, leaving a game negatively affects 9 other players in the match. This is one of the key reasons as to why Leaverbuster treats all leaves equally and why we are unable to remove or modify the penalties. It takes a trend of disconnections before you get penalties, and if you're disconnecting often, there's likely a technical issue that can be fixed.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}
