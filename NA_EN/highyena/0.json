I checked to make sure the card into was right, I had the right CVV, etc. I even tried re-entering the card information and NOW it&#039;s telling me I&#039;ve made the maximum attempts, and I have to try again 24 hours later. I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;m not waiting 24 hours to purchase RP. I promised a friend I&#039;d buy them a skin today and I really don&#039;t want to make them wait considering they didn&#039;t make me wait when they gifted me a skin I really wanted. I&#039;d really like to get this fixed, it&#039;s quite annoying :-/","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-18T18:54:40.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mornign ladykoraki - \n\nAre you still having trouble with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-02-18T23:14:49.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue.
