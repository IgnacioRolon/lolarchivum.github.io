Then near the end of the game my internet disconnected for a bit. I had to restart my pc. After my friend said we won and when I logged back in I was shown leavebuster... EVEN THOUGH I CARRIED HARD. Whats worse is i got a 20 minute wait queue even though ive never dodged, afked, or anything for the past YEAR. WHY IS IT 20 MINUTES? AND WHY DO I GET PUNISHED FOR CARRYING AND LEAVING FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES AT THE END OF THE GAME. Leavebuster is made for those who give and unfair advantage to the other team by leaving the game or afking. So why should I get punished when I didnt do anything wrong but carry. The only thing my team did was close out the game from the lead I made.\nUpvote this is this happened to you and you think a change should happen to those like us, because it's simply unfair and a waste of time.

There was no way I could play if I couldn't even see what was happening, but it was already late game and we were pushed in our base. In the amount of time it took me to restart everything and go to reconnect, the game was already over and we had lost. I got a leavebuster and felt like it was unjustified since I had never disconnected from a game before and only did so because I was having computer issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2018-08-02T05:50:42.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idiots ragequit over a single death > Forcing Riot to crack down hard on those who leave and offer no exceptions > People who leave due to system errors or other plausible reasons suffering for it.\n\nIt's really annoying but it's just something we've got to put up with. I can't count how many times I've been crammed into leaverbuster for things I had no control over but I know it's not really Riot's fault here (impossible notion, but it's true, Riot's not a fault for this one).","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-02T15:50:39.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so I got DC'd (my internet took a crap) we were winning, I came back like 10 minutes later and we still won.
