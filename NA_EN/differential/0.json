For instance &quot;Underworld azir&quot; and &quot;project zed&quot; I would just like to know do you have any plans to actually recreate these ideas? I know you have used skins created from the community before but is this board simply for ideas? or do you just have a lot on your plate and are getting around to making these skins, as i&#039;m curious because id be willing to bet that some of the most top rated skins posted here would sell really good.\r\n\r\n-Hunter","replies":[{"poster":"bearded squid","date":"2015-07-18T12:21:44.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even if they were making them or had them shelved atm they wouldnt be able to tell you because thats how they keep everything a suprise","replies":[{"poster":"Differential","date":"2015-07-18T17:29:45.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't want specifics, I just wanted to know if they _ever_ are going to release some of these awesome community creations.","replies":[{"poster":"bearded squid","date":"2015-07-18T21:45:45.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think they could even give you that much","replies":[{"poster":"Differential","date":"2015-07-19T02:19:37.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-19T06:50:52.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much what I was going to say.\n\nHowever I can give you more context on how we go about choosing what projects to work on. When we have a meeting to ideate on thematics and champions for skins we always bring up relevant fan concepts and take note of how much player support they have garnered. We never just say 'This concept got 8k upvotes so let's make it' but if an idea is popular it will at least be considered in the spread or used as a starting point for a design. I would say skins team (with people like Whist, Galetta, Nurse Flan and KateyKhaos to name a few) keeps a close eye on fan concepts, not just on the boards but also on the Chinese/Korean/Garena sites.
