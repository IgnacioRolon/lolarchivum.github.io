And as players it is up to us to figure out how to do it.  Does TP need nerfs?  Who knows.  Without aggressive summoners, your own ability to carry games is severely impaired.  There was a time where melle champions arrived to lane with 500-something hp and ranged champions would arrive with around 400.  These days we arrive with 650-700 hp in lane (not always a bad thing you need dem base stats to survive the ranged tops).  But combine this with teleport and suddenly now we have a big problem.  \r\n\r\nDuring the times of aggressive spells you could end someone before gank support happened.  You could ward off the less mobile junglers and go about your lvl 1-2 crushing someone who did not respect minions, your early game, your exp lead, or any of the above.  And when he comes back if he extends he will die AGAIN.  That was how it was and how it should be.  Since our ability to make leads was lessened, shutdowns increased, now more than ever it is harder to 2v1 the laner and jungler even with a big lead.  Ganks are stronger and ganking someone 3-5 times will put them out of the game.\r\n\r\n Now we are both giant tanks, our sole purpose to go bottom and turn that 1 fight around.  We even build disgusting items like knights vow redirecting damage to OURSELVES hoping that someone else will carry harder.  Lord dominics regards will crush us lategame and no full armor build can stop you from becoming a healthpot... without ignite or thornmail.  If you kill someone 3 times?  he can still farm.  Ive done it when I mess up.  Why?  Because i now have an exp lead with a frozen wave because i teleported.  Something needs to be done about the bot meta because right now with the new shield items, heal items, and lack of ignite, carrying games vrs an enemy adc is impossible if your own adc player is afraid to fight while 5 people crush you.  AP mid has yet to become a glorified support.  Dont continue to let us toplaners be.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-08-02T14:19:20.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buff juggernauts and we'll fix top lane up real quick","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-08-02T14:17:43.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing glorified about toplane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dygax37","date":"2017-08-02T08:22:27.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh and these days the late game is LOL.

While it is true that some people can dive you regardless if you are ahead, behind, or full hp and farming safely, teleport is still a lose less spell.  And losing less is a bad deal for any good player out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2017-08-02T07:51:26.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhhh what? you are playing SoloQ. Go and play a splitpusher if that is the only way you know how to. Go play a carry top laner if that is the only way you know how. You can bring ignite anytime you want top lane, don't complain when you get dove by the enemy jungler+top laner and forced to go back making you miss  a lot of CS or when you are unable to do anything when the enemy is actually doing something more productive than pushing a wave past river. You are speaking like carry top laners and splitpushers will auto lose if you pick them right now. That is not the case,, not even remotely","replies":[]}]}
