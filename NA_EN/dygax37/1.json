Zoe is not a problem for me or anyone building a shred of survivability.  The comments about here seem to be stemming from adc players, so why should people consider nerfs?  Those who are complaining have basically been getting to play god from 2017-2018.  There needs to be a fix for the problem.  And damage in general.  4 armor items, 1 dps item, and tabi wont stop it.  \r\n\r\nThere are only a few instances where there may be a HINT of a problem with zoe.  And it is not her damage.  It is her ability to excel in the fog of war and the ability to attack over and over with little punishment, until her enemy slips up.","replies":[{"poster":"RuFiot","date":"2018-01-10T07:02:01.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:142}} is the new {{champion:1}} only safer","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-15T09:33:07.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only without the aoe cc, without the super easy laning, and without the reliability.\n\nWow they're sooooooo comparable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-01-10T08:31:38.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem with Zoe is how forgiving her Kit is. And how rewarding it is to MISS her E. \n\nYou miss the bubble only to proc a zone the size of Brand's Pillar of fire (W) which is a hitbox wider than oprah's thickness. THEN!!! you have a sleep that lasts for over 2 seconds from Skill Level 1, which is CHAMPION LEVEL2!!! A 1 second wind up slow and a 2+ second sleep which is basically a stun. that rewards you with procing it's entire skilldamage a second time....**IN TRUE DAMAGE** \n\nthen...her W.....this godforsaken turdcake. Ok, imagine getting redemption at lvl 3. imagine gunblade active at lvl 3. imagine a Barrier ontop of ignite and flash, or multiple flashes, a tp, fucking locket of the solari active!!! you can get ANY summoner spell and ANY item actives in the god damn game with the sole exception of targon's and for god knows what reason. \n\nYou try fighting a champion who can just for mediocre csing break the 6 items Limit and 2 summoners Limit. multiple times in a row, for entire fight durations.\n\nEdit: Long story short, Zoe is not op or broken, but everything in her kit just screams \"Fuck fun, win or quit kid\" ","replies":[]}]}
