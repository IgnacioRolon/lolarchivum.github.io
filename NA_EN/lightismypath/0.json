After jumping in game full of fear for the changes to my favorite, reason-i-play -the -game champion and the harsh changes to my favorite class of champions in general I had to realize with horror my fear were still 100 times better than what truly was the situation. \r\n\r\nI have a generally aggressive playstyle and I went out of mana at level 2 in both games I played. In the first game I was facing a Brand, who I play very rarely. In the second game I was against a Syndra though, whose mana costs I am confident with.. And she was at about half mana bar while poking me back. I basically lost lane at level 2 without any kind of chance to come back till teamfights as I was constantly oom.\r\n\r\n I didn&#039;t understand how that was possible until in a duel I died because I couldn&#039;t reactivate my already on the ground E while oom. The moment I died it exploded normally. I went oom again with E on the ground later and I realized this: Pressing it again to explode made the indicator glow.. Exactly like when you have no mana to cast a spell.\r\n\r\nSo I checked the spell with all numbers up: If you activate E again in the first second or so after landing it on the ground (the near istant detonation) IT TAKES MANA FOR BOTH CAST AND EXPLOSION...\r\n\r\n Lux mana costs are already pretty harsh but having your main poke tool at a 140 mana cost at level 1 effectively makes the champion unable to trade . Coupled with the radius reduction (which makes pretty much impossible hitting anyone not afk without insta explosion ) and the mana nerfs later in the game (preventing you from sustaining to poke at double mana cost) the champion is unplayable in any scenario but teamfights when you can allow your E on the ground enough to avoid this (who I suppose and deeply hope is a bug). \r\n\r\nPlease fix this if it&#039;s a bug! This mechanic (I sincerely hope bugged) is killing (especially mid) Lux!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Calad","date":"2018-05-02T17:43:13.059+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are aware of this bug and looking to fix it ASAP.
