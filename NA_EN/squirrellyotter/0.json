This spear kinda looks like a narrower, faster, silver-white version of a Karthus ult.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is, the spear doesn't appear on the third hit, nor does it appear (consistent) on unit death, and sometimes procs while the target is alive.  I realized later that this spear consistently appears on critical hits; I notice the spear only appears after I purchase Zeal/PD/CoA/IE and appears more often when I have PD and/or IE.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a gamebreaking bug obviously but it is sometimes distracting, and sometimes irritating, like looking at a faulty strobe light.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else besides my girlfriend (also a Vayne player) and I experienced this?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-25T00:54:34.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeab!
