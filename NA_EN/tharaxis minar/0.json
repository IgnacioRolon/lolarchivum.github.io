Came Back (WON) and get Negative LP","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"So had a game this morning that somewhere around 10 minutes in I started to lag real bad (800 ping spikes) then my internet went down and I disconnected.\r\n\r\nTurned out it was my computer not the internet so I had to restart.. Took about 7 minutes to come back...\r\n\r\nGot back in the game and my team was actually doing well and we went on to win the game.  Then I see I get a message \"You are ineligible to earn loot due to leaving or AFK behaviors\"\r\n\r\nNow i get they want to stop AFK players..but this to me does the exact opposite. So if in the future my game crashes... or my internet messes up what reason do I have to even re-connect to the game? Your team always flames you for leaving.. so if your going to get negative LP why come back at all?\r\n\r\nJust confused on how this helps the game at all.  I could understand not giving LP to someone that disconnected and never came back and their team won 4 to 5.  But I was there for about the last 10 minutes of the game..\r\n\r\nMaybe I am just looking at this all wrong but I just imagine this will make people who d/c not want to reconnect in the future.  Maybe just no LP gain if you come back and get a victory or something but not a -17 LP for a victory.","replies":[]}
