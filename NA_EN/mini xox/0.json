I always have used the Team Recruitment Board to find teams and now the only sorting is \"Recent\" which is not actually \"Recent\" at all. Go and check the Team Recruitment page you will find posts from 3 days ago mixed with posts from 8 hours ago. Before I could sort it by new and see someone looking for players 5 minutes ago. This is now impossible due to the removal of this sorting system. Why was it removed in the first place? Was funding cut on the Website? Was it too difficult to keep the sorting system that has been around since the old forums? I just see no logic at all as to why it was removed other than pure laziness. This is extremely frustrating for me and many of my community friends. I just want to hear a response that actually makes sense for this change. It hasn't streamlined anything now it's more tedious than ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-11-24T22:48:59.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They changed it because people were asking for it to be changed.\n\nThat being said, I think adding back the 'new' sorting would be a good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-11-24T23:55:11.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While the change to \"recent\" sorting was based on a solid request, it doesn't leave much for alternative viewing styles.
