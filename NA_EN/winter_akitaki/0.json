This issue has been around for a few patches already and nobody seems to address it - at least, I haven&#039;t seen anybody complain.\r\n\r\nQuite often, like 1/2 or 1/3 of the times, I stumble upon an annoying bug. My emote wheel would be empty for the whole game. It&#039;s as simple as that and I don&#039;t believe it requires much explaining. Feel free to comment on this post if you have the same issue. I play a lot of ARAMs lately so I don&#039;t know if it also happens on Summoner&#039;s Rift; that&#039;d be a maybe, sorry, I don&#039;t know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2018-09-28T15:35:12.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens to me on all of my accounts.

I play mostly summoners rift, so it’s not just ARAM. It’s kinda disheartening to be a midlaner and not be able to thank your JG quickly with an emote after a gank, or use emotes at all for that matter. I read that other patches have had the same issue, so I’m curious what’s going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Winter Akitaki","date":"2018-09-28T11:02:59.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly my issue.
