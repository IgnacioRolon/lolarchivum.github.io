Everything for the most part is normal, I have normal Ping (36) and I'm not sure if my FPS drops during it or not, I don't know my normal FPS because I've had the counter turned off for awhile unnoticed. I don't have constant lag, but every 20 or so seconds, sometimes sooner, I get this random spike where my ping shoots up, only about 10ms mind you, to around 45-50ms, which isn't bad, but for some reason, it makes it impossible to play the game. I completely lose control of my character for a good 6-7 seconds, sometimes longer, but the rest of the game goes on without me, and I can see everything that's happening, I just lost complete control of my character. Then, everything goes back to normal, and then it happens again in another 20 or so seconds. The game is unbearably annoying, unplayable and i can't stand it. I'm pretty sure it's not my internet, but I could be wrong. I say that based on the fact that 99% of the time my games are completely normal. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody know what the problem is or a fix?\r\nIs it my computer, my internet, riot servers or what?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T23:58:40.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like pretty common symptoms of *Packet Loss*, which happens if the packets of data sent or received from the servers is lost along the way.

A couple of days ago when I posted this, I had this \"lag\" and it was extremely frustrating. It would just start to happen one game, and it wouldn't stop, long stretches of me not being able to control my character, cast spells, or even ping or talk in chat. This freeze could last for ~10 or more seconds sometimes, meanwhile I can see everyone else do everything in real time. After i woke up the next day, I had one of those, \"Updates\" where it says it's patching, but it doesn't look like it's doing anything, and it never gets to 100%, it just stays at 0% and then disappears. I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but afterwards my game worked fine. I also notice I tend to only notice it some days, but the days I do get it, it usually happens at night. I've been playing for the past 3 or 4 days, day and night, and I haven't had any of this \"Lag.\" But today, back at it again, where I'm just playing and one game it randomly starts up.\n\nI did the packet loss test thing, but I don't know what any of it means, however, here's the \"Noteworthy: Minor aberrations\"\n\n\nMinor Aberrations\nâ€“\n\n    Certain TCP protocols are blocked in outbound traffic\n    We detected at least one proxy\n    The network indicated bursts of packet loss\n    Network packet buffering may be excessive\n    We received unexpected and possibly dangerous results when looking up important names\n    Certain TCP protocols are blocked in outbound traffic\n    Only some root servers returned DNSSEC information \n\nI see that it says the bursts of packet loss, does that mean it's my ISP? And if so, that basically means there's nothing I can do about it, I just have to deal with it sometimes?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-20T23:14:45.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet loss just means there's an issue between your PC and the server.

I'm going to take a break for a few hours and see if it resolves it self again like it always does, it's just annoying that the lag is seemingly random and I don't know when it is going to happen. I hasn't happened since I posted that last comment either, just now again. It just randomly fixes itself and randomly shows up again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-27T21:51:52.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening during peak hours (5PM-10PM)?

Not sure what it means, but I posted it as a ticket on the support boards. And as for whether or not it happens at peak times, as I said before it happens at seemingly random. Yesterday at roughly 1am I was getting the lag, and today at around 4pm I was experiencing it. Another side question, could it also be my PC? It's been awhile since I've cleaned it out, but I'm not sure if that would cause what's happening to me in game to happen or not. It's happening more frequently however, I'm having the same problem as before, it just seems to happen more sporatically in game. I'll start the game with 200~ FPS, but once I see it fall to the low 100s~ I know that's when I'm going to start losing control.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T22:54:15.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've already ruled out local network settings, so it's very likely something along your network routing.
