Odds are only a handful of people will read this but hey, it'll make me feel like I did something nice :P \n\nFirst thing I want to go over is minion spawn times, I figured this would be helpful for roaming, if you want to make sure you get as much CS as possible, roaming in between waves will help you make it back to lane by the next one (usually)\n\n**When I say \"Arrives @ Lane\", I am _not_ referring to when the minions meet at the center of the map. I am referring to a couple seconds later when they go into attacking formation (3 Melee minions in front, 3 caster minions in the back)**\n\n\n**Minion Spawn Times:**\n\nMinions Spawn 5s after previous one arrives to lane\nMinions take 25s to Arrive to lane \n\n1:15 - Wave 1 Spawns\n**1:40 - Wave 1 Arrives @ Lane**\n\n1:45 - Wave 2 Spawns\n**2:10 - Wave 2 Arrives @ Lane**\n\n2:15 - Wave 3 Spawns\n**2:40 - Wave 3 Arrives @ Lane**\n\n3:45 - Wave 4 Spawns\n**3:10 - Wave 4 Arrives @ Lane**\n\n3:15 - Wave 5 Spawns\n**3:40 - Wave 5 Arrives @ Lane**\n\n\n**Minion Gold (G)**\n\nThis info can also be found [Here](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Minion) on the League Wiki, I felt I should add it here so it would all be in one place\n\n**Melee Minion** - 19.8 G  (+0.2 G / 90 sec)\n- 3 Spawn per Wave\n- Give 59 EXP\n\n**Caster Minion** - 14.8 G  (+0.2 G / 90 sec)\n- 3 Spawn per Wave\n- Give 29 EXP\n\n**Cannon Minion** - 40 G  (+0.5 G  / 90 sec)\n- 1 Spawns per 3 Waves (Wave 3, 6, 9, etc.)\n- Give 92 EXP \n\n**Super Minion** - 40 G  (+1 G / 3 min)\n- 1 Spawn Every wave after an Inhibitor is destroyed\n- Give 97 EXP\n\n\n**Minion Agro**\n\nBy default minions attack whatever enemy is closest. This will change when there are champions involved, if there are champions involved it will prioritize who it attacks in the following order. \n\nTIP: Before going all in on an attack, make sure that there are more of your minions in the lane than they do, this way when you get into a fight, your minions will be attacking the enemy. While this wont completely change the outcome of the fight (especially late game) but it will save you a death when things come close.\n\n(Ranked from greatest to least priority)\n(These are kinda confusing to read, sorry)\n\n1. If an Ally champion is being attacked by an Enemy champion, minions will attack Enemy Champion.\n2. If an Ally champion is being attacked by an Enemy minion, minions will focus the enemy minion.\n3. If an Enemy minion is attacking an Ally minion, ally minions will focus the enemy minion.\n4. If an Enemy turret is attacking an Ally minion, the Ally minions will focus the Enemy turret\n5. If an Enemy champion is attacking an Ally minion, then the Ally minions will focus the Enemy champion\n6. The closest enemy minion.\n7. The closest enemy champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-06-21T02:06:45.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking this necro","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alonso1859","date":"2017-06-27T20:19:11.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The part about agro is incorrect or not well explained.
