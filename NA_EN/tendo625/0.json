The way we try to approach skins nowadays is to fully flesh out what X champ's story is within a given thematic, with the intent to let that then inform design throughout the entirety of the skin from Concept all the way through to VFX and SFX. Ideally we treat the story as sort of a creative North Star. So we started there.\n\nIn this thematic, Yorick is essentially a king of a great and prosperous land, and when darkness descends upon his kingdom he is tested by the divine light of VelKoz's gaze. Passing the trial, he gains power and dominion over light, becoming a paladin of the Arclight Order to protect the mortal realm from the dark threat. In doing this, however, he also loses his mortality. Yorick outlives his beloved queen, his children, grandchildren, his kingdom and it's people. In taking on the light he ends up still losing the very thing he vowed to protect with it's powers. The last remaining humanity left in him uses the light to create constructs, monuments to his fallen queen.

Think about it Sandcastle Cage, Giant Toy Shovel, Coral reef as his back piece, and the piece de resistance: A MERMAID MAIDEN, MERMAIDEN!!! My only complaint is that the pool party skins have already had so many contributions. I'm not sure if the theme would still work as Atlantean/Deep Sea. Maybe you could call it Beach Bro Yorick. As an aside I like the skin you guys did a great job and I'll definitely buy it day 1. I'm wondering if there is anywhere I can read about the alternate universe skin lines. I know the new Star Guardians is the first time the lore team went full out on a skin line. I think it'd be awesome to read about the thought process the skins teams go through when coming up with new designs or revisiting older ones. I'd love to read a dev blog about the Arclight/Elderwood/Project skin lines and why certain champions are chosen over others. What the champions connections are in those universes etc. I quoted you but this goes Riot Kindlejack and the whole team.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot DrPh8","date":"2017-09-18T05:41:36.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha yeah dude....

We're all absolute geeks who nerd out over these elseworld representations of the champs we love and are super hyped that we're able to funnel that kind of love and craft into the content we put out, so it'd be really cool to share some of that stuff in a broader way.

Aatrox and Syndra's designs are quite different from each other, a little more wild.\n\nI had an idea years ago to revisit Justicar and really figure it out, but now I'm on champion so we'll see if skins ever take a crack at it :)\n\nWhen it comes to renaming old skins we've discussed it in the past and for now at least decided to leave the old names alone.

A man cowers before it. All the light in the cavernous hall suddenly rushes toward the unblinking eye, refracting off its cornea and generating enormous, purifying power. The man’s body lifts from the stone beneath his feet. His skin blisters before his body disappears in the blinding light.\n> Vayne: A pair of golden wings speed her through the air as she slings bolts of light from a heavenly crossbow, smiting the fools who question her supremacy. True warriors dream of testing their skills against her divine power.\n> The lucky ones wake up before they do.\n> \n> I think this is all we got about the Arclight theme. And there is the theory, that Vel&#x27;Koz transforms people into the Arclight warriors (so the man in his story gets transformed and not killed).\n> So maybe Yoricks release post will bring some lore for his skin.\n\nUnfortunately we want the voice out for release so we might be unable to include anything in the release post :(","replies":[]}]}]}
