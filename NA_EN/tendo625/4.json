The thing that frustrates me the most about League lore is that not only is it static, never really getting anywhere despite the stories we get, (the broken blades was a rare and welcome exception) but if you ever casually browse red posts and see an answer to a lore related question you more often than not come across the phrase &#039;player facing&#039;.\r\n\r\nThis phrase has always made me frustrated because it&#039;s almost mocking. They know full well the answer to what you want to know but choose to hold it back for arbitrary reasons usually related to finding an &#039;appropriate&#039; time to release it. For all we know they could have the Soraka lore update done but just choose to hold it back since there&#039;s no Targon event happening and the fact there is no communication other than a vague &quot;soon&quot; just makes it all the more tiring being a fan of League lore.\r\n\r\nThis frustration has made me appreciate the skin lore much more than the normal lore. Do you have a question? just @riot in the title and you&#039;ll get your answer within a day or two no matter how complex when wanting to know something like the color of Swain&#039;s underwear requires months of build-up and teasing and &#039;soon&#039; to ultimately culminate in something we either already knew or a meme response.\r\n\r\nWhen important aspects of the lore like Swain&#039;s demon is left aside under the vague umbrella or &#039;maybe soon&#039; it&#039;s so incredibly frustrating to see a simple thing not be answered since it&#039;s not &#039;player facing&#039;. Tahm Kench&#039;s recent bio and story were written up for quite some time according to a red and only recently shown due to the Bilgewater event, him being my main I was both excited and upset that the lore provided nothing I already didn&#039;t know about Tahm. It was cool but Eve got so much more interesting history and developed Demons as a whole while Tahm was more just reiteration. Why did it have to wait if it wasn&#039;t even spoilers or anything?\r\n\r\nThe only word I have to keep describing this is frustrating. I just hope we get more Dark Star or skin lore now since it feels a lot more fulfilling to be noticed and answered when you want to know something new.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-06-11T21:37:16.624+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so I feel like I've got a lot to answer for here - I've used that phrase quite a few times.  \nSorry - it was most definitely NOT intended to be mocking.

I have some concerns though.\n\nFor starters, a lot of the lore in bios is left intentionally vague. For instance, it's not immediately clear in Pyke's bio that he's dead, but his VO does emphasize this point. The bio should be the place where first and foremost we are given the groundwork for a champion, such as their life state, brief synopses of their life and what led them here, and whatnot. It fails to be a functional bio if it doesn't give us a grounded understanding of the character, especially since visually a dead character like Pyke doesn't look much different from a living character like Illaoi with her spirit tentacles and glowing eyes.\n\nAnother concern I have is the fact that it doesn't appear that the lore and narrative is stabilized at all. It seems that every time there's a new event or a new champion, that causes a ripple in the continuity where existing lore and bios get changes far too frequently. It looks to us like there's no game plan or commitment to the lore and narrative, that it's all made up on the fly. I get how this can be good for creativity of new champs and concepts and such, but _planning_ how the lore will unfold, and how the greater story is going to be told is essential for having a world we can continue to love, and honestly makes it easier on your end when trying to slot things into the world. It's pretty exhausting to have to _constantly_ reread character bios because the release of a new champ caused everyone else in the region to have their lore rewritten. Commit to a story. Build characters in that story. Try not to completely rewrite the larger stories in the middle of existing stories, because it degrades the quality of the narrative.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-11T19:50:32.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:10}} and {{champion:25}} 's lore will not be updated for an eternity because there's probably a 0% chance of an \"angel event\" happening.\n\nI mean Jesus Christ they aren't even part of the League universe anymore.\n\nThey're in their own little world.","replies":[{"poster":"Febos","date":"2018-06-11T19:55:29.807+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=XYYzEKKa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-11T19:50:32.343+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:10}} and {{champion:25}} &#x27;s lore will not be updated for an eternity because there&#x27;s probably a 0% chance of an &quot;angel event&quot; happening.\n\nActually, Kayle's and Morgana's lore will be updated when **both** of them receive their rework.
