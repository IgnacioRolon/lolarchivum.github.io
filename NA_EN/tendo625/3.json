A lot of players connect Dark Star to Star Guardian just because of the ''Star'' showcased in the name itself I have the feeling; both skinlines do have no harmony at all with each other â€“ one is straightly cute & shiny anime, the other grimdark cosmic horror with a much more ''serious'' design.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-10-25T16:07:04.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree on both counts.
