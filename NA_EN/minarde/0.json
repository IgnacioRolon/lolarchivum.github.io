Furthermore, the [LeaverBuster article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h1q4) includes Co-op as a \"game you have to queue up for.\" Additionally, the [Honor System article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751854-Honor-System-FAQ#h1q1) also specifies that honor is available in all matchmaking queues. As with FWotD, Honor is available after Co-op games. There's even a [Riot post from the Bilgewater event](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/OZeWNveN-gangplank-returns-and-the-event-end-draws-near?comment=000900000001000000010000) stating that Co-op counts as a matchmade queue.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the [Chat Restriction article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752984-Restricted-Chat-Mode#h1q6) directly says that Co-op games *aren't* matchmade games. That seems strangely contrary.\r\n\r\nAs such, is Co-op considered a \"matchmade queue\" and is thus supposed to drop key fragments? If yes, has anyone actually found a key fragment there? I've gotten 35 Co-op wins since the Crafting system was released and never gotten a fragment drop there. If no, could the appropriate articles be amended to state \"matchmade *PvP* queues\" to avoid future confusion?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-05T21:04:20.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see how it could be a little confusing.
