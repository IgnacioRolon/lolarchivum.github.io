He has a great kit for a corrupted knight - imagine huge corruption bursting out of the ground when he uses the Darkin blade, and his true fall when he uses World Ender and the corruption takes hold - which results in some of that empowered corruption staying behind after his true form relents and he gets some of himself back.\r\n\r\nHuge potential in new animations for his abilities here since he would be more knightly - so maybe less verticality to the Qs and more of a humanity-lost stance on his ult, instead of having his sword on his shoulder and just looking generally pissed off.\r\n\r\nI think there’s a ton of room for a purple+steel+blue color palette and more of a rounded or amorphous particle shape for a skin for him instead of everything being bright red and sharp like his base skin. Also he could use a skin with a more traditional sword that would change when he ults - I think that particular feature of a model swap on ultimate that lasts until death was one of the coolest things Leona gave us that still sticks around with High Noon Ashe.\r\n\r\nI would also say he would make a fine “old god” for the coven line, but I think he is very knightly to begin with and frankly base Aatrox could almost be an old god for how he looks.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:30:35.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone make concept art of this- it sounds epic as heck!
