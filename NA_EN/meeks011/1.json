It's more than being able to master a champion or \"make plays\" or get an early lead or have a successful teamfight. It involves being able to watch enemy movement patterns, predict where enemies are even if you can't see them, where they're going and why, when to spot and take advantage of opportunities, identifying who the most valuable asset and highest priority target on the team is and who and why the enemy will target first, etc.\n\nStrategy can help you take advantage of bad situations. I once went 0/6 as Wukong in a lane, so instead of trying to face the top-laner head on, I focused on keeping the lanes pushed and defended as the rest of my team dealt with the enemy and my fuckup. I smashed almost all of the turrets and inhibitors and ultimately won us the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrisisEchoes","date":"2017-08-17T17:09:59.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone could use strategy playing something like kogmaw as an auto turret and probably get to plat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fééd l0rd","date":"2017-08-17T17:06:18.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mechanical trashers always want more strategy","replies":[]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2017-08-17T12:59:10.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yet without skill you stay in bronze 5, you need both","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-08-17T13:37:28.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a skillless idiot and managed to get to gold the past 2 seasons.\n\nWhere is your god now?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-17T13:47:21.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is saying that both are important.
