It stacked multiplicatively, like tenacity. A lot of runes, masteries, and abilities used to grant dodge as well as a few items. \n\nDodge is a chance to reduce damage taken by a basic attack by 100% and critical strike chance is a chance to increase damage dealt by a basic attack by 100% (or 150% with Infinity Edge). So essentially the same thing, except that one is offensive and one is defensive. If someone with 50% critical strike chance was attacking someone with 50% dodge and crit on every attack that wasn't dodged then it's like they are hitting every basic attack but not criting. \n\nThe math gets a little more complicated than that but basically dodge countered crit. Nowadays the only counter to crit is a single mastery. \n\nSo I suggest crit be removed, dodge be readded, or some form of counter to crits be added.\n\nEdits: \nAbout on-hit effects - You'd probably get up to 25% dodge tops, is it really that bad? If it's something like Siphoning Strike then missing won't waste the ability, you land the on-hit effect on your next attack or two. If it's frozen mallet, Darius Bleed, etc. it lasts a few seconds so missing won't effect it much. \n\nCrits are satisfying - Why not just add dodge animations? If you're spamming dance near enemies then it's hard to keep it up, but dodging a lot of shit in a team fight would put your moves on.\n\nDodge > Crit - Not necessarily, it should be meant to be a tank stat. No damage mixed with dodge. And you're gonna be reaching like 25% dodge, while the ADCs are reaching 40%,55%, or 90% (fuck you Yasuo) crit chance. Also crit chance is so much more gold efficient than dodge. Dodge stacks multiplicatively and crit doesn't. There's an item that increases crit chance's gold efficiency by 50% and dodge wouldn't have that. Crit helps you CS and dodge doesn't. When dodge was a thing you could only get it from Phantom Dancer and Ninja Tabi. There are a hell of a lot more crit items than there were ever dodge items. Though dodge on Phantom Dancer wasn't really a good idea. Makes ADC 1v1s an even bigger RNG battle.\n\n\nEverything in this game has a counter except for crit chance! Just now I played Taric and had 500 armor but the enemy Lucian was able to deal 1000s of damage in seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-03-25T15:45:51.318+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":12,"body":"I'd say there is a pretty big difference.\n\nFirst, reduction is much more significant than addition. I mean, think about it: two champions with equal stats are dueling. One champion gets +50% damage, the other gets -50% damage received. Who wins?\n\nWell, the one with +50% damage receives 100% damage.\nThe one with -50% damage received receives 150%*50% = 75% damage.\nThe one with the damage reduction wins by a large margin.\n\nLikewise, dodge can be toxic while critical chance is perfectly fine.\nIf you're very low health and I know 1 attack will kill you, I'm probably going to go for that attack. E.g. I'm tristana and I'm going to jump under the turret and shoot my auto, then jump out. Now suddenly you have dodge, you dodge that one attack, I don't get my reset on kill, I'm stuck under your turret for 2 extra turret shots and I die instead. It removes way too much predictability from the game and completely wrecks any strategy that used resets and a lot of other engages (e.g. following a kill up with Zhonya's, or starting to run before the auto attack projectile makes contact for the kill). \n\nIn contrast, no champion jumps in *because they can get a kill only if they crit*. A critical attack may affect a trade or a duel, but there are two key points here: aside from the 1% crit chance in runes that some people run you typically have 20% or more critical strike chance meaning that crits are fairly reliable in extended duels. Second, if you were going to win a duel and an unlikely crit rampage changes that, you can still disengage. The idea here being, you might have won the 1v1 duel but there's no way you were certain the enemy didn't have a nearby ally to jump on you and turn the battle. Why complain that you lose due to them having built 55% critical chance but they crit on 70% of their attacks in the duel, when they could have had 0 crits and you'd still lose when their mid laner appeared. \n\nFinally, armor also counters crit. It's not like critical strikes apply armor shred or percent armor penetration. Your armor reduces damage on crits as well. There is nothing that can be built to make you dodge less.\n\nSummary point: The entire game is balanced WITH critical strikes and WITHOUT dodge. There is nothing wrong with Critical strikes, they're just another way of amplifying your DPS output - while armor and health reduce your Damage received. The only time critical strikes mean anything more than raw DPS output is in early game trades - where critical strikes rarely have an impact and you can always disengage so the result of an untimely crit shouldn't be an unwarranted kill. If 1 extra critical strike is enough to secure the kill, that's your punishment for playing unnecessarily riskily.","replies":[{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-03-25T16:27:06.767+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ValyrianBlade,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JE81QOo7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-25T15:45:51.318+0000)\n> Well, the one with +50% damage receives 100% damage.\n> The one with -50% damage received receives 150%*50% = 75% damage.\n> The one with the damage reduction wins by a large margin.\n\n{{champion:78}}: You called?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-03-25T17:52:32.101+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ValyrianBlade,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JE81QOo7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-25T15:45:51.318+0000)\n>\n\n> If you're very low health and I know 1 attack will kill you, I'm probably going to go for that attack.

Sound logic and I was very satisfied by your answer.  \n\nThat being said, I disagree with your statement that critical strikes are perfectly fine.  They are unfair, and they are the only aspect of RNG that has been allowed to exist in League, despite the call for tactical decisions to play a bigger factor than luck.  \n\nIf 2 adc's fight, and one has 30% crit chance and the other has 50%, that does not mean that the champion with 30% crit chance can't crit twice before the other champion crits once.  I acknowledge the fact that this is unlikely, but such a thing should not even be possible in a game that is being played professionally in this manner.  \n\nI would like to see critical strikes changed to a stack system.  It would be easy to implement and would turn crits into a predicable damage increase.  Make 10% crit chance becomes 10 stacks.  At 100 stacks, your next auto attack is a critical strike.  Roll over is allowed.  This means with 10% crit chance, you will crit every 10 attacks.  If you have 60 stacks, your second auto attack will crit, your third will not, fourth will, and your fifth will.  \n\nOf course, people say that over an infinite number of auto attacks, things will \"even out.\" This would remove that \"even out\" necessity while maintaining a more exact dps.  \n\nSo while I think crits are necessary in the game, I think they are not implemented well in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-03-25T18:47:27.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except that dodge items and masteries should be tanks only and tanks don't have damage. When the person with crit is dealing 350-1000 damage per hit you're dealing about 100. When dodge was a thing Phantom Dancer had it, this was a bad idea. Damage items with dodge would/were just boosting bruisers and shitting on tanks even more. Imagine an ADC with Jax's Counterstrike. They would win every 1v1. \n\nThat was off topic, but I did the math and a full build Yi would kill a tank with 4000 health and 300 armor in 6 seconds, not counting true damage or armor pen. Or anyone with maxed attack speed and 1000 damage crits. The slight differences would only give you a couple more seconds to live. Whenever I'm killed in three seconds as Malphite I ask how and almost everyone says crits is responsible. Though every ADC building Last Whisper doesn't help either. The counters to crits have so many fucking counters themselves. Also as a tank 1v1ing an ADC they have lifesteal regenerating hundreds of health per second and you got health regen regenerating hundreds of health per minute.\n\nAlso, dodge only works vs half or less than the enemy team (ADC and most likely jungler and top).

Because if it didn't then tanks and certain bruisers would be unbreakable juggernauts for ADCs... which is a problem, because ADCs are meant to shred tanks and squishies alike late-game. Armor shred/reduction is by no means a mechanic unique to this game, and it can be balanced. However, a lack of dodge does not instantly necessitate the removal of crit, either. \n\nImplementing dodge, even at a hard cap (the proposed 20%), does not mean it would be balanced. Crit, however, is balanced because there are counters to crit. You can't reduce the severity of a dodge like you can with a crit. There's no glancing blow damage in case your attack is dodged; it straight up did nothing. However, armor can greatly reduce the effect of a crit, and attack speed slows reduce the frequency of crits, and in addition we come to Thornmail, again, which inflicts a large portion of the crit back onto the attacker at a rate that didn't even meet reductions. So if he would have crit for you 1000 before reductions, and you're walking around with 200 armor, before reductions, he took 300 back and did about 400-500 to you with Last Whisper, and healed back about 80-100 of that 300 damage he just took. That is an enormous reduction in the effectiveness of crit and auto-attacks as a whole. And it doesn't take a tank to do that.\n\nWith dodge, not only was your crit invalidated, but your whole auto-attack was.

Because crit is a multiplicative of AD and ASP.\n\nAnd it is still countered exactly the same as regular AD.\n\nDodge has no counter. You can hit more.

It's fun for the person who Does dodge, and not fun for the person who get's dodged. \n\nThe red post someone pasted here said that the beneficiary of the dodge stat doesn't feel like it's doing anything for them. I'm sorry that is blatantly wrong. \n\nWhen dodge did exist most ADCs (And personally, I did this on all my roles) would take .5% dodge rune just in case you get a proc. People do the same thing with crit. If I was laneing against an enemy ADC and they reach in for poke I return the shot. if I dodged their attack, I'm going to all in them immediately. \n\nI for one think that the issue with dodge is that so many people (and probably riot devs) are split on the decision. If they really want to eliminate RNG they HAVE to get rid of Crit. But most people don't want that and if they did they would need to fully re-work many champions. \nSo if you take the RNG element out of the argument then there is no reason to remove dodge.  I think they should put dodge back on Tabi, give maybe 5 or 10% to the Ghost summoner spell (Or a new spell that says you dodge the next 3 attacks) and give small amounts of dodge on items which have 0 offensive stats. \n\nSome people mentioned that it was dumb that dodge would mitigate 100% of the damage. I don't belive that this is really a problem but we can leave it up to Riot's balance team to determine if maybe \"dodge\" should actually be \"parry\" and you can get \"glancing blows\" so it's a %chance to take 50% reduced damage on the hit. \n\nI think this was purposed and someone replied \"That's what armor is for\".

I'll just die in 5 seconds instead of 0.5 of one.\n\n4 anti armor items ? i guess you mean brutalizer upgrades. which are all flat penetration between 10 and 20, not really important against heavy armored tanks, + the little extra damage reduce from black cleaver passive.\nThen you see FH is +100 armor, Thornmail is +100 armor, randuin is +70 armor, IBG is +60 armor, and that just 4 out of the lot. Now, i'm not sure if i understand correctly, you say you only live 5 sec when you have 75% damage reduce against 1k damage. alright lets pretend the guy is landing 100% critical hit chance (normal builds will have around 50% chance) thats 250 damage per hit, if that adc, on top of his 100% critical chance has 2 AS that mean he has done 2.5k damage after that time. thats not a lot of hp for a tank. So while i'm not entirely sure an ADC with 6 items (no defensive items) can get that much damage output, you clearly dont have the hp of a tank, and get rekt by late game 6 items adc, and thats without counting AS slow from randuin and FH, reflected damage from thornmail, and i assume you not exactly just standing still has a tank.\n\nMaybe you have trouble with your tank itemization?","replies":[{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-03-26T16:27:21.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last Whisper, ever heard of it?

That's just bad game balance itself.\n\nThen look at the number you gave us.  39% armor penetration (which is LW + masteries) means 300 armor goes down to about 183 armor, not 137, and thats still 65% damage reduction. As for marksmen, they dont usually build the other armor penetration items, as for assassins/fighters they will reduce your armor by an addition 10 or 20 armor. a bit more reduction if they go cleaver, but they need to be hitting you for a long time, and if they get full penetration items, you still have HP to tank and Tank usually have CCs and base damage to fight back. That's why you dont usually see assassins fighting tanks (of course if there isnt a huge difference in levels and gold).\n\nThere is literally 14 champions out of 124 that deal true damage (if i dont count the 1 true damage from some abilities like trundle pillar). 2 of them need to die to have access to it, 1 can only use it against minions and monsters. \n\nChampions who deal true damage with standard attacks\nCorki's Hextech Shrapnel Shells [P]\n Irelia's Hiten Style [W] (active only)\nTwitch's Deadly Venom [P] (applies true damage over time)\nVayne's Silver Bolts [W] (upon 3rd consecutive hit on a single target)\nMaster Yi's Wuju Style [E] (on autoattacks, but for duration of ability only)\n\nChampions who deal true damage with abilities\nAhri's Orb of Deception [Q] (upon retraction)\nCho'Gath's Feast [R]\nDarius's Noxian Guillotine [R]\nKog'Maw's Icathian Surprise [P] (available once after dying)\nNunu's Consume [Q] (only to minions, neutral monsters, and pets.)\nOlaf's Reckless [E] Swing\nRek'Sai's Furious Bite [E] (100 Fury)\nVel'Koz's Organic Deconstruction [P] (upon 3rd consecutive abilities on a single target)\nZyra's Rise of the Thorns [P] (available once after dying)\nNot exactly as many champion as you implied.\n\nBlade of the ruined king is a necessary for the same reason i described earlier, and because something like a mundo with thornmail and 5 warmogs isnt really what you expect from a balance perspective. There is 2 high armor attack speed slow that work well against the item, and champions that use that item in general. Also, ruined king is only become good when you face champion with a lot more hp then armor, its still physical damage.\n\nNot sure where you get that lifesteal counter thornmail, but if we compare it to bloodthirster,  30% damage reflection **before **considering any reduction from armor and other sources, is stronger then 20% hp drain **after** reduction from armor and other sources.\n\nOverall, Champion who build damage should have a way to deal damage, since they are squishy. Tank can definatly still fight them and turret dive them, due to their hp and defenses, and usually CCs, but overall they work best when teamfighting. Thats the whole point of tanks. You are soaking the damage for your carries, so they can deal theirs. It's not about diving 1v5 for a pentakill, because you are unkillable, that would be poor balance. That's why penetration is a necessary stats. Remember that ADCs need time and gold to get to a high damage output point, while most tank item are fairly cheap in comparaison.","replies":[{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-03-27T10:17:04.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"25% armor reduction before penetration. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Risurin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JE81QOo7,comment-id=00130001000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-26T17:41:16.547+0000)\n\n> Champions who deal true damage with standard attacks\n> Corki's Hextech Shrapnel Shells [P]\n>  Irelia's Hiten Style [W] (active only)\n> Twitch's Deadly Venom [P] (applies true damage over time)\n> Vayne's Silver Bolts [W] (upon 3rd consecutive hit on a single target)\n> Master Yi's Wuju Style [E] (on autoattacks, but for duration of ability only)\n> \n> Champions who deal true damage with abilities\n> Ahri's Orb of Deception [Q] (upon retraction)\n> Cho'Gath's Feast [R]\n> Darius's Noxian Guillotine [R]\n> Kog'Maw's Icathian Surprise [P] (available once after dying)\n> Nunu's Consume [Q] (only to minions, neutral monsters, and pets.)\n> Olaf's Reckless [E] Swing\n> Rek'Sai's Furious Bite [E] (100 Fury)\n> Vel'Koz's Organic Deconstruction [P] (upon 3rd consecutive abilities on a single target)\n> Zyra's Rise of the Thorns [P] (available once after dying)\n> Not exactly as many champion as you implied.\n\nFuck, I still count it as correct cause ignite and smite and shit. \nCheckmate, atheists.\n\nYou lifesteal the same amount no matter how much damage you deal. Why do you think you get a bunch of health for killing wards? \n\nAnd tanks have the lowest number of kills out of all champions. They're not meant for damage. \"Malphite Q 220 damage OP, omg 280 damage E one-shot our team, ult too OP half my health omg\" Unless you have at least two AP items you're not dealing shit for damage. And you rely almost entirely on spells cause 70 damage every 1.5 seconds from basic attacks ain't gonna cut it. I think you're talking about bruisers. \n\n'Most tank items are pretty cheap in comparison.' Yeah, cause they get no kills. Every champ in the game heavily outdamages tanks unless you're stupid enough to focus the Rammus as an ADC or build no penetration items.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
