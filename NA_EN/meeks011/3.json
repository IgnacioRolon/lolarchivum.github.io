Something that could encourage more supports and balance the system more is if supports got a small IP/EXP increase with the games you play them in. Currently it seems you get less of both from playing support and this might be one of the reasons they're underplayed. The increase could be like 1.25x or something like that, that would be just good enough to make a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2014-08-15T03:32:57.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think the problem lies half with the balance and half with the community. A big part of the community wants to carry/be a nig guy, and support is the only role that doesn't really convey that feeling (in most cases).\n\nPersonally, I believe that out of the current standard roster of supports, all of them are either pretty bad (Taric/Zilean/Janna), really not enjoyable to play (Soraka/Nami) or eveyone is burnt out of seeing them (Thresh/Leona/Braum). People are so despaired about the current roster that I've had a roughly 15-20s queue time average on support shaco for like 10 games. I'm seeing more Gangplank/Shaco/Poppy/Brand/Veigar/Volibear than I'm seeing Lux/Galio/Zilean/Janna/Soraka/Sona. It seems that right now, the standard definition of support is \"can kill the enemy ADC and/or proc spellthief/targon efficiently\".\n\n However, that's not 100% on Riot's fault. I think that the main gripe with support is \"giving kills\". Personally, as a Poppy/Veigar support main, every single kill       that's within my reach, I will take. And I personally feel that on every single supports, taking a few kills is better than a 8/0/0 ADC. Since the kill-assist gold is usually about 150gold (225g if you're 3 guys taking the kill), I believe that letting it to the lowest income character will influence the lane much harder than leaving it to the cash-stacking one.\n\nIf people were less mindful about supports being ideally 0/0/77, I believe that there would be more support players. And for people finding it farfetched, it's a pretty common thing in DotA to try to get those early kills on your support, so there may be a reasoning behind it (although the reasoning is exacerbated in DotA's case because of the nature of the game).","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-14T20:04:02.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said bacon, but what I really meant was they need to find a non-gameplay related way to boost the role.  I think they wouldn't give any actual benefit to only support players that wasn't purely aesthetic like the ribbons.  If they can do something more to the actual gameplay of the support to make it more interesting(but not more powerful), that might help.  One of the major things with team builder is joining random people and hoping you can synergize with them well.  As a support it's infinitely more important, so most people probably only do it with friends.\n\nEdit: which makes me realize team builder really should accept duos, or possible merging of teams.  If a guy searches with a friend planning to duo bot, and another guy searches with a friend planning to top and jungle, it'd be awesome if you could just combine the teams.","replies":[{"poster":"Kexus","date":"2014-08-14T22:14:37.505+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see duo queues allowed in teambuilder.
