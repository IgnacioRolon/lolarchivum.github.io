However, nobody with a high winrate on Morde actually builds him this way, because the &quot;scaling&quot; on his kitten sweater is a joke. In fact, a key item on Morde in higher-elo play, Luden&#039;s Echo, isn&#039;t even in the Recommended Items. \r\n\r\n* Hextech Gunblade&#039;s healing is worth more than Morde&#039;s blanket because the worth of the health gained actually scales with resistances.\r\n\r\n* [His wet paper towel](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Mordekaiser/Abilities) starts decaying after **1.5 seconds**, because if Morde could fill up his shield before combat, then it might have actually been useful. \r\n\r\n* Morde has a [placement of 46/48](http://champion.gg/champion/Mordekaiser/Top?league=) on champion.gg, out of all top laners. The only reason why his winrate is positive is because the only people who play him regularly have no will to live and snort cocaine before every game. \r\n\r\n* Morde still doesn&#039;t have a spotlight because they couldn&#039;t get any footage of Phreak winning games on him. He didn&#039;t have the time to get 50+ games on Morde to make his winrate positive.\r\n\r\n* Let me reiterate something. Morde has **no mobility**, **no CC**, and he&#039;s **melee**. When Rylai&#039;s and/or Flash are necessary to be useful, you know a champion is bad. At the very least he could have the survivability to actually make it to someone and deal damage. \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s a scenario. Say late game you&#039;re tank Morde, because you felt like you weren&#039;t useless enough as it is, and have 4000 health. The fuzzy wuzzy bar is &quot;worth&quot; 1000 health. Say that, as a tank, you somehow are able to deal 4000 damage to champions (you gain 25% of the damage as pity from your enemies) throughout a fight without taking any damage. Now you have a full &quot;shield&quot;, solid and unbreakable enough to stand 1 autoattack from the enemy carry (I&#039;ve seen attacks over 1000 damage {{champion:119}} even when armor was applying). \r\n\r\nAre Morde buffs too much to ask for?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-09-01T01:17:05.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It uses resistances.
