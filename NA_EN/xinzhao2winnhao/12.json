You can be a better person, and I just hope that you would realize that. nobody is naturally evil, and we were all born good people. I know that sometimes LoL can be frustrating but it's no reason to make someone's day even worse by being toxic to them.\n\nI reported you not because I want revenge, but I want you to know that your behavior is not acceptable, and that it's up to you to change your behavior. Riot can do everything they want to stop toxicity but if the community doesn't want to change the community will stay toxic. Only you can make this game a better place.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-14T03:49:16.706+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sadly your average toxic player is young and/or highly immature and arrogant, and has _no idea_ that they are the problem.

This is why Riot bans people who continuously breaks the rules. Hopefully then will they learn, but in most cases (as ive seen) they will continue to blames others. Then it leaks into the real world, and we get what we are seeing now in how people are acting.","replies":[{"poster":"XinZhao2WinNhao","date":"2016-11-14T06:03:38.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sarutobi,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pwe76e7K,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-11-14T05:40:10.860+0000)\n>\n> They will always blame someone else.

But the problem with banning is that there will always be a new wave of toxic people after the first wave get banned.\n\nThe only way to actually stop toxicity is if the community works together to discourage this behavior, and toxic people learn that their toxicity isn't helping, and other bystanders stop encouraging toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Kartagia","date":"2016-11-14T11:52:19.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, chat ban is not good idea.
