He will rage nonstop if people tell him that he's not good enough. Selfish and wants to be the star of the show and will push others aside to do it. He's also really really really fucking loud. Also easily irritable and always believes he's right.\n\nTraits: he doesn't speak any understandable language and communicated only through grunts, mumbling and cursing. Unable to understand complex plans.\n\nHe also can't tie his shoelaces, so himself and people within 3 feet of him have to make a dex save before moving to make sure they don't trip.\n\nhttp://sk2.op.gg/images/medals/challenger_1.png","replies":[]}
