Literally haven't seen someone pick Kayle since the last patch.

There are currently 7 tier 5 champs, so the chance of getting a Kayle is 0.29%.  Even with 30 rolls, you had ~1/3 chance of finding a Kayle.\n\nIf you're looking for a tier 5 champs, you have to be at least level 8 and be willing to spend a lot of gold.  Even at level 8, a 5% chance, you'd still have 2/3 chance of even finding a single Kayle after 30 rerolls (60 gold).  Rolling at level 7 is fine if you're looking for tier 4, but not tier 5.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thilmer","date":"2019-09-14T14:09:01.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difficulty to get Kayle causes the 6 noble composition to be basically imposible to put into play.","replies":[]}]}
