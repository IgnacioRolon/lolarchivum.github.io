I KNOW I BELONG IN BRONZE, IM TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE IN GENERAL\n\nIt takes a pretty long time to climb if you gain 20 LP per win and lose 20 per loss.\n\nIt's because if you are \"stuck in elo hell\" but better than most of the other players in the tier, you probably aren't really really good (if you are, let's say a 70% winrate, you would have carried yourself out of there already). Players who are stuck in elo hell who are slightly better than the players in their tier don't have 70% winrates. They have probably a 55% winrate if all goes well. So, let's say you're better than bronze but you're in bronze. You have a 55% winrate in bronze (or whatever tier you are in) on average, so you are slightly better than bronze (or whatever tier you're in)\n\nSo, if you gain 20 LP per win and lose 20 per loss, then after 100 games, you'd have 55 wins and 45 losses (on average). That's 200 LP you gain, so you gain approximately 2 divisions. That means it takes 250 ranked games to take you from Bronze 5 to Silver 5 (or silver 5 to gold 5 or plat 5 to diamond 5, etc). If each game is about 30 minutes long, thats 125 hours of playing. (and most games are more than 30 mins) If you play 2 hours per day, that's 60 days. You probably don't play every day of the week either. So let's say you play from monday to wednesday for 1 hours per day and saturday and sunday for 2 hour per day. You have an after school sport on thursday and fri so you cannot play LoL. So, you play 7 hours per week, it takes more than 15 weeks (almost 4 months) to gain 1 full tier.\n\nAnd if you wanna go up a 2nd tier, this time your winrate might be only 52% and you may only gain/lose 10 LP per game. So per 100 games you will win 52 and lose 48, netting 40 LP/100 games. That means that you will need 1250 games to go up a 2nd tier. That's more than a normal person will play in a year.\n\nOf course, there is about a 40% chance that you fail a promo if you have a normally 55% winrate. So you may have to start over a few more times too.\n\nAnd if you don't get your main role your 55% winrate may go down to 40% or something like that.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, if your winrate is over 50%, you will climb. Question is... how fast?","replies":[]}
