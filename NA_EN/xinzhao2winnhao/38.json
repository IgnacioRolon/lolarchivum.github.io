I've even had a friend who was silver IV last season who really belonged in bronze IV, trust me, I've been in lower bronze, his mechanics and mentality was that of a lower bronze and yet he was placed in silver because he got lucky in his placements, then he never played ranked because he would lose. That's not even me hating on him or anything, plenty of our mutual friends agreed that he didn't belong in Silver.
