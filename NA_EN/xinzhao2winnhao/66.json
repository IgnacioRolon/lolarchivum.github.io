I do not take such players&#039; opinions on game balance or their proclamations of skill seriously.\r\n\r\nI seriously don&#039;t like playing with people who don&#039;t earn their own keep and I wish there was an option for &quot;I don&#039;t want to play with duos&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis crest looks so much brighter when it is earned, not given for free\r\nhttp://sk2.op.gg/images/medals/challenger_1.png","replies":[]}
