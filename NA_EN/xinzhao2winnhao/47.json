Panth and talon's kit and lore cover why they wear a hood/mask so it makes sense that they do, and hooded/masked champs are cool too, but it would be nice if we had a new male champ that doesn't cover their face.\n\nWe really should have more good looking male champs. There are gamers of different sexual orientations, there are female gamers and there are gamers who like playing a good-looking character regardless of the gender or attraction.\n\nPS these are the champs I consider 10/10\n{{champion:91}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:55}} ","replies":[]}
