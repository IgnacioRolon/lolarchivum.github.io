(That&#039;s a rhetorical question. We all know they do that because they&#039;re compensating for something.)\n\nBut seriously, fuck those smurfs. You&#039;re ruining games for 9 people. Even your own team will be fucking frustrated because you&#039;re just making the game a 1v5 and they dont get a chance to do anything. If you were a high school basketball player, you might want to play 1 or 2 learning games with Michael Jordan, but it&#039;s not gonna be fun playing with Michael Jordan in a competition game (like ranked) where it&#039;s 1 person doing everything and you&#039;re pretty much benched.\n\nSmurfs are pretty much benching 4 other players on the team and thats why nobody likes it. Not the enemies of course because they get stomped. But not the smurfs team themselves.\n\n**DO NOT SUPPORT STREAMERS WHO POST VIDEOS OF THEMSELVES SMURFING AND PUBSTOMPING LOWER ELO, THEY ARE RUINING THE GAME FOR 9 PEOPLE EVERY TIME THEY DO THAT AND PROBABLY BREAKING THE SUMMONERS CODE TOO**","replies":[]}
