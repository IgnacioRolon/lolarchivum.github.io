I am having fun in bronze. The games are really chill if you get paired with non-kids. If you play later at night when there are  more mature people playing, they don't care if you build nonmeta or anything because they want to have fun too. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DONT TRY TO WIN. IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T THINK THE META IS THE ONLY ONE WAY TO WIN!!!! If you do get the raging kids, I guess that's kinda sad, but at least their rage is funny sometimes. I mean, who else says \"OMG NOOB TEAM DOESNT TOWER DIVE AT 100HP WITH ME SO I DIED!\"\n\nIf you get a more mature and reasonable team that's chill, they don't really care much about winning, just having fun. And that's what I want to do anyways.\n\nI also think that bronze games there's more dynamic action going on besides just farming, and that contributes to the fun.\n\nI also know my CS is bad. And I don't need you guys to tell me why I'm in bronze and how I can learn to CS better/climb. If I wanted to, I'd go to this handy little website (maybe some of you haven't heard of it, I think it's quite obscure) called Google and search for LoL guides on CSing better. Some of you suggest doing a custom game to learn CSing. That works really well, but the thing is, LoL is a hobby to me and not a main focus of my learning life. To me, it is just a game I find very fun, but I am not as dedicated as many higher tiered players because I prefer to play it as a game just for fun. I don't want to learn how to make LC$ Big Plays, I just wanna have fun regardless of tier. CSing in custom games is pretty boring and not in my definition of fun.\n\nalso, keep in mind that nobody has 160 CS by 20 minutes except in theory. In real games, people have to deny their laning opponent, harass, gank other lanes, back and buy items, trade damage, kill, die, fight, dive, gank more lanes, maybe chat a bit etc. 160 CS by 20 minutes is if you just stand there and farm and do nothing else.\n\nI know I belong in bronze. I also don't need you to tell me how my opinion on something like \"Who's the hottest champion\" or \"which league of legends champions have the coolest skins\" is invalid just because I'm in bronze. Also, if you type \"lol bronzie\" every time someone in bronze tier makes a comment, you just sound like a no-lifer, because everyone else understands that there are people who don't devote a lot of time to improve in LoL and get diamond, even most people who spend most of their time bettering their League plays still understand that not everyone is like them and will respect the differences.\n\nTL;DR: Not everyone is willing to put in the work to become diamond. A lot of us bronzies just play LoL as a game: for fun. We still try to win ranked games, but we don't want to be tied down to a single meta. We like to build in different ways and not the same build every day. We don't need you guys to comment on how bad we're playing.","replies":[]}
