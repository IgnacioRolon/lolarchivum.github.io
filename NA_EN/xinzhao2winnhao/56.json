Also, in silver you don&#039;t decay, so you could have won 2 out of 10 placement matches (which is apparently how much you need to get into silver Season 5), you needed 5 placement wins last year to get silver, and not played to stay silver\n\nIf they played more rankeds, I think that many of those silvers will drop into bronze just like the rest of us","replies":[]}
