Compare Riven and Fiora to actually high skillcap champions like Lee Sin (if you miss his Q you're probably useless for 15 seconds), Cassiopeia (everything about her is high skillcap) and other champions where almost every ability is a skillshot and you'll see the difference in skillcap.","replies":[]}
