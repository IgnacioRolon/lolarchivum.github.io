Sometimes, when I'm in a fight I just stand there and I can't move or do spells, but I can see the green arrows when I click to move but my champ just doesn't move, sometimes I can stand there for 5 seconds up to 30 seconds, which is a long time when you're in lane. I know some people have already had this problem, but that was 4-5 years ago, and some of the ones I had seen had no solution. I was wondering if anyone is having the same problem? I also posted this here because I can't make a support ticket, because it keeps saying I need to log in, even though I am as you can see. I have died a lot to this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"pachiporomari","date":"2017-11-29T23:42:52.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some additional steps we can take to help troubleshoot this issue.\n\nTo me, it sounds like it could still be a connection issue, even with that 99/100 on the lag report.
