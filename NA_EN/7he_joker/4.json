This season has been going poorly with many close games and my win rate is 40%. My KDA's are good yet i keep loosing, im trying to communicate with my team and not raging. I guess what im saying is my win rate of 40% is lowering my confidence. Should i just play and not worry about what other people think of my skill depending on my win rate. I dont think im an amazing player but im also not a bad one; ik i can make it to gold again but this is bugging me","replies":[]}
