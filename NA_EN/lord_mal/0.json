I closed the game to try to enter again and the launche  told me  \"unable to connect to authentication service\" as 6 times. By the time I got in, the game was over and they probably reported me having disconnected.\r\n\r\nI must clarify that I did not lose my internet connection, since I did speed tests, I opened different pages to check that, I still had the service and eliminate a possible error on my part. Please, I need help I donÂ´t wanna be banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-25T15:40:06.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks, sorry it happened to ya.  :(  You might not have lost your internet connection overall, but you can still have trouble reaching specific services.  For your specific issue, it seems like your connection is struggling to reach the game server and ending up as a disconnect.  You should run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot that, but be sure to test it in a custom game for now.","replies":[]}]}
