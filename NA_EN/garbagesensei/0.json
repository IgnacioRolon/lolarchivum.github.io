This started happening when I went to my cousin's house a week ago. I didn't even use my computer that much other than going on crunchyroll or using youtube. I started having a problem where my computer wouldn't show any available network but that stopped once i got back to my house. I have uninstalled and re-downloaded league. At first it was giving me the same error message when i tried re downloading it but i restarted my computer and waited a couple days able to reinstall. I still get the message when i try to open it though.  Everything else on my computer works fine so i don't think i got a virus. I have been playing league since {{champion:157}} came out and i would be so heart broken if i can't play anymore. Please help :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T17:03:31.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patcher Kernel errors are most often caused by League not being assigned the right administrative privileges to run. Since League interacts with a lot of files that reside outside the League directory, it needs special rights.
