In fact the one i was in 5 minutes - 30 minutes previous had no error. This one however decided to bugsplat and tell me to check my internet connection ..... which i cant do as i am a college student. I tried to reconnect 10+ times and it wouldn't let me and i get pre-que timers. Is there any way i can get these removed?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T22:17:05.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Bugsplats will occur if a driver, hardware, or game asset failed to render the game.  Your connection could be an additional issue, but I'm confident fixing the bugsplat will set you back on track.  Run through the steps in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot, but be sure to do it in a custom game.

That's like implementing a system to ban players without having a way to correct false positives. I'm sure you have ways to remove leaver busters. Being a college student i don't have the time to go through these. To be honest this lowers the faith i have in riot if they can't even fix an error their system made.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodshed12","date":"2017-09-09T00:04:35.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest if this is how the staff at riot treats people who get punished by an automated system for something out of their control i'm incredibly disappointed","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T14:59:06.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The system is going to treat all leaves equally, regardless of intent, because all leaves still causes others a negative experience.

Instead of getting any help with my issue you are basically telling me to fuck off like you don't even care. I feel like i'm just another money grab to people at riot. You obviously have no want to keep the player happy or you would have proposed some sort of compromise. Literally you could have said anything. For instance, \"Sorry about that there is nothing we at Riot can do but as you as a player mean a lot to us we would like to resolve the issue by giving you a free mystery champion shard\". Something as small as that and i would feel like at least yall care, but you instead basically just told me to fuck off.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-09T20:17:12.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's not bad customer support just because they tell you the policy.\n\nIt's like if you get kicked off a plane for trying to sit in first class when you bought an economy ticket - it's not bad customer service.\n\nThey won't give you rewards for continually leaving games. You don't get a LeaverBuster penalty for one leave. You either have a history of having to leave unintentionally or intentionally, in which case you need to either stop leaving or fix your problems that force you to leave games.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodshed12","date":"2017-09-10T00:19:57.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is no problem on my end.\nIt is literally a game bug and the fact that you come post where you are unwelcome is entirely rude and uncalled for. Don't insert yourself in other people's business. Learn to have some class and respect.\n\n In the end i'm more mad that he obviously didn't read that the problem didn't occur 10 minutes earlier and nothing had changed on my end. Which in the end means it's a compatibility issue with their server that they are punishing me for. In the end though he failed to take the time to read the initial post which was clear when he gave me trouble shooting advice, instead of apologizing for the issue and looking into it. In the end his initial post was a copy pasted trouble shoot your pc reply which just about anyone could have given me. In other words he gave me a default response to shrug me off.\n\nWhich in the end is bad customer service.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-10T00:30:50.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Learn to have some class and respect when you're asking for exceptions to policy.\n\nYou came to a public forum to post - it is my right to post here. If you wanted a private discussion, shoulda gone to support tickets.\n\nJust because nothing changed with *your computer* does not mean it's Riot's fault. Your ISP, your router, your power, or your computer could've been the issue and you may not have caused it but that doesn't mean Riot did.\n\nBugsplats happen - however, if they are happening frequently then it **usually** is an issue with your computer. You don't get LeaverBuster penalties for one game, so that means either this is happening frequently or you've intentionally left games before.\n\nPlus, you still ruined the game by AFKing for other people. It's just like crimes - you may not have intentionally shot the gun at that person but you still caused pain/suffering thus you still get punished for it. Involuntary does not mean you didn't waste others' time.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodshed12","date":"2017-09-10T00:50:12.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Get the hell out of here you are literally just a white knight on the internet. Literally you are defending bad business practices. Legitimately i wouldn't care if i had to go through the stupid fucking timers that instead of making people not leave just make people want to not play. But the fact that he gave me some bullshit fix your computer answer literally is the same as shoving people to the curb because you are in a hurry. It also shows no problem solving skills. You are literally on the support forum for people to get help from riot you aren't welcome in a post that is for that reason. Literally all you posting here does is make matters worse. You are legit trying to make me seem like an asshole when i am unhappy that he couldn't do any more than tell me to fix my computer which was working until 5 minutes after a successful game. Then instead of trying to work with me or calm me down he basically just said tough luck you are pretty much fucked. He couldn't offer any solution that as a player would make me happy. Oh and the funniest thing is Leaver busters is a system that attempts to correct peoples behavior, but why would i want to wait 20 minutes for a game when i could play something else. \n\nOr here's another idea go play Heroes of the Storm, Where when i had an issue all they wanted to do was make me happy because guess what they had an error in their game that punished me for something out of my control. Guess what they were better than RIOT in customer support as well. They apologized fixed the issue and compensated me for the bad experience caused by the issue by giving me a free hero.\n\nSo in a game that is the same class, More fun, and with better customer support, What is Riot doing to help me out and make me feel happy as a player. Telling me to fuck off and fix my computer or what? I'll tell you they aren't doing shit. While i admit they can't foresee every problem they could at least apologize for the issue being there and tell me they are investigating.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-10T00:58:50.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's literally a public forum, not just for rioter response.\n\nUnless you can prove that it was an error on Riot's side and not a corrupted client, you are being an ass for assuming it is. Run the hextech repair, if that doesn't work, reinstall client completely, if that doesn't work **then** you have a case that it might be a Riot issue.\n\nLike I said, you do not get LB for **ONE** game.
