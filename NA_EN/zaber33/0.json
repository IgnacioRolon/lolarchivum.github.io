The login screen says to check the email sent to the address associated with the account for more information, however I haven't received one yet. Is it common for emails to not go through right away? I would like to know what happened with the account, and why it was suddenly banned, with no other past behavior warnings or punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T01:02:18.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may not be getting those ban emails due to the type of suspension that was placed. It actually looks like this was placed due to some rather suspicious activity. so go ahead and shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the option \"I need help recovering my account\".
