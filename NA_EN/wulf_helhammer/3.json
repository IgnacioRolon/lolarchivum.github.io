They have even less effect on gameplay than a skin would, so I don’t see a large need to make them obtainable via BE (except maybe during an Emporium). However, I do believe that the Beta pass reward of getting one of 3 premium Little Legends should be added as a new/returning player mission, so that people that just straight up weren’t playing the game still have the chance for one of those.\n\n-_-\n\nI am a person that has spent *a lot* of money on Hextech craftables, to such an extent that I have every obtainable skin. You could I guess classify me as a “whale” (although I really don’t like using terms like that in general when we’re talking about people).\n\nThat being said, I do not like how Little Legends are obtained. At all.\n\nSo far in its history, League has had the track record of “if you want something, you can buy it directly”, and with the exception of a few specially intended exclusive skins, they’ve kept that record.\n\nLittle Legends change all that.\n\nSure, you can buy the base form directly for all them, but that’s it. No way to purchase levels, no way to purchase variants. All those are locked behind loot boxes.\n\nWhich brings me finally to my main points: Riot, if you are going to keep releasing new sets of Little Legends, as these new releases seem to suggest, then one of those things needs to change about how we buy them. Either we need to be able to directly level up the forms, be that through purchases or play time, and different variants are behind loot boxes — Or we need to be able to directly buy the base form of all variants, but level ups are still randomized.\n\n-_-\n\nI know the nature of Teamfight Tactics is RNG.... but let’s try to keep that to the gameplay of the mode, and maybe ease off it a bit for the monetary part.","replies":[{"poster":"MegaHuff","date":"2019-08-02T22:56:15.469+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"As much as I agree, don't get your hopes up.\n\nPrediction: \"OH QQ DONT COMPLAIN BOUT THEM LIL LAGINDS BECAUSE THEY FREE IS NO P2P STOP CRYING ENTITLED MILLENIAL\"\n\nSeen too much of the above on other similar posts.

I just find it unfortunate that it seems to be difficult to understand for a decent percentage of people on the forums. I made a reply to a different post about this exact thing, back when it first was a hot issue.\n\nIt just baffles me when any criticism toward something is seen as people \"whining\" or being \"entitled\" or some other strawman.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xhaiden","date":"2019-08-03T12:20:25.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The marketing team doesn't check the forum, or at least - they never showed any interest in what the community had/has to say about their money making schemes (as they proved through almost every past action). Gambling schemes prey on human weakness - and that's exactly what Riot exploits the most. Even more than that - they're trying to speed-up the gambling process with the current scheme (Little Legends) - by trading quality for quantity. As in... champion skins are far more complex (well, some of them are - mainly Epic and above... cause the majority are more like a suit placed on top of the old model - since they kept the same abilities as the original, same interactions, same taunts, same dances and same voices/audio). Obviously, same can't be said about Little Legends. They don't do much (they have their dance moves and taunts - but other than that - they drag a champion and open a box / there's not much interaction with the actual  game). Even the difference between tiers revolve around cosmetics alone.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsS5o5hM06M\n\nMy point is: they're far easier to put together - compared to a champion skin. And since they're part of a permanent gambling scheme.. everyone who's affected by a gambling addiction - should be really careful with this ones (easier said than done - unfortunately). This is the part that i find worrying about \"the new business model...\" since it's quite predatory - when it comes to people with gambling addictions. Personally, i find it immoral.\n\nI presume you were referring to this new releases...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5nA4xayraI\n(at this rate Little Legends could triple by the end of the year - if not more).\n\nThis is what TFT is all about. Why it became permanent in such a short time. And since TFT covers the space - where the temporary modes used to be (like URF or BN), i take it - this may also be the reason why they intend to recycle TT (to use that space for temporary modes). Anyway, this is a different subject - for a different topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2019-08-03T21:17:11.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> more recently with the Prestige skins - where the community was completely ignored and nothing was changed\n\nDidn't they used to have it where you can only get prestige points from buying chests?

Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm legit interested, since League allows you to buy the specific skin for a champion or ward, as well as specific emotes, so I I'd like to learn what appeal you find on the Lootboxes themselves.
