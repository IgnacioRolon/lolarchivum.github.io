I have seen some REALLY thought out and insightful posts about balance and change for the game that got completely ignored. That should be enough to tell you that do not care about their playerbase input. If that isnt enough then how about the one response veigars players finally got which was essentially \"we are not changing the changes we made to him and we will decide if they are good or not later\", pretty much a huge slap in the face consider he was suppose to get compensation.

I go around and see some of the most confusing posts ever, such as Veigar's E got nerfed rather than the fact that he can now deal damage to 2 targets with his Q now, giving him more ability to gain AP which is what he's about. Though I cannot agree with everything the balance team brings, such as too many skill shots and too many nerfs.\n\nI don't really understand nerfs, to be honest. When a champion is played a lot, we ask for something to be done to help make it so that other champions don't feel to weak. After about a month, we finally see a nerf to that champion when another seems to be stronger by that time. It's not fun playing as some champions anymore.\n\nSince Soraka lost her mana regen on her E, she's not as fun. Since champions like Rek'Sai came out, all I can say is I'm tired of Riot's nerfs. Tryndamere has 100% AP on his E. Gnar has 100% AP on his W. Why can't a mana champion have 100% AP? I can think of a few that could use it. Brand could use 100% AP on his Q skill shot. Cassiopeia could use more damage. Braum deals a lot of damage for a Tank, yet they think that Zac deserves all his nerfs. And Braum is suppose to be a support. Corki now deals barely any damage on his abilities, especially the ultimate that is a skill shot. Dr Mundo deals no damage for a fighter. Elise has no damage. Evelynn is too squishy. Gargas' ultimate could use some damage. Where did Hecarim go? He use to always be played. Janna is not the strongest support, just the most handy right now. With all the armor and magic penetration, Jax's ultimate is now useless, can Riot do something about the penetration, please? Riot can't seem to understand that Kassadin is already in a pitiful state. While Katarina is not that powerful as she use to be, lets nerf her; is what went through Riot's minds. Kha'Zix and Kog'Maw got nerfed. LeBlanc lost a silence. Lucian gets nerfed hard, but meanwhile, Jinx and Kalista are hitting us hard (and yes, Jinx is a little broken but not like Kalista). Lulu's abilities got wrongfully nerfed. Unlike champions like Yasuo, Mordekaiser uses his health, why no compensation? Hurray for this short term shield that can block anything but goes away fast, not like Yasuo's that blocks all attacks and abilities from champions. The list can go on and on.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-21T03:40:38.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Evelynn is too squishy. \n\nEve is not too squishy if built properly.

She's kept nonviable on purpose. I have to stand RIOT saying that they don't like one of my favorite champions and they won't let her be viable until they rework her. Why?

But This thread is exagerating. They didn't dump it down *that much*.  \nAlso, the item pool size was always the same, if at all, it's probably better now. At least as far as supports are concerned. Not that sure about the others. But I think most ADCs have at least 2 option for each of their item.

You could argue taht some classes (assassins and adc) are a lot better than others (Let's say tanks).

They're pretty much saying \"if the majority of players aren't ok with him after playing him, then we'll do something about it\". A neutral response, if anything but of course, you interpret it as you see fit. \nAhri got compensation too, not only in the damage department, and she wrecked 5.2. Wanna see that happen again?\n\nThe idea behind this game is that it changes constantly. Player input is necessary in the form of gameplay. However Riot can decide which parts of it wants to enhance and what it wants to reduce. There will always be two player factions, for and against, which makes appeasing people pretty difficult. Riot had a good game going for it until it decided to gut snowball. What we are seeing right now is the long term result of that questionable decision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whispering Tide","date":"2015-02-21T02:52:43.711+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with turrets.

How much damage you can tank, and controlling the turret aggro so no one dies...much more strategic than hiding under a turret and farming.  \n\nSame with point and click.  With skill shots, you need to worry about minions in the way, you need to worry about jukes, you need to worry about hitting proper targets.  It offers much more strategic depth than simply clicking on people.  One of the key differences of LoL and Dota 2 is the prevalence of skill shots versus targeted skills, and targeted skills, in Dota 2, don't have much depth past \"click on the target once\".  Even in Dota 2, heroes with skill shots often stand out because there is more depth to them.  Untargeted spells allow for a wider range in use and also serve as a weakness to a hero at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-21T02:51:25.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you need to worry about jukes\n\nYou need to worry about mobility.

I'm sure that's how this game works.\n\n> How would a targeted skill be any more strategic and take more thought than a skill shot? \n\nYou are messing concepts here. Skill shots are not strategy, but skill (I know it's redundant, but still). Strategy is to pick i.e. Amumu + Zyra + Miss Fortune + Malphite + Nami to make a huuuge AoE combo that ruins the enemy. Strategy is to pick Lux or Xerath if you see the enemy picking Veigar. Strategy is deciding if it's worth to counter-jungle enemy red to possibly take level and gold advantage over the enemy jungler, but losing some early ganking potential.\n\nLanding a skill shot, or making a cool Lee Sin LCS play, or picking Zed no matter who your team and the enemy team has picked to just make some kills (because your champion has everything he needs to excel at every game) and then roflstom the whole game, that's mechanical skill.\n\nThis game used to be a combination of strategy and skill, of outplaying and outsmarting. Now everything is about to \"counterplay\" and \"making cool plays\" (which usually means using dash + dash + dash + dash + QWER).\n\nVeigar is not about counterplay, Veigar is about strategy. He was a insta-pick if you saw the enemy to pick Karthus. Current champion selection is about \"Have we the first pick? If not ban Zed and Jarvan\" and then rush to pick the most op champions of the moment. Take a look at DotA2 champion selection, or, if you don't like DotA, look for competitive games from Season 1, that's how champion selection should feel like.\n\nThe main problem is that this game is not only about dodging stuff, it's also about outsmart and true strategy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
