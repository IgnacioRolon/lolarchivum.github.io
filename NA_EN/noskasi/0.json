Though I know this isn't unplayable, it feels less responsive than it should. League is the only game I have issues like this with as I get sub 30 ping in CS:GO and sub 50 ping in Overwatch. Been trying to troubleshoot this for a while and finally ran a trace route but I'm not sure how to read it and I don't know if there's a problem on my end, my ISP's end, or Riot's end.

As suspected, it looks like you're having some huge spikes upon hopping to your ISP's routing, which can cause disconnects as well.  Make sure to go through the connection guide, change your DNS, and even power cycle your router.  If that doesn't do the trick, you may need to present these logs to your ISP to see what the deal is with that node.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
