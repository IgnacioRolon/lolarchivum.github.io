I&#039;m sure one day the Riot messiah will come before us and hear us.\n\nPlease do not blame me for my written English, I&#039;m a despicable frenchie. &lt;3\n\n\nSo !\nHere is the description of the concept the title already began to ring in your charming little heads :\n\n------\n\n**Friendly Fire (May also be called Ego√Øsm Mode)\nSimply put, if a spell or competence can hurt an ennemy, it can hurt an ally (or yourself, as {{champion:51}}  and her trap.)**\nTHIS sure if for fun, but it does make you work on your positionning a lot more, 'cause I know this is one of the hardest teamfights tricks.\n-----\n\nthere&#039;s a lot of different possible effects (as {{champion:4}} 's or {{champion:16}} &#039;s ult) that I would like to discuss with you so please write your heart content below =D\n\n\n(I don't care if it is feasible, Riot won't ever take a look at it, the same goes for every thread on this forum.)","replies":[{"poster":"Togira Ikonoka","date":"2015-10-19T09:57:21.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"karthus decakill","replies":[{"poster":"Pr CoolCrab","date":"2015-10-19T10:09:17.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great, no ?\n\nYou play 1vs9, you just share one side of the map with 4 others.\n\nObviously you don't get gold for killing your \"mates\".\n","replies":[{"poster":"Togira Ikonoka","date":"2015-10-19T10:10:37.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult would kill himself as well (unless he was already dead)","replies":[{"poster":"Pr CoolCrab","date":"2015-10-19T10:14:22.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get magic res ? x)\nMaybe ults wouldn't have this friendly fire concept.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-20T07:57:09.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly... I would LOOOOOVE getting gold for killing my mates...\n\n... but yeah, I can see the downhill spiral that would ensue.\n\nThis kinda sounds like Majicka meets LoL. I always like me some Majicka...\n\nOnly problem I see is that mainly single target non-skill-shot champs would have an unfair advantage. I think you'd have to add hitboxes for all ranged autoattacks, such that they hit things in the way, similar to caitlyn's ult. Similar changes would be needed for abilities as well. It could get hairy.\n\nAnother issue: For this to reach maximum hilarity, you'd also have to include self-fire: aka, ziggs better watch where he places his bombs, for his own sake... But then you run into the issue of how to apply aoe's. Does shyvana suddenly kill herself with her own flames? That would be a serious problem... but, also hilarious. Full lifesteal shyvana incoming. Is the warmog's passive burned by friendly fire? If so, there goes plan a) on split-pushing singed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-10-19T12:23:02.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, sounds far more frustrating than rewarding. You think about how many trolls are showing up now in OFA and it's not hard to imagine getting camped at the fountain by one of your teammates who kills you over and over again. People who wanted to win would just pick more AA reliant champions so they didn't have to fight the friendly fire.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2015-10-19T11:59:48.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not have it so that your attacks can injure allies but not kill them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-10-19T10:50:33.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how bout free for all","replies":[]}]}
