This issue can not be solved by changing graphics settings or doing what the official Riot Games support page for fps issues suggests. \n\nThis is my personal experience: \n\nmy specs:\nintel i5 6660k @ 3.50 ghz\n8gb ram\nNvidia gtx 960\nWindows 10\n\nit started yesterday (please note that even after the latest patch was released i played and lol and all was fine). My FPS went from 110 - 144 @ very high settings to 15 - 60 @ whatever graphics setting.\nThe only improvement comes from disabling V-sync (i increased my fps by around 20 - 30, but for a limited time)\nThe fps range has huge spikes, sometimes like 30-40 fps difference per second. Game litterally unplayable.\nAlso fps seems to be higher when the game starts, going down since minions spawn and reaching the minimum during teamfights later on in the game.\n\nI tried other games to see if something in my pc was broken (ex: dark souls 3 @high settings | 45 - 60 fps, nothing changed since last time i played the game one week ago)\ni also tried to do all the things Riot suggests on his support page and tried Hextech repair tool.\n\nStill having issues. i hope some rioter explains what is going on.\nIf you guys are here for the same issue, please do a report of your experience.\n\nEDIT: with the help from a Rioter in a ticket we solved my issue! My problem seemed to be that my cpu integrated graphics were processing the game instead of my GPU. here's how to solve it if you have a Nvidia graphic card.\n\n- Right click on desktop and select Nvidia control panel\n- Go to \"manage 3d settings\"\n- On \"global setting\" click on \"default graphic processor\" and select \"Nvidia high performance processor\"\n- Click on \"apply\"\n- if you don't have the  \"default graphic processor\" entry you have to manually set lol.exe files (NOT THE CLIENT EXE, BUT THE ACTUAL GAME EXE) by going on the side menu \"application settings\" and by adding leagueoflegends.exe applications ( located on C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\n\nplease note i translated the procedure from italian.

They can happen for a variety of reasons, so I usually ask that players go through each step of the FPS guide to help rule out possibilities.    While I haven't seen any widespread issues impacting FPS, it wouldn't hurt to take a deeper look and investigate further.
