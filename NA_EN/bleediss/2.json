Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or social status, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nSee? It clearly says it favors equality for all people, not just women, or men, or any specific thing on Earth.\r\n\r\nNow I don't think feminism is a bad thing, it's definitely needed in third world countries, but the way people twist the definition, yell at people for not joining the movement, and actually do the opposite of what feminism is meant to do, just makes me want to ignore it completely.\r\n\r\nSo I guess ignoring it would be wise, you know, whenever I see it on the web I just scroll past it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, have you guys ignored the chaotic scene of feminism on the web? Since, you know, radical feminists tend to stand out more, so trying to find actually ethical feminists can be tough at times and feel like they don't even get the attention they deserve for bringing the right kind of movement into play, which is sad, because it'd be wonderful if the web were filled with ethical feminists, not radical ones.","replies":[]}
