I found learning the game and grinding up to 30 to be immensely frustrating. I made stupid mistakes, knew I was making stupid mistakes, and was having my teammates take it out of my hide rather than helping in the vast majority of cases. It seemed like I was playing with as many smurfs as other newbies, and they would just take over games and abuse the other players. I also had no sense of value for how to manage my IP, the relative importance of building a champion pool vs. runes, and so on and felt leagues behind. This isn't particularly surprising, and I don't really blame Riot for much of it. While they could improve the onboarding experience for new players it is an area they are aware of and working on. It is a difficult problem. League is a very mechanically complex game, with lots of moving parts, and enjoyment will naturally increase along with mastery.\n\nAs a result, I now enjoy League a great deal more. I've been able to gather people I enjoy playing with on my friends list, started climbing the ranked ladder, and start learning multiple roles. I started as a support main simply because it was the role that nobody else wanted, and that was the only way I could reliably get practice in a single role. I've now gotten to the point where I can pick up jungle and top, and am now working on mid/adc. There's a huge range of champions and playstyles to explore. I just got Yasuo as my free champ and tried him out in a custom vs. bots. I'm terrible with him, but had a blast. I'm going to train up on him incase I ever need to fill as an AD mid.
