Yeah, exhaust turns their scariness to laughableness because look at this for a second:\r\n\r\nExhausts target enemy champion, reducing their Movement Speed and Attack Speed by 30%, their Armor and Magic Resist by 10, and **their damage dealt by 40% for 2.5 seconds.**\r\n\r\nLike think about Annie, Syndra, Zed, time your shit right, and use that summoner's spell, BOOM, their burst just got destroyed, and they can't fight back, but guess whaaaaat? You can! You can kill them and snowball your lane! Isn't that AMAZING?\r\n\r\nSeriously, I'm just saying, especially on immobile mages, exhaust can be insanely good because what it does is it instantly puts the enemy laner you're against at a disadvantage, and they'll probably flash from the movement slow because most of the time **they can't fight back.** Also, it makes it where you can completely turn the fight against someone, and snowball, like one time I was using Zyra against Annie, took exhaust, timed it well, she ulted when she got exhausted, boom, I spammed every ability possible, and she died, and I snowballed, and I carried my entire team to victory, and guess what? Annie, a really scary burst mage, was left in the dust, all because of that one summoner's spell.\r\n\r\nSo... if you're ever in a matchup against someone with high burst... think about taking exhaust... it might **really** make your time easier. :)","replies":[]}
