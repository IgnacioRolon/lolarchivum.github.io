Well, ya see, when someone, no, most of the community, walks into the URF lobby and decides to be a tryhard about everything, you begin to feel like you are not part of this 'tribe,' which is something humans always want, to be part of the 'tribe,' and once you feel like an outsider you feel like you just don't fit and want to leave or in this case want people to come over to your tribe because most people on GD are fucking sick of the tryhard tribe and want the fun tribe.","replies":[]}
