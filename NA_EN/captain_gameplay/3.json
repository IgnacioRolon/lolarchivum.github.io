As such, the character has the SC2 Lore name of Kerrigan because it uses her model, but the abilities are 100% designed and created by me.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes:\n\nDesign can be considered fairly similar to Gnar, except more carry/hybrid/flex orientated than the almost exclusive bruiser role given to Gnar. Funny enough, the hero was designed before Gnar was revealed, we just had fairly similar conception.\n\nEssentially the hero is designed to allow multiple play styles. \n\nOne style, traditional Ranged ADC, will utilize her self peel through Ranged W and steroid from E,  Q to poke/scout, and R briefly for the extra durability in a pinch, and an escape with her Melee Q/W (jump to ally).\n\nThe next style would be as a bruiser/battle mage, that isn't afraid to jump into the middle of the enemy team in melee form. With a fairly tanky build, this hero would be able to significantly lower its cooldowns through the chain damage from the Melee E, which counts for the Heroic Passive. Thus the hero would have essentially reset-able abilities assuming it stays within the thick of the fray, including a very short cooldown on the Ult transformation itself (or even no cooldown). Additionally, it should be noted that the hero does not have mana cost while in Melee Form (as the mana cost is upfront in the transformation).\n\nFinally, the hero can be played as a burst caster who has decent laning harass due to the ranged E steroid, and a very powerful spike in damage at level 6, as show in the video demo. As all it's abilities scale with AP, a full rotation of skills into a zhonyas would be somewhat akin to Diana/Liss engagement.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTextual Transcription\n\nHeroic Passive: Damaging enemy heroes with basic attacks or abilities lowers Hero's cooldowns by 0.5 seconds. This amount is doubled while in Melee Form.\n\nQ:\n\nRanged Form - Linear Boomerang. Deals moderate magic damage and reveals all enemies hit for a moderate duration. Enemies may be hit once per pass. While enemies are revealed by this effect, they take increased damage from the Hero.\n\nMelee Form - Self Centered AoE. Deals moderate magic damage and briefly roots enemies.\n\nW:\n\nRanged Form - Lifts up enemies in a small area and throws them a short distance towards a direction specified by the player. Deals moderate magic damage to enemies thrown, and enemies that units thrown collide with.\n\nMelee Form - Leaps to the target point, dealing moderate magic damage in an area on impact, slowing the movement and weapon speed of enemies hit. Target point MUST be targeted on or nearby another unit.\n\nE:\n\nToggled Passive Ranged - Attacks consume a small amount of mana and deal bonus mixed damage on hit.\n\nMelee - Attacks consume a small amount of mana and deal bonus mixed damage on hit to the target before chaining to up to 3 nearby enemies.\n\nR:\n\nRanged Form - Transforms to Melee Form, gaining substantial armor and spell armor and access to a different skill set, at the cost of a small movement speed reduction.\n\nMelee Form - Reverts transformation.","replies":[{"poster":"Eagleheart","date":"2014-09-23T19:37:03.522+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So a champion that's melee AND ranged?\n\n{{champion:126}}","replies":[{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2014-09-24T12:23:37.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:133}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2014-09-23T20:08:51.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PPPPP POWER SLAM\n\nbut the better comparison is\n {{champion:150}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gona Get You","date":"2014-09-23T23:40:22.961+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL,  Look at that Quidditch kid getting nuked at lvl 6.","replies":[{"poster":"QuanTomiK","date":"2014-09-24T01:35:43.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He looks like quite the noob doesn't he?

You're describing Gnar.

Kerrigan's Q does not slow or have CD reduced on return (nor does she have to catch it) it does a bit of damage and targets hit by her Q take 50% increased damage from her E toggle. And her E toggle steroid is on hit flat damage scaling with 20% ap and ad dealing mixed damage, while draining mana everytime she attacks with it. Her ult is controllable and doesn't give as much free stats. Her ranged W also is a small aoe, ranged and provides no cc other than picking units up and placing them down.\n\nThe playstyle is completely different as well. Gnar can build full tank and be extremely effective while kerrigan has to build damage with a few bruiserish items. On paper it kind of seems like Gnar, but I assure you the feel is completely different.\n\nAlso like Yasuotits said this hero was designed a couple weeks before Gnar was revealed and was about 50%+ complete in the editor when Gnar was finally revealed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2014-09-23T21:12:59.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm aware of the similarities, and like I said in the post, it amused me that while I was already working on this hero, gnar was revealed and they had such similar kits that I even felt the need to change mine a bit. If you want proof of that, the best I can offer is this changelog, showing this hero's finished implementation on Aug 6th: http://www.riseofamon.com/index.php?/topic/361-beta-changelog-165-172-patch-kerrigan/\nWhile that patch hit a few days after Gnar's reveal, if you mean to imply I can design, coordinate, and program a full hero in 6 days, I guess I'm flattered.\n\nMostly I made this post to see how people would react to a video demo of a hero concept, more so than the actual design itself. Hopefully the reaction is positive and ideally I would get some advice on what people feel was unnecessary, and what they felt should have been added to the demo/post (so I can improve future submissions).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2014-09-23T19:33:05.383+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner's old passive...R.I.P.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2014-09-23T19:34:53.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its a bit snowball-y which is why I made it against heroes only.

I cannot get my shield back up when I really need it (in the heat of battle) anymore. This forces me to build tank items since I cannot just build AP and rely on my shield. After 4.2 rework, I could go full AP and enter combat with a shield equal to 3/4 of my max HP. It might break fast, but if I'm attacking the whole time with max CDR, then I can have it up again 3 seconds later. Now it's like 7 seconds minimum with max ranks and max CDR. That's longer than almost all engages, even team fights. Even if I build full AP, the shield will break fast, only now I have to wait 7 seconds to put it up again and I have no defense when it's down.\n\ntherefore, tank items are mandatory on Skarner now, when, before, they were a build option. I start with Chalice of Harmony and then go either Spirit Visage or Randuin's Omen depending on enemy comp. I almost fully sacrifice damage for soak. Also, the fact that his passive deals AD scaling damage bothers me to no end. Where I used to build Lichbane, now I need to build Trinity Force to actually hurt people.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-09-24T04:43:50.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I respect the desire to make a transformation champ, but this comes with all the same problems other transformation champs have and doesn't seem to bring much that's new to the table. Because of the lack of gating on the transformation post-6, this champ's playstyle of this guy is more like top lane jayce (sit in ranged form and harass all day, go melee for the kill) even if the kit seems sort of like Gnar.\n\nMuch like with nidalee, jayce, and elise, there will be one true way(tm) to build this character that maximizes the benefits of their range with the strength of their all-in. Depending on the kit's numbers (how high is the damage steroid? what's the cd on  Q, W, R?) I see this as a kayle-style mix of AP, AS, CDR, and maybe some mana/mregen.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2014-09-24T05:35:45.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The transformation has a fairly long cd [80/70/60 seconds] with a maximum duration of [20/30/40] seconds, so it isn't something the hero has up at all times. Likewise, the hero actually has fairly low poke, with the only real form of ranged harass being the Ranged Q skill and a few AA's. Without any mobility skill in Ranged form or easy wave clear/poke, I don't think the hero would be played as a poke all day and then all-in type, as the sustained poke damage would either not be high enough, or put the hero in a dangerous position.\n\nThough my own custom moba has its own meta and items, so its not representative to try to directly translate game results to potential performance in LoL, it would appear that there are multiple ways to build the hero. This could be due to our differing item set itself allowing for better variety of builds, but as far as I can tell, the design seems to have a very flexible role. If u want the actual numbers (which may or may not make sense to you), here they are:\n\nQ Ability:\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/b5ZnHnB.jpg[/IMG]\n\nW Ability:\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/9QXaREn.jpg[/IMG]\n\nE Ability:\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/XkShjHk.jpg[/IMG]\n\nR Ability:\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/0mUxLJ8.jpg[/IMG]\n\nSome Useful Conversions:\n\n1 Range in SC2 = approximately 100 range in LoL\n\n1 Movespeed in SC2 = 100 Movespeed in LoL\n\nSC2 uses \"Energy\" as the term for Mana, (not to be confused with Energy in LoL)\n\n1 Mastery in my custom game = 1.65 AP? The values are set so that 1 Mastery = 1 Weapon Damage, as opposed to LoL's system of like, 1.65~ AP per Wpn Dmg.","replies":[{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-09-24T17:57:28.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She may not poke with her abilities, but save them for an all-in while only poking with AA's (similar to quinn). Her mobility isn't particularly necessary since she's got a strong escape with her telekinesis. You may also be underestimating the power of attack range, because it makes poking very easily.\n\nThe large cooldown on her ult will *definitely* encourage focusing on a single playstyle, because the cooldown reset from ulting is in such a limited window that maximum benefit will be derived from using it as efficiently as possible. I'm not sure why you haven't noticed a one true way playstyle, but my guess is because of a lack of playtesting -- nidalee, jayce, and elise were initially designed with the same intent as your champ, and 100% of them focused on comboing the abilities to maximum benefit despite the fact that internal testing/iteration indicated players would be able to diversify.\n\nA couple more things:\n\n* You're missing the damage amp on the Q tooltip\n* You're missing the chain effect on the E melee form tooltip\n* There's no passive on this guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2014-09-24T21:07:15.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad on the damage amp on Q. It just increases her E damage by 50%\n\nThe chain effect is exactly just that, it bounces to up to 3 nearby enemies. I didn't think it was relevant to a tooltip post on damage/cd/mana cost approximations.\n\nThe passive was also not included because there are no such values. It is simply -0.5s cd on all abilities on hit or on ability hit against enemy heroes; doubled to -1s cd while in melee form.\n\nUsing the hero's ult \"As efficiently as possible\" will largely depend on what role and item build the hero pursues. For example, if the hero were in LoL, and built like a traditional ADC, that ult would almost exclusively be saved for either a kill secure (similar in function to Quinn) or a for a quick boost in defensive stats and a jump to escape, then immediately change back to ranged form for the kiting and movespeed advantages. On the other hand, if you built like, say, Shyvanna, you would probably ult immediately and dive into the middle, trying to maximize your CDR from your heroic passive by fighting in a position where your E chains to as many targets as possible. Alternatively, instead of focusing on CDR, if you are confident in your ability to dive enemy backline, you could attempt that as well - but without the CDR resets her chase is actually not that powerful (a gap close into a brief root). She also cannot jungle for her life, so I don't think Elise/Nidalee comparisons apply, who both have large gap-close, some form of sustain, and damage scaling based on the target's Health, which make certain stats more powerful on those heroes than other stats.","replies":[{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-09-25T06:43:14.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they looked like ability tooltips. I figured it would be good to let players know explicitly what their abilities do. That passive is also kind of a big deal, I would recommend noting it in the OP!\n\nRemember, when Jayce was released, Riot said he could be used as a marksman with kill secures, or as tanky top laner, or as a glass cannon assassin. And it turns out his only truly optimal playstyle is as a glass cannon assassin. With Elise's release, it was thought that she could be built as a tank, mage, or assassin, and then it turned out he was only good as an assassin. And the same remains true for Gnar, Nidalee, and Quinn, regardless of their gap-closers, sustain, or whatever.\n\nI can only guess at what the ideal playstyle and build are, but if LoL's form-shifting classes are any indication, there will be *one* build that optimizes all her abilities. Unless you have a way of demonstrating that this wouldn't be true for your champ (saying it doesn't have sustain or a long-range gap-closer doesn't count), I think it's the most reasonable conclusion to draw.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2014-09-25T08:59:56.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are ability tooltips, i just cut on some parts of them for the screenshot. The passive is explained both in the video and in the OP. \n\nI agree that LoL designs have in general panned out to be rather one dimensional in role, but I think this is more that Riot has purposefully done this to their own heroes and gameplay. Look at itemization and meta - items meant to allow niche building, like essence reaver, are just universally considered trash, and riot doesn't' do anything to try and help it out. I personally prefer LoL style gameplay with quick reflexes, and team \"fullfillment\" where each role feels individually powerful and impactful at all times in the game (vs Dota's Ward Bitch supports etc), but I disagree with some of the game/item designs Riot implements, as well as the way Riot adjusts balance because I think it stifles diversity and strategy in favor of a mediated and controlled meta shift every major patch or so. Just look at the change to towers way back whenever when Riot made it so certain T1 towers were just plain harder to push than other T1 towers - just to make sure one meta was superior to another.","replies":[{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-09-25T19:58:36.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just letting you know, in case you didn't code the tooltip info into your game.
