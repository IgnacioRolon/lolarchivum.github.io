The purpose of this post is purely to provide a personal bit of feedback from a fan - something I myself have found incredibly valuable in my own works.\n\n**Store design and layout**\n\nWhile I am no web developer or graphics designer, I think the web store design and layout could still use a bit of improvement. While the store has a very clean layout, one thing that immediately stood out to me was the lack of a search bar, which I would imagine would be an expected feature of any website where a user needs to navigate through multiple pages to find what they want. Another thing that struck me was that the store was thematically very different from the League of Legends website itself, which has a darker and fantasy feel to it, with it's ornate borders and black/dark backgrounds. Finally, I was also unsure of why the default sorting of products was \"Sort By Position\". I'm not even sure what \"Sort By Position\" means - perhaps the date that the product was made available? In that case simply changing it to read \"Newest\" would make it much clearer. Additionally, I felt there should be a \"Sort By Popularity\" option as well.\n\n**Product Feedback**\n\nI personally have purchased a few products from the store, but I do not feel the store or its products have really satisfied demand - at least for myself. This is not to say it hasn't create some great products - such as the Tibber's, Teemo, and Poro Dolls - these products are especially good for Riot because they can be readily given to children/non-players as gifts. However many of the clothing designs are either too expensive, or too embarrassing to wear. I expect that your main demographic consist of non-weightlifting young adult males. Can you imagine them wearing a shirt proclaiming \"Braum's Body Builders\" with an image of a super buffed man tossing a loaded barbell around? As for the figures - I can't offer much here because I don't know anything about them prior to my exposure here. I have however, seen images of League figures compared with \"nendoroid\" figures of similar price range, and these comparisons have made a compelling argument that the League figures are of inferior quality. There was also that whole issue of not having context pictures of these figures next to objects (instead of floating in a white void), but that seems to be partially resolved now.\n\nI will finish this with a concern about a product I have purchased - the Gnar Jacket. Upon arrival, I noticed that the zipper was not YKK. Perhaps I am therefore biased, but within a week, the zipper had broken - shattered when I took off the jacket and the zipper impacted against a wall, breaking in half. Upon closer inspection, I've also noticed that the threading around the zipper lace has begun to come unraveled. Linked below are two images of these issues. Otherwise I have no complaints with the product and am fairly satisfied with it despite these inconveniences. I must stress I am not looking for any compensation, but if this is an issue with the zipper design and construction as opposed to simply a lemon zipper, I would imagine that others might take issue.\n\n[Broken Zipper](http://i.imgur.com/jDEyhgI.jpg)\n\n[Loose Threading](http://imgur.com/jDEyhgI,JOTMpx7#1)","replies":[]}
