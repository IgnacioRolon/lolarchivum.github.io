{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2016-08-16T19:46:52.476+0000","title":"Assassin Roster Update - Katarina","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all,\n\nThe last major update for Assassins this pre-season will be focused around improving Katarina and solidifying her functionality within League of Legends. We believe that at her core, Katarina wants to be a hyper agile, high lethality champion that rides on the razor edge of adrenaline and thrives in the middle of the action. She was our fourth choice here because we wanted to create a more fleshed out and richer version of this - one that is even more exciting to play, but with fewer game health issues then her current kit incurs. Our goals for her are as follows:\n\n**Tactical Play**\nPerhaps the most significant goal in this update is building Tactical Play and Counterplay into her kit - giving both Katarina and her opponents the ability to make moment to moment plays against each other. In teamfights, there is no more frustrating experience than playing against Katarina when she can cast 5 spell rotations as fast as possible, blinking all over the screen in a completely un-interactible mess of blades. Like the other Assassins in the other updates, we are addings windows in her kill pattern that opponents will be able to meaningfully interact with. Expect her live combo of Shunpo + Sinister Steel to be altered to not be as instantaneous. In return, Katarina players can expect to gain significantly higher mobility and the ability to dance in and out of encounters and set up her own success.\n\n**Laning and Interaction**\n\tWith her current live kit, Katarina players are forced to eke through laning phase, if they can. With no real means to kill or even make trades against most opponents, laning becomes a non-interactive affair of throwing Qs and stealing the opportune CS. This feels wrong given her nature and we want to make her laning a much deadlier dance for both parties involved.\n\n**Mastery and Skill Expression**\nWe believe skill expression to be an extremely important part of Katarina&rsquo;s appeal that has been unfortunately under-exposed. To all the Katarina players who have undeservingly earned the reputation as face-rollers that win fights by mashing all their buttons repeatedly, we dropped the ball. Internally, we know that she actually has a rather steep mastery curve. On top of rapid input constraints, she tests many less visible aspects revolving heavily around her ability to track opponent CC and pick the exact right moment to engage. These are all important to her, but there should also be more obvious moments where Katarina has out played her opponents built into her own kit, whether through clever juking or flashy prediction plays.\n\n**Resetting**\nThis is probably the elephant in the room when it comes to Kat. There are multiple compelling arguments against it, including the extreme Feast or Famine pattern it creates. However, kill resets are a powerful tool for striking hard in high risk high reward and adrenaline rush gameplay, while also making a strategically sharp character. And Pentakills. We see Katarina&rsquo;s ability to hedge her entire skill rotation knowing that if she is successful, she will be able to try for even more is vital to the unique appeal she brings to League. To resolve the aforementioned Feast or Famine, we are actually doubling down here. Expect that Katarina will not only get to keep her live passive and also gain access to some other form of partial resetting on part of her kit - most likely Shunpo.\n\n* Shunpo and Ward Jumping\n\t\t* We felt a heads up is valuable here: As an indirect result of multiple shunpo resets built directly into Katarina&rsquo;s kit and a heavy focus on premeditated set up plays, we are re-assessing Ward Jumping. Ward jumping allows Kat to be anywhere she wants regardless of how poorly she set up, which limits our ability to make this multi-jumping playstyle reasonable. Without Shunpo&rsquo;s ability to ward jump, we would be able to push more power into Shunpo resetting, while also allowing us to give Katarina even more kill pressure in lane where the reliable escape limits her power budget. This isn&rsquo;t a light consideration and we understand that this function is an expression of skill on the champion, but we feel that there is significantly more mastery to be gained through new Shunpo gameplay.\n\nBest,\nBeluga Whale","replies":[{"poster":"JP Killyleagh","date":"2016-08-16T20:14:05.027+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":1,"body":"*deep breath*\n\nWill she still spin?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2016-08-16T20:24:04.166+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":0,"body":"She probably spins more actually.

While riot does a pretty good job with these, I think kat is really good where she's at now. I'm happy the resets are staying but I'm still scared about other things. \n\nFor example I feel like ward hopping is one or the things that sets apart a good kat from a bad kat. It also incentivizes riskier plays which I think riot likes. Many of my first bloods have come from me flashing under the enemy mid's turret, securing the reset, and ward hopping out. I've watched a lot of expert kat players and see the same thing. Removing ward hopping will discourage risky plays adrenaline pumped plays. It's also the one redeeming factor of her laning phase. She has a lot of trouble in lane but at least she can still hop on a ward when she gets into a sticky situation. Removing that will force her to play much more safe and under turret because as a squishy melee champion she will be in much more danger other wise. \n\nI trust riot to do the right thing but please don't remove her smooth gameplay. I like that they also acknowledge that she has a higher skill cap than people think. But my favorite part about playing kat is being a whirl of spinning daggers jumping around everywhere and I hope we don't lose that.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2016-08-16T20:52:00.985+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is no version of Katarina that doesn't involve blinking around and whirling daggers.","replies":[{"poster":"PaeanAsklepios","date":"2016-08-16T22:00:46.410+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having read everything to this point so far, I'm satisfied. As a Kat main, I understand. Ward-hopping gets really old really quickly, and while it has been something that has rewarded risky but good gameplay, if it has to go, it has to go.\n\nThe fact that Riot acknowledges Kat's high skill cap is enough for me to have faith in this rework. Actually, then Riot announced that the assassins were being updated, I hoped from the beginning Kat would be on it. She is definitely not in a good spot right now, either for Kat players or for their opponents. Her initial burst has people raging far too much, and I believe that's why people accuse Kat players of face-rolling a keyboard.\n\nMeanwhile, Kat is rarely played in professionals, and to my knowledge, she's played just as little in the tiers just before it. As long as her identity is kept unique, I'm looking forward to the rework. Never mind that I initially started to main Katarina because of the initial burst that left squishies with almost no chance to react. It originally felt balanced because that burst does nothing against tanks. However, it reminds me of champions like Rengar and Kha'Zix, who I feel are horribly imbalanced and very unhealthy because of their initial burst.\n\nRengar is on the update list. That makes me feel even better.\n\n**Edit:** I'm also extremely excited to see that her laning phase is getting a buff, because laning with Kat is like pulling teeth, and it sometimes makes it hard to roam, which is essential for assassins.\n\nLong story short, this Kat main has been looking forward to the update from the announcement of the assassin update as a whole, increasingly so as more information is revealed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-08-16T20:03:59.854+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will she still build the same?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2016-08-16T20:37:04.629+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"We debated whether we should swap her over to AD since it made more sense with how her spells feel, but ultimately choose to keep her AP based builds because the items honestly were cooler (Zhonyas), and the cost of forcing everyone to re-learn builds was not worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-08-16T20:48:52.926+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you mean that you'll make her mainly AP or hybrid/choosing between AD and AP?\n\nRegarding AP-build being cooler, maybe there should be cooler AD items if that's the case!

I mean, it seems to me any changes would disrupt her builds anyway, so re-learning those will be the case either case. \n\nHer thematics clearly say AD, so the AP scaling is a bit of a thematic disconnect.

Take a beating, but always keeping an eye out for an opening, or perhaps waiting for an enemy to let their guard down, and then assassinate them and snowball. \n\nI know feast/famine isn't exactly liked, but you don't play these types of champions for team utility. You play them specifically because you want to kill key targets and snowball, if you don't want to fall behind then you play Zilean or Morgana. When you famine, it punishes you for making  selfish picks.\n\nBut aside from that, I am interested to see how you will balance Shunpo with no ward hopping. I will have faith in what you do(for once, haha) because I think it can make her more skillful, to only overextend when she has a minion wave coming from behind to make her play smarter, but I think it could open up oppportunities to balance her better with only being able to hop to living things.

Ideally she is constantly choosing between higher burst (mimic sigil)  or mobility (mimic distort) or cc with the cost of staying in the fight for longer (mimic tether) - but the moment she gets far enough ahead that she can distort + mimic distort into Sigil + 1st hit of Tether, and actually nuke someone out of the fight with just that, a lot of the gameplay has vanished.","replies":[{"poster":"PeelGodDamnit","date":"2016-08-16T21:21:40.937+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ahem... zed...
