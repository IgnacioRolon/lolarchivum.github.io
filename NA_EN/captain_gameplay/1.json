Enclosed below is your one way ticket to Tibber&rsquo;s Tea Party. Don&rsquo;t miss it.\r\n\r\nOne of League iconic duos, Annie and her bear Tibbers have gone through their fair share of updates as League has grown over the years. Throughout this, Annie has held on tight to her identity as a little pyro surrounded by gods and demons. Even the likes of Aurelion Sol is fated to die in a fire when matched up against a skilled Annie player. But while Annie has weathered well, her other half Tibbers isn&rsquo;t living up to his fearsome potential. While Tibbers always makes a dramatic entrance, his contributions to the fight post-summoning aren&rsquo;t always befitting the awesome flaming magic bear he is.\r\n\r\n**Things we especially like:**\r\n\r\n* The flash bear drop. Annie&rsquo;s bread-and-butter burst combo is a threatening affair that&rsquo;s more about skirting the edges of Annie&rsquo;s range than dodging a skillshot. While League benefits a lot from the potential to outplay most abilities in the game, having Champions with reliable abilities is also good for the game as long as they don&rsquo;t make less-reliable champions obsolete.\r\n* High accessibility, high mastery curve. Despite being one of the easier champions to pick up, Annie&rsquo;s performance scales dramatically with experience thanks her limited but sharp windows of opportunity.\r\n\r\n**Things we are working on improving:**\r\n\r\n* Tibbers AI and Control. The current state of affairs re: summoning leaves much to be desired, reducing him to be League&rsquo;s cuddliest walking sunfire cape. Tibbers is certainly a powerful ally, but commanding him beyond tanking a turret or walking towards your enemies often yields a less-than-satisfactory experience. Often, he&rsquo;s left cancelling his basic attacks while Annie is busy slings spells.\r\n* Hiding power behind poor threat communication. Constantly checking Annie&rsquo;s buff bar should not be the correct, or only way to know if she&rsquo;s hiding a stun behind her next Molten Shield.\r\n* Throw-away Passive stacking spell. We&rsquo;d like Molten Shield to have a use past &ldquo;Pyromania Stack&rdquo;.\r\n\r\n**What we hope comes out of the update:**\r\n\r\n* Annie players should feel connected to and empowered when accompanied by their summon Tibbers. This _will_ mean shifting some power out from Annie&rsquo;s direct abilities into Tibbers himself.\r\n* Players matched against Annie should have better communication around when she&rsquo;s most threatening and when she isn&rsquo;t.\r\n* Molten Shield should have value as a powerful defensive ability on a mage; especially one that&rsquo;s often bear-dropping into the thick of battle.\r\n\r\nWith this update,  we&rsquo;re finally answering that age-old question: Yes Annie, we _have_ seen your bear Tibbers.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBeluga Whale","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-03-26T20:13:59.930+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":8,"body":"I don't understand how it isn't hypocritical to say that you like the flash-bear drop here when in Malz' Mage Update Riot said that a kit that relies on flash/acting as an assassin is unhealthy.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=6c2r0VAc,comment-id=000a000200000000,timestamp=2016-02-14T02:42:50.948+0000)\n>\n> Because if this character needs to be played like an assassin in order to win, he's probably not healthy for the game. His only options are to walk up to or Flash up to someone and combo them, or to catch someone off guard (like in brush or something) and combo them. There are champions that are much better suited to do both of these things, and given Malzahar's kit, if that's what it took for him to succeed, he's probably just overtuned.\n\nWhy do you consider Annie \"better suited\" to do these things?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2016-03-26T21:34:03.839+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":26,"body":"Malzahar is different from Annie in multiple ways. This is not a comment on whether or not Flash plays should be allowed, but rather a comment on whether it makes sense for such a play to be so key or identity defining to a given Champion's impact on the game.\n\nMalz flashing to combo+ult a target is bad because he is meant to offer something other than this, but ends up being balanced around it. Instead of a mage that cares about bouncing his DoT and maximizing it's usage for sustained DPS, you get a mage that only cares about killing one target as fast as possible.\n\nAnnie on the other hand, is a bursty mage that severely punishes mis-positioning. It makes a lot of sense, then, for her to feel especially empowered offensively by abilities that allow her to re-position (like flash)","replies":[{"poster":"Not Thomas","date":"2016-03-27T00:31:46.254+0000","up_votes":170,"down_votes":10,"body":"I think the problem with Annie is that she has:\n- a reliable stun\n- insane range of that stun with flash up\n- incredible amount of burst damage \n- which is instant and almost impossible to dodge\n\nSomething has got to give..\n\nIf you keep that playstyle you will be stuck with the problem that Annie will be completely binary, something that riot usually tries to avoid. \nAlso, I believe champions should not be balanced around summoner spells. You basically limit Annie to being useful once every 5 minutes.\n\nI think Annie is one of those champions on which a large part of the community seems to agree is very frustrating to play against. I think it is wrong to try and save a champion identity, when the identity is the exact thing that makes a champion frustrating. (being flash tibbers, insane amount of burst, no counter play)\nAnnie has enough other parts of her identity that you can build on instead, which would make her a far less binary champion.\n\nOn a side note, I would love to see Tibbers become like the badass from the cinematic (including spawn animation, rito please). Make Tibbers scary, make him leap, make him maul.

Reliable output actually has really high value.\n\nThis is not to say we are celebrating over the idea of Annie one-shotting you on Flash's cooldown - even small increases in Tibber's persistent power come at costs to upfront burst. Rather this is a defense of her ability to reliable engage on opponents who stray too close to her. Flash is inevitably a natural extension of that threat. Compared to similar in-class champions like Lux/Syndra (or Zyra/Brand/Velkoz for damage support threats) who can cc and delete you from 1000 units away without Flash, the fact that Annie's catch is _not_ dodgeable is what allows her to function while being shorter ranged (not to mention having poor wave-clear when pressured). If Flash allows her to cheat this occasionally, well Flash allows a lot of people to bypass weaknesses built into their kits.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-03-27T02:11:05.904+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":12,"body":">If you mean to say that her ability to reliably catch out enemies means she won't be viable outside of solo queue, then this is wrong because a reliable catcher actually has incredible value\n\nNo, he's saying that you can't give her kit any real power because you insist on keeping her dumb-arse flash Tibbers combo.

He's only good for the immediate stun and nuke even though he lasts for up to 45 seconds afterwards. Worse is that she's 100% reliant on Flash, and even you guys clearly consider her worthless without it.\n\nYou have the technology to make Tibbers more meaningful.\n\nSo here's my idea: *Make it so Summon: Tibbers cannot trigger Pyromania.*\n\nUse Tibbers to extend Annie's range, even further than Flash would allow. Give *Tibbers* the ability to cast Disintegrate and Incinerate.\n\nIf the target of Annie's Q is out of her personal range, but within Tibbers', the spell will be cast from Tibbers, and vice versa. Both would cast it if the target is in both of their attack ranges. Incinerate would always cast from both as normal.\n\nIf an unfortunate soul is caught between the two and hit by both, Disintegrate and Incinerate deal 180-200% damage. If the ratios are lowered to make up for that, maybe to 50-60% AP scaling on her Q and W down from 80 and 85% (meaning the increased damage would surpass her current scaling), this would still encourage Annie to get in a danger zone for maximum damage output, which is one of her current few weaknesses. The base damage staying the same would allow her to still farm as efficiently with her spells in the early game as she currently does, and remain effective as a support.\n\nShe can even be a safer ranged threat, even if that means the AoE and immediate damage is smaller by comparison. She could RW and still stun 2-3 people in Incinerate's cone immediately instead of being forced to Flash-R for an engage.\n\nThis would remove Annie's reliance on Flash and that horribly one-dimensional playstyle, as well as give Tibbers much more interaction and potential within her kit while keeping her current drawbacks intact. It might make things more difficult for new players to pick up, but you've already been doing that with Ashe and Garen, and restricting new players from using Flash keeps them from understanding Annie's threat level in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Javazon","date":"2016-03-27T00:51:43.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":15,"body":"Annie's fine how she is.

It would even be really cool to have her throw her toy bear into the middle of the enemy team and have it erupt into a flaming life-size bear.

Looks like it's scattered around the average at pretty much every point to me. She has a very low learning curve because by the time this graph starts at 20 games players are already capped out in terms of skill on Annie. The Delta between game 1 and 50 is unimportant because I guarantee you she has one of the smallest deltas between games 20 and 50.\n\nhttp://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/azir\n\nFor the record this is what a high mastery curve looks like.\n\nYou'd get a better idea of mastery by choosing a percent winrate increase and seeing how many games it took to reach that from the first game winrate. While I don't have acsess to the data to actually do this my guess would be that Annie would have one of the quickest growths in winrate out of any champion, which is what a learning curve actually is.\n\nWhat your delta increase is showing is the difficulty of playing a champ in the first game relative to the difficulty of playing them in the 50th game, it is ignoring the actual curve in-between and where it caps off. My guess would be that for Annie it would start to level off at around the 5th game.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2016-03-27T02:57:48.228+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"We do have our own data @_@\n\nAlso unless I'm reading that graph wrong, it also claims that Annie has over a 57% win rate, as the lowest her winrate on that curve ever gets to is ~56.5%","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-03-27T03:03:34.637+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"The graph isn't wrong, it starts at 20 games played. But what it does show is that by 20 games people have mastered Annie. That is an incredibly shallow learning curve. If you look at Azir's it continues to increase well past 20 games, all the way up to 100 games played. Other champs with steep learning curves like Syndra share these sorts of Azir like curves too while simpler champs like Sona who lack learning curves are more similar to Annie.\n\nYou just proved you aren't that great at stats though, because the first thing you should do when you see a graph is read the axis.\n\n>We do have our own data @_@\n\nYou don't make it public, so I can only counter argue with what I have.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2016-03-27T03:22:58.039+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ah okay I see what the graph is saying now.\n\nFeel free to compare it with the graphs of other Champions. You'll find that a curve that cuts off the first 20 games actually ends up leaving most mastery curves pretty flat (1-3%). I understand the statement that Annie has a high mastery curve compared to a lot of other champions sounds weird, and this is explicitly because of how easy it seems to pick her up (which is something that is really cool about her).\n\nI do find it funny you link Azir's. Yes he has an insane mastery curve - it causes all sorts of problems for him @_@. On a side note, look at Udyrs :). I remember FeralPony getting ridiculed for stating Udyr was a hard champ to master as well. It only gets steeper when you add in the 0-20 games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
