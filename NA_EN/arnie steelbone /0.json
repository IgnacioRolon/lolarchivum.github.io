The funny part is that fullscreen works fine it's just the windowed borderless. Like i said i never had problems with that and i don;t know where to start (obviously i updated my drivers right away when i saw what was happening) So please help because it looks ridiculous when this pc is running league with 20fps (i need the windowed borderless so i can alt tab out once in a while to check on stuff) So yeah.. Would appreciate any help! {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-17T03:20:07.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like League may not be running off your dedicated GPU, causing your FPS instability and low FPS.
