That's why it's a circle jerk to complain about assassins. Assassins quality is mobility, not 1 shot-ness. no one is as mobile as most assassins, but to complain about damage is a circle jerk when Caitlyn and Draven 1 shot auto attack people, and there are many better burst CC combos in the fighter or mage tree that have no counterplay for 100-0 damage. The only reason people notice assassin 1 shots, is because they get as fed as anyone else does, but then they have high incombat flashy mobility to use it, normally to kill a backline adc or support(the squishest people on the team.) Confusing this quality as being able to one shot verses mobility just means you circle jerk boards and don't really understand the game. \n\nThe way Assassins scale is also legitimately normally a joke. They don't 1 shot anything level 18 without becoming insanely fed. Their entire purpose is to win early-mid-game. Katarina literally buys TWO flat magic pen items, mejais, and gunblades, this is to win the game at under 20 minutes. She does 'high damage' early game, because she is itemizing the highest damage items early game possible, that fall off faster than any other stat in the game. Talon with his Lethality rushes is the exact same. You literally just buy cloth armor(or null mantle), and he has wasted 1100 gold to your 300, and he loses his entire early game power spike for nothing and you gain 5 armor for free. The counter play to assassins is the easiest one in the game. It's not uncommon for people to buy cloth armor(zhoyna) against Zed just right off the bat at the start of the game, and this shuts his ass down pretty well on just about anyone, because his early game sudden impact is shot, building duskblade into armor hurts, and then you get the fastest possible completed zhoyna. I have trouble thinking of a single assassin that isn't effected by early game armor itemization heavily, with the exception of master yi, the true damage assassin, but he is technically never '1shoting' anyone, he autos you down. Even then, armor is strong against his ass too.\n\nEvery role in the game has a '1 shot'.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2018-06-25T18:15:47.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Meanwhile you realize Wukong builds full lethality (aka ASSASSIN) while he was supposed to be a fighter.
