For your specific issue, try relaunching the client under Windows 7 Compatibility, which can be found by right clicking the lol icon and selecting the compatibility tab.

I recommend posting this at the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards to let the client devs know about this.  In the meantime, your best bet may be to return to the legacy client until then:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Svimeznaju","date":"2016-11-23T16:51:10.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a question regarding your answer: Where am I supposed to return to?\n\n I've been trying to use the old client like always, the one that was in use 2 weeks ago (I had to delete the game 2 weeks ago and am trying to reinstall and play but running into this issue) Is there anything else I should try?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-23T16:56:22.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Returning to that older client doesn't require a reinstall or rollback.  Navigate to the location you installed League, likely **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nIn this directory, or whichever directory you chose to install League of Legends, you should be able to find a client called **lol.launcher**.  \n\nIf the dimming is happening on the old patcher too, let the devs know at the mentioned boards as that would be an unusual issue then perform a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)to return to a fresh state.","replies":[{"poster":"Svimeznaju","date":"2016-11-23T17:01:48.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, this is happening on old patcher, I never tried out the new client because I had been absent from the game for 2 weeks.
