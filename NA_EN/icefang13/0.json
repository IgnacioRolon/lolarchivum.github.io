Based on the way they are written, &quot;Windspeaker- Your shields are 10% stronger&quot; and &quot;Runic- Bonus to shields on you&quot;, it implies that all shields should work, even self shielding. Is this intentional or a glitch? I tested both, and both individually and didn&#039;t get a bonus.\r\n\r\nAlso somewhat related, Perseverance is written as +50% bonus health regen (and 200% under 20% HP), but it only impacts base health regen, like healing beads do. Probably intended, but I could see how it could get confusing since you can increase your flat (flat but not base) health regen with runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot2BKiddinMe","date":"2015-11-12T05:20:24.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is messed up. I haven't played him yet but I got both of those masteries on him for that reason. I'm assuming it's a bug. Then again, you can tell how little thought they put into Urgot this patch. They might just not really care.","replies":[{"poster":"ICEFANG13","date":"2015-11-13T02:45:13.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read somewhere else that Morde isn't working corrected with Runic (along with others, unlisted), and that was unintentional, so hopefully Urgot is on the list of incorrect champs that need to be adjusted to.","replies":[]}]}]}
