Its the most problematic spell in his kit (besides his point and click Root) and has little use outside of organized team play. It may be because I'm unranked and only play normals, but I can't even count how many times players ignore my ultimate. Double goes for the enemy team, who just seem completely blind or oblivious to it.\n\nWhen he was first reworked with this ability, I loved it. I used it A LOT and I also played Ryze a lot (i spam normals, and with Ryze to avoid bans, I spammed Twisted Treeline to learn his combos and some mechanics) , so much so that he overtook my all time favorites in the enjoyment department ; Riven and Yasuo.\n\nNever before have I found champions in this game with whom I connected with his playstyle like I did with Ryze. You guys have really hit the nail on the head with his thematic, and I love it much more then the simple and basic \"Rune Mage\" theme you had originally designed him around. Being a \"rogue\" mage fits him in a much better light than previously.\n\nHowever, all of this being said, its really painful to play Ryze these days. I can take a losing lane and get positive creep score over my enemy, and in some cases, a KDA lead as well(Unranked games are really messy!) that can help me slingshot into late game at the mid game point. Despite my (personal opinion, i am obviously biased) skill with Ryze, and with my 6 years of laning experience, Ryze just doesn't feel worthy to play anymore. I can blame pro players for using him repeatedly in high level games and in the end, results in Ryze's nerfs, but its not their fault they they're trying to win.\n\nAnd tbh, Ryze's ultimate is one of the best abilities in the game to lead your team to victory. Despite my negative personal experiences with  it, the spell itself is a game changer, and I hope in the near future you remove it in favor of something else that can benefit Ryze more, on a personal level. \n\nAs it stands right now, his theme is dwarfed by his ultimate ; his personality and story claim he's a loner, roaming the lands dealing with World Runes and bringing peace (and sometimes strife as a result) to areas afflicted by the runes. He collects them, hoards them, and ultimately keeps them away from the evil champions(im assuming). He's also a loner, at this point in his life, he hates people and keeps them at arms length to protect them. In a twisted sort of way, he cares for all of them, deeply. \n\nObviously ,gameplay and thematics don't need to match up 100%...But the way I see it, there are two problems currently with Ryze ; His ultimate is too strong and game changing, and preferably needs to be changed into something else to fix his second problem of thematic dissonance.\n\nI hope you took the time to read this, and I apologize if it was too long and you didn't feel like reading it. You gave us some great feedback when you guys reworked Quinn and a lot of healthy communication, Please repeat that with Ryze. Theres a lot of ryze lovers out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1v1 Terror","date":"2018-04-17T19:01:20.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about remove this unbalancable ultimate and bring back desperate power.

The true dmg is actually huge since on lvl 13 if Syndra maxes W second she gets a bonus of 20% true damage and that hurts a lot. Ryze on the other hands gets 40 PERCENT on his Q on lvl 13 that scales up to 50% on lvl 18. It is harder to land it though with your W becoming a slow since you have to use the E proc with your Q if you want the extra damage. They also pretty much reverted the E dmg nerf to minions meaning that he can waveclear even better now since at the time of the nerf they buffed his E's base dmg by 20 on lvl 1.\nAnd people are complaining that his R is on a 5 min cooldown but they're forgetting that the range is increased to fucking 4000 units. That's 2250 extra range on lvl 6! You can actually just win a game off of getting a good early game skirmish on botlane.
