R should be made faster and more visible (like through fog of war), with maybe an ARAM-specific nerf as compensation.\n\nZac\n\n- Hard CC on 3 out of 4 spells, yet still retains higher than average damage for a tank \n- Same as Galio, punishes you too hard compared to the telegraphs he gives; landing E all but guarantees his ult \n- Doesn&#039;t feel particularly high in counterplay even though that was a goal of the rework (his Q needed to change but spammable, instant AoE % damage is completely fine?)\n\nprobably just needs nerfs\n\nRammus\n\nno idea how he actually is, to be frank. rammus players keep saying he&#039;s been neutered but I&#039;ve seen him completely wreck shit more than a few times\n\nMore tanks should be like Sion.","replies":[{"poster":"PePsiLemoNN","date":"2017-06-19T18:58:53.675+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cause you know , there is a chance we want different champions in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-06-19T23:11:07.174+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean I should delete my thread asking to rework every champ to Jinx in different outfits?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-06-19T23:12:46.988+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah.

That said he would need a pretty big buff to his q in order to justify a massive nerf like this. Something like the damage and slow on q would need to be changed. The slow amount and duration would need to scale with charge time, and the damage might need to start significantly higher at about half of a max charge and work it's way back up. (Remember Sion's q does 33% damage to minions so a max charge r1 q right now deals the same damage as a r1 e base damage.)\n\nBut for the most part, the q max is very defining to sion, and has significant windows of power. The only issue is how royally fucked he gets by champions with dashes, especially those whose dash puts them directly in top of or slightly behind sion where his q doesn't work. I think there should also be a small area of leeway around sion where units are knocked up anyway to prevent situations like these. \n\nI've been trying q max more lately and finding it's just as good as e max, although quite less reliable, and feel it should be somewhat more rewarding but in its current stance is fair and enjoyable.\n\nSion main,  M 7 500+ k mastery points.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-06-20T13:03:59.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed with the \"top close to hit\" problem with Sion's Q.
