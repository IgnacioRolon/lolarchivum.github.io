So, Riot restored reliability elsewhere on his kit,  his E. And then, when he actually gets to stick, all of those previous buffs (and items that he likes being buffed-- righteous, cinder, this is just as important as the creation of stoneplate) suddenly compounded to make him a monster right now. His niche has changed from anti caster to anti squishy.\r\n\r\nBut don&#039;t get all twisted. Cho needs that reliability in some form. His current state of power can be solved through simple numbers changes and down-tuning some of the buffs he&#039;s gotten.  He&#039;s not a problem champion, he&#039;s not a balance nightmare.
