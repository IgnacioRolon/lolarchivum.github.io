Making them strong options into more specific circumstances would IMO do them a lot of good, same goes for a big chunk of the roster that tends to get shuffled out of meta pretty easily for most of the same reasons.

Riven at least actively builds more AD than other bruisers, whereas Irelia builds full tank outside of Trinity Force and still one shots ADCs and has enough survivability to kill everyone else in 2.5 seconds. A fed Irelia seems to counter almost anyone whether she hits her stun or not, and her ult still has her old E syndrome where it forces you to choose between two terrible options(walk right into her or flash out, where she likely already Q'd you when you flashed, or you didn't have flash and you died anyways) and can 1v1 almost every other fed champion outside of probably Kai'Sa(because I think she has the best late game in the entire game now) while also having insane teamfighting potential with her ult, her very very good damage and tankiness.\n\nI personally think for her kit they should force her to build like an assassin by lowering bases/increasing scaling.
