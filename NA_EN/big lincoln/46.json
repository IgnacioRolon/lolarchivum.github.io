By contrast, life steal offers something that no marksman has innately, and that's sustain. The only marksman who ever had sustain was Kindred, and that was removed due to how well it worked for them in lane. Riot has specifically discouraged itemizing early for life steal because of how safe and passive it makes marksmen, but the very existence of those items allows marksmen to heal themselves back to full in a few seconds come late-game, something they would never be able to do otherwise, and in a manner that far exceeds even champions with innate healing and multiple items that enhance it. Even mage items, which aren't statistically as strong, provide these radically unique effects like stasis and even dashes. Meanwhile, the moment immobile melee champions are given an item that makes their weaknesses a little less glaring, the stuff gets abused by ranged and hypermobile classes who benefit from those effects practically just as much, in addition to the innate advantages they already have, forcing those items to then get nerfed (Sterak's Gage was nerfed into unpopularity largely because of how much it was abused by marksmen, for example).\n\nI agree with the basic idea that every champion should have significant weaknesses, and shouldn't be able to paper over them through itemization. However, the problem we have right now is that, on one hand, juggernauts have weaknesses that are often so extreme that it makes them outright dysfunctional, and on the other we have several other classes with many champions whose very kits have no strongly-defined tradeoffs, let alone after they purchase items that can cover whichever weaknesses they do have, e.g. marksmen purchasing lifesteal and resists in addition to tremendous amounts of damage in order to negate their own squishiness. Of course juggernauts aren't going to be competitively popular if they're one of the few subclasses that can be hard-countered in League, and of course marksmen are going to remain at the center of the game's meta when they bring more to the table than any other class without any major disadvantage. If League's meta hadn't been marksman-centric from the very beginning of competitive play, I don't think nearly as many people would agree to the way power and advantages are being distributed among classes today.","replies":[{"poster":"Aryador","date":"2017-08-20T15:57:59.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"while you make good points we already have very few items that do not work for melee or ranged champion.

Lethality is perhaps the most recent example, where the stat was exclusively designed for assassins, but when marksmen started abusing it, even to the point where Lethality had to be nerfed several times, the devs still chose to allow them to purchase assassin items in the name of build diversity. Similarly, melee-only restrictions would not prevent many assassins and light fighters from purchasing tanky items, and thus far the only way to truly dissuade them from going for bruiser builds is to nerf their bases and increase their scalings, which makes them more snowbally by dint of being far more item-dependent.\n\nOne of the big issues with itemization as it stands is that it offers practically everything melee champions have, except for hard CC, but does not give melee champions the option to go ranged (Rapid Firecannon provides a bonus that is both inconsistent and minimally effective to melee champions, and so doesn't quite count). It's very easy for a ranged champion to load up on health, resistances, movement speed, and so on, and in fact many ranged champions build those stats as part of their standard build, but it's impossible for a low-mobility champion to drastically increase their target access, and for many it's not possible to reasonably invest in stats like attack speed, crit, etc. because that would require committing heavily to an itemization path. Melee champions not only tend to have fewer unique advantages over ranged champions on their own kits, but also have fewer itemization options. When melee champions do, on very rare occasions, abuse items intended for ranged classes, e.g. Vi with BotRK way back when, they usually get knee-jerk nerfed and pushed into more narrow itemization paths. In the end, it really feels like there is a double standard at play between melee and ranged champions in how they're made to interact with itemization.","replies":[{"poster":"Aryador","date":"2017-08-21T05:06:23.589+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As i said : to hell with the veil of diversity. There isn't any. We have too many people number crunching and finding the meta build for every champion and then finding the other good options in case you might find yourself in a case where the meta build is not the best. And let's face it diversity is not something naturally positive or negative. In other words : diversity for diversity's sake is poison. Same with the continuous stream of champions.

You do not balance X class as you balance Y class. Because all of these have different expectation and thus standard. And all that balancing SHOULD include everything : runes, masteries, ITEMS, raw stats and spells's values.\n\nIs it that hard to understand that adc weaponry shouldn't be the same as the warriors or the assassins ? Dota does it to some degree by using a basic stat system, dawngate used to do it by giving different degree of ratio of attack speed, damage on autos and spell depending on the kind of character being played and I am pretty sure other games do it in an other manner too. League is the only one refusing to enforce a character identity.

In other words : diversity for diversity&#x27;s sake is poison.\n\nWhile I agree that forcing diversity to happen at a cost in overall game health is not a good idea, which is Riot has been discouraging certain champions from picking certain items (e.g. assassins and tanky items), diversity itself _is_ an inherently good thing. More diversity means less repetition, which means more replayability and less of a chance of burnout. Stagnancy in many aspect of League is frequently cited as a reason for burnout by many players, as they get tired of playing the same champions in the same positions with the same builds.\n\nFor the sake of the argument, let's assume that diversity is not worth encouraging, and thereby don't bother increasing it. The immediate issue this raises is that of itemization: systems like runes, masteries, summoner spells and items exist purely to give champions more options, or at least were created with that intention. If they don't add to diversity, they just add more power, plus a few common gameplay effects, and complicate balance exponentially. If you accept that champions don't need that kind of variance (and, let's face it, itemization has been made increasingly restricted to particular classes over time), then those systems need not exist. Either we have a League where diversity is important, which means these customization systems need to be overhauled in order to provide actual variety, or we have a League where diversity isn't worth it, and we might as well stick common features directly onto champion kits and stop giving them the illusion of choice through items and the like.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Aryador,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G903LBxh,comment-id=002a000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-21T05:06:23.589+0000)\n> \n> But on your second paragraph i will have to disagree with your idea : Yes there is a double standard.

What I am saying is that many marksmen and even some mages are allowed to overstep their own limitations and do things they shouldn't be doing, much of it with Riot's blessing, but the same has not been done for melee champions, who are much more heavily limited. It is not a defining characteristic of marksmen or mages to have more itemization options, and in fact it is fighters who should be having the greatest degree of choice, as they're meant to dip into both tanky and damage itemization. What we are experiencing, however, is the reverse, which is why I think this is a double standard that need not exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Aryador","date":"2017-08-21T19:49:12.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stand by the fact that league provided false choices since it's inception only changing what the false choice is from time to time. If you want to create actual choices you need every champion to be strong enough without items and the item to be extras that add to the game-play rather then just majorly stats increase. I rather have 3 choices then a plethora of fake ones. Diversity is not in itself positive sorry. It just forces us to number crunch and once it's done the puzzled is solved yay.\n\n\nYou were speaking about a double standard of treatment instead of different standard of approach done by class. My bad. However i will disagree with you simply because of what the past has shown us. we see is that adc are actually dependent of a lot of things...Remember the ad 2017 meme ? Because they were, in a way, not allowed to play. And life steal alone does not explain their durability. this is the culmination of many factors : death dance + phantom dancer + peeling support + peeling item + sometimes a peeling jungle + sometimes a peeling mid. Left alone without any peel those adc are not that durable....I know it because I play it and I quite easily end up as food for the crows if left alone. So I disagree on the idea of lifesteal or lethality being the source of the problem. For your point of view you may consider it, at best, as a part of it but not as the main culprit.\n\nSo while I agree that adc shouldn't be about burst this only shows a glaring problem of league as a whole : the amount of dmg across the board is too damn high. Because in order for them to be the top dog in dps when they have to compete with something like a cassio or a ryze you have to admit that the bar is already set quite high who are already at the point of burst per second so ofc they have to do even more. And how is the reverse happening ? I mean if you have the \"choice\" (nice veil isn't it ? : D) you have more options period. In fact unless we're speaking heavy crit build all the items the adc use can be used by the fighters with varying degree of efficiency. They have \" privileged access to both life steal and lethality \" ? How is it privileged for adc to have access to life steal ?  I can understand lethality but life steal ? what the fuck man.

It just forces us to number crunch and once it&#x27;s done the puzzled is solved yay.\n\nI don't think we're actually disagreeing by that much here. I agree that League's itemization is fundamentally conducive to false choices, doesn't bring about diversity, and never truly achieved it even when it was created, despite the best intentions. Every iteration of runes, masteries and itemization has devolved into a solved game, and this is bound to happen as long as you introduce effects specifically meant to synergize with some champions better than others. No truly diverse system should ever require you to number crunch in order to find the \"optimal\" build, and a single, static notion of optimality is antithetical to diversity, as a diverse environment would make different builds become optimal in different, about equally and concurrently possible situations. Therefore, any system that aims for diversity, but also sets out to make some choices inherently more valid than others, is doomed to fail.\n\nI completely agree with you, I would rather have just two equally valid choices, or no choice at all, than a large series of options where only one is worth picking. Personally, I think this might mean ditching itemization, runes and summoner spells as we know them, and coming up with an alternative mode of customization, but that's certainly not a suggestion most players would be inclined to agree with. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Aryador,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G903LBxh,comment-id=002a00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-21T19:49:12.787+0000)\n> \n> Remember the ad 2017 meme ? \n\nThis is not fully relevant to the main point, but I think the whole \"ADC in 2k17\" meme is complete bullshit. Even when that was in full force, _marksmen were still being picked in practically every match, on both teams_, and the only instance where they were threatened was by the occasional appearance of Ziggs  in bot lane. Sure, they died quickly, but at no point did marksmen players at large even try to compensate by itemizing more defensively, in spite of the plethora of options at their disposal, and at the end of the day they were still important enough to be considered mandatory. Players immediately complained without trying to adapt, and before they could Riot swooped in with large buffs to marksman items, which may have appeased a portion of the playerbase, but generated an environment that is now much less pleasant for everyone else involved. We are at a point where marksman builds are cheaper than mage builds, meaning marksmen now scale faster _and_ harder than most other classes in the game, and end up laying down damage per second that rivals, and sometimes even exceeds, that of dedicated burst classes, all with far more safety and reliability. \"ADC in 2k17\" was the cry of a playerbase used to playing an extremely privileged class, afraid of losing even the slightest amount of those privileges.\n\nIt feels weird to talk about privilege within the context of a videogame, as classes are picked mostly by choice and there's none of the violence and historical context that comes with real-world privilege, but I do still think that, within the context of League, marksmen are a privileged class. They are one of the two classes in the game to be considered mandatory to every team, the other one being the support, a class that is practically designed to cater to them (e.g. Janna giving AD, a bonus that makes no sense within the context of her own kit, or that of most champions). In a game environment where non-marksmen have received massive nerfs, even heavy reworks, because their power was considered too reliable, marksmen continue to be able to output the highest damage in the game via autoattacks, which a) cannot miss, b) have very little downtime, and c) cost no resources to apply with only some situational exceptions. Bot lane is heavily protected to ensure only they get to take up the carry position, but they have been allowed, even encouraged, to take up literally every other role in the game, including support. \n\nWhereas champions now are being aggressively discouraged from picking stats that don't conform to their class, marksmen have good access to practically every stat except health, on top of their own dedicated itemization, and often without even having to compromise on their damage (notice how items like BT, Maw of Malmortius, Mercurial Scimitar, Guardian Angel, etc. all give 40+ AD). Even items _made for other classes_, i.e. Knight's Vow, Ardent Censer, Zeke's Convergence, etc. are designed specifically with marksmen in mind, and only marksmen. At this point the game really does revolve around marksmen, and has been doing so for most of its lifespan now, to the detriment of diversity that has been very easily achievable in other MOBAs, such as HotS or Dota 2, where members of all classes can carry. Whereas initially the prevalence of marksmen arose naturally, it has now been enforced by design, and has been taken to such over-the-top levels, e.g. currently with supports being forced to give most of their power to the marksman, that it has made the game significantly less enjoyable for many players.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Aryador,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G903LBxh,comment-id=002a00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-21T19:49:12.787+0000)\n> \n> So while I agree that adc shouldn&#x27;t be about burst this only shows a glaring problem of league as a whole : the amount of dmg across the board is too damn high.\n\nI agree with this, but a) marksman damage is a contributing factor to this, and not merely a symptom, and b) having an environment where damage is too high does not excuse marksmen, a damage-over-time class, to be able to apply more burst than actual burst champions, and do so continuously. This is not an exaggeration, by the way, as looking at Twitch or Draven's performances frequently shows them bursting enemies down in a few hits, and in Twitch's case doing so to multiple enemies at once. There has been an amount of damage creep, but marksmen have benefited the most from it, as mages had their total AP reduced in favor of better access to CDR, assassins got reworked specifically to have more delayed burst and greater difficulty, and tanks had their main source of itemized damage, i.e. Sunfire Cape, completely slashed. By contrast, marksmen received only a minor nerf to the attack speed they could build, but instead got more AD _and_ crit, in addition to plenty more defensive options, including damage reduction, plus a 30% CDR item for casters. When toning down the amount of damage in the game, marksmen should be the first class to have their own DPS deflated, and so by a _lot_.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Aryador,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G903LBxh,comment-id=002a00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-21T19:49:12.787+0000)\n> \n> How is it privileged for adc to have access to life steal ?  I can understand lethality but life steal ? what the fuck man. Everytime you start to make sense you derails into going a bit too far....\n\nLife steal is a stat that provides sustain, which is a form of durability. As a class, marksmen are defined as squishy ranged damage-dealers, meaning that once they start taking damage, they should not be able to survive much of it. As a result, they are also given no innate sustain, because that would make them more durable. However, life steal means that they can heal out some of the damage they take with every autoattack. Not only does this directly contradict one of their few core weaknesses, as they're meant to be squishy and this makes them more durable, but in addition life steal is also currently the most powerful source of sustain in the game, exceeding even that of most enchanters. \n\nWhen a champion gets to heal for large amounts over time, they become a drain tank, which is supposed to be the domain of champions like Vladimir and Warwick, and has been heavily controlled on them due to how snowbally it can be (if you can heal more damage per second than you receive, you cannot die). Effectively, marksmen not only have the best damage in the game, but are also exceptionally durable over time, due to how they can heal for literal hundreds of health every second at no cost. You could say that they're vulnerable to burst, but this is directly countered by features like BT's shield, GA's resurrect, the damage reduction on DD and PD, and so on, to only count effects directly under the marksman's control, and not the many shields, heals and other forms of protection and peel supports dump onto them with their kits and items. Life steal is not a stat marksmen should have, because it makes them significantly harder to kill, and it is this uncontrolled, hyper-snowbally sustain that has in part contributed to damage creep, because burst champions need to be even burstier if they want to have a chance of killing a member of a class capable of negating a large portion of their damage output every second.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Noblewind","date":"2017-08-20T06:49:54.853+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly in a couple of years attending these boards on a near daily basis, I have yet to see a discussion made by marksman players saying what melee champs should or shouldn't have.
