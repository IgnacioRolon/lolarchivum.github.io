I want to say it should ground, but exempt abilities that allow you to ignore CC so that he can still be countered by Vi, Malphite etc, but that&#039;s a little iffy \r\n\r\nwhat u think","replies":[{"poster":"doublelift fg","date":"2017-01-31T22:40:46.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his wall should create ghosts of enemy team that hit for 0.5*karthus's Q damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"badooga","date":"2017-01-31T22:39:28.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea, although I wouldn't want to change him too much. All they need to do is make Karthus steals (a portion of) the MR that his wall shreds, giving him a bit more beefiness in trades versus some of the more hard-hitting AP mids out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheFallenShaw","date":"2017-01-31T22:38:53.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He'd be alot easyer to play.

They would be drawn toward Karthus, like a lesser version of Diana's E.  It was scrapped because no one would risk interacting with it, ever.  I think it's too broken of an idea.","replies":[]}]}
