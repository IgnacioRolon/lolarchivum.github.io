Going Titanic Hydra is possible, yes, but aside from that, there are few options that increases the damage you want him to have with the tankiness he should be.\n\nDoes that make any sense? I am just throwing this out there. An issue I had when I first tried him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kilanost","date":"2017-04-24T03:09:57.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its the lack of control on the W","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-04-24T02:33:11.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a global dash for his team, 2 MORE long range dashes as if that wasnt enough, Thresh Q, and enough damage to 100-0 anyone with 1 skill.

If you need to survive burst and remount, then going Death's Dance is a good place to start. Against something tanky? Black cleaver. Sometimes you want burst and waveclear, so you rush Tiamat. BoRK is good when you'll need to help take down high-hp targets.\n\nYou can build anything as Kled, I swear, but the right tools are based on the enemy comp. Personally, I only take one lifesteal item, and often end up with something that looks like {{item:3071}}, {{item:3748}}, {{item:3812}}, {{item:3053}}, {{item:3046}}, and your choice of boots.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"desertcroc","date":"2017-04-24T06:03:40.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play him from time to time to see the salt in chat from people who think he's op, its funny to respond with one of his quotes and watch them get angry","replies":[]}]}
