The E base damage is a little random, but acceptable. \r\n\r\nWhat confuses me is the ultimate change; this is entirely out of the blue. Are you trying to encourage AD Mordekaiser? Why is his AP-tank build not approved of, and will there be further changes that make his AD playstyle the superior one, even if he lacks the incentive of itemization for it as opposed to what items like Rylai offer? \r\n\r\nFurther, do you plan on addressing the most complained-about gripes, namely his abysmal base stats and the current state of Harvesters of Sorrow?","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2015-12-10T23:35:14.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just made his ult a  more hybrid ability","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-12-10T23:55:17.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does he really invest in AD right now, though?\n\nthe only item I can think of that most Mords will grab is Gunblade, and that's, what 40?","replies":[{"poster":"OmegaTree119","date":"2015-12-11T00:57:08.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mallet, Black cleaver and Tri force Are some other examples.

Odds are though that not all of that change list will ship, we're trying a few things to see what delivers best. As far as the ult change goes we do want Morde to feel rewarded for choosing to use some AD items, so are looking at mechanics that support doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2015-12-11T02:02:34.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buff to decay rate is a must have","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-12-11T01:32:36.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright, i'm interested to see what you guys have planned for him\n\nI'd really like to enjoy playing him again :(","replies":[]}]}]}
