He's a one trick pony.\n4. Yes, I know you can catch him, but he has his both Ghost and his R ready, he's going to slip away again.\n5. Oh hey, he tossed you over that wall. Ready to give up and... did you seriously just Flash back over?!\n6. Okay, congrats, you blew everything to catch him, he's at 12% HP, he can't possibly esca- oh look, their jungler is here!\n7. And now you're dead. And he's spamming /laugh over your corpse and dancing.\n\nBut wait - what about the dreaded \"Proxy Singed\"? How do you deal with that? Glad you asked.\n\n1. Counter pick him. Lots of common top laners have the damage, mobility, range, and/or CC to kill him if he proxies.\n2. You picked... someone who doesn't counter him. Yeah, no, that's fine. Play the champs you love. We can manage.\n3. So while Singed runs around behind your tower farming, ask the jungler to help push the lane and take HIS tower.\n4. Congrats, you won the lane, go gank mid a bunch, steal enemy jungle buff, et cetera.\n5. Singed is still farming behind your tower? Ward against ganks and ask your jungler to push again, taking the next tower.\n6. Great job, you've got 2 towers, several kills or assists against mid lane, and roughly equal minion farm. Nice work.\n7. Wait, what? Goddamn it! Bot lane fed the enemy Vayne, blamed the jungler for not babysitting them, and ragequit.
