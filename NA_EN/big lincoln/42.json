Unfortunately early game, Zed can outpush him, and Swain will have a hard time farming. And he can't afford to rush Zhonya, Rod of Ages is absolutely necessary for Swain to allow him to scale into the game.\n\nHowever, if you manage to get into the late game, then Swain will shit hard into Zed.\n\nThat's the problem with Zed, so many champions have the potential to beat him, but they can't lane against him. I wouldn't recommend picking Swain into Zed. The two very few champions that can survive lane against Zed - and counter him - are Kayle and Vladimir.","replies":[{"poster":"Nunya Bezwacks","date":"2015-11-24T03:09:43.252+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah....late game...the point which the game never gets to anymore...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-11-24T01:10:00.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Swain can kill waves really fast post-6?

As a Swain main for quite awhile I can say a few things about the champ.\n\nFirst of all, he can be countered by other mages, or a good Assassin player that knows when to all in. Lux, Syndra, Annie, Brand, Veigar,basically any mage that has serious burst potential can beat Swain in lane. Swain basically NEEDS to land Nevermore or he won't get a kill, as opposed to all of the champs I mentioned above that have a MUCH easier time landing a snare. If you know how to lane against Swain, you know to dodge the snare, and you also know it has a ridiculous long CD (18 seconds at level 1) and it is his last ability to get leveled up. So basically he has it at level 1 for the majority of the game, he can't afford to level it and miss out on his DoT. \n\nSwain needs to snowball in order to be effective late game. All of Swains damage is DoT, which is useless late game when other champs are dealing out 1500 damage a second on crits and spells if Swain is not already snowballed. No sense being about to do 1500 damage, over 6 seconds....most team fights don't even last that long. Only thing Swain has going for him is his sustain, but again if he's not crazy snowballed, new ADC's and masteries (looking at executioners) can just tear him apart.\n\nI rarely, if ever see Swain being played, so I have no idea what Riot is thinking with this nerf. If anything I thought Swain would get some buffs because of the lack of mana potions; also for the fact he has a hard time CSing considering he has one of the lowest base damages in the game. You basically have to take AD runes to help with his CSing if you are not the best at doing so.
