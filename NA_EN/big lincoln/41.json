{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-10-02T19:54:11.262+0000","title":"riven's rework is already said to be very experimental and they're willing to take it down","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":144,"down_votes":13,"body":"because her mains don&#039;t like the change, even if it&#039;s a potential buff to those who have mastered her with the damage increase and non-execute ultimate\r\n\r\nin the time i&#039;ve been playing this game (around shortly after Jinx&#039;s release), i have not seen the same courtesy shown to other reworks, except for Lee Sin.  (of course)\r\n\r\nCassiopeia players hated the rework that completely altered what she was. All they asked for was a grace period on her E&#039;s reset to make her combo smoother; what they got was an unwanted rework that turned her into this awkward, time-based carry. A myriad of poor design decisions were forced into her kit while overloading the hell out of one ability so that she&#039;d be &quot;functional.&quot; Before, she was able to at least play somewhat flexibly; Q max was a viable option, and her E spam was, too. Riot decided to neuter her poisons in favor of making her E completely central to how she plays, failing to realize that, from what I&#039;ve seen, most players would have MUCH preferred her being THE premier DoT mage, someone who can really satisfy that theme of a poisoner. Riot did much worse than not keep up with player concerns; they _lied_ about saying they would, and then the man notorious for it now, Stashu, disappears for months at a time. After a brief period of being too strong, she is now both bland AND undertuned.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser mains protested the drastic changes that completely alter how he plays and feels. All of the experience previously mounted up is gone; you can no longer play him in solo lane without being a detriment to your team. His skill maxing order has been made less diverse, his build path is less interesting (build tank or die) and he is no less frustrating for others to play against as evidenced by the constant complaints about how strong he is. He is now a shell of his former self who can&#039;t even enjoy a game in the pro scene because the one ability he&#039;s centered around using for damage is ridiculously overtuned at the cost of the others (notice a trend?). Riot ignored all criticism regarding it and it took _weeks_ before the person who spearheaded it even bothered to reply to complaints. Currently, Riot has not announced any future plans to satisfy the people who prefer his old, much more varied playstyle.\r\n\r\nJust because a champ is unpopular doesn&#039;t mean that you should feel welcome to throw their rare but beloved designs out the window in favor of some grand vision that will magically raise their play rate (the exception being extremely archaic designs that have proven to be genuinely bad for the game -- Warwick is sad you shelved him). Please don&#039;t rework them in ways that are the exact opposite of what their communities ask for, then refuse to change more popular champions because they have a larger group to flood Reddit and Boards with.","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-10-02T19:55:27.425+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":17,"body":"To be fair they already said these were experimental changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-10-02T19:56:31.448+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":4,"body":"why aren't more drastic changes experimental?\n\nwhy do Mord and Cass players have to lick Riot's boots for the tiniest amount of information and still get radio silence?\n\nalso sorry for the timing on your post and me editing the title","replies":[{"poster":"SeductiveGrandpa","date":"2015-10-02T22:38:39.254+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":16,"body":">why do Mord and Cass players have to lick Riot's boots for the tiniest amount of information and still get radio silence?\n\nI have the strangest feeling that this will be the complaint reason for every new rework now...yikes...\n\nwell if we're gonna be serious, the PBE/Live Boards has a bad habit of cheering on something and it comes completely broken on release, I mean as a company I feel Rito shouldn't have to listen to the community on every single thing/release, criticism is good but really they should be able to release something without having to listen to the community on every single thing. I'm going to take an assumption here and believe that these two reworks were done as Rito trying out something new, ya know a fresh change to the normal formula of just reworking a champ to work better in its position (like new minigun ashe and her no longer useless passive) and since the boards usually complain about things that work out well, maybe they just took the chance that it would be good. \n\nIts not like the champ was destroyed, IMO, Mordes always been annoying and stupid gameplay wise(Sorry cass too, but I really just hate DoT champs) But the reason I wrote this was to point out that Riot has stated multiple times that they have a system where they work on multiple things instead of everything at once so they can have more things out frequently. I mean they just cant drop all their work and fix Cass/Morde and whose to say that will even make everyone happy about those two again? If the community says: \"This re-rework failed again!\" and the board circle jerks complaints again, they'll just start an annoying and time wasting loop.

The response to that rework was extremely negative, because in all honestly, it was probably the single worst designed rework Riot ever had the audacity to put before us. Even people who hated Lee jumped on that as being a stupid idea. Scrapping huge amounts of ability damage and early game potential in favor of shifting his gameplay around his passive in the late game, which is arguably the single most boring part of his design and also the least-supported part of his design as the game goes on. It's like Cassiopeia's rework shifting all of her damage to her E, except that Cassiopeia was at least slightly E-centric before her rework. Lee's rework made an active attempt to kick everything he had to the curb in favor of autoattacking with a shitty steroid. That was legitimately terrible, and it really was almost universally hated.\n\nDropping Lee's rework was one of the best things Riot ever did in terms of listening to its community, and my only regret from it was that they apparently forgot that lesson and started dismissing feedback again on later reworks. They should be doing what they did with Lee more. They should be paying more attention and trying harder to create designs around what players want, instead of making designs and then trying to force players to like them..","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-10-03T00:07:40.321+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i just looked it up to see if my memory was right -- it wasn't\n\ni am glad they didn't go through with that, jeez","replies":[{"poster":"HAIL WHYDRA","date":"2015-10-03T14:55:20.822+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"CertainlyT should have done the change to riven so that it goes though no matter how the community feels.\n\n\nKappaNotkappa","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-10-02T21:01:50.035+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":12,"body":"That's probably because riven players are like oppressed third class citizens in game and on the boards, and people default to making statements that are 'attacks on them as a person' as the go to thing to say to a riven player.","replies":[{"poster":"Blade of Justic","date":"2015-10-02T21:05:09.822+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Sword Saint,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OIg7f9Vu,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-10-02T21:01:50.035+0000)\n>\n> That's probably because riven players are like oppressed third class citizens in game and on the boards, and people default to making statements that are 'attacks on them as a person' as the go to thing to say to a riven player.\n\nYa, um...\n\nPretty sure no one is oppressed on this forum.\n\nThe mods will make sure that everyone is allowed their opinion as long as it doesn't break rules.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-10-02T21:29:56.151+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":7,"body":"Mods won't stop riven players from getting mass downvoted purely by association, nor will the step in and delete large amounts of passive aggressive comments and posts that are always being thrown around.

It was mostly a trade between high burst full-AP or sustained damage tankier AP. Mordekaiser lost the ability to max his spells differently, because there is, really, only one spell that ends up being worth its cost early on -- his Q. No longer can he max his W for defensive lanes and extensive trades, nor E for lanes to poke in. That alone works counterproductive to Riot's ideal 'diversity' that they like to preach about while forgetting about practicing it. You get one good choice of support for him - engage. That's it. Either you pick someone who can engage if Mordekaiser is locked in first, or you don't pick Mordekaiser if your support locked in Karma or Soraka. \n\nSecond, and I'll include another quote in here,\n\n>Building/balancing a tank/mage/AD fighter? Now you have 3x as many items to keep track off, and you have to make sure that each build is both not broken AND also still viable.\n\nLet's count, off the top of my head, how many champions have multiple build paths and, much like Mordekaiser, either weren't problematic or are no longer issues.\n\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:154}} \n\nMany of these champions offer multiple builds, whether it be as damage dealers or tanks. Malzahar and Kog'Maw have both AD and AP builds; a lot of these guys' AP off-builds give them high burst, and they still have justifiable (or superior) AD builds. I've seen nobody complaining about these (most of the time.) Balancing champions for one role and only giving them the capability to run one build is the reason that we get stagnant metas with nothing but stat checks and RNG-ruled bot lanes. \n\n>What you want to do is NOT just focus on those who main that champ but the entire fan base as a whole, which frankly they just don't do. Face it, the mains get the bigger say in how reworks/balances are accomplished or not.\n\n{{champion:69}} mains got no say.\n\n{{champion:45}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:43}} , and only Veigar's was justifiable after numerous compensation buffs to bring him up to par.\n\nNo, you shouldn't focus on this degenerate majority fan base. Because they'll pick that champion up after seeing a shiny new rework, play them for maybe a week, and if they aren't mind-bogglingly overpowered, they'll be dropped, leaving this champion with an uninterested fan base and, generally, with many of the players who used to main them moving on to someone else. \n\nBut please, do tell me how these reworks were for the best. I'm really interested in how Mordekaiser became a much healthier, more interesting champion with his kit losing its synergy with itself in favor of a gimmicky 3-hit ability and losing many of the versatile skill-max and build options he once had.\n\n>annnnnnnnnnddddddd downvote\n\nCool.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-10-02T19:57:15.243+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"They said they were experimental days before they hit the pbe - they were declared experimental at the very first time anyone knew about it at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2015-10-03T19:18:26.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Anyone else feel like the complaints about cass are really dumb","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Hammerlock","date":"2015-10-03T00:06:11.592+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i like the riven change (not a riven main btw don't even own her)\nwhy?\nit rewards riven players for using there abilities wisely and autoing in between and now punishes those who roll there face on the keyboard to get a triple kill\n\nalthough boxbox said it will make her more annoying to play against","replies":[]},{"poster":"ApexInTheCircle","date":"2015-10-02T22:21:28.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"My only issue with (most) Riven players, is the bad attitude they bring into game with them.
