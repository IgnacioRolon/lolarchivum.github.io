Only good if the odds are good and if you already have redemption and locket\n\nAt the end of the day utility scaling is a mistake, and riot balanced janna around it after buffing her 2 or 3 times=? after the changes, then a set of 3 or 4 nerfs\n\ni wouldn't mind having old janna that didn't need any items\n\n-gH","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heckin Support","date":"2017-04-09T22:51:13.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elikain,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cHbd72vm,comment-id=00050003,timestamp=2017-04-09T12:22:47.790+0000)\n\n> Mejai&#x27;s is supposed to be in here because if Janna herself is not dying but is getting assists, she can easily stack up AP without even investing gold in it.

Even if you're ahead, it's so much better to buy redemption, locket, censor, boots, sightstone, almost anything else. Janna isn't meant to be a mage support like Lulu or Sona and build items like Mejai's or Athenes, items like locket, redemption, censor, mikeals, etc are so much better.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-04-10T12:29:48.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mejai's is an item that is supposed to help champions who want AP but don't have the gold to invest in actual AP items. Buying AP on her isn't terrible. The thing is, you'd only use that AP for more shields/AD or your ult for the heal. Her Q or W aren't that much important, considering that her W can get a bit more slow on the enemy, a bit more MS for you and her Q is mainly used as a disruption tool, not for waveclear or damage. Janna isn't a mage but an Enchanter who scales off AP. There really isn't an AP build for Janna, just these two items that synergize with her kit naturally.\n\nYou'd probably go with more AP if the enemy has more single target damage while you'd go for more utility oriented builds if there's more AoE in the enemy team. Even with my proposed Mejai's + Ardent, you wouldn't rush either. You'd first buy a Dark Seal to see if you can keep your stacks at 10 and then you'd normally go for Sightstone and whatever your team needs first. Ardent Censer is probably 4th+ item, to give a bit more stats to champions who already have decent items.\n\nThis means it's not delaying your core items at all nor is it replacing them. Redemption and Locket still have room to be built even if Mejai's and Censer are in your inventory.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-04-09T03:18:44.619+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post is good.
