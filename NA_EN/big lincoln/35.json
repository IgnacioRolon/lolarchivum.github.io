Where are you at, it&#x27;s 99% at max rank.\n\nIt's 95% at max rank for the final second of the ability. It's only 35% for the first second. The average slow it does is (35% + 50% + 65% + 80% + 95%)/5 = 65%. HOWEVER, movement speed slows diminish when they get strong enough. The absolute lowest movement speed it's possible to achieve outside of things that simply prevent movement is 110.\n\nLet's take your example of 400 MS and see what the true average slow is over the duration of Wither. For the first second, movement speed is slowed by 35%, resulting in 260 for the first second. For the second second, movement speed is slowed by 50%, resulting in 200 MS for the second second. For the third second, movement speed is slowed by 65%, resulting in uh oh. Movement speed is reduced below 180, so a new formula is introduced. The would-be MS is halved, and then gets added to 110. So, for the third second, MS would be 140/2 + 110, which is 180. That is a 55% slow instead of 65%. Let's see what happens on second four. 400 reduced by 80% is 80. 80/2 + 110 is 150, meaning a 62.5% slow. And, finally, for the fifth second, 400 reduced by 95% is 20. 20/2 + 110 is 130, meaning a 70% slow.\n\nAveraged out, Wither slowed for (35% + 50% + 55% + 62.5% + 70%)/5 = 54.5% slow.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"arghilost","date":"2017-07-07T03:43:31.031+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"its his last maxed spell and not even relevant in most games, not sure you've ever played nasus in high elo.

If anything he just needs slow resist somewhere in his kit so he isn't \"required\" to take Stormraider's to avoid getting kited to death by the absurd amount of random slows or an inherent Phage passive in his kit.\n\nNasus's problem is definitely not his damage. It's the fact his overall game plan is significantly inferior to the other juggernauts. The other main juggernauts (Illaoi, Darius, hell even Voli) are all much more early game centric and transition into excellent teamfighters once late game comes around. Nasus has a VERY match up dependent early game, a VERY good mid game if he doesn't get shitstomped, and a bad late game ONLY because he can never actually utilize his stacks on a moving target since the only thing he can actually hit in teamfights are tanks which take next to no damage from him since they all stack armor naturally, have Ninja Tabis (a big bonerkiller for Siphoning Strike), and Nasus simply doesn't do enough damage to do anything about it.\n\nI have a few suggestions that MIGHT help with Nasus. We can go with some sort of slow resist or move speed boost in his kit if they want Nasus to actually stand a chance at hitting ranged champions or we can go down route B and make him actually deal with things he can hit. In order to deal with tanks we have 2 solutions that might help out. Solution 1 is give him a Trundle like effect on his ult instead of what he has now where he just starts taking their stats instead of gaining some of his own. It would obviously be WORSE than Trundle ult on the steal (since it is AoE), but it would make him a better teamfighter overall and let him actually damage a tank without a Last Whisper. Another option is to give his Q the Mundo Q mechanic in some manner. It would still stack like normal, but it would also stack a %max health damage part on it and it would choose the larger of the 2 numbers on it when hitting someone. It would still get reduced by armor, but it would at least let him dent tanks a bit (while probably only using the flat on monsters since adding a 400 damage cap like other spells would simply do worse than whatever the flat would be).","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-07T05:19:49.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for the write up\n\nim partial to letting him hurt tanks, I think that should be a juggernaut staple","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2017-07-06T20:54:37.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I think his insane lifesteal passive has more to do with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-06T20:57:25.315+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"necessary for him to survive laning and scale.\n\ni would like his healing to scale directly with stacks so that it's target agnostic sustain but having healing is necessary if you want his early to actually be weak","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2017-07-07T00:30:52.468+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could increase his health regeneration, then scrap that passive and give him a more interesting passive.

Currently, due to how resistances and the items/masteries that offer them  have been nerfed, Nasus gets outscaled by other champs in both those departments. That is unfair, considering the terrible price you have to pay early for using him \n\n\nAll in all, buff his dueling power(%arm pen) and leave him weak in teamfights as he already is for game health reasons. It would be great if we at least had a jugg that scales into a duelist hypercarry and not so well in teamfights like the rest of them","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Archon Adagio","date":"2017-07-07T10:51:33.216+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"kek nerf wither? its the only thing keeping him in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-07-06T19:38:15.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would making it a small AoE work?

While passive it could give some sort of buff like increased Q range, increased move speed after Q'ing or something else (help with ideas here). \n\n3. Now for the active portion it can only be activated when someone is hit by Nasus E which would then mark them for X seconds for his W. \nWhen W is activated if only a single enemy was hit they could get hit with a slow similar to the one he has now (or possibly a root or stronger slow?), and if it's multiple people the slow gets weaker per x person but hits all of them.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention when activated the passive part would not apply\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2017-07-06T21:27:03.768+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea.
