What he offers are two CCs and an execute with a smidge of AoE damage. He is not an initiator; in fights he plays reactionary, either for peeling or for follow up after the primary tank. He is incredibly good at killing squishy champions, but struggles against tanks due to not building any damage items or penetration. He falls off hard late game. \n\nFrom playing him endlessly the past two weeks, these are the problems I think should be addresses either in his VGU or in whatever small changes he&#039;ll get soon.\n\nPoor allocation of power. At the moment almost all of his damage budget is tied to his execute, and his ultimate suffers for it. E and R feel very bland and not satisfying.\n\nSeason 7 jungle. Volibear has trouble keeping up thanks to these new camps, which is the biggest reason he&#039;s actually weak right now.\n\nToo simple. It&#039;s impressive that Riot made a champion that manages to be more simple than Garen. His skill cap is his skill floor; there&#039;s no tricks to him beyond flash Q.\n\nDependence on snowballing. Kind of obvious for any stat heavy champion, Volibear is horrible if he falls behind early \n\nLack of specialty. Volibear does not excel at anything; his best claim is being able to kill squishes at low health but Darius can turn his execute into a steroid and carry a teamfight. He has no real niche and only becomes popular when his stats are stronger than his competition.\n\nRelative to other juggernauts, what does Volibear offer? Not much. He has the worst time of them in dealing with tanks, others can kill squishes just as easily or easier, and Trundle, Nasus, Darius can all peel for teammates from further than melee range. His sustain is the easiest to deny, too. His peeling is fairly good, though, and with CDR he can spam his flip fairly frequently. He is also the one most dependent on snowballing to stay relevant into mid game.\n\nI would like to see Riot shift power out of W and into his ultimate and passive, and open up some offensive items to him so that he can be more of a fighter than a secondary tank. He will probably need larger changes; if he needs a new role in his rework, I wouldn&#039;t mind him being a little more utilitarian and team oriented, given that he currently doesn&#039;t play as selfishly as a Darius or Illaoi would. Someone to pick if youd like to be a little more of a team player while still being able to carry.\n\nInterested to hear what you guys think or would like to see Volibear get.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2017-03-16T21:47:01.499+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Glad to see some passionate Voli players out there and great feedback! Currently I am planning to experiment with some satisfaction upgrades/light buffs to his ultimate on PBE very soon. \n\nLive Gameplay works on a lot of stuff at a time and a large scope project for Volibear isn't heavily prioritized over other things right now unfortunately. That said, I feel that there are some easy changes we could make to make his R moments feel a lot cooler with minimal power increase. \n\nIf we did do larger scope work on him, I believe we would try to push him more into a juggernaut territory and re-tune his damages/tankiness around that direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-16T22:20:14.558+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm incredibly passionate for all Juggernauts.

If you're just looking at his ult, maybe give it some way to hit tanks a little harder? He has trouble fighting other front liners; even just a small amount of % current health damage would do wonders for him. \n\nPart of what I like about Illaoi/Darius and why I consider them to be the best designs of the group are that they actively reward you for playing aggressively with good healing and a lot of damage (Olaf is a close runner up). Volibear and Garen, and Mundo, don't really give that same satisfaction with their healing, and I find myself dying before the heal is even halfway over late game. Possibly, make the duration of the heal scale down with levels or ult ranks, so that it's the same total but much faster in the later stages?\n\nI think you should look at his E, too.

I believe that should remain the ONLY advantage, because it is an extreme one. Saying it should be better for teamfights when Volibear consistently gets kited and builds tankier items really is counter-intuitive to the interactions that need to occur. He shouldn't be stronger in a place where he is weakest due to inherent kit flaws or it won't solve much.\n\nIf he should have any point where he is strong in the late game, I believe it should be coming from his ultimate only and gated by CD. Something like a Sunfire lightning DoT that does bonus damage on targets that you land spells on rather than AA's. Currently his ult feels like it does nothing unless it's a close 1v1.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-16T22:47:54.646+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd be surprised how easy he gets killed even with passive up early. \n\nThe change I suggested doesn't make him strictly 'better' late game -- it's a hopefully net neutral change, weighed off by the fact that his heal being a shorter duration makes applications of Grievous Wounds more powerful, but if he manages to avoid that somehow, his heal will be a bit burstier.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to have all juggernauts have in-combat sustain rather than 'triggers when you are low HP, activates out of combat' etc. but I'll probably do a separate thread on a complete overhaul for Volibear later","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-16T22:35:52.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive is really only good in the jungle early.

Idk how late you mean when you say he falls off hard late game. Or when you say he's dependent on snowballing.\nWhat I love about him is that he is one of the few champs that can 1v1 successfully when TWO levels behind, like Vi and I think Yi, as well (I don't own these 2 tho, but I've seen what they can do). Now I managed to do that, and I've seen others do it too. Someone with no smite got a quadra kill with Voli while underleveled and with a score like ~2/8. I helped him throughout the jg knowing it wasn't a lost cause, but how much can you really help someone with no smite, you know? Imo Voli can be really strong, at least mid game, despite being behind. The only problem atm is not him, but the god dam birds, because I have issues with them with other champs, too, made some threads n comments about it since the beginning of this season, and switched to mid and support. Reduce their number, and the jg will be golden. It's prolly why he's mostly played top, last time I checked.\n\n3. I agree with his weird distribution of damage, W being the main one here, and I can add that I feel his kit is asking for the slowing smite rather than the burning one, even though he would benefit from the burning one more. It feels like with his little speed boost he still can't catch some champs at the same level with same level of boots.\n\n4.

Nautilus top, Leona support, etc. Are what let Volibear get into the fight easier so he can shine. \n\n>Idk how late you mean when you say he falls off hard late game.\n\nHe falls off because his tank stats quickly get shredded to bits after carries purchase their Whisper upgrades, BORK, Void staff, etc. When they are closer to full build, he struggles with doing anything other than becoming a secondary support unless someone else can initiate for him and tank aggro so that he can DPS the carries and execute them. Not to mention how poor his damage output is vs champions with resistances.\n\n>He has other tricks besides flash q, I'm only a bronzie but I realized I can fear them while chasing with Q. Increase fear's range and he might become op.\n\nThis is a 'trick' but you should note that his E slows champions, not fears.","replies":[{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2017-03-17T19:18:57.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, it's as good as a thresh's hook, not ult. Yes, it's single targeted, but so is let's say a Blitz's hook, and that's all you need to win a team fight if everyone is there and committed. You instagib the first victim, then the 5v4 starts.\n\nRight, it only fears monsters and minions, slows everything.

Two abilities in his kit scale with attack speed, but juggernaut items don't support that stat. You can grab a {{item:3078}}, but that's not a lot of defensive stats for a melee frontliner with a single, conditional defensive ability built in his kit. Even {{champion:122}} won't buy one unless he's incredibly ahead early on.\n\nGranted, W takes care of itself somewhat because of the innate AS it grants, but the ult is just so underwhelming if you can't proc it a lot. This is made even worse since Voli can have a tough time sticking to more mobile champions to get autos off in the first place, despite his flip. There's counterplay, then there's a self-countering kit.\n\nI would say his ult could be changed to something like {{champion:53}}  or {{champion:85}}  has, where lighting strikes in an AoE around him when he activates it. To help separate Voli's ult from the other abilities, his ult could apply grounding to everyone struck by the bolts to give him a unique flavor and help him overcome kiting in his moment of strength.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-03-17T16:31:06.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3800}} : Volibear is now an innitiator.
