Going only off the major ones, {{champion:122}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:21}}  All of these reworks did not &#039;reinvent&#039; the character or forsake their current player base in hopes of drawing in a new crowd. They took what the character already has, and they improved upon that by adding nuance to their kits to modernize them, or by focusing them around their existing high points and pushing them even further into what made them so appealing to begin with. Most of their balance problems post-rework were numbers issues and could be solved easily; otherwise, they are good reworks.\r\n\r\nConversely, almost all of the reworks that people regard as the worst usually involve Riot trying to push them to do something entirely different, because they had a new &#039;direction&#039; for that champion. {{champion:72}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:90}} are some of the worst offenders in this regard; their existing player base and what they may want out of a rework was not taken into consideration, and more importantly, Riot tried to completely change the champion** while keeping most of their kit intact. ** That&#039;s the biggest reason I think these gimmick reworks fail so often; their scope is far beyond what a class update can offer to them, because they try to redefine these champions, while leaving such a large portion of their original kit intact. On the flip side, making those reworks bigger than a Class Update makes them an overhaul, which leaves them even more separated from their original identity, which feels just as bad or worse for the people who play them. The only exception to this, that I know of, is Graves, and he&#039;s been very controversial since his rework with strong opinions on both sides. And I think we&#039;re seeing the same thing with this update; Sejuani and Maokai are being &#039;redefined&#039; as champions instead of being built upon, and the people who play them are not very happy about it. \r\n\r\nSo please keep this in mind when you decide on the next class update; if they can&#039;t be easily and quickly modernized and improved upon without changes that completely repurpose them, consider setting them aside for an individual rework later, where you can look at them more intimately.","replies":[{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2017-04-26T09:17:45.666+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":43,"body":"You left out {{champion:14}}  and {{champion:78}}  Whose reworks completely changed their playstyle....how convenient.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-26T11:17:06.338+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":1,"body":"They aren't class updates.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2017-04-26T12:34:30.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":29,"body":"And you cannot really consider Sion a rework \n\nOriginal sion was literally made as a joke\n\nthey just decided it was time to do something about it and make him an actual champion\nThough that is a long time ago now and he could use a small update to modernize him a bit\n\nThe current tank update would have been a perfect time\n\nHis kit doesn't really need any changes, just a few touch ups and modernization would have made him perfect again \n\nImo a far better candidate then sejuani who would arguably needed more work then what the tank update offers in order to satisfy her player base theme and niche\n\n**Edit**\nLol i like how i get 16 downvotes, for suggesting to modernize Sion haha.\nThere are like 5 sion players on the boards. \nYet somehow all these ''experts'' and ''mains'' know all of it better ahahaha xD","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-26T12:39:15.920+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"i was completely fine with sej as is, i only wanted a less awful clear. if she needed to get reworked then I would have preferred they kept her as the slow-tank and built around that thematic instead of trying to make her line up with the other two Freljord girls \n\nSion as a champion is good but as a rework, I consider him a failure.

She started out very weak, only being able to lane against a handful of people and even then it wasn't a great matchup for her, but as the game went on she got stronger and stronger at a rate that was slow at first and then ramped up to insanity. However, even with her insanity that was late-game, she had a very narrow kit focus in what she could do or how she could do it. She couldn't farm well, she couldn't split-push quickly, but she could definitely kill you, and you wouldn't have much of an answer for it.\n\nThe problem? As I see it: League isn't built for hyper-carries anymore. Games end too quickly, and their kits are too easily abused in this game, making them look like binary feast-or-famine designs. That's probably why none really exist on the level of Spectre or Medusa anymore in League; Poppy was the last one. \n\nThat said, for the sake of League specifically, I'm not sure if it's actually sad like Lincoln says it is. It looks like it was more or less bound to happen due to the different direction League has decided to go with their design philosophy. More than anything, I'm just surprised Sion was made a tank rather than his Melee Carry route or AP Bruiser route of the old Sion. Sion feels like a failure in that he is nothing like old Sion in the slightest, but I feel like he's a success in that he's generally well designed. Similar for Poppy: nothing like old Poppy, but barring numbers being overtuned she seems fairly well-designed (like with Sion, your opinion may vary). As relaunches, they're successes; as carriers of their former champion's identity, they're failures.

You can redefine a champion, and you can leave their kit mostly intact, but you can't have both at the same time, and trying to do so with the limited time and resources of a class update is bound to end up with a middling kit that will be both confusing to play and difficult to balance, while usually also needing more in-depth work in the future. Mordekaiser is perhaps the biggest example of this, as the goal of his update went beyond even some major VGUs, yet his changes fell so short that it took months of follow-up to get him back to a playable state, even though his innate, E and R all played the same.\n\nThe innate scope restrictions imposed by class updates are also what make me question their associated champion reworks: the original goal of these big batch updates was to do quick, efficient work on a large set of champions who would otherwise take months to receive a full VGU, but each milestone has proven that the playerbase doesn't really like it when their champions get changed, yet don't receive enough of a full treatment to be in the most perfect spot they can be. Cutting the Tank Update down to 3 champions is a direct consequence of this, but also begs the question as to why those champions didn't just get assigned their own pods. I get that having more teams generates more complexity in coordination, communication, etc., but pulling a few more designers into a hypothetical Pod C, in addition to the current ChampUp pods A and B, could boost the rate of updates by about 50%, which is huge. Having each of those pods work on a champion in conjunction with an upcoming class update could also produce flagship reworks with a far higher chance of succeeding, and would likely require less follow-up work in the process.\n\nAlternatively, the solution should just be to not force champion reworks to fit a class update deadline, and instead focus more resources on changes to itemization and other linked systems. A recurring issue with class updates is that their item changes often don't really address their intended goals, and sometimes generate more issues in the process: the juggernaut items spawned a wave of tanky assassin/marksman builds that abused DMP and Sterak's, the marksman item changes failed to produce true diversity and choice for the class, the Mage Update ruined a lot of items, and the Lethality mechanic added during the Assassin Update continues to generate issues, in part because it's being abused by marksmen, but also because the feature ended up being really difficult to balance properly. The Tank Update was supposed to definitively answer the problem with tanky itemization being generic, stat-heavy and too beneficial to squishy damage classes, but the end result ended up being just two new items and some stat shifts towards resists. Time will tell if this will truly achieve the goals that were originally set, but for now I'm skeptical, and I think many more items could/should have been redone entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xicashina","date":"2017-04-26T12:50:58.236+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait was the Cassiopeia rework well received, I thought it was unanimously hated?","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-04-26T17:18:51.084+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first one was.

If 6 months ago you asked me to name 5 tank champions who I thought would be the least valuble to work on I think I would have said something like Sion>Poppy>Zac>Sejuani>Leona. I think the only moderately justifiable choice of tank to work on for one of these large scope reworks was Maokai.\n\nI'd personally say they went the absolute wrong direction for the tank reworks however. Rather than trying to do an in-depth rework on 3 champs who didn't warrant it anyway they should have looked at small scale updates (like the Amumu one) for 6 or 7. The thing about tanks right now is that they're either already pretty solid as in the cases of {{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:154}} or they're utterly abysmal and need larger work like {{champion:31}} {{champion:3}} (old) {{champion:54}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:223}} . The only tank I think falls between them and would have benefited from changes on this scope is {{champion:98}} , but I think it's still too soon after his rework for Riot to admit it's anything other than perfect.\n\nIMO what they should have done is smaller scope changes for Amumu, Gragas, Leona, Maokai, Naut and Sej, I don't even think Zac needed smaller scope changes. They also should have bundled Galio with this and marketed him as part of the tank update rather than a sole rework. No actual changes other than a later release date, just make that the focus of the rework rather than trying to work on tanks who don't need it.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-04-26T13:10:21.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I highly disagree on Leona, she needs a modernization to her kit due to how binary it is.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-04-26T13:15:43.558+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her kit's a lot like Ashe's, it's simple and that's what makes it excellent. \n\nIt's a high risk kit, it has a single goal sure, but it's not like it's Veigar levels of \"Nuke or be useless\".

It was bonus damage but you were able to sit out of fights and do less damage by spamming q max range and saving e for when they dove. now in order to even do anything besides tickly squishies you have to get aa range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2017-04-26T19:17:49.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Conversely, almost all of the reworks that people regard as the worst usually involve Riot trying to push them to do something entirely different, because they had a new 'direction' for that champion.\n\n{{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}}","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-04-26T22:13:23.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"god damn I miss old karma.
