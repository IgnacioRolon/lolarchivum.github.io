I can to websites on chrome right now, and I can even talk to the friends using the LoL chat. HOWEVER, I get a message when I try to queue for my bot game. It keeps on saying, HTTP error, please check your connection and retry...or something like that. That is strange because 1) I have internet (how else did I create this) and 2) I am literally talking to people using the LoL chat thing. So what is happening? I tried to reconnect several times (about like 10). So...yeah. Am I going to get penalized for missing a bot game?\n\nSTATUS UPDATE: SO!!!! The bot game finished, and I relog, and it was stated as a leave. So i decided to create a custom game with me and 1 bot opponent. Guess what? CONNECTION ERROR! Is it just me? Or are other people having the same error?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T22:33:20.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error message may be a little misleading and not actually a connection problem.  It looks to me like your game and its files can't be accessed so nothing can load or render the game.  Try the steps in our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that access to game files are being allowed.  Try it out after in a custom game and let me know if that helps.\n\nIf the issue persists then we can look into connection issues, but I want to give you the heads up on that because even if your net is fine you can still have problems connecting to specific servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Alpha EGirl","date":"2016-10-28T03:17:35.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: Restarted cpu and game for the 3rd time, and I created a custom game, and it won't connect.
