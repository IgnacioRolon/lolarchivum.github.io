I finally got comcast to replace some of their wiring and connections and that seemed to fix it. Due to those random disconnects I was entered into the leavebuster wait queue, which I understand, and I waited my time and was fine with it. I served my time.  I understand that it can impact other players experience even if I get back into the game and we win. I have played two or three weeks without any problem or disconnects until last night. The last game I played last night the power went out in my area (random outage not due to a storm or anything like that). I eventually got back into the game once I could. Now today, after just one disconnect it has entered me back in the leavebuster queue but this time at a 20 min wait. My question is, why is it at 20 minutes? I understand my account looks like I have left games but all of those games (unless the disconnect happened after around 30 mins) I would get back in and continue playing. Some winning, some losing. How long does it take for the system to reset?","replies":[{"poster":"reder rainbow","date":"2016-09-24T17:43:45.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also doesn't give me a message saying that it is only for a certain amount of games","replies":[]},{"poster":"reder rainbow","date":"2016-09-24T17:31:17.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that. I did my time and THEN played two weeks (28-42 games(I mostly play at least 2 sometimes 3 games a day)) of games and it still went up with one disconnect. How long does it take for it to stop going up? I would get if I was back at 5 min since it wasn't that long but why did it go up to 20 mins?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T17:00:37.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"[leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will continue to escalate the more an account accrues leaves.  It's necessary to play consistently without interruptions- not just the required games.  Otherwise- your standing will continue to remain the same or worsen as you continue to leave.  I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is in-shape after the changes your ISP made for you.
