I honestly don't know why there haven't been any LGBTQ+ characters in any of the lore so far. Is it really that hard to write them in? There have been plenty of confirmed straight relationships. (to the point where everyone gets reminded that GP and Illaoi are a thing when you load in) I'm pretty sure the closest we've gotten to an actual LGBT character is when riot stated in a Q&amp;A that Taric doesn't really care about gender (or something like that) and the couple Riot employees who ship Diana/Leona. Also, didn't someone state that Kayn have a crush on Zed but then someone else came and said he didn't?  There are 139 champions (including Ornn) and we don't have a single one who is shown to be Queer in the lore? I understand that relationships, in general, aren't really shown in the Lore of LoL that much but, throw us a bone, please.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2020-02-09T23:28:42.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reviving necro- threads which already had their time to shine is against [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE) and as such I will be locking this thread to make sure it lands at the bottom of the howling abyss.

Because that is not our defining characteristic trait that we chose for ourselves. I am sure some 100%NA would actually care a little more because to them it is a much bigger defining trait.\n\nThe LG community is the one who is making sexuality their defining trait, when it should really only be one aspect of their life, not their entire existence.\n\nI have already said I am fine with a few LG characters, especially if it would (pardon me) shut up the small vocal community of LGs who need approval and normalization by every other person because they are insecure in themselves.\nYou are right though. The problem comes when the few is not enough. I know nothing of borderlands, but if LoL decided to go 90% LG I might get upset at it. If it was in the background, I probably wouldn't care. But if it was a purposeful political statement, then you bet I'd care. I don't want your politics in my game.\n\nAnd I am sorry if that comes off as rude. Again, I am not trying to oppress, or say hide yourself or anything. I just want my entertainment to be entertainment and not another political machine trying to make statements.\n\nOk, reading through it again. Yea, you definitely come off super conceited in yourself. This is why there is no point in having these types of conversations.\n\nEdit: Also you ignored your two incorrect points completely.\nYou said asexuals aren't romantic, an asexual on this thread said he was.\nYou said Riot's new characters have 4 confirmed heteros. Well someone said Riot said Taliyah is... x-sexual.\nBut yes, insult me more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mechakaiser","date":"2017-08-11T09:50:38.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well, there are a lot of people discussing why LoL should have a LGTBI character or not, and I just see things too clearly. Because of THIS. THIS. This whole post, and its comment section, that's why League should definitely have more LGTBI characters, because they aren't normalliced in society, and whenever someone brings this issue to debate, the whole thing turns into a mess of insecure guys trying to make it about themselves.\n\nGuys, it isn't about US, it doesn't always need to be about us. Some people are gay, just let them be gay, you don't need to feel attacked in any way, again, this isn't about YOU, but THEM. The fact that some League characters where defined as being LGTBI wouldn't affect you on the least, but it could make a lot of people happy, and it would also help make their situation more normaliced.\n\nThey don't want a LGTBI \"Token\" character, they don't want a character whose only defyning trait is being gay, because that would be boring and insulting. People are much more than their sexuality, people have ambitions, dreams, flaws that have nothing to do with their sexuality. The only reason for them to talk so much about sexuality is that they CAN'T, because they aren't allowed to talk about it as it was a normal thing. And it HAS to be a normal thing, because otherwise, we are hurting each other and making a lot of people go through lots of problems, just for being born they way they are.\n\nAll that OP asked for was for Riot to \"throw a bone\". That's it. Not some character wearing rainbow clothes and yelling about how gay they are. How many people are like that in real life? They want a Hero, or Villain, or whatever, like any other character in League, and they want Riot to CONFIRM, just with one message, or picture, or some short story, that aside of being a Hero, they are also LGTBI. Just like people outside there are LGTBI, without that needing to be \"justified\" by their life experiences and goals. Blizzard only needed one image of Tracer kissing another woman (can't remember her name, I am not really into OW) to make their LGTBI fans go nuts. That's what people need, those are the tiny steps that help normalice something that should have been normal since the start.\n\nThis is Jorgen: Jorgen is a bruiser with Heavy Ad scalings who is perfect for skirmishes in the early game. He has this gimmick where he uses walls to bounce off them and enhance his attacks and... long talk about mechanics and gameplay...\n\n...still talking about mechanics and gameplay...\n\n...some random thoughts by the designers...\n\n...some Lore...\n\n... also, he is gay. And this is is launch skin Warrior Kingdoms Jorgen, have a nice day.\n\nAnd it doesn't need to be \"justified\", whatever that means. People don't need \"justification\" to be LGTBI, they just ARE, as characters in fiction should simply, BE LGTBI, because fiction is all about making us think about our reality in different and new ways, and people in our reality are LGTBI. This won't turn Riot Games into a machine of throwing \"politically correct\" (LOL) characters, they just want Riot to \"throw a bone\", SOMETHING, because so far, they have gotten NOTHING, and that's simply not fair. Come, CONFIRM, strongly, that one character is LGTBI, then keep doing amazing characters, as they always do, maybe add another one in the future. That's it.","replies":[]}]}
