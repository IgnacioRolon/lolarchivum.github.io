They may take cues from the community on what to police and how, but they have no obligation to follow the community's ideals. It may not be wise to not take the community into account, but since it is Riot's property, they get to make the determination.\n\nNote: I am not saying that they don't take the community into account (while some may disagree with that observation), I am just saying that we, the community, have no direct say in the rules.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-10-11T05:40:45.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only Riot bans people for telling others to commit suicide?
