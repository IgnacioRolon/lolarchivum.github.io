I installed it and ran and nothing came up on screen. thinking that it may have crashed i tried to start the log in client again and it showed me this blue box with a message that said it was already running. I have tried to kill it with the task manager and start again but the same error persists. I also ran the hextech repair tool to fix any strange settings like i saw in previous posts.\r\n\r\nrunning on windows 7","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T18:36:24.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe that the HRT will correct work for the updated client.

Create the shortcut using the LeagueClient application located in the League folder in Program Files. Once the shortcut is created on the desktop, add the -no-sandbox parameter at the end of the location description.\n\nGet it together rito...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForceFEEDLord","date":"2016-11-16T21:54:40.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS.

Will look into this and pass it on.  I'm not part of the client update team, so any issues you guys are seeing are problems that we are finding and troubleshooting together.

In task manager LoL shows up on processes but not on applications. i can end process and try again endlessly but it never works. if i dont end process and try to open LoL again it gives that black window and the message saying it is already running. so in processes in task manager its recognized as running but in applications its not and nowhere on my computer does the login screen pop up so i can attempt to log in or revert to pre beta version. Im using windows vista and i seen another post on the internet where a person had my same issue and they said they had windows 7. Riot needs to come up with some real solutions and advice quickly PLEASE. If i open from C drive riot games league of legends it doesnt help. through shortcut icon or direct file it opens the Launch screen and then does not work when launch is clicked. it does seem like something happens for a second after i hit launch. like it did something but didnt work properly and LeagueClient.exe*32 and LeagueClientUx.exe*32 opens up in the processes in task manager but not in applications. kind of repeating myself. but i really want to be understood and offered a legitimate solution. Hoping for a reply sooner then later. i also have a ticket made that i hope is looked at soon. thank you for your hard work riot, i really hope you can resolve my issue swiftly. the -no-sandbox thing didnt work for me. nothing has. can anyone please give me guidance.","replies":[]}]}
