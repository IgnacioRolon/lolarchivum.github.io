And his E is a lot harder to rename to something that doesn't sound cheesy than LB's Q.\n\nA mid range blink, that applies a very strong very short duration slow, in the kit of a *literal* assassin of which his primary emphasis is his ludicrous quantity of blades he has, doesn't exactly have a clear name.  If it was a long duration slow, the name Cripple could be used, but it isn't a long duration.  You don't cripple someone for a quarter of a second, you cripple them for life.   It just is hard to have a such a multi-faceted ability have a clear name that accurately describes it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OuttaControl56","date":"2014-10-29T16:37:40.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it makes sense now.\n\nHe tried to silence her, he couldn't and now he can't silence carp anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Young Kush Clop","date":"2014-10-27T17:50:30.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does make sense because he no longer has his silence.
