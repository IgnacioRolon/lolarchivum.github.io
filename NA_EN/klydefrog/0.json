While it does technically work with energy champs, I don't think it's as impactful for them. I definitely like the first reworked version that refunded ult CD, though. Still, this new version takes out the weird niche cases of champs like Corki (short ult CD), Pyke (recast timer), and Swain (ult CD only begins after effect ends). Its identity is now firmly a mana/energy thing.\n\nAlso, resourceless champs like Vlad, Mundo, and Kat don't benefit from this iteration of PoM at all, so it'll automatically change to Triumph when the match begins if you still had it selected. No need to mess with your rune pages unless you have a champ that can use it (mana/energy) and specifically don't want it.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2020-01-15T20:07:30.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Energy champs can benefit a hella lot from it, some too much to be healthy.

First hand experience\n\nMy perspective is probably skewed by how visible it is when I'm out of mana and then get two takedowns and suddenly everything is fine. I don't play energy champs much anymore, actually due to the previous version of PoM that was much better for mana champs. I need to break that bad habit, honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2020-01-15T20:43:49.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now I'm at work, but I do plan to talk about the rune and energy users later in a thread of my own.\n\nIf you want I can toss the link for that thread here so you can read on more detail.","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2020-01-16T02:59:32.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr increase max energy and refund energy is win win","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2020-01-16T09:16:10.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/rMkun7MJ-lets-talk-akali-boards-vs-reality\n\nThere you go.
