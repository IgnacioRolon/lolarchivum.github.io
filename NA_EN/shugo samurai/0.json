To troubleshoot and rule out possibilities, your best bet is to test Tab on a different keyboard and see if it still spams.  If not, then your new one may have an issue or setting causing it to do that.  If that's the case, you should ht up their manufacturer's support and see if there's a way to disable it.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
