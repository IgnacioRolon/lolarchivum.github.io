this site ( https://www.random.org/ ) to generate a random number between 1 and 129.\nYou wake up as the champion with the corresponding number.\n\n-----------------\nKeep in mind that:\n\n 1: If your champion is not the same gender as you, then you will wake up as a male/female equivalent to that champion.\nSo let's say you're a guy, and you end up with Jinx.\nIn this situation you will wake up as a boy version of jinx.\n\n 2: You gain all the abilities of your champion, but you do not inherit any of their motivations or personality traits.\n\n 3: Any pets that you may have (Quinn's Valor, Annie's Tibbers) will still have their personalities, and motives, but they will ultimately have to do what you say.\n\n 4: Your mind cannot be directly altered in any way. \nSo if you're Udyr, then the 4 animal spirits inside your head, wont be able to make you do anything or directly change your mood.\n\n 5: This takes place in the \"real world\", not Valoran.\n\n----------\n\n1.

This gives me a collection of helpers I can count on to perform simple tasks for me, whether that be bringing groceries upstairs (Can't trust Ravenous with that though) or finding my television remote.  It also means I can make ghost-clones of people, which comes in great when I need to be in two places at once or need more than two hands to complete a task.  Probably won't make me too popular with the Church, though, and two of the ghouls have issues - Ravenous tends to eat all my snacks and Decaying smells like, well, death.  Spectral would be pretty chill, though.\n\nIf we factor the 'undead' side into this as well, it means that I don't need to eat, sleep, or breathe, which opens up a whole lot more time to do things.  I can recover from nearly any injury (albeit slowly) and I can't ever get sick.  Downsides there are that I really like eating and sleeping.  I think I could adapt, though.  And there won't be that usual 'undead smell' if I remember regular daily hygiene, which will be a lot easier with the extra eight hours a day I don't have to spend sleeping.  Immortality might get old after a while, though.  We'd have to see.\n\nI dare say I'd really luck out with this one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TauNoob1","date":"2015-02-26T19:20:31.923+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:6}}  :C","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2015-02-27T00:31:42.157+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:4}} \n\nHELLO WORLD POKER TOUR","replies":[]},{"poster":"eman9871","date":"2015-02-26T19:15:38.505+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:98}} I.
