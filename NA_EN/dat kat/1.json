All my hardware parts are far superior to this game, I can operate overwatch, battlefield, call of duty, gta 5, star wars batllefront, titanfall 2, just cause 3 on ultra settings without a single sweat. League is about the only game I suffer from when it comes to fps, I checked out the forum at the player support section 2 days ago and noticed that riot does acknowledge the fact that the game struggles to run on high end pc's, and the only solution suggested is turning off a feature in game settings or video settings I forgot, which was already disabled in my options anyway. The question is, when will the problem get fixed? I cannot endure playing league like this anymore. My brother's shitty pc runs the game better than I do. We're talking about 16 gb ram, gtx 980ti and intel core i7 with a water cooling system, gratefully, I never suffer from heating problems.. League doesn't even require a fraction of the performance my pc can produce and yet It's the only game that struggles to run on my pc. It's really pissing me off.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-25T17:45:31.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, since the steps in the guide didn't help I created a ticket for you.
