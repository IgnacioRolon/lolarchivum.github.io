This not only can cause higher than normal ping, but a more unstable connection as well.  We are working with these ISP's to try to get this resolved, but I have no new information to provide right now :(\n\nFor players outside of Minnesota, the root cause seems to be something else altogether.  Lag spikes and rubber-banding seem to point to some sort of unstable connection to the the individual game server.  Since not every single player in the game is experiencing the same issue, the fault doesn't seem to lie on the individual game server itself.  Therefore we have to start looking elsewhere as to why this might be happening.  The best step you can do is to use our [Connection Analyzer Too](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743)l.
