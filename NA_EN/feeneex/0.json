The matter at hand of which i speak is the practice of DDOSing  and drop hacking. This has been happening a bit too frequently now, especially in my matches. I always play on a good connection myself using a cable, and its usually me alone on the network and my ms rate is normally 72 - 114 and a good fps. What has been making me angry a lot is when you're having a great game and then suddenly out of no where, either your abilities dont work, you freeze up for no reason being unable to control your champ while everyone else is moving, enemy team just appearing out of nowhere even when you have the map warded....the list goes on. For example I have just completed a rather digusting match where i was severely harrassed with the hacking. Our adc had problems connecting from the start so i took over bot lane as morgana, enemy team had a blitz, nautilus, lucian urgot and an azir, i had no problems holding off bot lane on my own as blitz and naut kept roaming around leaving me and lucian alone to fight. However as soon as i had started placing too much pressure on lucian, i noticed some descrepancies occuring.\n\n1. I had placed a ward at our raptor area near inner turret in the bushes, it had shown in inventory that it was used but showed no where on the map, even my teammates could not find it.\n\n2. in team fights where kat and i had the advantage, we would just get frozen not being able to move and by the time things returned to normal e uld be dead waiting for respawn.\n\n3. my teammates constantly complained about not being able to use summoner spells but their spells would be on cooldown\n\n4. a surrender vote showing 4 votes in favour of surrendering when i did not vote yes and it as 4v5 as draven was mia.\n\nI dont usually post names but this is gettingout of hand and it seems that the report system isnt efficient\n\nEnemy Team: [REMOVED]\n\nif possible please review these players, if im wrong with accussing them for hack i apologize, but the coincidences of hacking occuring in that match were too many.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-01T22:30:42.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your frustration, but keep in mind it isn't possible to DDOS or Drophack particular individuals within a game of League of Legends without knowing their IP Address, which cannot be gained through League itself.  This is why when DDOS or Drop Hacks attempt to happen in League, the entire game is dropped and everyone in the game experiences the same issue, even the player who is doing it.  \n\nIt honestly sounds like the game you were playing had a fair amount of issues, and there may have been a larger scale issue with that particular Game Server causing these issues.

Possibly just affecting you?\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"MissMikasa","date":"2016-06-01T22:44:48.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"dArtagnan- PLEASE READ!\n\nThis has been happening to a whole BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

Before, the path your connection took was very efficient, whereas now, it seems to take much longer to get there.  If this is indeed the case, then there is very little we can do.  We work with ISP's within each region to get the most efficient path to our servers, but since you are connecting from Europe, we cannot optimize a path that crosses to the other side of the world.  The best step you can take is to contact your ISP directly to see if there is anything they can do on their end to help League of Legends players who use their service.\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"FeeNeeX","date":"2016-06-02T10:23:13.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot this my OWN personal video take a look at it to see what its happening and probably not only me but for everyone else i think\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mLTPrfc65k","replies":[{"poster":"cheddacide","date":"2016-06-06T13:53:17.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not gonna lie tho, that morgana could've saved you when annie flashed in, but yh thats the same problem i have, your ping is fine, then wham you go in for the kill then you get frozen and your life just gets deleted, then everything goes back to normal and the enemy team is jeering at you....yup been facing this alot","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FeeNeeX","date":"2016-06-01T04:03:07.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Riot\n\nWhy are you always trying to make the problem fall into someone else and YOU dont check and FIX your own Servers\n\nWhy always give the blame to someone else ???\n\nPlease fix the servers Riot because i contacted my ISP and everything its good\n\nHow can i be getting 165-168 normally and then suddenly the gameplay freezes and i have ping spikes \n\nAm pretty sure thats not my ISP problem\n\nPlease have your egineeres and technicians have a hard look at the servers and what may ve causing the problem","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-01T22:26:18.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems your main issue is different now.  Are you saying that you still consistently get around 168, but are getting ping spikes instead?  Or are you bouncing between 168 and 240, and when you get 240 is where you get the ping spikes?  These are actually two completely separate issues.  If you get 168 like normal, but get the ping spikes, this is most likely not due to any ISP issue.  That being said, we need to rule out some possible root causes why you get these ping spikes.  If it was indeed the servers fault, then every single other player in your game would be experiencing the same lag spikes.  Since it doesn't appear to be the case, we need to start investigating other root causes.\n\nMake sure to complete every single step in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).
