I feel this, in particular, is crucial to having a good time in League and to be on the right path of an honorary ally *and* opponent.\n\n**2.** The [Instant Feedback System FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) covers most of the reasons why players are either suspended or penalized for certain actions or behavior in-game.\n\n**3.** Finally, the [*'Reporting a Player' Guide*](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player) goes over examples of both *Reportable* and *Acceptable* behavior in-game. It's a great supplement to the FAQ above.\n\nI hope this helped. While I can't list every single possible scenario of what will and will not get you banned, I feel these guides will point you in the right direction. You can always post a discussion to the [**Player Behavior & Moderation Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) if you ever want to have a conversation regarding the specifics of these systems.","replies":[{"poster":"FeeNeeX","date":"2016-11-30T15:34:43.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=rv45WtEk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-30T05:34:47.837+0000)\n>\n> **It&#x27;s hard to cover all this information in a single post, but some great places to start are listed below:**\n\nWhy don't you create an official thread on the website or on reddit going over this on full detail ??\nAm asking this because i want to know for sure how Riot operates on this topic so i WILL KNOW FOR SURE WHAT NOT TO DO\n\nPlease Riot you need to cover this topic because me and people like me who have over $500 in our accounts DEFINITELY don't want to get banned for some silly reason so if you OFFICIALLY go over this topic once and for all it will be really awesome and informative","replies":[]}]}]}
