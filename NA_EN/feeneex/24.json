Instead of camping out in the cold waiting for a great deal on some vidyagaemz you could sit in your own toasty home and nab some great deals on dope skins! I'm not on the store team, so I have absolutely no idea if this could ever be a thing, but I think it's a pretty neat idea.\n\nIf you feel strongly about this, I encourage you to draft up an idea of how this could work and post it to the [Miscellaneous Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) where a member from the store team can potentially see it. Let me know if you have any questions. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Thatguybykorbin","date":"2016-11-23T05:08:55.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"So I hope that what the guy below says is untrue that Tencent only cares about the money (though I would put it past them), but you can't forward this to somebody that works with the store? That is almost a must for a company like you guys to maintain good relations with the community.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheXtremeGamr","date":"2016-11-24T16:46:55.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:120}} yur mum","replies":[{"poster":"FeeNeeX","date":"2016-11-24T17:16:00.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheXtremeGamr,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=KaWiwRou,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-24T16:46:55.990+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:120}} yur mum\n\n?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FeeNeeX","date":"2016-11-23T04:18:22.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it will be pretty cool if that happen's i mean everyone has black Friday store's offline and online even freaking dota has but league of legends never had a single one \n\ni would create a draft but do you guys even listen???\n\ni don't want to waste my time explaining and writing about something that potentially its never going to happen \n\nAfter all Tencent want's to extract maximum cashflow out of league and they made it to corporate that's why even the icons and wards are RP sales instead of IP \n\nEven if you guys agreed on Black Friday sales i don't think Tencent will \n\nAfter all there are thousands of people working already at Riot \n\nwhy would anyone care about my opinion??\n\nI know for sure tencent only cares about this ====> http://i.imgur.com/9lnyCwv.png and how to increase it\n\nSooo.. i don't think its gonna ever happen\n\nIt's all about maximum cashflow now with Riot and everything became corporate \n\nSkins after skins bundle's after bundle's nerf's on champions after selling a high ticket skin ( Ashe example ) and so on i know what Tencent its trying to do \n\nAlso i posted many threats about A Diana skin that i would really like to be made and get an opinion from a Riot Lead Designer but that never happen and no one paid attention to it from Riot \n\nSoo why bother now?? \n\nIn my eye's Riot doesn't even care about the playerbase opinion you guy's just make change's and you roll out stuff and we just have to accept them and move on with them \n\nThat what i think","replies":[{"poster":"Regretful Angel","date":"2016-11-24T20:59:19.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this is how i suppose this would work. You have everything a certain percent off according to popularity\n For Example: If WorldBreaker Nasus is very popular, you could have like 10% off because it is already a pretty low price but if something like DJ Sona is very unpopular, you could have like 30-40% off This would result in an increase in sales which means that Riot will make up for the money they made...
