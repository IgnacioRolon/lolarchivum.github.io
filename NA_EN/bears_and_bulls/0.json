Am I going to play seriously again to regain the last 3-4 years worth of progress? Obviously not. So I treat accounts like they are disposable now because that's exactly what they are when you have nothing of value to lose on the accounts. Not even trying to be edgy, that's just the reality of how permabans work. They are designed to keep you away, so when you actually keep playing and make new accounts its breeds a care free mindset.
