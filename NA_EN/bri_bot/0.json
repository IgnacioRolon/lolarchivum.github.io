Did Riot put out an ad or something simple or is it more complex than that? Did they need to only come in for a day or two? I know some voice actors for league have reprised their voices multiple times but others kind of fell off the face of the earth...\r\n\r\nThanks ahead of time!","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2018-11-22T19:44:11.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They contact agencies. You need to establish a reputation and your agency will have a history of voices you have done. When Riot sends out a request to agencies looking for someone with a certain range, experience, and availability, they pretty much choose their best option. Not sure if they do auditions or if they just pick and roll with it, but it's a process that someone simply can't waltz into like that, unfortunately.\n\nThis is speaking as someone who does voice work, and I tell you it's not easy to land a role as a champion in a big-name game like League of Legends unless you luck out hugely.\n\nAlthough, if you attend a lot of Riot events and get active, you can establish some connections to kind of streamline the process and make yourself known to them.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-11-23T18:19:14.005+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly.\n\n80% We contact agencies as listed (Sometimes specifically calling out an actor we want to hear) and sometimes backdooring a rioter or actor we’ve used before (20%) (obviously excluding skins)\n\nOur VO team selects a number of candidates.
