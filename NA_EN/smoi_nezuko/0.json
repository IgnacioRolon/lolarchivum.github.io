Get through champ select, and after, screen goes black for a split second then returned to main client, with the reconnect button available to press. Press the button, and the loading icon appears, then the reconnect button comes back. Nothing I do will allow me to actually get into game, and I&#039;m currently waiting for league to &quot;check for corruption&quot;.
