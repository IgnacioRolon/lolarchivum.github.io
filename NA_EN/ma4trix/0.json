This at least would be one step closer towards a more balanced competitive gameplay of TFT, in my opinion.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-26T23:29:23.441+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to that power of the items, the cost would need to be dramatically increased.  Also, you could have a supply/demand system, where the more that other people buy the item, the more that item would cost.  If everyone buys only bows, they could cost ~30 gold each, for example.","replies":[{"poster":"Ma4triX","date":"2019-07-27T00:22:09.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont mind Items beeing more expensive those numbers are just a suggestion, but if it gets way more expensive then they should also add a reroll in the Item shop and people have to decide themselves if thats even worth it or if they rather eco.\n\nI dont mind supply/demand system either, but I think it shouldn't be a real time thing, not like while you are in a match and depending on how many players alrdy bought it it gets more expensive, instead maybe a seasonal thing, or a patch to patch thing, or maybe even from match to match (obviously with a cap otherwise the whole shop wouldn't make sense)\n\n'Cuz otherwise the issue I see with that is, whoever buys as many bows as early as possible gets the cheaper ones, I just don't like the Idea if there is **too** much focus on Items\n **I just dont want people to behave like its Black Friday everytime carousel is around** \n\nI brought that in 'cuz i want the game to develope, like how often did you see 6 knights? Did you **ever **see someone building 6 knights x) ? Most of the time people just dont feel confident enough to go for some comps because they are shi**y by themselves, or hard to achieve in the first place, but people can get creative if they have access to more options, they could buy spatula (obviously coming with a price) to turn their yordles into knights for example xD.\n\nWith that I feel like people can come up with a lot more counter plays since they are not bound too much on getting specific Items from the pve round (if they get any at all), that way to some degree they'd have the reins of destiny in their own hands.\n\nBut maybe I think way too romantic and naive regarding this, I guess it'd need a lot of testing anyways, but we should start somewhere, so this are just my thoughts ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-07-27T05:41:56.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think this would break the tft meta, and people would consistently build the same broken items and ruin the game mode, so i'll have to say hell no. Ok maybe you could price an item at 100 gold, then it would be a still strategic game, the point is to keep the item cost so high it is completely unreasonable to depend your strategy on items","replies":[]},{"poster":"tires","date":"2019-07-27T00:40:49.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m not quite sure I follow how this would change people bringing up RNG as it’s yet another element of RNG added in. While I do believe it’s better than getting no items, I don’t think it’s really a solution.\n\nFor example, say you implement this shop idea and a player gets 3 random items. Assuming it would be similar mechanics to champion pool, there would be set amount of each item shared in an overall pool between all players. What’s to keep people from complaining about the RNG of them getting worse items than others who get things like a bow or spatula from this item shop?\n\nSure it would help with itemization, and that would be nice. However if someone gets unlucky item shop roll and only gets components to make something like idk thornmail for example, that doesn’t help them when going against someone who’s item shop gave them components for a cursed blade or (god forbid) a force of nature.\n\nNot to mention, I feel like people who are in a lead in tft games have the luxury of sitting on more gold than people who have less health, because they’re trying to utilize their gold to come up with a comp that will keep them from being the first eliminated. If only the top people have gold and the item shop costs gold (which I see more frequently than not), then the top people would be the only ones who benefit from purchasing items directly - making them even stronger.\n\nYes, if this were implemented then people who have low scores due to bad item drop rate RNG could learn to spend money more wisely. But in doing so they lower their chances of having a strong enough team comp in exchange for a potential yet still very RNG form of maybe getting item components that could help them. \n\nAnd the final point I have to discuss is that even if low people were able to spend gold effectively without harming their composition, and everything were equal RNG between everyone, the people at the top score wise are still most likely ahead because they got more items, so if they had an equal chance to build even more items it wouldn’t fix anything.\n\nLike if a person with 5 items and a person with 1 item both get to this item shop and each person buys 3 items, you’d still have one person with 8 items total going against a person with 4 items total. Sure there’s a chance that the person with less items could build two full items that are helpful, but would they be useful enough to counter someone with four full items that was already ahead of them? \n\nWhile I totally agree that the item system could be changed to be more beneficial to all players versus a select few, I’m not quite sure if this is the best way it could be done. It would need some tweaking before implementation.","replies":[]}]}
