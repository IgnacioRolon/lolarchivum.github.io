What sense does that make. the new ranked system is not the same as the old at all. In the old i could be ona losing streak and lose about 18lp per game and if i win I get 21lp, which helped me climb, and eventually i got 24lp per win and lost 16 per loss but my winrate was much much lower. The new ranked system really punishes players overall","replies":[{"poster":"Míellá","date":"2019-02-08T11:49:33.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From Riots \"Ask Riot\" thread about the new ranked system.\n\n\nHow does the provisional system work? Because I won more games than my friends in placements and got placed in bronze 1, and they all got placed in silver. But I used to be in silver last season.\nDuring placements, we consider a few pieces of information: your past rank, your MMR, and your win-loss record.\n\nWhen you play your first game of the season, we give you a provisional rank based on where you ended last season—you should expect it to be about a tier lower. Then, during the rest of your placement games, your LP gains and losses will largely depend on your MMR and your record against the teams you face.\n\nAny or all of those variables could be different from one player to the next, and if they are, that could explain why you got a different result. You’ve got this though; good luck on your climb—I’m sure you’ll be Gold in no time!\n\nRIOT SAPMAGIC","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"magicangel","date":"2019-02-04T01:09:02.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Legend Alpha ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k7YEKEFo,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-02-03T20:22:09.366+0000)\n>\n> The new LP gain/loss works almost the same as the old one.\n> The only diffrence is that there is splash now.\n> If you gain 16 lp and lose 16 lp, then that&#x27;s because you should be where you are.\n> If you play better than iron 3, then you should be able to climb higher, even if you lose as much LP as you gain.\n> Infact, if it really was incredibly unfair, then you&#x27;d lose more than you would gain.\n> You&#x27;re the one that has to show the system that ur better than the elo ur in.

This change literally catered to the minority. I was told that if was made because people didnt like that when they were auto filled...that if their lane opponent was on their main role they were at a disadvantage.    Its a TEAM game...suck it up and just learn 1 or 2 champs for every role so that when u need to play it u are ready and do your best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"support braahh","date":"2019-02-03T20:19:11.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On my losing streak (which was from the beginning of season to about a week ago) i was gaining more lp than losing... roughly 22 or 21 per win and 16 or 17 per loss.... but now that I'm slightly winning more (was at a 30% winrate up to now a 45% winrate) I'm only gaining 17 or 18 and i think still losing 15 or 16.... it's definitely slow going and promos are all but impossible to win even with a free win since i fell down 2 ranks at the onset on season..... i feel your pain on this.... hopefully it calms down some and getting back to gold won't be the most frustrating thing I've ever done... good luck","replies":[]},{"poster":"magicangel","date":"2019-02-03T19:57:35.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and i follow all the unspoken rules, i start getting tilted i step away. no point losing cause your upset at losing. i avoid dodging as much as possible but will if i totally have to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2019-02-03T19:46:37.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't under the impression that lp changed much with the new system.
