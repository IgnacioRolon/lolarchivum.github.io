How is this fun? You cannot gain MMR or LP when you have to win 4v5s. Maybe people really good at the game can. But I am not, so riot just says screw the little guys trying to learn and have fun?

With extremely bad luck it might take a hundred games, but that's not likely. That only happens because there are *millions* of players. You just played 7 games.

I dont play league that often anymore (just if a friend is on like one day a week or so) because im not a fan of large team games. In starcraft, 2v2 is okay, but I still stick to 1v1s because I just hate being at the mercy of random strangers performing well enough to win a game. Id rather rely on myself and get placed based on my own personal skill relative to others. I am diamond in starcraft, silver in league lol. Just not a fan of big teams. \n\nIt sounds like youre mad at Riot for some reason over this lol. Dude, they cant control people. This is the nature of team games with random anoymous strangers. Accept it or play something else like I do.

Everyone is trying to rush through them, tempers are high (often for the same or similar reasons you listed), and the MMR compression pushes people of wider skills together than normal.\n\nI don't think I've ever tried to rush placements first week, and only do first month if there a mission for it.\n\nI know, it doesn't help when you've already played most of your placements, but that's just what I've seen happen pretty much every year at the start of the season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gintyl","date":"2020-01-14T19:39:56.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Match 8, auto filled to jun, (my worse role and the second time in 4 games) o yeah and the enemy jun has 900K mastery points..........................
