First game, not bad. second and third game top lane feeds then afks......... 4th game, okay we are 2/2. 5th game auto filled jun, still go 5/4 but of course we lost. 6th game jungler gets way too aggressive and leads to the game falling apart. Now I'm 2/4 in my placement matches and i feel like i only got 2 out 6 real chances to play the game.................... Yes, i suck. yes i need to \"get good\" but really riot? I will now have to try to selvage what is left of my last 4 games and pray i get at least a couples games without random flaming people or people going afk..........
