I was adc tristana and managed to get first blood.  Our mid was winning his lane.  Then..........everything started to go wrong.  Our top lane kept disconnecting repeatedly and arguing with our jungler about how he wasn't helping him top.  Our jungler, who finishes 0-9, then decides to start intentionally feeding by sitting under the middle turret while spamming his laugh emote because our top was trash talking him.  Our top just disconnects for the rest of the game after raging like a child.   I finish 8-0, completely dominating my lane with my fantastic support and we lose because it turns into a 3v5.  This is why I have stopped playing ranked.  It literally just takes all the fun out of this game.  I just hope Riot decides to keep hexakill or add more game modes because the only fun things to do on league are custom game modes.\r\n\r\nMatch history: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/36990784#matches/1611385211","replies":[{"poster":"Herny knock down","date":"2014-10-30T02:51:22.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what do you want?
