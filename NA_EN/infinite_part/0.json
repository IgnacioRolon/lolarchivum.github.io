Is this a possibility? \n\nI&#039;ve decided to reform but haven&#039;t decided whether I should continue on my old account or make a new one for a fresh start. If anyone has valuable input for my situation that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-11-01T01:29:32.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you continue to show you've reformed it doesn't matter.
