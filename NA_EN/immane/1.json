Literally basic math.\r\n\r\nYet, I see so many people picking champs they have sub 50% win rates with in ranked games.\r\n\r\nIf you do this -- why do you do it? I&#039;m trying to understand the mentality. Are you trolling? Did you not attend elementary school? Are you bored and want to play a champ for fun and refuse to play normals? \r\n\r\nI honestly don&#039;t understand why people would ignore the rule of &quot;if I play this champ, I will more likely win&quot; in a ranked game, so looking to hear from people who do this.","replies":[{"poster":"L Psy Kongroo","date":"2016-06-16T03:20:50.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In ranked, you should prioritize playing champions you are comfortable with above all else. Fizz can have a 90% win rate, but if you rarely play Fizz, you're not going to win more often with him, because you'll be clueless about how to play him properly. People don't troll by picking low win rate champions. They pick low win rate champions because those are the champions they can play successfully.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loko","date":"2016-06-16T03:09:45.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Immane.\nThere's a fair bit to discuss on this topic.\nI used to go hardcore on only picking high winrate champions. Does high winrate mean - \"This champion is slightly more powerful than it should be\"?\nI see complaints about Zed being far too strong, however his winrate is often seen as negative.\nWhat you likely have not considered is this:\n* How hard is that champion to play? - There are probably thousands of players learning the champion attempting to get the mechanics right. You see this a lot specifically with Lee Sin. Who has excellent win potential in the hands of a good player, yet newer players bring his win rate down.\n\nOverall, you should ignore winrate for now:\nUNLESS, they winrate is stupidly high. Say during the Juggernaught rework when Skarners winrate skyrocketed from sub 50 to above 60 which is insane.\nThat's when they're overpowered.\nAlso, Heimerdingers winrate is pretty high. Why's that? Most Heimerdinger players are die hard Donger mains. So they've got a lot of skill on them.\nOlaf, if played correctly is very strong. But a lot of people mess it up. So his winrate is low.","replies":[{"poster":"Loko","date":"2016-06-16T03:10:47.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdTuhuu5lMY\n\nJust remembered this video from Gbay.

I have to say that personal skill is way more important than everyone else. Take thresh, for example: currently he has a 48% wr. I personally have about a 70% wr with him. What I'm saying is that if you personally suck at a champion, I fully agree that you shouldn't play ranked. If the world sucks at the champion, but you are godly, than screw the world.
