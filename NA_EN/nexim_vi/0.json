I was of course ecstatic becuase I've wanted to be on the PBE for a long while and I opened the email to find a link to create an account! \r\nhttps://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe-signup\r\nHowever, whenever I click the link, it just gives me a message saying:\r\nERROR: 500 Something has gone Hexagonally wrong. I checked the PBE client status and it says it's all fine. I've tried several times over the last few weeks to create my account but this always shows up!\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Mezorin","date":"2017-03-16T02:59:43.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue as detailed here.
