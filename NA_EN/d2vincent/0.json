I try to refresh, but then it reverts to the original Location/ISP it sets (also, the score it always gives is 0 and 3 games from the last week despite playing 3 games *tonight* and having played several games beforehand)","replies":[{"poster":"Viscarious","date":"2018-02-06T21:57:03.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One other thing to note, if you're experiencing ping spikes in game, I'd recommend looking at how much packet-loss you're getting since the ping reported through the game client can be influenced by packet-loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Viscarious","date":"2018-02-06T21:55:44.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi D2Vincent,\n\nSorry to hear that the Lag Report isn't identifying your correct ISP or Location. We have a database that associates IP addresses with cities and ISPs, but it isn't correct 100% of the time. To account for this, we've included a form for you to provide feedback, which we'll use to update our database.  From the Lag Report, there should be a red flag that you can click on to provide us feedback on your ISP and location. Alternatively, if you're logged in to the Lag Report, click on 'Change Location' then click on 'Provide Location and ISP Feedback.' We'll then work on getting your feedback incorporated into the Lag Report.\n\nThanks!","replies":[]}]}
