Now I&#039;m not saying he should be buffed or anything, (though perhaps a buff to his E and Passive would be appreciated) but I&#039;m curious as to what Riot thinks as to why Karthus is not nearly as played as other mids. Now, I don&#039;t remember much, but apparently he&#039;s showing up once or twice in LCS which means hopefully Karthus might be seeing some action by the general player now. I&#039;m just saying that the last time we saw Karthus in the Patch notes was about a couple months ago regarding a bug fix. At least give the poor guy a skin LOL.

This may sound like something true of most champions, but I'd expect it to be especially true of Karthus due to his low mobility and delayed Q  resulting in particularly difficult matchups against targets with either more range or mobility than him. He's also not a staple of competitive play (despite some occasional play), so that doesn't serve to boost his play rate either.\n\nAnyway, I can't verify that these are the reasons; just my guesses.","replies":[{"poster":"D2Vincent","date":"2015-08-15T16:45:00.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you suppose a small buff or 2 to either his E, Q, or Passive would help him gain some more fans among the other champs?

That just not favored by the meta at the moment. The meta favors more roam focused midlaners who can assert pressure early/mid game. That being said he doesn't need to roam because his ult allows him to basically AFK gank. so he has the best of both worlds.\n\nOther than that. He's low mobility, low CC, pretty much bringing nothing but damage to the table.

Teamfights start breaking out far too soon (for a Karthus), and your ADC is probably going to rotate mid (so you have to compete with them for your CS).\n\nThe multiple nerfs (a long, long, long time ago) on his Wall of Pain were possibly a bit too much. If one wants AoE-DPS damage, there are plenty of other champions who can do so, with either more mobility or utility attached, and certainly without requiring 10k gold to become effective.\n\nThat being said, once \"late, late game\" comes around (when Karthus has 13,000 - 16,000 Gold in items... that's 4 complete items + sorcerer shoes for those not counting), he is more than capable of pulling his own weight.\n\n If your other lanes are also winning, you make them \"win more\" with your ultimate to pick up kills/secure early teamfight objectives. If your other lanes are losing, you may as well concede the map for the next 15 minutes, because you cannot output sufficient pressure with your zero mobility, low turret clearing power (**note**: wave clear != turret damage), and an ulti on a 2 minute cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nekusen","date":"2015-08-15T21:44:39.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1- reduce the delay of his Q between cast and explosion\n\n2- increase his AA missile speed\n\n3- ult could have some kind of MR penetration","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2015-08-15T18:00:33.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about {{champion:143}}  ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2015-08-15T17:17:30.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy playing Karthus just because his voice is so incredible.
