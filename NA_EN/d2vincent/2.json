How is the jungle going to be tuned now that Smite rewards are gone? Will it be slightly easier to clear? will there be more lesser creatures to kill to take care of that? (like when we saw a total of 5 birds in raptor camp)\r\n\r\n2. With Rylai&#039;s soon to be nerfed in one of either MANY apparent directions, will mages be able to get a new item that&#039;ll at least fill the 100 AP item slot that it&#039;s leaving behind? (I think MM and I both vote for Pox Arcana and/or Netherstride Grimoire from BMB lol)\r\n\r\n3. I keep hearing that Masteries are the next thing to be discussed next week, after the discussion about the jungle/Plants have subsided. While I can wait till then to hear **Specific** masteries, I was wondering if any new ones will help out mages :P (Hey, I gotta look out for my karthus man!)\r\n\r\nAnd One Question pertaining to something not really related to Pre-Season, but I figured what the heck lol :P\r\n\r\nBONUS: When it comes to champs with &quot;After-Death&quot; Passives, Both Kalista and Ryze can basically do the same stuff with their ults (As far as I know), but one weird bit is that while Kalista can Ult Karthus while he&#039;s in his passive, Ryze Can&#039;t.

I'd argue Deathcap still fulfills an endgame niche _extremely_ well, with earlier purchase points on the best AP stackers. Comparatively, there's a lot of room to make an AP off-tank item that isn't just a bunch of HP and AP. Like (improvising here, might be bad) if ohmwrecker's statline also had 60 AP, and it's passive was replaced with \"Gain 5 movespeed per minion within a 100 unit radius, minions within the same radius gain 15 movespeed\" - AP tank tops have a way to compete with the stupidly strong phage passive, and both mid and tops get a mechanic that makes trading around minions more rewarding, and allows for stronger/faster pushing. The passive also gives the biggest boost in nexus defense scenarios, which is an area where tanks and (ap) offtanks tend to lag behind in my experience, if only due to damage dealers being massive at that point, making any CC a death sentence.\n\nEven Moonflair Spellblade on Summoner's Rift would be an excellent addition in my opinion.

In general the items that make a Mage feel like \"Okay, now I'm seriously STRONG\" have been demphasized and don't feel like they are there anymore.

After Deathcap's cost got increased to 3800 (being one of the most expensive items in the game) and Hourglass not giving 100 AP anymore with it's active, every AP champ that can afford to go Rylai's will definitely do so because the alternatives got shafted pretty hard. Deathcap is an odd item to balance because you either rush it first because it's super efficient or you don't and then you cannot finish it last that well due to it being a 3 item component which makes it hard to spread out the cost.
