I was mostly curious about the lack of inclusion of the Full Metal line of skins. Just curious if you guys were still going somewhere with that skin line considering it's Jayce's answer to Viktor's fully completed \"Glorious Evolution\", and it seems kinda weird how story-wise it's kinda one sided. >.>\r\n\r\nAlso because I'm still working on this Full Metal Karthus concept of mine since I'm running out of robot themes to try to put him into XD","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-01-25T08:25:08.969+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full Metal Jayce harkens back to a time before there were really stories or thematic lines for skins. If you see the concept for that skin it's really different and wasn't made to be part of anything; a sort of Art Deco Rocketeer type design that wouldn't look out of place in Bioshock Infinite. I always thought it was a nod to Samus Aran until I saw that concept. Full Metal Rammus is a robo-rammus that would have most likely been designed as a Mecha skin today. And Pantheon well, he kinda looks like he's post-apocalyptic wearing armour made from steel scraps rather than some kind of robotic suit.\n\nI guess, as we do when we're looking back at old themes, the first question would be 'what is it' and the second would be 'what does it offer players that is different to the plethora of tech skin thematics we currently have'. I think those would be really interesting questions for you to tackle along with the visual design of Full Metal Karthus. The longer I work as a concept artist the more I realise there is to this job beyond drawing cool stuff.\n\nLooking forward to it!","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-01-25T09:41:27.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This makes a lot of sense.\n\nWhat would you say are the possibilities for the Full Metal line?

If we have data to suggest that something like Undertaker Yorick fitting into the Gothic Horror line won't upset Yorick players then we'll do it. However if the tone or the reason people buy a skin is distinct we wouldn't do that. Full Metal might be something we do or don't revisit in future skins, but it's definitely it's own thing and we wouldn't change it as radically as mecha etc. I think if we reworked Vi, Neon Strike might become Super Galaxy but mostly in name not changing the design much.\n\nRight now they're having that conversation about Commando Galio. In my opinion Commando has a 80's action tone that is a little different from something as straight-laced as Special Forces or Arctic Ops, but how valuable is that for players? It's a tough one.\n\nOther Piltover champs getting full metal skins like Jayce makes sense. But then what about Pantheon and Rammus? Rammus actually does seem like Mecha, or Sad Robot Amumu, while Pantheon is almost a Road Warrior skin.

Skins that make sense in the canon of Runeterra, and may depict the champion wearing a different outfit or during a different part of their lives. Skins like Captain Fortune (which to me, is base Fortune now), Rugged Garen (which I thought of as Garen in a different part of his life), many Katarina and Jax skins (Angler Jax is just Jax going fishing!), etc.\n\nI've noticed that skins now tend to be the champion in some sort of alternate universe or in some fashion that makes it very unlikely they would ever actually appear that way on Runeterra (Candy King Ivern). Now I'm not saying I don't like these kinds of skins, I love a lot of them and they can be VERY impressive (Project Yi is the bomb)- I just love the character and immersion an in-universe skin (okay that's what I'm calling them) can bring, and playing them feels awesome. I'd be absolutely rocked off my flimflam if I saw a King Jarvan IV skin, or Human versions of any of the Ascended champions, etc.\n\nI know it might be impractical to do them given the limitations of such skins and the significant popularity and massive, fantastical, particle-changing potential of alt-universe skins and skin lines, but as it is so few in-universe skins come out. I know one post by me won't change anything, but do you have an opinion on this? Do you think the skins team will ever release in-universe skins with a regular cadence?\n\nP.S. in my headcanon Blood Moon Diana is completely in-universe and I fkin love that skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-01-28T07:10:36.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me start by saying if you think a skin works in-universe no Rioter is gonna tell you not to. This game and it's lore is for all of us to enjoy however we want to! Personally I love love LOVE the fanfiction/comics/art I see with character interactions and stories, often even more than the official lore.\n\nWhat you're describing we refer to as 'Lore Skins' and there's actually more than may first be apparent (although many are pre-retcon lore). Pre-void Kassadin, Acolyte Lee Sin, Jailbreak Graves, Spellthief Lux etc. You are right in noticing we haven't done any since the Bildgewater event. Myself and a few others who are big lore fans (like Ant in Oz) pitch the idea to do more semi-regularly but again you're right in guessing that they aren't nearly as popular as the big alternate universe skins we do. Also as other teams continue to build the lore of Runeterra it's difficult to co-ordinate with their efforts, and we wouldn't want to put out a skin that flys in the face of what they're working on either.\n\nI think the biggest opportunity for Lore skins is in characters that either had a drastically different past (such as Renekton before he was a Crocodile or Taliyah when she served Noxus) or who are on a journey and can be depicted at their height of power (Captain Fortune, Tyrant Swain, maybe Sivir if she ascended).

Great to hear a reply :) If you're interested, I'd like to show what themes I've been trying to use for Full Metal Karthus\n\nFor a bit of story for him, I've come up with the idea that a sentient \"AI\" was created as a surveillance program to monitor Battlecast activity. However, after witnessing endless carnage and destruction, he decided that peace can only be attained through ultimate destruction, and In this, he created a body for himself using prototype nano-machines as well as combined schematics from the previous models. Afterward, he turned on those who created him and destroyed the entire facility with the orbital satellite he once used after it was converted into a powerful laser.\n\nFor FMK I've been toying with the idea of Nano-machines and the like which would comprise his Passive, W, and maybe even his Q.
