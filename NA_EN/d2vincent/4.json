In my opinion these are several mages that need to be looked at: {{champion:63}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:1}} ~~and possibly {{champion:115}}.~~  \n\nBrand is a good example of an immobiole mage: he has power, combos, Teamfight, and CC. The reason i think he needs to be looked at though is because of his combos, i feel like they could be explored a bit more so their is more choice and less spamming. This is something ive thought about for awhile.  \n\nAnivia has a really interesting playstyle pre-6 in my opinion, hit them with Q+E for Damage, gotta use Q effectively its her only hard CC, the Wall is an awesome ability with a lot of potential. Then she hits 6 and her playstyle becomes a little more binary as her ult becomes the focus of everything she does. Im not saying this is bad or she becomes boring but i wish her ult augmented her playstyle rather than become her playstyle. I don't play her often though so my opinion on the matter is probably not reliable.  \n\nMalzahar is a very unique mage, i'd say he only needs help staying unique and powerful. His point-click Suppress is a lot of the reason people don't want him strong and i understand that, but they only need to try playing him against a competent opponent who knows how to deal with his kit to see that Malz isnt as strong as people think. Plus he is becoming more and more of a niche pick, only viable against certain champions, although currently a lot of those champs are meta right now.  \n\nAnnie is toxic. Ridiculously strong, with an instant AoE nuke stun. Her kit is too easy and too strong, it doesn't take much time to learn how to stack your passive without alerting your enemy which eliminates counterplay. She needs to be toned down, her passive needs to be reworked or at least its interaction with her Ult.  \n\n~~Ziggs, he seems pretty feast or famine, he is either stomping or feeding it seems. I don't play him nor see him all that often but when i do thats the feeling i get.~~  \n\nSorry for the long comment, I just like talking about things that interest me, the Immobiole Mages interest me.  \n\n**EDIT:** There is a bit of misunderstanding on what i meant in my comment. I am only speaking from my personal experience, so the champs i've mentioned and the issues i have are personal. If i didn't mention a champ its because i don't have any experience with them and don't know anything about their place in the game and whether they need work or not. I am also not talking about whether they are too strong or too weak, except Annie who i think is too strong, these are more issues i have with their gameplay or their core identities. Hopefully that clears up a lot of the misunderstandings.","replies":[{"poster":"Melondrama","date":"2015-11-30T00:15:58.081+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:143}} ??????","replies":[{"poster":"MelanLady","date":"2015-11-30T05:26:10.132+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, she needs some work. Very least her plants need fixing. Change them so that champions gain attack priority when in range rather than her having to land a successful auto on them. It makes the plants so weak that the enemy can walk out of range then walk back in and kill them in 2-3 autos. Make them have to choose: take some damage to get rid of the plants or be zoned away from an area. Her passive is trash as well. People new to her don't realise what it is and sit there half the time until it expires or shoot it randomly, and usually the enemy can move out of range by the time the cast time is over. She just needs her plants ai tweaked and a new passive. Perhaps every so often she gets an empowered seed that when transformed has greater range or slow depending on the plant type.

Many champions can actually walk out of range of it before you even have the chance to shoot it. The biggest reason I hate her passive is not because it's hard to land, but because of how little use you can get out of death passives in general. Sion's is okay I guess and Karthus' Death Defied is amazing because with his short range and squishiness he's bound to die in a team fight and staying in the fight while being untargetable ensures that he can cast requiem uninterrupted. However, Zyra has long range and has nothing in her kit that would make dying a plus for her. In many situations you can't even finish off a target even if you hit your passive and if you have a perfect game then you just don't have a passive that game.

The changes to his ult. basically kill the poke style many of us AP Kog mains enjoyed. Moreover, an on-hit build is way too slow for mid and also doesn't fulfill the role's requirements. If a mid laner lacks significant CC, they need great waveclear and poke. Kog's lane is more punishing than ever but even if you get your items, the team rarely has enough peel/CC to allow it to be effective. Burst, waveclear and poke are what mid-lane is supposed to contribute if you want to win. \n\nThe old Kog variant was not only stronger in lane but provided better burst and poke while also scaling way better as a reward. This allowed him to contribute to the team somewhat safely barring engages and gave windows to come back too. Now, if you have to get into 710 range for 6 seconds with no hard CC, no defense and only mediocre damage output, all of Kog's weaknesses are amplified 100 fold. However, due to the nerfs to his ult.'s  damage >50% HP (as well as increased cost and duration until mana reset), you are forced to use W a lot more even in AP builds just so you're not completely useless. This makes mid-lane extremely unforgiving and his early was weak even before the rework. If you have to play such an unsafe style with him for a meaningful contribution, W needs to scale way better with AP or have a higher base damage.\n\nNo one really asked for a Kog rework and we weren't asked for feedback regarding its direction. It's not fair to change him so drastically that one of his favorite lanes actually becomes uncompetitive in ranked. I've played hundreds of AP Kog games and he's my favorite champion.\n\nThere are many other Kog threads with suggestions. We'd like some direction and all our favorite lanes to be viable. Although, I will say that the changes to W probably make Kog JG nearly viable and that's something I've tried a lot before the rework with pretty unimpressive results.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7g8eEjfA-dont-fix-something-thats-not-broken\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/txlGL51M-so-meddler-said-koggy-is-the-sustained-damage-centerpiece-adc?show=flat\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/yAOq9HeA-lets-congratulate-the-new-adc-with-the-lowest-winrate-and-a-way-forward","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-11-30T12:42:01.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there is anything that should be looked at, it should be the Mages who currently overly rely on {{item:3157}} such as Kennen, Fiddlesticks, and such as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2015-11-29T21:49:07.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tvkA4lci,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-11-29T20:43:09.147+0000)\n>\n> Mages, immobile ones especially, are probably the class we'll look at next.

Brand - Before the new keystone he was just outclassed by everything. There is a place for him now in the game but not sure if it ll still be like that once he gets nerfed\n\nAlso for a combo heavy AOE mage he has just few core combos (Compared to le bl for example If you are master withle bl then you know she has atleast 30 core combos while brand has like what ? 7-8 core combos That doesnt make him combo mage?) \n\n**So he should definetly be the one who needs some love **\n2. Malzahar - what is he a lockdown mage with toxic scallings ???? \nDefinetly needs some love personaly i would like him to be more pet reliant tricky etc \n\n3. Midlane Velkoz he overlaps a bit with malzahar and syndra.. give him unique input\n\n4. Zyra well she became a support over years what else to say \n\n5. Swain. Reduce dmg increase tankyiness.

Anivia has identity as a anti juggernaut champion according to lcs atleast. She is quite tanky mage which excells vs low mobility champions \n(Not saying she is bad vs high mobility champions as she can stop their jumps mid air with w)\n\n3. Xerath is the poke mage - so definetly identity there\n\n4. Ziggs is a poke/zone mage with some waveclear  unique enough though he is in weak spot (Yes he does have some mobility so i am not sure if you count him)\n\n5. Annie is one of the best engage champions in the game. Whether it is toxic you should honestly keep it because it is the only reason this noob friendly champion is valuable in high elo. She could use some tweaks but not a rework \n\n6. Cassiopeia ehm she is kite-hypercarry \n\n7. Lux is utility mage with ranged burst (Doesnt overlap with xerath because once she hits you with one spell you die, unlike xerath who pokes you continualy and the tries to kill you with r + she has shield)\n\n8. Orianna teamfight scalling utility mage\n\n9. Viktor ehm kite control mage which can be played defensive early because of shield \n\n10. Donger.

Yeah she's a safe pick, hard to kill, but going 0/0 won't carry any games, and her snowball potential is very lacking too.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SeveredKidsFeet","date":"2015-11-29T23:38:55.374+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}}  {{champion:101}}  {{champion:101}}  {{champion:101}}  {{champion:101}}  {{champion:101}}  {{champion:101}}  \n**BOUND BUT NOT BROKEN**","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2015-11-30T02:21:36.272+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Far, _FAR_ from broken.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Luminum","date":"2015-11-30T04:29:05.433+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Powerofdenait","date":"2015-11-30T00:29:48.514+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most inmobile champ who need an update is {{champion:9}} , at the moment he cant jungle and it was one of the first junglers but ... ok, all the new champ has any kind of CC that can counter him, and the new Ap jungle item is usless for him","replies":[]}]}
