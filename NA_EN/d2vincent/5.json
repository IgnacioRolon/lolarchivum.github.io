Here I go: \n\n1. **Will each game mode have it&#039;s own list of banned champs?**\n\n    For those who don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about, during URF, there was a small list of champs that couldn&#039;t be played during the game, and in One for All, both Karthus and Teemo were banned during the event due to &quot;potential Toxic playstyles&quot;, my question is, will each game mode have particular champs that couldn&#039;t be played, or will certain champs be tweaked specifically during these games so they too can be played?\n\n2. **Will there be new items specific to certain game modes?**\n\n         From what I remember, Black Market Brawlers had it&#039;s own slew of special bilgewater items that accompanied the game mode that it used (I don&#039;t know much about it, I never actually played it). My question is that for each game mode, will there be any new items to go with those particular game modes? On the flipside, will there be certain items omitted from these game modes?\n\n3. **Will we see the return of Butcher&#039;s Bridge, or even new maps?**\n\n         While I never played BMB, I did play ARAM on the Butcher&#039;s Bridge and I rather liked the idea of different variations on maps, so I&#039;m curious if we&#039;ll see it&#039;s triumphant return. On top of that, I&#039;m also interested if we&#039;ll ever see a new map to fit some game modes, like an official shuriman map if Ascended comes back, or perhaps even a Piltover/Zaun map on URF or something like that. \n\n4. **Future Featured Features?**\n(Try saying this 5 times fast LOL)\n\n         Once this goes live, will all future featured game modes be permanently put into this cycle? I mean depending on how successful the featured game mode is, will it permanently make it into the featured Queue automatically? or will we have to wait about a month maybe to gather data first?\n\nJust a few questions and thoughts I had about this new Featured Game Queue, What are your thought? Riot Feedback is appreciated! :D","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2016-03-08T00:19:29.392+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice question list. Here we go.\n\n**1. Will each game mode have it's own list of banned champs?**\n\nTL;DR: Our goal is always to have _**NO champions unavailable in ANY of our game modes**_. \n\nI think it really sucks when you love Champ X, and get excited to play them in one of our modes, only to discover \"sorry, Champ X not available\". :/ After 2014 URF, we actually made sure to have everyone available for 2015 URF, which we're hoping was way more fun for people who loved those champs.\n\n**2. Will there be new items specific to certain game modes?**\n\nI don't want to say \"never\", but unless the mode is specifically exploring that kind of  gameplay (IE: Black Market Brawlers) I would say \"no, we don't aim to dev mode specific unique items.\"\n\n**3. Will we see the return of Butcher's Bridge, or a even new maps?**\n\nThat Butcher's Bridge map was gorgeous, I loved it too. I'm not directly involved with it, but I hope we can see it again as well.\n\nAn entire new map just for a specific featured game mode is a pretty big task. I'm not sure if we'd go that far, right now our main focus is on finishing this queue. :)\n\n**4. Future Featured Features?**\n\nYes, the Rotating queue will be the new home for Featured Game Modes. As to how frequently modes come back, you're right, we'll need to consider each one case-by-case.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempura King","date":"2016-03-08T00:38:27.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I read what people say is that the queue is only there 2 times a week.\n\nFrom what I understand the queue is there at all week long but it the gamemode is changed every week.\nExample:\n1st week URF all week\n2nd week hexakill all week\n3rd week NURF all week\nand so on...\n\nSo which one is it?\n\nMade a thread but it got buried fast so trying to ask here now.","replies":[{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2016-03-08T03:12:09.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"current planning is that new queue will be available on weekends.

So why not have that as a seasonal alternative to Howling Abyss, similar to the halloween and winter versions of Summoner's Rift that for some reason aren't around anymore. You could have it as a 50/50 chance in regular ARAM too. A lot of people want more maps with updated gameplay, and especially now with the removal of Dominion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-03-08T19:43:20.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yes, the Rotating queue will be the new home for Featured Game Modes.

Maybe a 9 day run (weekend through weekend) instead of the 2.5ish days it seems like FGMs will run for?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Troll King","date":"2016-03-08T08:11:26.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, Rotating Queue is a permanent feature, but it's just that the game modes will be in rotation??\n\nDoes this mean that a Feature Game Mode will be available to play every week (rotating in-between Game Modes)?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's count how many Featured Game Modes there are:\n1. Ascension\n2. URF\n3. Doom Bots\n4. Black Market Brawlers\n5. One-For-All\n6. Hexakill\n7. Legend of the Poro King\n\n(Did I miss any???)\n\nSo 7 total Featured Game Modes. There are like 52 weeks in a year, so 52/7 is just a little over 7 (appr. 7.4).\n\nSo, does this mean that each Featured Game Mode will be playable ~7 times each year (in the Rotating Queue)???\n\n*Obviously not 7 times each this year, since it's already March.....almost April....\n\nIf so, then I can deal with having a featured game mode every week. \n\nP.S.---just remember to make sure that URF is 40-50 of those 52 weeks for the Rotating Queue....because we seriously need some variety.","replies":[{"poster":"TheProAndrew","date":"2016-03-08T08:55:11.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u missed \"nemesis mode\" where u pick ur enemy champ (all games with {{champion:72}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:266}} etc..)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-03-08T00:31:52.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One question I have. Since it seems like the Rotational Q becomes available on Weekends. Does that mean we won't get any other featured game modes except those on Rotation?\n\nI mainly ask in conjunction with Events. Ascension and BMB were made as part of an event, and pretty much lasted the length of said event. Are we not going to have such big events now that we are supporting the rotational Q? (Not having dedicated game modes tied to events.)\n\nOne more question actually. Can we expect Dominion to show up in the rotational Q at some point? I know the Dominion Q's weren't enough to support full time, But I hope the game mode is not gone for good.
