Champion icons on the minimap are miniscule (though recall animations on it are the correct scale, oddly), though the real issue is the cursor: its at what feels like about 1/4 scale of what it should be. I lose track of it in fights, farming, heck, even just running around. At this point it's just bad enough to put me off playing.\r\n\r\nAre there any plans for 4k support? Or allowing scalability of icons in-game?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T00:54:34.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't currently *officially* support 4k monitors AFAIK, but if you'd like you can go ahead and hit up our friendly neighborhood tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they've got any tricks up their sleeve for getting that to display better!","replies":[{"poster":"SarcasticShepard","date":"2017-09-28T22:19:31.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late update on the ticket, but after much discussion with support, I have found that there exists no fix, at least, internal fix for the problem, apart from the cumbersome suggestion of adjusting the resolution of your screen and the game before and after to accommodate. \n\nBasically, looks I'll have to see what other people with 4k monitors have done.","replies":[]}]}]}
