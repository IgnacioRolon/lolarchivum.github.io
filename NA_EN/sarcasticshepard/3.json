I suppose drop isn't the right word, because I typically get about 200+ fps and these drops plunge me down into the range of about 15 for about a second, which results in the game appearing to seize up. Some background: my PC is higher end of the custom market, my ping is about 24-27 and I don't have anything intensive running I play I stick the setting down to the lowest.\nSo when this happens I lose about a second or two of gameplay, which has been lethal to me and my team. I ran through the list of 'fixes' recommends (side note: \"disable all ingame sounds\"? Seriously?). Still no positive change. Anybody have any alternative ideas to keep this game from chugging harder than a PC trying to showcase the Fallout 4 mini-nuke minigun?\n\nEdit: tried verifying the game a second time, because I'm honestly out of ideas. Now I need to reboot the whole client to actually get into the actual gameplay. Soooo, yeah. Now I'm really unhappy.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-08T23:50:43.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many background apps do you have running, and do any of them draw over League.
