I'm pretty sure this is due to something with how the game loads visuals, because the lockups will happen most often the first time in-game a ability is used. (Naturally, this has caused deaths for me.) \n\nThe issue itself is unique to League, and I can play any of my other games without this issue occurring, so I'm ~95% sure it's not caused by a driver or other piece of software. Ping is also not a possible source; I play on a wired connection and my ping sits around 26-ish. \n\nI do have a workaround, in the form of doing a file validation every time there is an update though this means I have to repair the game every patch (the irony there is not lost on me). Basically, I'd really like help finding a permanent solution to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T21:01:34.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's probably really frustrating needing to repair after every patch....and definitely doesn't make much sense. There might be some corrupted files hiding somewhere in your install, so honestly I would suggest grabbing the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and trying a clean uninstall and reinstall. I know it's not the best solution, but that should make sure any messed up files and removed entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"SarcasticShepard","date":"2017-05-22T22:44:58.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't sell yourself short; if its certain to wipe any bad files for the game, it's a pretty good solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T01:34:49.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D'aaaww thanks for the support mah porobro!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
