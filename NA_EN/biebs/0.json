My connection speed if pretty great I have around 30-40 down and a stellar 30-40 up. I have no idea why I'm having this connection issue and I've not seen a record of someone having anything similar. It started about 2 days ago, so I doubt anything has changed in that time. If anyone could provide some help that would be great. I've already tried a DNS flush, port forwarding, and closing out things like Steam and Spotify.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T19:39:26.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with solid internet, you can still have issues connected to specifically servers like the game server.  You've tried some solid steps so far which is great, but I also recommend a full run through of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.
