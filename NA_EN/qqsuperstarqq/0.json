The visual update Soraka got in 2014 looks terrible compared to all of the champions league haves now. All the other supports look good for the current season. While soraka still looks like a 2014 champion. I want her to have a full visual rework, i think they could really do an amazing job with her seeing, how nice Morgana turned out.","replies":[]}
