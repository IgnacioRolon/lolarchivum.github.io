I&#039;m focused more on the champs that are being intentionally left out of the meta this season. \n\n**List of AP Casters needing help**\n\n-Orianna\n-Xerath  \n-Ziggs\n-Cassiopeia\n-Karthus\n\nI know, I know you hate me for putting karthus on this list because that ult lolz:P\n\nHonestly I know orianna has been in the competitive scene way too much but i thought the goal for this season was to make any strategy viable, but it seems like the last couple of patches have almost all been indirect nerfs to all AP casters barring viktor whose ability to stay safe and wave clear with relatively low mana costs.\n\nXerath is a different beast entirely the buffs to AD assassins and the release of the reworked Maw which allows an AD assassin to give up almost nothing besides some flat AD to be able to gain 50 MR and a huge Magic shield when they take too much damage seems a little off balance, i can understand that the item was intended  to assist assassins and ADs in general but i feel because the MR was raised soo much from the last maw it doesnt need to have such a big shield.\n\nZiggs along with orianna are probably the 2 closest champs to being meta on this list ( i know some of you will argue that orianna is still meta please dont hate me) but i understand giving ziggs some early game ult strength was an attempt to help him but ziggs was never meant as an early game explosive(excuse the accidental pun)  champ he was always a mid to late game poke champ.  Which will continue to push him outta the snowball early to mid game meta but i think even the item suggested later might be strong enough to bring him back as his mid game poke is very good.\n\nCassiopeia is one of the saddest cases on this list because she was on the forefront of strong champs for a couple patchs in season 5 before she was randomly and abruptly ripped from viability. The release of Updated Ryze(AKA Super Cassiopeia) coupled with the release of the new Maw and other early game AD items have made her way less viable plus a meta that forces games to end early. \n\nKarthus I know you all hate his ult when you get low health after a fight in lane and he ults you and then you say &quot;a few choice words&quot; but once again hes a champ that hasnt been in the meta for a very long time as far as AP casters go hes completely lost for so many seasons, making a rare appearance every once in a while in a cheese competitive comp but for the most part hes a champion that hasn&#039;t been viable for a long time, to be honest if he was given some more early game help in exchange for some of his late game I&#039;m sure all the karthus mains will be thanking riot for the gift.\n\n**Possible help options**\n-New AP Armor item to help in this new AD heavy meta \n-Nerfs to {{item:3156}} \n-Individual Early game in exchange for late game buffs, but this would only fix short term\n\nThanks for reading this article, would love to hear some feedback about my ideas in the comments!","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-02-05T18:55:10.815+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"-Orianna is fine\n-Xerath is fine, poke just isn't meta, although his ult is too unreliable. \n-Ziggs is fine, poke just isn't meta\n-Cassiopeia is getting used in LCS some even.

It means if you coddle your AD assassin, he will get ahead, get armor pen items, be even with the AP champs in strength vs each other, but the main role of AD assassins will be lowering the damage of ADCs, either via death or forced HP/Armor items in order to survive. \n\nIt gives AD assassins a clearer purpose other than \"just hope you 1 shot something somewhat squishy.\"\n\nIf you ask me, more AP armor items would be great. They shouldn't get a free ride in lane against AP champs when they're strong just because most of them are squishy. They should get a free ride vs the ADC if their team actually helps them get ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2016-02-05T22:16:47.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you give mages easy access to armor, what's stopping players from abandoning non-marksman AD champions altogether? By devaluaing the power of autos you reduce the power of every AD champion that doesn't build as a glasscannon--which therefore pushes all of your priority into mages and AP bruisers like Rumble and Diana because they can build defensively without losing your offensive stat lines. As much as I want to see a reduction in Marksmen, I don't think providing armor to mages is the right answer.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-02-05T19:24:11.305+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ziggs is getting a late game nerf?
