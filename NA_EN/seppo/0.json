I have been working on mapping out the cities of Runeterra for a project and when it comes to Piltover and Zaun I am absolutely lost.  The story goes that after Zaun tried to bomb a canal between Piltover and itself it resulted in a failure, Zaun sunk down and then Piltover created the sun gates above Zaun which act as the original Zaunites intended, a safe passageway through western and eastern Valoran.  That being said, in no depiction of Piltover ANYWHERE that I could find (if there is please link it, I'm desperate), Zaun is nowhere near the water or the coast.  The link posted shows that there is clearly no city below the large dam classified as the sun gates.  Even in images like [this one](https://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/factions/image-gallery/zaun-collecttechmaturgy.jpg) or [this other one](https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https%3A%2F%2Funiverse-meeps.leagueoflegends.com%2Fv1%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fpiltover_environment_01.jpg&amp;resize=:1200) there is no room or depiction of Zaun at all.  Even on an image like [this one](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/region/piltover/?mv=highlights), could the right side of the picture be of where Zaun is?  If thats the case then how did piltover build the sungates over them when those same sungates are on the left side of the image?  \nMy main problem is that, given the knowledge and depictions of Zaun to Piltover, Zaun is more like a crack in the earth, like a large slab fell into the ground of piltover(which is kind of what happened), but if Zaun is in the middle of Piltover where is the water that should have flood into Zaun constantly from the ocean?  If I am completely wrong in my assessment of the sun gates please let me know, because all the images of the sun gates show absolutely no trace of a possible city and most depictions of Zaun show them fully immersed into the city of piltover.\nNow, I understand that this may just be me messing something up somewhere, or a miscommunication with concept artists (coordinating all this information is really hard, no blame :)).  Can someone try and explain how the city is laid out?  What I have so far is conglomerated through the images I have linked beforehand and [this one](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/8b/Piltover_Zaun_LoR_Background.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20191022172320). \nWhat it looks like is that judging by the world map, the sun gates have to be facing North to South.  Thus, the majority of piltover will be located on the landmasses between the sungates and on the water in between which is seen.  The sun gates are a dam that changes the waterlevel severely on the eastern(?) side which is kept very high, compared to the western(?) side which is low due to the explosion that Zaun created. Since Zaun fell, piltover built NOT the sun gates but just more of the city above using bridges to navigate between the split terrain while Zaun slowly excavated and did a similar thing lower into the ground creating their buildings and architecture.  The sun gates are then created further north, (closer to the Valoran side) to profit off of the possible trade and market values that Zaun had seen beforehand.  \nYes, I know I edited the story to have it make logical sense based on my description of the city, but I honestly just want a clear map or mental image of what a map of the city would look like.  One that isn't inconsistent based on the source images.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2020-01-04T04:22:57.824+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, fellow cartographer!\n\nI was tasked, a while ago, to map out Piltover and Zaun, so I absolutely know and understand your pain.  Not sure how much I can get away with saying here, today, but heck - everyone's asleep so let's map-chat!\n\n_STANDARD DISCLAIMER: Nothing said here can be 100% relied upon to go forward.  Unless it's published and translated to all the appropriate languages, it's subject to change because posting in one place in one language is a lousy way to distribute information.  Use with caution.  The State of California says it may cause cancer._\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was dealing with the two 'sea level' heights - one one side of the Sun Gates, the water level is clearly very much higher than on the other.  Now, while it's tempting to use a dam or something, for Piltover and Zaun, they are both of them open water.  Piltover and Zaun are on an isthmus between the two continents, with the lower ocean on the SE side, and access to the higher seas between Valoran and Shurima on the NW side.  While it might initially seem a bit nutty to have different sea levels, this is actually something that does happen in the real world due to the rotation of the planet, the movement of the moon, and the geometry of coastlines and oceans.  Earth doesn't have anything quite as _extreme_ as this, but it's a matter of scale, not of possibility.\n\nNext, and I'm not sure you even mentioned it in your post, is the River Pilt.  Having a river flow onto an isthmus is challenging, but not impossible.  I recommend just tweaking the heights/contour lines until you get it working pretty well.  I had it dumping out into the lower sea.  However, it dropped very suddenly to do so, resulting in quite a few stepped waterfalls.  At least, it used to.  Until the explosions.\n\nThen, the caves and reinforced edges of what was Zaun on the waterfall collapsed into what are effectively long sinkholes - creating several chasms at or near the lower sea level, with the River Pilt crashing down into the first one and making its way through what is effectively mineral Swiss cheese of crevices, underwater caves, and the like, until dumping out in a very polluted fashion on the SE side.  These chasms are approximately perpendicular to the Sun Gates to the NE.  When the chasms opened, the riverbed drained, revealing new prime building space (New Town style) for what would be called Piltover.\n\nGotta go before the lore-police finds me.

The Sun Disc, Mount Targon,  the Frostguard Citadel. It would be so cool and would breathe so much more life into the map.\n\nHaving the ability to zoom in to much finer details, with as you've trademarked* mapception, was something that was discussed when the player-facing map was being created.\n\nAt the time I thought it was a fine idea!  As long as it wasn't me who was required to create a google-Earth style level of detail for three continents and change worth of landmasses (not to mention oceans).  Basically, I would keep responding with \"Ha ha!  F*** off.\" or words to that effect.\n\nI realize that makes me the baddie, but at the time, we were behind schedule for getting the map out as it was.\n\nHowever, that doesn't preclude the possibility of having mapception in the future.  I'd certainly welcome it with the appropriate support, etc.  For example, while I love making a good map - my maps are, shall we say, 'functional' in appearance ;)  I.e. ugly as sin.  So there would need to be art support, not to mention the technical support to bring the feature to the site.  And probably UX - those folks get forgotten about, but without them, we'd get lost in menus and hate buttons for no discernible reasons.\n\nTL;DR - I'd like to see mapception.  I stopped the feature during initial development because it was scope creep, but I'd welcome it now.  It would need skillful people to support it.","replies":[{"poster":"Seppo","date":"2020-01-04T22:40:12.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does seem like a Scope Creep issue, is it reasonable to hope for a small number of town maps (Like the Medarda Heirloom) to be released eventually?

Regardless, even if Riot doesn't know exactly what the address of Jayce's workshop is, its easy to see that it is located in Bluewind court in North Piltover, the concept art shows it against the cliffs meaning it is either facing towards the west on the upper part of Piltover or facing away from the cliff on the lower side of Piltover, assuming I interpreted all of Bioluminesecence's hints properly.
