I wonder if could someone help me, so I got into (C:)/RiotGames/League of Legends/Rads/projects/lol_air_client_config_eune/releases/0.0.0.46/deploy/lol and I kinda changed the \"lol\" file so I could disconnect from the pvp.net and play without anyone bugging me, and the problem is that I cant connect now. And please dont tell me about firewall and stuff I already tried everything, PLEASE HELP, any response appreciated.

I recommend repairing your client and avoid making adjustments to your files.  You can do this quickly through the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) if you're not on the updated client.  That should get you reconnected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"montanaskiracer","date":"2016-12-15T16:06:46.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been have the same problem when I try to get into league it wont connect to the server and it gives a link to a help page that is a long waste of time cause none of those seem to work in fixing the problem. I have tried repairing and reinstalling neither seemed to help. Tried different times of the day and closing anything else like pandora that is using internet. Before I repaired the client I could get into the main menu but on the bar below it would read Unable to connect to chat, you may reconnect manually. This was the most frustrating thing, like your almost there but if you play a game or anything you wont connect to the game then youll get a ban for some time because you couldn't get in the game. Fix this problem","replies":[]}]}
