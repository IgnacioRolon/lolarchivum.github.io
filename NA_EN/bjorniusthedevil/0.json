It sounds from that error message that something is probably going wrong with some of your drivers, so I'd suggest going through and making sure you've got all of those properly updated especially your graphics drivers. If that doesn't seem to help, shoot our tech guys a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and make sure to send over some R3D logs that you can generate using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool).","replies":[{"poster":"BjorniusTheDevil","date":"2017-08-21T12:40:53.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the help, I have already updated all of my drivers, as far as i know. I'll look into that a bit more. I've also made a Ticket with the Lol Logs attatched to them... I hope the tech team can find anything.","replies":[]}]}]}
