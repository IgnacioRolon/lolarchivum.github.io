You sir, have a way with words xD!\n\nBasically what's going on with this is: your game client was able to detect certain files that are damaged/missing/corrupted/eaten by a hungry poro. When it picks up on that, it's trying to fix up those issues but apparently, it doesn't quite fully solve the problem. Try grabbing our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool), and make sure to run it with **Force Repatch** turned on. \n\nGive that tool a go, test it in a custom game, and let me know if that helped!","replies":[{"poster":"puzi","date":"2017-07-30T02:58:46.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will most certainly give it a go my dude.
