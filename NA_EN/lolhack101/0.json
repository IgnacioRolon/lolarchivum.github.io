{"poster":"LOLHack101","date":"2016-01-04T22:26:00.554+0000","title":"[MAJOR] The Most Shocking Conspiracy About Leblanc","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":97,"down_votes":18,"body":"[Spoiler/Warning] This post is about to reveal the most terrible truth about Lux and Leblanc, so please read as your own risk.[Spoiler/Warning] \n\n*  I think I just discovered major secret about Leblanc, it's all started when I analyzed one of Leblanc's joke:\n\n> {{champion:7}} : Lying is, like, ninety five percent (95%) of what I do.\n\n* It sounds normal, right ? But if you use \"Reverse Psychology\" you'll know that she's technically lying now. Which means she's honest 95% of all the time, and only lying for 5%. Then....\n\n> {{champion:7}} : For my next trick I'll make their life bar disappear.\n\n* Again, if you use Reverse Psychology, she meant that her next trick will make your life bar full. Hence, she's a healer. Who's the strongest healer in the game ? The answer is {{champion:16}} . Oh wait! Let's take a close look at their weapons !\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tJoB3Jo.png\n\n* What did you notice ? They both use staff as a weapon. Not just that both staffs have similar shape (You know like a C shape, or waxing crescent moon). Coincident ? I guess not. Remember both champs used to have a single target silence that have no counter play; those were so toxic that Riot had to remove or rework 'em. \n* Mind blowing ? It's not over yet !\n\n> {{champion:7}} : Looks can be deceiving.\n\n* If you inspect this line in game, you'll hear something like \"Lux can be deceiving\". Leblanc is giving us a hint that Lux..... can be deceiving ?\n* Okay it doesn't make any sense but if you take a look at {{champion:99}} 's Lore.\n\n> In Lux's lord, Lux tricked Morgana to give Lux a demonstration of {{champion:25}} 's binding. Lux studied, mimic-ed Morgana's binding and made her own spell (Lux has \"Spell Thief\" in her skin line). \n\n* Damn Lux ! You're such cunning and.... !Deceiving! ? . Holy moly ! It all makes sense now. Lux mimic-ed Morgana's spell, who else can mimic spell ??? {{champion:7}} 's ultimate. So, Lux is Leblanc ? Let's take a look at Leblanc's splashart.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3luTqhm.jpg?1\n\n* As you notice, Leblanc splash has 2 face expressions there. Real Leblanc looks innocence and worried, the Leblanc clone's face looks intriguing  like it's about to do something really Evil. So my assumption is that Lux is Leblanc's clone !!!! Alright, here are proofs.\n\n> {{champion:99}}: Light mage? I'm just an ordinary mage.\n\nHow can you not be a Light mage ? You literally just shoot rainbow, light, even banish the shadow. Ofc, you're Leblanc's clone who is an ordinary mage (not Light mage). Well atleast Leblanc clone was being honest.  \n\n* Here's another proof. When Lux dies, she'll disappear into thin light, why don't we see her body  ? Because she's not real, she's an illusion of Leblanc. Just like Leblanc's clone Lux disappear upon death.\n\n* Let's get to the most important part ! We all know that in Leblanc, she likes to pretend to be Jarvan, the fourth. Dont you think it's a little bit  creepy and pointless ? My  conspiracy is that Leblanc wanted approach Lux and expose her when she's at least cautious.\n\n\n_So the whole game was a lie ? Leblanc was the true hero who urge to fix her mistake? And Lux is Evil ? So is Lux even a champion ? if so what happened to the real Lux ? What has the clone done to her ? It'll be never unraveling.\n\n{{champion:7}} : Tricky aren't you ?\n\n* Can someone just explain this BS ?\n\nTL;DD - Overall conspiracy:\n*  Leblanc used to be a healer support.\n*  Leblanc is heroic.\n* Lux is Evil.\n* Lux is Unreal.\n* Leblanc isn't an awful person like most of use thought.\n* {{champion:7}} : Looks can be deceiving. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2016-01-04T22:39:53.426+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/009/832/dafuq-did-i-just-read-meme.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"HenryDahNewb","date":"2016-01-06T06:42:29.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Boulderox,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=f9nN1n83,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-04T22:39:53.426+0000)\n>\n> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/009/832/dafuq-did-i-just-read-meme.jpg\n\nwhen a meme gets more upvotes than the post. lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi Im Jackie","date":"2016-01-06T04:11:31.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Boulderox,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=f9nN1n83,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-04T22:39:53.426+0000)\n>\n> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/009/832/dafuq-did-i-just-read-meme.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heretic Lunari","date":"2016-01-04T23:02:44.796+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://media0.giphy.com/media/11qAyKz9AbFEYM/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"IS1a442cd69a169ed293a39","date":"2016-01-05T12:08:04.931+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MoonMoon95,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=f9nN1n83,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-01-04T23:02:44.796+0000)\n>\n> https://media0.giphy.com/media/11qAyKz9AbFEYM/giphy.gif\n\nhttp://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/741/499/514.php","replies":[{"poster":"Sweaty Samuraii","date":"2016-01-05T15:16:26.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IS1a442cd69a169ed293a39,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=f9nN1n83,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-01-05T12:08:04.931+0000)\n>\n> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/741/499/514.php\n\nim gunna make a theory that Uncle ben commited suicide over being shot...","replies":[{"poster":"IS1a442cd69a169ed293a39","date":"2016-01-05T15:20:48.148+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xxillumanati01xX,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=f9nN1n83,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-01-05T15:16:26.289+0000)\n>\n> im gunna make a theory that Uncle ben commited suicide over being shot...\n\nhttp://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/741/494/bcf.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ClemJohn2","date":"2016-01-06T02:30:06.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet another meme that began on 4chan.","replies":[{"poster":"Sweaty Samuraii","date":"2016-01-07T13:59:02.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all meme's come from 4chan... or reddit.... or depressed 12 year old girls on tumblr (i.e. amumu might be a tumblr girl{{champion:32}} )","replies":[]},{"poster":"IS1a442cd69a169ed293a39","date":"2016-01-06T15:04:15.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ClemJohn2,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=f9nN1n83,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2016-01-06T02:30:06.011+0000)\n>\n> Yet another meme that began on 4chan.\n\nYou don't sound happy.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-01-04T23:56:40.417+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said it before and I'll say it again. {{champion:7}} got so fed she killed all the other champs, broke out of Summoners Rift, destroyed the League of legends and is now posing as every champ in the game to keep the citizens unaware.

Swain was, with her for various points. In the mean time, her clones were:\n\nmasquerading as Jarvan 4, forcing Katarina to work with Garen to prevent a Demacian-Noxian War, whilte J4 was kidnapped or possibly dead.\nA clone was also disguised as Swain so that Swain could embarrass someone challenging him for the highest post in Noxus. After this, the real Swain came back (unnoticed by the crowd), and he ordered Darius to execute the challenge.\n\nLeBlanc herself has never appeared in the League's events(ie, you are playing as LeBlanc's clone in game), it is a cleverly made clone. The actual LeBlanc's last appearance is unknown.\n\nIt's easy to just consider her League's equivalent of Dr. Doom.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf206105905","date":"2016-01-05T16:02:44.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay first of all, all of these champions are too old to have such convoluted plot twists, it's mostly because of the design style of Riot back in the day.\n\nSecond, LeBlanc is not her real name.
