Please help.\n\nIf anyone else is having issues please let me know. I hope im not the only one\n\nEdit: Its been 2 days of this lag. Ive troubleshooted everything and im almost positive its not on my end. Please let me know if im not the only one!\n\nRiot as you can see there is not a problem on our end. Clearly its a server issue due to the new patch. Issues arriving after the update should not be left untreated. Please help\n\n\nEdit: I saw one tip to flush your DNS. I dont know if it works, havent got the time to try, but if someone could and see if it helps please let us know.
