There is a pop up that appears but is only halfway revealed, so even if there are buttons beneath the pop up, I cant click them or even view them, in other words the pop up is cut off.  I have tried uninstalling and re-installing to no avail.  Does anyone know what the problem is or is this a virus on my computer?","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-12-09T02:12:33.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Death!\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing the same issue as a few players where they can't accept the terms and conditions due to their DPI settings.
