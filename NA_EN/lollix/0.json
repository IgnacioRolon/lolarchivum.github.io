I rescanned the files it told me to do and restarted my computer just to make sure. Hopped back on to start up another for it to happen again. I have lost 40 LP now because your game keeps freaking crashing on me and I DONT KNOW WHY. Can I get that LP back that I lost because of your game and can someone help me fix this problem since it cant fix it self apparently. Sorry for angry typing but well Im angry.","replies":[{"poster":"61939590DEL1","date":"2016-08-01T12:55:22.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played 3 other games before the client begin crashing, you can even view my match history riot on lolking.

Can you provide some more details on your issue, such as any error messages you are receiving?  Do you see anything on your screen during the crash, and at what point exactly is it happening?  If you need to reproduce any of this, please do it in a custom game to prevent further penalties.
