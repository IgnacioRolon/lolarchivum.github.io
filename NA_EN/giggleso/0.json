Maybe if you cared about all champions more equally then we wouldn't have this balance fiasco.\n\nEdit:\nWith an official rioter response I thought I would compile some data from Champion.gg to compare and contrast with what was said by this Rioter. Specifically in response to this. \n\n>\"No we are not buffing Yasuo because he's popular/has a large player base. We are buffing him because he has the highest average games played per player out of EVERY champion in League, and even with the largest number of players who HAVE mastered him, he's struggling to win the \"promised\" number of games based on what you would expect from a mastery curve\"\n\nSo I complied a few champions curves and compared them to yasuo. \nYasuo Mid and top\nhttps://imgur.com/h7N4UoX\n\nGagas all roles\nhttps://imgur.com/R22b7hC\n\nCorki Mid/ADC\nhttps://imgur.com/FYNhunJ\n\nChogath Top/Jungle\nhttps://imgur.com/lpWCBMS\n\nA-Sol Mid\nhttps://imgur.com/nWdS30t\n\nSo maybe I'm confused why we don't have A-Sol Nerfs, why we have Yasuo Buffs why champs like gragas and corki and cho aren't getting buffs (lol cho buffs). \n\nMaybe it would help if you gave us some EXTRA data. Things like champion.gg Still show us things like this. Where yasuo still has an extremely high winrate for his mains, despite his current overall winrate.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/7rkZqzo\n\nEverything came from champion.gg \n\nMaybe you could give us what the winrate of players that master a champion should have? Without data to back up your reasoning when Riot says things like this it will always sound like you are just looking for any excuse to buff a champion. Is this data from champion.gg even correct? \n\nYou could also answer things like: \nHas every-most players that have mastered yasuo fallen below the \"promised threshold\"?\nWhat is the \"promised threshold\" for mastering a champion?\nWhy don't we use he same argument to buff champs like volibear?\n\nWithout this type of data its pretty easy to misconstrue anything that you say as being biased in any thread that you make. Which is exactly why you get so many threads exactly like this one. It honestly sounds like Riot is biased, because back in S1-3 when olaf, eve, and etc.. was this popular riot just nerfed them, and let them sit at low winrate for years. Which again is why it makes Riot sound biased with statements like the aforementioned. \n\nEdit 2: \nThis isn't even about yasuo buffs, I don't think that it is inapropriate to buff a champion that is below 50% winrate. I however hate the fact that it sounds like Riot only does something because he has such a large playerbase. A lot of champions could gain a large player base if they had relatively self sufficient kits. Yasuo/Lee Sin and other popular champions have historically been very self sufficient so if played properly they appear to have very few weaknesses. Where other champions weaknesses are more pronounced. \n\nEdit 3: \nSo before riot tries to bury this thread anymore about not buffing champions for popularity. I'd like to remind the community about a rabbit hole that Riot jumped down years ago... \n\nhttps://imgur.com/4jfzIfM\n\"https://twitter.com/RiotMorello/status/484042166948212736\"\n\nPlease do keep turning up the volume, we have some people in the back that are hard of hearing, or just not ignorant to the fact that popular champions get touched up more frequently. Which could be easily seen by looking through patch notes, and compiling the raw number of changes each champion has received since their original release, or lack there of in the cases of champions that were over preforming and were not nerfed when they needed them. They owe us the data on why they are buffing champions and nerfing champions. Otherwise its just biased garbage. Without  data there is no balance.

Long story short - we&#x27;re buffing him because he is NOT a balanced champion currently, and it&#x27;s our job to react to champions like him accordingly. \n\nCan you share any internal data on whether Yasuo's win rate differs significantly based on the team comps he's a part of?\n\nI feel like Yasuo should see a below-50% win rate for two reasons, and you're only addressing one of them (that he's a high skill cap champion and players that haven't put a lot of time in to him will do poorly on him). \n\nThe second reason which I've not seen addressed anywhere, is that Yasuo simply does not fit in the majority of team comps in league. That should make him a niche champion, and yet as the graphs Riot released show he has the widest and deepest playerbase of all champions (I think largest breadth, and second deepest after Kayn). \n\nThat's a **huge** red flag to me. Why is a niche champion being played so much?\nIs it because the teams that allow him to thrive are super popular right now? **Absolutely not. The meta is actually very against comps that Yasuo would thrive in.**\nSo the alternative is that players are **picking Yasuo in the wrong situations**.\n\nWhy is Riot buffing a champion who is losing games that **he should lose**?\n\nWhat do you want your mid laner to bring to a game of league? Typically a threatening amount of magic damage, ranged waveclear to stall from behind, and some utility. If you look at historically good mid laners they all have all of these: {{champion:103}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:99}} etc... all demonstrate all of these properties. Yasuo **demonstrates none of them.**\n\nWhat do you want your top laner to bring to a game of league? Typically engage, peel, tankiness. In the recent meta even more than ever, you want a lot of peel and tankiness to let your ADC thrive. **Yasuo does none of this.**\n\nThen, Yasuo has a kit that's more dependent on allies than most champions. His ultimate is only usable on champions that are airborne, and he only has a somewhat unreliable way of doing it himself and often only on one target. Allies like {{champion:154}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:516}} etc... are great for Yasuo because they can knockup multiple enemies fairly reliably. Most champions don't bring AOE knockups for Yasuo to thrive with. \n\nYou throw all of this together, and I'd expect that if Yasuo is being consistently picked with disregard to his team comp (which as we've all seen in solo queue, that last pick mid goes Yasuo in to allied {{champion:23}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:222}}). In games like that, he should lose. Yet I've had plenty of games like that where I'm on a true tank and stacking 300 armor and still struggling to win what should be free because Yasuo just puts out soo much damage through armor. \n\nSo what I want to know: is Yasuo mid seeing a sub-50% win rate in all team comps, or is his win rate varying a lot across different teams?\nWhat is Yasuo's average win rate with any of these champions on his team: {{champion:12}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:143}} ?\nWhat about with these champions? {{champion:254}} {{champion:40}}, Support {{champion:63}} (i.e. his support can bring the magic damage).\n\nOr better yet, use the data to identify which champions Yasuo does well with, and see if he's consistently winning over 50% with a subset of specific champions.\n\nTell me those are under 50% and I can be on board with Yasuo buffs. If they're like 54% then I think it's clear that Yasuo mains are just picking him knowing it's not a good time to do so, and they shouldn't get compensated for that. They're volunteering to have a sub-50% win rate if they're going to pick like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2017-12-11T03:10:48.504+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to chime in and say I never really thought about it by comps.

You mean dictating 4 other picks by just picking 1?  or auto lose?\n\nNot in general,  but when said carry has such heavy synergies with other champions,  you're going to have a disparity in win rates depending on comps. It's a lot more fair to the non-Yasuo player base to give him a 40% win rate on other comps and a slightly over 50% win rate in his preferred comps, rather then a 50% win rate in his preferred comps and potentially a 60+ % win rate in his preferred comp. It's not our fault that Yasuo players only play Yasuo and won't adapt to allied picks (or one trick a generalist rather than a specialist). If you only play a specialist,  you should expect to generally be at a disadvantage.\n\nIt's also not 4 other champions.  The reason i listed the top row of champs separately is that they're examples of champs that alone in Yasuo's team can make it a decent comp for him. For example malphite brings a reliable aoe knockup, tankiness,  engage,  and magic damage.

He benefits more from ranged waveclear allies since he can't himself. Certain champions like zyra support bring all of this at once,  so yes that's a heavy synergy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2017-12-10T23:23:21.979+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":10,"body":"All we want is for Yasuo to be less ...

That&#x27;s not to say we don&#x27;t talk about those champions if there&#x27;s quick wins we can get from the our teams perspective, but we need to make sure we&#x27;re also focusing on &quot;problems&quot; we can get some progress on in the next patch, vs only focusing on longer term champion wins.\n\nYou probably already know this but the boards this year have been extremely horrible. \n\nI see people posting weird stuff and if it was up to the boards\n\nMages would have an AP version of hexdrinker that gives 10% cdr 400 mana and 50 AP for 1300g.\nAhri syndra lux and every other AP champ would get buffed\n\nZed and yasuo would have a 33% win rate and be reworked.\nAdcs will not be viable anywhere and get kicked out by AP champs whom autos a.speed and dmg scale with AP 100%\nInfinity edge will cost 4k\nAll zeal items will cost 3.2k\n\nI thought the boards were pretty idiotic when i saw a thread that was upvoted titled\n\n''a buff bruisers need''\n\nand in the body was nerf adcs\n\nIf you take a bruiser top the reason you hate life is because Tanks are actually winning 1v1 trades against you top lane, you have no good runes and everyone is doing too much damage for a role thats suppposed to be somewhat tanky. \n\nYes even supports are doing too much damage. Not just adcs.\n\nBut the hate here is so real and biased that you cant even be offendedanymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-12-10T23:28:03.862+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":8,"body":"You're throwing so many lies out of that brain it's ridiculous.
