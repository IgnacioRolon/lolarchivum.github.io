Even tought you said that not fighting isn't counterplay, it actually is in my opinion. Your job to win the lane in that case is to not fall behind and not die, because unless Ryze player fucks up, you won't be touching him at all or winning in 1vs1 scenarios. Nevertheless, like you said he tends to push the wave quite a lot, wich makes him vulnerable to ganks and also Ryze n my opniion has a huge disadvantage at lv6, because his ultimate is not a ability that does a lot while fighting.\n\nBut yeah, I think overall you have to change your definition of winning considering the matchup.  In certains matchups, not dying and just play it safe and not lose EXP and get the most CS possible is a win situation. I think people misunderstand this a lot.\n\n\"Oh, Veigar and Talon are in equals terms because none of them died and both have the same CS\" - Wrong.

If you're playing a damage dealer like darius, renekton, fiora, etc. I'd actually recommend grasp... but that's just my playstyle. It gives you better ability to outlast him in lane while giving you some nice scaling and durability too.

You don't necessarily win the trades or win in farm, but you don't get low and die either.

Ryze doesn't kill anyone in a single spell rotation. He can't use 2 rotations immediately in a row. So if he holds onto spells hoping to catch you with the spread effect of using one on minions already hit by it, you can give up a whole one cs, force him to waste it on the wave w/o hitting you, and then do a trade after because he can't combo you then w/o hitting you directly with first spell and even then you are trading combos. If he does use it on wave... great, his combo is down for a few sec, shove away and force him under tower. It's not rocket science or particle physics. Just like with any other champ, the best way to trade is when they can't properly do full combo on you... the second best is when they can either combo you OR farm minions and you force them to CHOOSE one or other and then abuse them for whichever choice they make.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2019-01-20T19:14:17.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gangplank seems pretty good against him.
