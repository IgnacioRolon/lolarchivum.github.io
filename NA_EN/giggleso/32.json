They pay a lot of attention to the boards. I reckon what you really mean is \"Riot doesn't do what the loudest portion of the community says.\" Let's be real, neither the forums nor reddit are a good sample of League's player base, and the only people posting anything are those with opinions strong enough to bother. Riot is quite aware of what goes on in the boards, but they know the game better than any of us do, and if something needs changing, it'll be in the works.","replies":[]}]}
