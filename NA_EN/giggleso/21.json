You can not miss any of her basic abilities and you can not miss her auto attack\n\n\nlet's do some math and say that she gets a lich bane proc on all 3 spells\n\n4.5 seconds minimum (which would be impossible given the animation time)\n\nbase AD damage x 0.75 x 3 = 2.25AD ;  lich bane damage 50% AP x 3 = 150% AP\n\n2.25 AD + 410(magic damage) + 150% AP lich bane\n\nlet's say she has 1000 AP with a full build\n\n1500 + 410 = 1910 magic damage + 2.25 AD physical damage in an impossible 4.5 seconds\n\n100 AD = 225\n\n#2135 / 4.5 = 474 dps  interesting, this might be where some of her damage potential comes from, but that would mean that lich bane is a large part of the problem.
