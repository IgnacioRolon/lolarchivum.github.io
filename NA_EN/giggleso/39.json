The heathregen of it is amazing if you play someone who benefits from % health regen (while Soraka level 1 would only get 3 bonus hp per 5 Heimer would get a bonus 16 hp per 5 level 1). \n\nIt's a solid item for tanks however it isn't as good as it once was but is still definitely viable.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-02-26T03:42:31.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried to hold a lane with zz since they last changed it?

I find it is still possible as the rot minions will damage enemy minions and thus enabling your wave to push.
