Morde has such a low NA playrate I&#039;m 38% of his mid playrate. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/7by4YQz.jpeg[]\n\nhttps://imgur.com/V4SwfpG.jpeg[]\n\nSo I&#039;d like to point out that when I say morde is actual hot garbage in the hands of the 1(ish)% of the 1(ish)% I mean it. \nHis playrate is so god damn low that one person that isn&#039;t working for the week can actually influence his winrate data. \n\nHere is the sad part about my influence on the data. I have a 55% winrate (mid) on him as 38.8% of the mid data, and yet he still has a 45% winrate... \n\nAnyone want some data from the guy that makes it? Some tips? Tricks? Anything?\n\nEdit: he has 41(ish)% WR mid if it wasn’t for my data.

Last 7days data is always unreliable - for any champ. Also you looked in only diamond+ and on a smaller region. Come the fuck on dude. I don’t know if you _seriously_ think this is good data but it’s embarassing if you do. \n\nHow about look at past 30 days data across multiple regions in multiple roles before you complain about your champ being bad.

I'm not being deceptive in any way. I also didn't want to count back two weeks on op.gg. op.gg conveniently only gives last 7 days in their stats at the top. \n\nData is data, I was pointing out how large of the source of diamond+ data I am in midlane. \n\nAre you ok that you feel the need to come on the boards and attack someone that is pointing out that they are a major contributing factor to the morde winrate data? His winrate is low, and if it wasn't for data manipulating mains like me his winrate would be even lower.\n","replies":[{"poster":"charge attack","date":"2019-01-23T19:32:37.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you’re using deceptive data to try and conclude if Morde is good or bad?
