Only 30% over 3 seconds. That's not jack shit. I will take the full damage in 3 seconds, however I have the lifesteal so I would be gaining just a little bit. Does it seem broken on paper? Yes. In game? Feels like nothing.\nNothing gives them heals, unless you are talking about lifesteal then well 3 items.\n\nShields, only two items give out shields. Maw of Malmortius, and Blood Thrister. No adc really buys Maw unless its a really heavy set of AP. Though the shield only blocks magic damage, not phyiscal. Blood Thrister shield goes down in you are not attack or attacking in 25 seconds. \n\n\nOn your point about the previous seasons, I dont disagree. It's true as a matter of fact. However that doesn't mean everyone else got my items to play around with. Same thing with runes and masteries since I know you are thinking about those as well.\n\nThe truth has been spoken!

How can you think that's an ok thing when ADC's have spent 6 seasons being balanced around the ability to be bursted. ADC's as a class are built around sustained fights, and when you give them properties to *guarantee* a sustained fight then you lose the opportunity to target the class' core weakness: burst.\n\nNot only that, but those champions who were dedicated to bursting adcs have all been forced to have delayed damage as well.\n\nEven on top of that you completely failed to acknowledge the incredible amount of shields and healing that is now prevalent in the game for adcs, especially with the ultra-buffed support items.\n\nOver all of this they still have the advantage of range as well as their usual lifesteal.\n\nHow can you not say that adc's have access to more defensive properties than ever before. I never said all of the defensive properties came from solely the adcs, I'm saying there is more defensive shit in the game *for* adcs (not just *from them) than ever before.\n\nYou simply don't speak the truth, you speak part of the truth that ensures a different conclusion can be drawn from you incomplete summary of the game's balance around adcs","replies":[{"poster":"Executioner","date":"2017-07-23T03:32:42.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The shields and heals are coming from the support are going to the team, not just the adc. Does it look like the adc seems more overbearing? Yes they look overbearing because of the support items, and the masteries. However everything wants to kill them, and supports felt underwhelming before. Now they are feel like they are making a difference in team fights. However no one looks at them. They only look at where the heals and shields are going to, the ADC, or the team mates. However fuck them, gotta look at the adc! The one doing all the dps late game. \n\nGA, maw were not given to the ADC to use. They were for all AD related champs to use. Assassins, brusiers, fighters, and adc to use. The only reason people bitch about GA and Maw being this so called ADC use it item is because someone bought it on them that they disliked. Items countering me!? Die Heathen!\n\nI simply dont speak the truth? You're right, what am I a lowly adc main that doesn't speak the truth. The games balance around the ADC?  It is, but quite. It's the position of bot lane that holds the key to the game. Why? Because the turret doesn't have a shield, they have a dragon spawning, and they have two champions down there compared to the other lanes with one champion. People going to bot lane with a teleport for a 5 main or 4 main. Is the game balanced around ADC? It is, only because everyone keeps putting so much emphasis on bot lane. Why do you think they have rift herald? To give bot lane less pressure and top lane something. Instead it's still this big ole fucking island anyways. \nEdit: Forgot to mention those shields dont come offline till 5 minutes on turrets. \n\nThe advantage of range is in every game, and any mage that is ranged as well. \n\nThe usual lifesteal is made to where it is because of warlords which procs once till it recharges, and crit that makes lifesteal look so good.\n\nEdit: You can still burst them.

A 700hp shield is more valuable and important on the ADC than it is on the Rammus, and that 700hp shield is *still* defensive stats for the adc. You're whole \"well the whole team gets it, not just the adc\" argument means literally nothing to the discussion.\n\n- As for support items in general. Cool? Supports became incredibly influential without ADC's receiving any compensation nerf, sounds fair to me :^)\n(and once again, you just stated a reason for why these defensive properties are available despite that not being the discussion)\n\n- Your argument about GA and Maw isn't even relevant either. No one cares what the items are meant for, the fact is that they provide incredible defensive stats for adcs. Saying that people only complain about those items because an adc used it is *literally the point*. ADC's have a lot of viable defensive items for a class that's not supposed to have defensive stats.\n\n- Didn't need to hear how bot lane is the most important lane. Everyone already knows it? I never even said that the game is balanced around bot lane, I said adc's were balanced around the ability to be burst (as that was their weakness) which has become *significantly* harder to do. Idk how you misinterpreted that but uh...just another irrelevant point you made I guess :/\n\n- Don't care that the advantage of ranged exists in every ranged champion, we are talking about adc's and I was stating *all* of their advantages (including ones they've always had)...I'm honestly so confused how you've gotten so far off track. What kind of justification is that anyways, \"it's ok to add defensive properties to adcs because they've already had X (inserts ranged or any other defensive advantage here) from the get go\"\n\n- Cool, so we both agree that lifesteal is quite easy to obtain in large amounts. You just need crit and 1 lifesteal item...pretty easy to get\n\n> You can still burst them.\n\nok? And juggernauts were still able to die back in the juggernaut meta. The argument is that it's significantly harder to burst adcs now, much harder in previous seasons, not that it was impossible\n\nYour entire comment completely missed the point of the discussion...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
