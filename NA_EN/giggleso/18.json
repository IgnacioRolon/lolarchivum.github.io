These have everything in them, the position of champions, minions, monsters, what level the enemy is etc.  \n\nPractice mode gives you the ability to mess with any of these inputs by giving gold, levels, reseting cds however your computer will be doing it all client side.  If there were 2 people then you would also have to send all of those changes to the other computer.  \n\nIf you then monitor the what packets are being sent between the server and the 2 other computers then you should be able to reverse engineer the proccess.\n\nIf you know what information to send to the server to tell it what to change to instantly give yourself 10000 gold or level 18 then you can start doing this in normal online games thus undermining the entire game and potentially allowing people to cheat.\n\nIdk though, I might be completely wrong but that's what I've kinda heard/read over the years back when they didn't want to make a sandbox mode entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortalspirit","date":"2017-02-16T05:20:45.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, i mean you got correct information there but your assumption that packets can be hacked into like that is pretty wild and requires an external application to 1. breach security and gather which variables are changing and 2. to physically manipulate those variables through a script. Even without a multiplayer practice tool, these variables can already be manipulated if you are able to breach security and physically manipulate them as all you would have to do is identify the variable the gold is changing with or something. This may sound simple but Riot is multimillionare company with very top notch security for their game, this isn't the reason they delayed sandbox so long originally.\n\n\"For this point, our stance is that sandbox mode is not the way to go. We want to make sure weâ€™re clear: playing games of League of Legends should be the unequivocal best way for a player to improve. While there are very real skills one can develop in a hyperbolic time chamber, we never want that to be an expectation added onto an already high barrier to entry.\"\nsource: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/riot-pls","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-02-16T05:23:18.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why play the real game if you can invite people in to the tool? seriously..","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElysMustache","date":"2017-02-14T22:21:24.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a new tool.
