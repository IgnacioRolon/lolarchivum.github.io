You need 150 armour for 1 stack of Perseverance to be better only considering armour, but that's not where it shines, even in this case however it's still probably statistically better since you get some MR too. At two stacks it's better at 34 armour, so always. The best thing though is the tenacity you get for using a summoner, which will save you a lot more than a few points of armour anyway. This mastery is the reason you'd offspec into resolve for most champions.\n\nAfter that there's second wind, which is going to give you far more anti harass than 3 armour. Let's say you get hit to half HP and you have 800 HP. This mastery would regen you by 16 HP meaning for 3 armour to save you that much HP you'd have to take 788 damage assuming you had 20 base armour. It gets worse as your armour gets higher. Mini D-Shield just saves you more HP at all but very high HP values.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-09-30T12:46:04.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just goes to show how crappy Iron Skin and Mirror Shell are that even _Second Wind_, which is a pretty crappy rune, itself, is pretty clearly superior...","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-09-30T12:55:12.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think Second Wind's pretty solid, it's not the best rune by a long shot but it still beats out most of the Resolve tree quite handily and is even fairly average when compared across trees.\n\nThe only other non-keystone runes in resolve which seem stronger to me are Font, Perseverance and conditionally Overgrowth.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-09-30T13:11:06.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Second Wind would be decent if it weren't completely gated by the \"for 10 seconds after being damaged by an enemy champion\" condition.
