You should have seen her with her old Tag Team ult, that was living hell for melee. Regardless, disregarded because Quinn was always a counter-bruiser.\n\nVayne top is also nothing new. It's not meta, but it's cheeky and good for busting tanks and bruisers. She gets ganked super easy, though. Just have a Kha'Zix or something and she will have to spend the entire game at T2 tower. Disregarded.\n\nKindred jungle is awful because Kindred is in a horrible position. Disregarded until she gets some crazy buffs.\n\nGraves isn't a Marksman anymore. He's a ranged bruiser. Also disregarded.\n\nTwitch Jungle relies heavily on the enemy team NOT invading him. It's the same problem as Vayne jungle: scales extremely well, but gets ganked easily. Lee Sin or any other jungler will ruin his day. Can work if protected and fed, but not worth the investment. Not meta.\n\nMF Support was never meta. It was a cheese pick in a pro game that caught people off-guard. The metasheeps hopped on it and thought it was awesome. (Hint: it sucks) The main issue is that if MF and her ADC don't get a huge lead early, she's nothing more than food.\n\nAshe Support is sketchy, but is the most \"meta\" of the 3 \"Supports\" you listed.

He cannot gank lanes that do not have CC since all he offers is a very minute slow, if he fails his ganks and he is not farming then he is useless.

At decent elos he will just get destroyed over and over unless you pick him against a jungler that all it wants to do is farm.
