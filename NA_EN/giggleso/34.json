Why you might ask? Well its that I&#039;m not dying in .5 seconds and then getting spam taunted by the enemy team. I&#039;m alive for a longer portion of the game. It feels good just being able to play the game even if I suck and am not contributing well to the team. I really wish we could tone down (champion) damage so that we could have a lane phase. \r\n\r\nlowering damage would make tower dives harder because you would have to tank them longer. \r\nLane phase wouldn&#039;t end at level 5 with a snowbally I killed my enemy laner 3 times ggez. \r\nTowers wouldn&#039;t fall as fast. \r\nObjectives like dragon and herald would be harder to take. \r\nSustain champions would be able to sustain without having died instantly. \r\nAssasins will have to hit all 4 skills to kill you rather than over killing you by 1k damage if they hit all 4. \r\nTanks won&#039;t be so burst heavy. \r\nAdc&#039;s won&#039;t be able to mow you down before you get to them. That is unless they actually kite. Right now they just stand still. \r\n\r\nThe game is just healthier with lower damage. No I&#039;m not saying hue hue &quot;tank meta&quot;. Historically tank metas have been when tanks deal too much damage for how tanky they are. I&#039;m saying we need their damage to be lower too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-12-30T07:24:03.571+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some things to consider when comparing HotS to LoL:\n\n1) HotS as more team objectives.\n\n- Instead of 5 turrets, inhib, and nexus (Single lane analysis); you have 6 turrets (recently dropped from 9), 3 inhibs that fight back, 3 \"gates,\" a nexus that fights back, and health/mana potions next to each inhib.\n\n2) HotS has more powerful neutral objectives.\n\n- Dragons, harolds, barons, alters, and spiders don't win games. They help teams do what they're already doing. Neutral objectives in HotS are (generally) *how* you win the game. With very few exceptions, winning lanes and ignoring neutrals will lose the game.\n\n3) HotS has a *significantly* less flexibility. Which makes fine tuning *lot* easier.\n\n- A character designed to be a tank (Johanna) can never be anything but a tank. They can do increased damage, but in-game systems ensure they will never come remotely close to an assassin. This means they can be balanced on the assumption that they will always do the only thing they're designed to do - they way they're designed to do it. No Tank Ekkos and AP Tryndameres here.\n\n- Meanwhile in LoL, any character is technically capable to doing near ADC level damage. With bad ratios, you can still generally stack enough AP to kill a squishy. And even the most die-hard squishies can become brick walls (Tank Yasuo, Akali, Fizz, Ekko, Vayne, etc.).\n\n4) Hots supports are healers.\n\n- ***ALL OF THEM.*** That is literally the defining characteristic of a support in HotS. And they heal a *ton.* On the weakest end, Tass gives *shielded* characters 40% life steal. On the opposite extreme, Auriel can 1-100 her entire team with a basic skill (yes, there are caveats to this). By HotS standards, Soraka is laughably bad.\n\n- Not to mention all the sustain in HotS: Regen globs with every minion wave and neutral objective (can now steal enemy globes as well), Wells that restore 40/30% health/mana every 2 minutes, and generally higher regen overall (until LoL reaches late game).\n\n5) Team levels.\n\n- How do assassins farm in LoL? Target who ever got shut down during lane phase and never let them leave base.\nWhat happens when they do this in HotS? They miss experience, putting their entire team behind if they fail.\nConversely, a lost lane in LoL always results in that team being -1 player; even if another lane snowballed.\nWhile in HotS, these two will balance each other out keeping both teams even.\n\n- A lot of the power in LoL is that small 1 character lead. Because players that break even often have no recompense for an ally that is behind other than to let them fall further behind. One of the biggest contributors to snowballing right now isn't necessarily damage, but how quickly and easily leads can compound on themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-12-30T23:04:11.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You right, except not all \"Support\" heroes are healers. Tassadar uses shields (and yes, saw what you said, but still) and there are a few other Heroes that are used almost identically to a Support, but aren't labeled as such for matchmaking purposes, like Medivh and Abathur. (matchmaking in HotS for those that dont know, at least when you aren't doing a Draft, typically tries to loosely pair you against a team with a similar layout to try and make it more fair feeling, but wont sacrifice making you wait a long time to do this however so it doesnt always turn out that way)","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Do Not Recall","date":"2017-12-31T03:47:05.171+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait, what was your point? I just read your whole post, it was very well formatted and informative but you literally just listed differences between hots and LoL...\n\nfeeling confused.\n\nIMO I agree with the OP, and non of the things you listed seem to contradict what hes saying. they are very different games for sure, and so need to be balanced differently.\n\nBut as a stand alone, I think most people would agree League was funner when you had resists options from runes and masteries (the current \"runes\") didn't give you a bunch of free burst for literally no other reason than to \"spice up the game\".\n\nLeague is trying to evolve into something it never was, and shouldn't be. League was always about laning, that was the enjoyable part of league. People started mass complaining when junglers became too strong and fucked with lanes too much, when towers became weaker, and now when the laning phase ends at 5 minutes.\n\nThe entire game, i can only assume and i sure hope it was intentional, was balanced around being able to lane long enough to pick up atleast one fully built item, so that you get an item for laning, and then you start building other items as the game pace dictates, team fight item, snowballing item, split pushing item, defensive item, etc.\n\nNow all three lanes are over by the time i finish my first item, but it doesn't even matter because all the power i got before from building a gold lead and an item advantage has now been front loaded into runes, they give flat burst damage that scales with level and often even give percentage increases to damage as well. CS literally doesn't matter in this game any more besides as experience. \n\nAnd the new rune system fucking up the gold system and the relevancy of items is just one aspect.\n\nBy removing the old rune system they completely fucked this game up balance wise, nothing makes sense anymore.\n\nAnd to be fair, this is kind of what they intended to happen, I'm not claiming this was some unforseen blunder that riot stumbled into, they wanted to shake things up.\n\nBut can we all jut admit its not really working? Please? You can make games fast paced and enjoyable to watch and play without removing macro elements, Starcraft can do it, League had it too, but now its gone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Professor Ward","date":"2017-12-30T03:19:57.018+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"im one tricking electrocute nautilus support with pretty amazing success, damage is way too high right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Aedificator1410","date":"2017-12-30T04:45:15.443+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":8,"body":"No offense, but in SilverV (which is your current rank according to op.gg), anything works.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-12-30T07:32:52.669+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"If anything works how does the other team lose?\n\n:thinking:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Ward","date":"2017-12-30T15:06:00.385+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aedificator1410,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nWhUL7ZL,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-12-30T04:45:15.443+0000)\n>\n> No offense, but in SilverV (which is your current rank according to op.gg), anything works.\n\ni duo soley with a high diamond/ex challenger player, my elo on this account has zero reflection of my skill.\n\nI hate people like you.

I know cause I've done it just ignoring the enemy mostly, running them around the map, and taking objectives while they try to kill you and win anyways. The lack of any depth makes it really bland as well as in 99.9% of cases you don't pick for the situation leveling, just what is best out of the choices (there are some heroes where this isn't true, but that isn't often even in Ranked). \n\nUnlocking heroes in that game is 10 times more of a grind than it is in LoL and the prices are more ridiculous to buy them with rl money as well.
