Morde heals to deny the darius reset. Then he kites over to the raptors for heals and shields, while controlling dragon seamlessly. Btw the first damage is at 50% speed... so if you want to see how fast that really happened pump it up to 2x. \nhttps://youtu.be/cWFX2_yryp0\n\nAnd this is crap, because damage needs a nerf. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSpaXH_3vpg\n\nSeriously we need to nerf damage already.

Not denying the Darius ulti would have been gg we lose because he could have just nuked the whole team. Not knowing how to position to get Morse’s double heal on raptors would have been gg I lose. Not getting Mordes E to generate shield at the right time would have killed him. \n\nMorde had to manage positioning, cdrs, and manage a clone that is notorious for not listening. I’d really like to see the micro on that Zoe Q ohh wait there was none.\n\nJust because you don’t know what actual skill expression looks like doesn’t mean it wasn’t there.\n\nSkill expression is not auto killing the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Potchikir","date":"2018-02-05T20:15:51.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"morde has to do manage positioning _a thing that adcarries always do and get punished  harder if they fail on it_  and know how to play the champion and spamming abilities when their useable and off cooldown","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-02-05T21:50:04.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adc's don't get punished as hard for it, because they have a huge range advantage from the get go. \n\nDid you know morde has 25 base armor, while draven has 35... \n\nShit like that is ridiculous. He also has one of the lowest base healths in the game. He also has a lower base MS, which means that its harder to re-position with morde.
