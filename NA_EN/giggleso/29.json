That does not mean they are unplayable - nor does it mean they can't succeed if played well. But the amount of time investment, skill, focus and general luck required to pull of mordekaiser successfully compared to similar champions such as Darius or Urgot is... Well. \n\nI just played - and won - a mordekaiser top game to test out my own rune page before giving advice on what runes to run. He is by no means unplayable, nor is he unfun - he is simply not good. \n\nI used to main him before his rework, and i mained him during the majority of season 6. Personally i prefer tank builds, but as he is a juggernaut his build options are very flexible - like all potential triforce wielders.\n\nWhile he is fun to play due to his unique playstyle, it is very poorly executed. If you want to win, you'll want to pick other champions over him as there are others that do nearly everything he does better than him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fedoran","date":"2017-11-08T23:33:12.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just take dark harvest :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2017-11-08T23:36:18.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"phase rush?","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-11-08T23:38:24.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Die/CC'd before I can do enough damage to kill them.

Maybe Glacial Augment, Phase Rush, or Fleet Footwork. I'm leaning toward Dark Harvest, or Fleet Footwork\n\nIf Fleet, I suggest Domination secondary with sustain sub-runes. Mobility and sustain are nice on Morde, the issue might be gap closing however. Legend: Tenacity if he goes Fleet is very nice, and Coup de Grace is a nice execute, considering his ult. Sorcery might be cool also as a sub-rune set (MS).\n\nI agree none of the masteries compliment his kit particularly well however. It's problematic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2017-11-08T23:41:01.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"check what malicious metal has been usual, hes the resident morde expert. hes on EUW i think","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-11-08T23:45:15.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's using Phase Rush so.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2017-11-08T23:46:00.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thought he might be","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-09T01:02:42.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would go predator.
