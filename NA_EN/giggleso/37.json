Oh yea, and the best damage reduction in the game is on an ad item... {{item:3046}}  #balanced","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-02-10T01:50:37.608+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bonds of Stone is essentially the weakest keystone in the game. Barely hitting 1.5k in a 30min game. The amount of difference Bonds makes is so insignificant that you can choose literally anything else and it'll be significantly better. The Resolve Keystones has been nerfed so hard that the only reason one would go down that path is for it's other masteries, especially for the 15% tenacity.\n\nAnd dont forget Knights Vow feels like how Bonds was supposed to work.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-02-10T03:02:30.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tusutaki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JlF8nsoF,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-10T01:50:37.608+0000)\n>\n> \n> And dont forget Knights Vow feels like how Bonds was supposed to work.\n\nI could not upvote you enough for this post...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2017-02-09T19:56:00.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straight removal of tanky items like bulwark and leviathan, auras being removed, nerfs to certain key tank items like warmogs.

IT would also be on par with the damage masteries of giving 50+ ad or 20% lifesteal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-02-10T01:29:54.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Come on guys, you can downvote this further.","replies":[]}]}
