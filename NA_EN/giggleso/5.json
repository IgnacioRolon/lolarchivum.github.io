I do wanna preface this with the fact that I'm not a developer, so I can't really make design changes or really influence the state of the game. \n\nBut yea, I can actually agree with you that numbers feel pretty high right now especially at the beginning of matches. Honestly though, I think it's just due to people experimenting and finding new rune/champions combos. I don't have any hard data on numbers, but I'd definitely suggest talking about these sorts of things in the appropriate places where those Devs who can make changes would see. This kinda stuff would have the best chances of generating discussion and being noticed if posted in Gameplay, but I'm always down to chat and give my opinions of course.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-11-13T23:31:45.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your time, I suppose I need to find a dev, but thank you for your opinion on the matter. I just really wanted to see if damage is actually higher or if I was just misunderstanding with how the numbers play out. With the increased shielding/healing in masteries its hard to gauge what is going on. What it does feel like is that I die faster even if that isn't the case. \n\nAnyways, thank you again for your time, if you can pass on that players want some statistics about this data to meddler and etc... it would be appreciated. As a side note, if they could clarify what their design intent for this season is towards damage I'm sure the community would be outraged, but at least more satisfied knowing where the devs are trying to go with the game. As of right now all of my S1 friends and I are just confused why we (feel like we) die so quickly, especially compared to the past when bruisers, adc's and everything could build tank items and live for a very long time (those S1 hour long matches).\n\nEdit: The icon wasn't a bait to get you in here, I really didn't know what it was for.
