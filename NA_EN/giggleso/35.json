Ask yourself if you want to live your life knowing that one mistake means it&rsquo;s over. NO YOU DO NOT. That&rsquo;s why we mandate safety ratings. The safety rating of league is one mistake you are done. I saw a double kill minute 1 in a 5v5 the other day. The game was unwinnable. The whole team even agreed to FF at15.\n\nIT WAS THE MOST BORING THING IVE SEEN. It was honestly worse than the S2 tank meta. ( which I enjoyed with its CONSTANT SKIRMISHES)\n\nFuck riot do you want your game to be played? Pretty soon we will be back to a farm meta because no one wants to risk that first blood ending the game at 5 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"IvernBramblefoot","date":"2018-02-15T16:40:12.497+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":6,"body":"inb4 the wave of people who barely play saying \"hey i enjoy the game just fine i dunno what your problem is\"","replies":[{"poster":"Corrupt Bliss","date":"2018-02-15T19:46:23.139+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hey i enjoy the game just fine i dunno what your problem.\n\nHaha but seriously, I do enjoy the game a ton.
