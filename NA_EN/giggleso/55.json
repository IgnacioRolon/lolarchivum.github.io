It fosters discussion when you don't try and force people to do something a certain way. I feel like thats why you see a lot of s1-s2 players make posts that they are leaving the game because it is a different game. \n\nI remember being able to build any champ any way you wanted in s1. s2 rolled around and they removed itemization options. In fact they have even removed ad itemization options. The issues were that they never allowed all of the classes access to the same stat benefits or slot efficiency. Look at dodge. You had the highest dodge stat on phantom dancer... so it was the squishy adc's that had the best chance of survival due to auto attacks from a tank. I do also remember doing 100% dodge builds... people would even stack 4 phantom dancers on rammus for the dodge stat alone. \n\nSo then what happens, in my opinion, is that you have to make champions specifically more powerful, or nerf them, because of access to itemization. If you can't access those stats through items you can never be viable without innately having them. Thus the \"tanks are op\" is (somewhat) true because without items they are inherently stronger. However, that also creates a balance issue because then when itemization does favor tanks they go over the top. Otherwise they are always underwhelming to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2017-07-25T21:27:03.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> the minimalist post design was to allow people to comment more freely.\n\nOk that's just hilarious.\n\nBut anyway you still didn't tell what you think AP champions need to play properly, also is it even true that AP champions can't play properly?
