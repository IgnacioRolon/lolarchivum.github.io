I'm not sure if anyone else is having this issue, I just thought I would ask. Are there plans to be able to better resize it, or even a chance that they will add a maximize button to the client so I can resize it better?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T18:59:00.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client sounds like it's overscaled.

Nope, the updated client is still in testing so you might run into issues like with scaling.  This was a one off case with a workaround, so there aren't any functions.  Hope that clears things up.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-02-05T04:03:36.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=5vGA9tMO,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-04T23:32:17.340+0000)\n>\n> Hope that clears things up.  :D\n\nIt definitely does clear things up, thank you again!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
