By leading the game, you can control its course, by controlling its course, you decide who wins.\n\nThings like preparing rotations (Pushing several lanes at once), setting up vision control near dragon and/or baron shortly before clearing them, Setting up a counter-gank or even just *warding* are all forms of *proactive action*. Actions whose goal is not to gain immediate advantages, but to set up and manipulate things to gain future advantages, or *prevent enemies from gaining said advantages*.\n\nZZ'Rot... You cannot prepare for a ZZ'Rot. You know they've got one and you know it's gonna get placed, but nothing more. You don't even know *where* it'll be dropped. You just have to wait until its down and then spend valuable time dealing with it while the enemy team basically has free reign. You can *only act reactively* to a ZZ'Rot Portal, and if you don't deal with it, it's gonna spiral out of control.\n___\n#The Point:\n####ZZ'Rot forces you to react. You don't have a choice. It's either \"Go deal with it and give the enemy free reign and certain huge advantages\" or \"Ignore it and lose valuable objectives.\"\n####You get even less options if you happen to already be the losing team, since you straight up don't even *have* the resources to react to the ZZ'Rot.\n___\n\n######...

That's not \"Dealing With\", that's a \"Trade-off\".\n\nIf you're thinking to destroy their inhib ahead of them placing ZZ'rot, well, that doesn't really change much, does it? It means their inhib is down, it has no effect on ZZ'Rot, not to mention taking an inhibitor isn't something you can just choose to do at any time.\n\n>or even just getting a banner of command/zzrot yourself.\n\nHaving to counter an item by getting the same (or a similar) item isn't at all healthy design. That just means the item is too hard to deal with or too powerful to be dealt with, so the game becomes a sort of \"Who can get and use the most of this item\"-fest. Things like that never turn out well, or fun.\n\n>You could even force a 4v5 while the enemy tank goes and places their zzrot.\n\nSo, say the one with the ZZ'Rot is the top-laner. What are they gonna have?\nTeleport. What now?\n\nThere are also plenty situations where someone can place down their ZZ'Rot and you *can't* force a 5v4, either because your team is split up, because someone on your team is dead or hell, maybe the 4 members they have left are powerful teamfight champions.
