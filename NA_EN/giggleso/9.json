I'd like to have you try running a repair through the League client really quickly, and test that out in a custom game a couple times to see how that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-07-24T03:23:07.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran repair, but it didn't seem to do anything. I've actually been having this issue since the new client came out, but was too lazy to ask about it. Is there some sort of diagnostics that I can give like a dump file for the task or ect? I just restarted league so it will take a few games to get the processor churning again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T03:31:27.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go ahead and reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
