You said you're one of the *top experienced Morde players* solely based on your mastery score. That just means you adamantly play this one champion. 1.6 mil is nothing to sneeze at, but that needs to be accompanied by results. High plat is ALSO nothing to sneeze at, but that's well under the bar of \"top experienced players\" of any champion. I respect Plat as an achievement, but I have to blow the whistle on this one.\n \n> I am in the top experienced players of morde, which means that I have a lot of experience on him... \n\nIt's more like you just play him a lot. Higher ranked Morde players with less games could still probably teach you a thing or two just cause they got more mileage and coverage from their play than you did. Not being condenscending. It's the same way for me and my 2 million Sona mastery biting off of Clown.\n \n> You could be in bronze and have a lot of experience. \n\nI mean, I guess? But is that experience well-rounded/fleshed out so that it'll reap results? No. That's the point I'm trying to make here. A lot of that experience is just \"separate instances of X where I did the same thing I always do\", so it doesn't really count for anything. Experience worth noting is experience that pushes you further on a character, or experience that's tried and tested to get you to the top of the competition. 1 million mastery in Challenger says more than 2 million in Diamond.\n \n> As a general comment, I lose very few lane matchups.

Mana is more effective late game than energy because you can build mana items to get a larger pool, where energy is capped and being energy starved means bad news... IMO zed's biggest problem is that he can get energy starved. Just because Kass is great vs AP champions doesn't mean he is terrible vs AD. Its a rough match up early but to me its easier to play safe on a champion who you know out scales, than play aggro on a champion you know who will get out scaled. Once Kass builds {{item:3157}} Zed cannot beat him. He also builds HP items early like {{item:3010}} which help survive early. Zeds only chance is to get a kill pre 6 vs Kass if he wants to win. Knowing this as a Kass player it is easy to give up cs, call out Zed roams, and force Zed's hand. Kass also more times than not Takes TP, and can play safe and TP back to lanes when he is low with that CD. If Zed takes TP he most likely will not get a kill Pre 6 on the Kass, if he takes ignite he cannot match his late game split pushing. Also you can {{summoner:4}} to out play most of zeds damage and kass not only has Flash but also has riftwalk. Time it well and zeds ult will be outplayed.\n\nAs for my bold statement Tell me a champion who is can 1v1 kass late game? I seriously think that there is no champion who can kill Kass late game 1v1... they will either die or he will run. The only way to beat Kass IMO is to shove a bunch of people into his lane before he gets enough items to become God-Tier-Kass.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-10-01T22:10:24.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're saying this like we live in a world where Hexdrinker doesn't exist, or we live in a world where Zed won't pen through Kass's entire bone structure with lethality.\n\nKassadin has no hard cc, so Zed's free to approach his offense on him from a variety of angles with a full guarantee that he'll be able to complete his rotations. If someone has an advantage, they'd be bad at the game if they didn't try to push it as far as they could, so why on Earth would we just imagine that Zed would just allow Kass to farm? Why would we assume he'd aggressively shove into turret all game instead of keep the wave in the middle/on his side so he can fish for damage?\n\nAs a side note: Being forced to flee from a fight *is* losing a fight.

This match up is easier for Kass than it is for Zed, and all the pressure is on Zed to outplay Kass. Kass doesn't often shove waves so yeah you may zone him out for a bit, but a patient Kass will do just fine vs Zed i have played both sides of the match up.
