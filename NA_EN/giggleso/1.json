Now I see the same player more than once, and I report them multiple times for the same thing, but I just can't get them to be permanently blocked anymore... Can we please add this feature back into the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T23:01:07.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing so not everything is up and running yet, like blocking.  In the meantime, you can use the legacy client as a workaround:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-02-02T23:21:33.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=gGIrij69,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-02T23:01:07.513+0000)\n>\n>\n> I hope that helps!\n\nTy very much, not wanting to overstep, but currently the new window sizing on the client also feels clunky. \n\nIt either covers up my taskbar, or my taskbar covers up the game, is it going to be able to be windowed down into a smaller window like the old client? Either that or could we have a maximize button so it snaps back into full screen and covers up my taskbar? \n\nTo be more specific, I'm talking about the client, and not while I am in game, and it only covers up my taskbar when it is centered and in full screen.... \n\np.s. Unless I'm missing a setting to change it?","replies":[]}]}]}
