He's somewhat good against juggernauts but some just beat him out {{champion:420}}. \nMordekaiser used to go even with {{champion:122}}  but the recent damage buffs sort of tipped the scale towards axe boi. \nMordekaiser stomps on {{champion:86}}  if you prepare everything when he goes in.\n{{champion:83}}  depends on how you play. But you'll mostly win because his zombies are coded like monsters so you get a full heal from them. Plus you can auto reset with Q to escape his wall during laning phase.\n\nTwo champs that Mordekaiser stomps on most of the time are {{champion:157}} and {{champion:92}} you poke with E knocking out Yasuo's sheild and when he goes in you out damage him because Q bonks to strong and W heals to good. You can use your E when Riven goes to farm to force her to either take it or burn E to avoid the damage.\n\nHe counters {{champion:6}} at about level 4 and beyond that because of your heal.\n\nMordekaiser falls off late game until flash comes up. He's basically a different champion when his flash is up, he goes from a carry trying to survive in team fights to a massive back line threat that can one shot squishes with his combo at about 400AP.\n\nKeystone wise I take Phase rush because it's easy to proc with Mordekaiser's kit but also it lets him make good trades with champions that he would normally not be able to trade with. It also lets him follow champions with dashes that try to escape. But again always change your runes for what you're against. \n\nYou might consider taking glacial augment and rush spooky ghosts for the slow so people can't escape when you fight them. Personally I haven't tried it yet but I do plan to at some point.\n\nPersonally I think Mordekaiser's short comings don't only come from his lack of mobility but from his lack of base defense stats. He has low base HP and Armour for a melee champ making him easy pickings for ad champions in any role. This is most likely to compensate for Mordekaiser's passive.
