I personally don't understand it because fire is fire. Like blue fire made sense because flames can be blue and pink fire just doesn't. But whatever because realistic flames look ugly you're going to hear complaints. I'm more upset about Ashe's arrows than Annie's flames, but if Ashe's arrows (which are a small particle) are blue it's nbd, especially since I already own 4 Ashe skins (and will own Sherwood when it goes on sale soon) so it's not like I don't have other particle changing Ashe options if that's what I wanted in a skin.\n\nGG Arclight Varus has a filter change on his voice, Rito didn't give Annie pink flames.","replies":[{"poster":"lxlLilybellelxl","date":"2015-02-05T14:52:51.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ugggh by this argument and the amount of complaining everyone does how about they just stop making 750 skins, because EVERY time they do people complain. Seriously Riot was looking out for the players by making these pricing tiers 750>>975>>1350>>1820. QoL changes and clarity for a skin should not be seen as a deviation from a pricing tier. If something just doesn't make sense, like Sivir's boomerang, they change it, but still leave the price at 750, but pink flames is a deal breaker, It's still very clearly and obviously Annie. It doesn't look strange at all... now if her base flames were like.. idk Green and then ppl demanded a change for sweetheart I'd completely agree because green flames on a Sweet Heart Valentines skin would just look completely stupid.\n\nIf you want particle changes on every skin then be prepared to pay 975+ for it. Honestly I just can't see why Riot bother's making 750's anymore, this newest line especially makes me sad when people basically say \"Screw all your hard work skin guy It's not good enough we want MOAR\"","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-02-05T15:20:19.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think some of the best skins in the game are 750 skins honestly. TPA Orianna Fnatic Janna, Maurader Ashe without particle changes is still up there as one of my favorites. I mean I'd buy the Ashe skin at 1350 the same I would at 750 (even if the skin didn't change at all) but then again it's the skin quality that matters more than the price. If the skin looks good it looks good. In fact I think Forecast Janna (while it has a super cool VO and some nice particles) is probably her worst skin model/texture wise. I use tempest over it at times.\n\n>  Honestly I just can't see why Riot bother's making 750's anymore\n\nThe 750 price tier is pretty nice honestly. The character looks kickass and all of the wonderful particles retain their classic glory. The only time you really need to pick out a skin for the particle changes is when you dislike their normal particles. Personally I dislike Sona's normal powerchords and I dislike her normal AAs which is why I used a lot of Arcade for the longest time, but someone like Ashe or Annie who have many skins have plenty of options for color/particle changes if that's really an issue for you. Not every skin has to have these changes.","replies":[{"poster":"lxlLilybellelxl","date":"2015-02-08T08:31:28.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the full context of me saying i can't see why they bother anymore was that, people always complain whenever they do that it's not enough.

Like they've stated again and again, 750 skins are just simple skins that change the outfit of a character, any partical changes will be simply for QoL for the skin. Sivir throwing her base boomerang would look stupid, that and her weapon counts as part of her skin too sooo yeah. As cool as annie with pink flames would be, regular fire works just as well for the burning passion of her sweetheart love, however Natuilus shield would just look plain silly in his Inquisitor/Warden skin.  \n\nPlease stop complaining when you obviously don't know what's going on you just compared an 1820(disc.975) Legendary skin to a simple 750.  The amount of work that went into that skin and the low price is incredible. Not every skin can have new particles, then you'd just complain the skins are too expensive at 1350 each.","replies":[]}]}
