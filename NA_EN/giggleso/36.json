One of those every 2 seconds is like moving 112 per second, this barely makes it as a 30% movement speed increase, not accounting for the fact that it has an ANIMATION so its actually less of a mobility boost, specially considering it is an empowered auto attack, on a champion with the lowest base attack speed in the game, so the attack animation is SLOW AS HELL.\n\nNot only that, but it's TARGETED ONLY, which means that if you're away from her 300 unit range (This is a very short range, almost half of Lucians auto attack range) she is NOT DASHING ANYMORE.\n\nIllaoi is not a mobile champion, her 'quick' damage relies on people piling around her and not moving away from her ult or ccing her, and her kit, while easier to deal with for mobile champions, can always be invalidated by RIGHT CLICKING THE GROUND.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2017-01-17T00:17:53.070+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Firstly, I don't really see any Rioter going around and saying \"champion x takes skill\" and even less \"easy to play\".\n\nOverall your description is slightly off and some champions are in the wrong place (the latter has been pointed out occasionally).\nBut overall what really comes to mind is how the 2nd row is generally a lot of point and click abilities or atleast not really what you would consider skillshots (obviously not true for Karthus, but nobody would dare to call him easy to play).\nGaren, Morde, Nasus, Vlad (not so much after the rework), Singed, Malph, Rammus and Nautilus are all mostly point and click. Nauti has to land his hook (although he has quite a bit of CC to help him with that, Mundo cleaver is generally often used for kiting/low CD/cost so missing it isn't too bad and Cho is similiar to Nautilus.\nSo overall they have a pretty easy time doing their part in dealing their damage. While it's surely rather easy to kite Nasus it doesn't take much to play Nasus - mechanically seen. Regardless of how things work out all you do is press W and Q on the target.\n\nAnother thing those champions have in common is that they are not really risky/punishing to play. Missed Nauti hook? Alright, whatever. Missed Mundo Q? Alright, not too bad. Got kited as Garen, whelp, go back and heal up. \n\nThe first row is mostly super squieshy (Illaoi, Vi and Heca are not and I wouldn't consider them to take a lot of skill) and get's punished when they fuck up (Ahri/LB probably not, but I wouldn't consider them particularly hard either). If Riven goes in and doesn't kill her target chances are that she dies.\n\nNow with that being said I don't quite see what your problem is. What exactly is your point, it's not like you draw some kind of conclusion  here..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2017-01-17T16:14:26.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/PU5YDMk.png?2","replies":[{"poster":"Stand in my X","date":"2017-01-17T18:10:46.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well her w is kinda mobility","replies":[]}]}]}
