Better for everyone else to just permban them, because someone so toxic they get that far is worthless to the game and probably in general.\n\n> If someone hacks the game, stop them from hacking the game.\n\nYeah, no. That actually helps hackers. Look up the logic behind banwaves.\n\n> If someone runs it down mid in ranked, stop them from running it down mid in ranked.\n\nTurns out they get banned for it, if it can actually be detected. It is *really* hard for a computer to tell the difference between inting and a bad player having a bad game. You may say \"0/9 is obviously inting..\" but there are plenty of players so fucking awful/impaired/drunk/young/whatever that going 0/9 by 10 is just a normal game for them, and are debatably making an effort.","replies":[{"poster":"DrDisrespect","date":"2019-12-07T07:10:16.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-12-07T07:18:44.426+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrDisrespect,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=iZadLspu,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2019-12-07T07:10:16.003+0000)\n>\n> \"They do.\"\n> \n> Rarely. Getting 2-week or permabanned is a much more common than just getting a restriction.\n\nConsidering a 2-week ban is the first punishment only if there was a punishment escalation (via zero tolerance stuff) or the punishment was for gameplay related behavior, I highly doubt that.\n\nIt's just easier to brush off a chat-restriction since it doesn't prevent you from playing the game. Less likely that someone will complain about a chat restriction compared to a punishment that locks you out of the account.\n\n> -----------\n> \"Makes them a liability to their team\"\n> \n> If that was true they wouldn't have added the ability to turn off team chat in the settings - so that argument is objectively flawed.\n\nTurning off team chat is something the player does of their own accord. It is also something that they can turn off at will. So a person with extremely poor self-control can go right back into the options and turn team-chat back on if they're determined to insult another player. If the same player with such low self control instead couldn't turn chat back on? Well, they already showed poor self control so it's likely they'll just find another way to exhibit their anger at the other player. Like through trolling.\n\n> -----------\n> \"Yeah, no. That actually helps hackers. Look up  the logic behind banwaves.\"\n> \n> That doesn't apply to this. I'm talking about IP banning hackers/scripters - not change the way they protect the games infrastructure.\n\nIP bans (for any reason) are flawed and unused nowadays because of the real potential of collateral damage. For example, a college dorm likely has a single public IP address for all of the residents going through the router/switch. That one IP address is what Riot sees so banning it would ban everyone in that dorm.\n\n> -----------\n> \"Turns out they get banned for it, if it can actually be detected.

If someone gets 20 intentional feeding reports in 5 games, you could then send it to someone to review the footage and determine if it's actually inting.\n\nYou're underestimating the number of games that are played per day and overestimating how many people are intentionally feeding multiple games in a row. Almost all intentional feeders I've seen do so sporadically, not as a constant habit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-07T07:16:03.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are clearly simply mad that you don’t get to insult people in game.

The quantity of reports do not matter beyond the first in any given game and a reported game will not result in any penalty what-so-ever if no poor behavior is found.\n\nSee here;\n\n*[\"It only takes one report for our systems to review a game.
