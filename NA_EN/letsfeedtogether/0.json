Jax is trying to force her W, Fiora's trying to predict his stun and the follow up in order to counter and do some damage with Vitals.\n\nFiora doesn't auto-win against him, they're evenly matched in this particular thing.\nIf Fiora mistimes his stun, she's eating the Q, W and R. Meanwhile Fiora has to dick around with Vitals (her P, not R) that may or may not face her for poke damage. Meanwhile if she ults, she still has to face Jax's E and play the same game as before but now time gated or else her R will disappear.\n\nJax has frontloaded damage, Fiora doesn't.\nHer Vitals do most of the work in her kit, Jax relies on brute force that's easier to control and comes from on-hit.\n\n>Why di i need to be a fiora player to say that?\n\nBecause a Fiora player would actually know where she stands, how her kit functions, how she's doing her damage and her bad splitpushing capability. Playing a few games on her, does not give you the full picture to a point that you need to speak out against her splitpushing buffs that absolutely do nothing in PvP on top lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lane insurance","date":"2019-09-13T20:44:31.252+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"As a Fiora smurf main, they need to revert the atk speed buff or the parry buff if they’re adding this.
