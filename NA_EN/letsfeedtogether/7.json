It's not that fucking hard to do lmfao. Especially with that stupid sleep cc that's better than people actually realize because of it's delay. The fact that it's delay gives you and your team so much time to react and combo off of it. The only time the delay is bad is if you hit leblanc and she does her teleport to dash out of range before the sleep activates. But cmon, leblanc is one of the most stupid champs when it comes to mobility lol.

Well i don't play ranked so I wouldn't know. Every champ feels different depending on how good everyone is individually. That's why I don't really like playing blitz in higher skill games because it's way too hard to land hooks consistently because most players are actually smart and not stupid like your usual normal game. Most people know how to hide behind minions, move left and right to side step, use abilities to dash out before the hook lands. But in low elo blitz is ridiculous. And the same can be said about pyke. He is very low risk in low elo because even if people have the cc to stop him, nobody ever does and he gets away with it. But again, hard cc being the answer to any champ does not make that champ balanced imo. Because every champ is vulnerable to hard cc to death.

Like I get it you refuse to learn the game. Like that fact that I now have to explain fundamentals of this game because you refuse to learn is really sad.\n\n1: pyke can't heal. It's regenerate not healing they are different. 99% of the time pyke uses his passive it's out of combat since he can't be in vision for it to go off.\n\nSo yeah it's basically out of combat and nothing you say will change that so stop making things up.\n\n2: His invisibility doesn't help him at all basically like he has to be so far that he is out of the fight for it to go off. And ms is a shit escape.\n\n3: it's not like you can very easily DODGE IT. It pulls you a short distance and slows a bit like it's not strong. It's ok at best.\n\nLike it sounds like you never seen pyke. \"its really not hard to E in to W and get away.\" This is a load of bs. Like it is very hard to do that actually since that is more then enough time for him to get cced and take a lot of damage especially late game where you will only stun like one or two champions leaving you up to die.\n\nThe only times where this is true is vs low cc teams and bot lanes but newsflash those are not popular.\n\nLike leona has a better chance of living after going in then pyke. \n\nHow about you actually think about the game instead just listening off champions kits.","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-08-25T18:24:38.362+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. how about you stop defending your champion and trying so hard to say its not \"basically out of combat\"\n\n\nwhen zoe used to 1 shot you. it was basically  ok because she had to hit her e. so basically  its fine.\n\npyke Q unlike blitz or thresh. does not show where is he aiming at. there for harder to dodge, his q has a pretty fast animation. makes it harder to dodge. his stealth IS A STEALTH its always useful. \n\n\nwiki copy paste : \"When Pyke is unseen by enemies, he rapidly consumes his Grey Health to heal for the same amount.\"","replies":[{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-08-25T18:36:17.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=letsfeedtogether,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vqUpIc0W,comment-id=0001000000010000,timestamp=2019-08-25T18:24:38.362+0000)\n>\n> No. how about you stop defending your champion and trying so hard to say its not \"basically out of combat\"\n> \n> \n> when zoe used to 1 shot you. it was basically  ok because she had to hit her e. so basically  its fine.\n> \n> pyke Q unlike blitz or thresh. does not show where is he aiming at. there for harder to dodge, his q has a pretty fast animation. makes it harder to dodge. his stealth IS A STEALTH its always useful. \n> \n> \n> wiki copy paste : \"When Pyke is unseen by enemies, he rapidly consumes his Grey Health to heal for the same amount.\"\n\nHoly fuck what is your problem like just LEARN THE FUCKING GAME!!!!.\n\nLike you have given nothing but you're wrong with any proof like stop.\n\nLike pyke q does show where he is aiming at wtf.

Since this is just nonsense.\n\nHe can't go inv after dashing that is not how it works, and ms is a very poor escape.

He is not that hard to play and a very forgiving champ. Most games, pyke will just carry and everyone in chat will say support carry. This is of course low elo and not ranked games. Anyone who argues about a champ not being broken because they are weak to hard cc is kinda invalid because almost every champ is weak to hard cc. You get hard cc, then die. Any champ dies to that. That doesnt make every champ balanced because they can get hard cc and die.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WAZZZUP500","date":"2019-08-26T08:35:46.578+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main issue with pyke is his healing and the way his ult scales/causes scaling.\n\nMost assassins can get shut down by poke, but not pyke cause he heals it all back. The grey health doesn't need to scale and should have a timer or something for the healing to start, not just \"press w to regain 70% of recently lost hp\".\n\nUlt needs nerfs to scaling and the gold income. An execute that powerful doesn't need to scale so hard; why can he execute people from >50% hp? Scaling. That's why.

Hell with decent timing draven could even knock Pyke out of his ult. \n\n he's kinda like bard. You kinda dominate early and then hope you snowball enough so your ADC can manage by himself and then go around picking people off in other lanes. Because he cannot be tanky, he is very susceptible to falling off.\n\nI know your frustration though. Everyone has that one champ they just CANNOT play against for whatever reason.

It has a bad case of the Thresh where the physical hook is smaller than the hitbox. This would invite more skill to be placed in the skillshot.\n - Remove the slow on his hook. This is the reason that it's impossible to dodge his E without a dash or a blink. This invites more skill with the \"aiming\" mechanic of moving around after the dash but before the stun.\n - Revert the buffs to his gold generation. Riot wants him to be a support, then gives him the chance to come out of a solo kill with 600 gold like that makes any sense.\n - Reduce the amount of gray health he gets from being damaged. I'm personally fine with the \"go invis and heal\" thing because you just have to ward bushes and use gap close more carefully when you want to fight him. Also grievous wounds is extra good on him because he doesn't usually build Spirit Visage.\n\nHis stun duration is a meh for me because by making it easier to dodge it is more risky to try and land but more rewarding for when you actually do land it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-08-26T13:45:40.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pyke has no in combat healing.
