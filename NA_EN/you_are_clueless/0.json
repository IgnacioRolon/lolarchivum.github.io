Randomly saying \"x thing is for losers\" is just meant to insult people who like whatever \"x\" is and incite arguments. It'd be like if I said \"the 2018 VS Wolf Icons are for losers\" - sure, it'd be a broad-strokes, general statement, but _you could easily see it as a pointed insult._\n\n> If the following line is the ONLY thing I say in the whole game, then how can I get punished?: \"I think anime is for >insert non toxic noun&lt; :)\"\n\nDefine \"non-toxic noun\".\n\n> Now there is no way, that this is directely meant in a negative manner.\n\nExcept for the fact that you're using a word with largely negative connotations (loser) as a means to disparage the people of the group you're broadly referencing.\n\nThe fact that you're still trying to create a dozen different rationales to say it's not toxic makes it pretty clear that you are, despite your statements to the contrary, looking for loopholes to use to be rude.\n\n> It's the same thing as saying: Garen is for new players.\n\nThere's a difference between subjective and objective information, and saying \"x is for losers\" (x being basketball, anime, whatever) is a great measure different from saying \"Garen is a new-player-friendly Champion.\" The former is you insulting people based on what they like (be it basketball, anime, etc.), and the latter is commenting on Garen's kit being simple enough to use that newer players won't have much issue playing the game as him.","replies":[{"poster":"You Are Clueless","date":"2019-04-03T22:36:55.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Dude, you're not reading what I'm typing...\n\n\"Except for the fact that you're using a word with largely negative connotations (loser) as a means to disparage the people of the group you're broadly referencing.\"\n\nI didn't say loser, I said \"non toxic noun\".
