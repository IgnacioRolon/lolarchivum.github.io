People all of a sudden think that because they're bard support, they should roam across the entire map, go to top lane, pickup chimes in enemy jungle, and all this what not terrible gameplay. First of all, learn the game. In no way shape or form is collecting chimes equal to soaking up lane experience and helping your teammate farm efficiently. Three games in a row, bard support player is down by 3 levels because all of a sudden riot has introduced a \"roaming ONLY support.\"\r\n\r\nFirst of all, any support can roam. Roaming is becoming the new meta for supports. The only problem is ROAMING CORRECTLY. You don't just leave your adc in lane while they're being pushed to tower and proxy farmed. That is called TERRIBLE support. Understand when to roam, not roam all the time because \"thats how you play the champ.\" I had to tell our support bard almost 50 times that bard is better at roaming ONLY because he doesn't lose as much as other supports do when he does roam. Do you know what he tells me? \"Well, this is bard support and I'm learning how to play bard.\" No, when you learn a new champ, you learn their kit and how they interact with enemy and ally champs. You don't all of a sudden learn a new \"role.\" This whole \"bard is a roaming support\" is bs. If all you do is roam, you lose the game. Simple. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdd on top of that the NERVE of this guy to leave a Twitch, A TWITCH OF ALL CHAMPS, in a lane versus kalista and thresh... \"support mains\" learn what it means to play support and learn your limitations and exceptions. Roaming all the time is not an exception. Roaming when the time is right, when your adc is in good condition, is an exception. I've played support for over 6 months and never have i ever thought to roam as much as these bard supports are roaming. I have had very successful roams and almost any support champ can roam. This whole roaming support role, is never going to make it far because there is simply not enough experience or gold outside of lanes. Jungle gives very, very minimum. Good luck roaming supports. Oh and don't forget that chime across the map. It'll give you 20 experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Vecuu","date":"2015-03-12T22:51:39.986+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, you don't even need to leave lane to get chimes, just get the few that spawn nearby when you go to ward, and the rest can be picked up once the laning phase ends and your adc is self sufficient.","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-03-13T00:36:26.866+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"In defense of these players, running around getting chimes is *pretty* addictive...\n\nGive them a week or two for the novelty to wear off.","replies":[{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2015-03-13T03:43:20.029+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like a pacman mini-game","replies":[{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-13T17:45:22.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"pikmin***","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-03-13T03:47:43.225+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"IKR those chime collecting...\nOoh piece of candy!\n\nI at least left a health pack before I left, and I made sure our minions were pushed out more.\nEven then, I literally just took a round trip from the river through our jungle then back to lane to get the chimes.\nI only left at a bad time once, then I just roamed and help pick up kills for the rest of my team.

If your support picks Bard, consider your choices and pick an adc with enough mobility or defensive capability (Ezreal, Corki, and Caitlyn come to mind). \n\nIf you're in draft pick, Bard probably isn't good against Leona or other kill lanes, so people shouldn't pick him then.

Roaming is part of being support, but it is critical for bard.\n\nLastly don't criticize new bard players. It is the second day and most people who don't main support don't know how to roam properly.

Then they turn around and introduce a champion that by its design goes against most of the typical meta.\n\nContrary to what the Op believes roaming supports is not remotely meta at all. Sure some do it here and there but early game the supports job is to be with the ADC. I get that at the highest levels of pro play that varies but lets be honest, in solo que it really doesnt.\n\nBard will largely cause rage because ADC generally cannot lane alone, especially not in a 1v2. I keep telling my teams not to ban Bard in hopes that the other team will take him. Seems like an easy champion to dominate in lane and if they roam a lot all the better. I will be perfectly happy to destroy your ADC and likely put your team on tilt.\n\nI am glad Riot is finally willing to release a champion that challenges the conventional meta at least a little, but for me it speaks volumes that in most of my games Bard is neither picked or banned, and this is on release. Bard's play pattern is utterly counter-intuitive in the current meta.\n\nThe results are of Riots own making. You cant oppressively enforce the meta through balance changes and then release a meta-breaking champ and expect players to embrace it.

If you're one of the 80+% League players that don't find the support role as fulfilling or engaging as the other roles, spending the first 15 minutes or so of the game wandering around the jungle collecting chimes and occasionally ganking sounds a lot better than slogging through bot lane.
