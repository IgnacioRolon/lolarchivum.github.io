The club still exists, and the members are still in it (including me, according to another member), however I cannot access the club.\r\n\r\nSolution: Through Riot's support, I was informed that there was a fix in progress. I know that many people are now back to normal through some fix or another.\r\n\r\nProblem: I still have no access to my club.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate some communication on this matter. If a fix is still being found, that's fine, but I'd like to know that my case hasn't been forgotten\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nThe Grand Design","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T00:08:30.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've already resolved this for most players, so we're actually resolving the remaining issues in [support tickets](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
