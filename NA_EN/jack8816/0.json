When I faced one playing Akali I went invisible and he could still auto me and so he 1 shot me again. So all in all i just think he need to be more balanced to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Sch√†denfreude","date":"2016-08-18T16:50:56.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"42% winrate*\n\nAlso, you played against Kled in normals only. You happen to never play ranked, so maybe it's because the other player is simply stronger than you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-08-18T15:52:14.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His character aesthetic is boring.","replies":[]}]}
