It&#039;s great for sustaining in lane that&#039;s the big thing I like about it but it doesn&#039;t feel as punishing when you tp somewhere that isn&#039;t a tower. Should TP be more of a choice and less of a requirement for a sololaner? Because I see some people lately saying that champions like Renekton are considered weak eventho IMO he is actually quite fine really its just that TP isn&#039;t the best on him and now that taking TP is more of a requirement for a sololaner. since Renekton relies so much on Ignite to get those kills he needs to make a impact on the game. I like TP I think its a great summoner spell to counter against the fast pushing champions and its really great having it on champions that have a pretty rough laning phase like Kassadin or Diana. I just feel like its more or less being abused quite too often with no drawbacks to it. IMO TP should be less of a requirement to take in the top lane and more of a choice between taking either TP or Ignite like how it is in the midlane for more summoner spell diversity.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-10-05T19:00:29.491+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":22,"body":"We've been talking about possible TP changes for the preseason.

How often champions with teleport should be able to quickly put themselves in an unexpected location is something we're also looking at. At present for example we regularly see 4v2s bot, with top laners teleporting down as their jungler goes in. That can result in bot lane feeling like a punching bag, with the risk that aggressive plays to establish lane dominance may be too frequently punished, leading to a loss of bot laner agency and a frustrating laning experience.

There might be spells that work better with some kits, but that does not change their inner value.\n\nThis is the case i see in most summoners ( flash by mobile and immobile champs alike to have more flashy play potential, ignite from assassins to low-damage support for kill threath, teleport for quick crossmap intermissions etc ) and usually that is enough to prompt a decision for the player because they have agnostical and clear power: they have, in short, a meaning to be picked regardless of the champion and more focused on what you want to do.\n\nIs that right? Do you think that the underdogs of the spells follow that line? I feel for example that Ghost is more picked so the player can balance the lack of chase power in a champion ( see Olaf) rather following an ideal or strategical approach, but chase power is a thing that can be also done by many other items and for this reason the value of the Ghost pick is weakened; in this case would not be better to give a different identity to Ghost?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReQnosis","date":"2015-10-06T11:31:18.503+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not that I'm agreeing to the \"need\" for a nerf to TP... but have you guys considered a \"Ranged CD\" for Teleport?\n\nIE: The amount of cool down time after the use of Teleport, is directly tied to not only \"what\" you teleport to (IE: Towers Vs.

There can be risks and drawbacks to picking and attempting to use teleport particularly in the sensitive parts of late game unlike other summoners which are, while although minor, are drawback free bonuses (other than the opportunity cost of not having TP). Of course it is hard to say TP can cost you when the potential pay off is so high compared to the risks that it has become mandatory in the meta top lane or for certain solo lane champs...\n\nBut say I'm playing solo queue and I have advantage and pressure top, then I see chaos bot lane, so I see a hero moment and TP bot to save the day. Hopefully this work out (because if this fight is thrown that's a HUGE setback). Either way if I actually go I am giving my top lane opponent breathing room to farm a couple waves and damage my tower...\n\nThen there is the late game split pushing situation. Solo queue is a much more variable game than competitive. Sometimes if you are behind enough or if they have a fed enough stealth or duelist champion splitpushing is simply not truly viable that game. Then there are times that maybe you can splitpush but the enemy team has really solid engage comp. In this situation you're basically putting a certain amount of faith in your solo queue team if you go split push, because a reactive TP someplace possibly on the outskirt of a fight is a very slow counter. Of course though perhaps this is simply bad solo queue play if my team is engaged upon with their tp splitpusher isn't yet next to a tower with a minion wave.\n\nBut my point is while TP is sooo strong it is the only summoner spell with an inherit drawback by moving you from one place on the map to another. That unless you are teleporting from the fountain to a lane. Or making a teleport homegaurd play. I guess those aren't super risky. Because coming from there you spent your gold and have full hp.\n\nI think all we have to do to dissuade mid lane from becoming a teleport meta and open up more variety top lane (at least in solo queue) is remove the tower TP cd incentive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dawkinstation","date":"2015-10-05T23:17:56.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The other problem that they look at though is the tp gank to bot lane.

This would still allow it to be used for things like backdooring, but create a risk of wasting it if you try to TP directly into combat.\n\nAgree on eliminating the homeguard interaction, though.  Hec is the worst abuse case because of his passive, but for a lot of people it not only significantly increases the desirability of TP, but then reduces boot options once you have already chosen TP.\n\nIn fact, I'd like to eliminate homeguards altogether and just make the fountain give a move speed buff that is canceled when you use an ability/summoner spell that moves you, instead (and maybe improve the rate of health/mana gain if that's an important part of current homeguards).  I think in a lot of people's heads it is seriously choking out variety on boot enchants (whether it's actually better, or just that its power is more visible).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgonnalearn2day","date":"2015-10-05T21:40:06.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chynonm,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qWGbZX8N,comment-id=00000004,timestamp=2015-10-05T20:05:23.763+0000)\n>\n> I honestly think targetting the cooldown isn't enough. There needs to be a nerf on it's versatility. You can:\n> \n> * TP to a lane for shorter cd to farm the wave/protect tower\n> * TP to a ward (even worse with mobis) to engage a fight or skirmish\n> * TP to a minion to keep it from dying to a tower and tank it longer\n> * TP to zac passive to make him unkillable.\n> \n> The power of tp engage is especially horrible for the bot lane, making it impossible to push a lane without fear of a ward behind you and a hecarim with homeguard ganking you every 5 minutes.\n> A solution I'd say would be to prevent homeguard teleport, it has to stop, it creates absurd engage and gives no chance of ouplay, preventing many of the low range/low mobility adcs from being viable because is nothing they can do to counter the engages. \n> It also makes enagagers not have to count on homeguard+TP to enage thus not forcing them into that build.\n> \n> Along with it teleporting to minions shouldn't be allowed either, using teleport to tank turret doesn't make much sense.\n\n\"Take away creative play. \"","replies":[{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2015-10-06T10:25:29.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the fact that it makes things invulnerable is bogus.

Here's my opinion:\n\nProblems:\n- Teleport outweighs combat spell effectiveness in lane because it effectively grants users experience advantage in lane.\n- Teleport is cumbersome to use in team fights (Place a ward so I can TP. Please ward. You're dead now and can't ward)\n\nSolution:\n- Make teleport target allied champions instead of structures/units/wards\n- Make distortion boots allow one to target structures with TP (to allow a player to use TP to defend against split push)\n\nThis would also make TP less complex for new players (One CD, but different CD if I cancel, but another CD if I use on turret, and a different CD if someone interrupts me but I didn't cancel before they interrupt me? ugh), and let's face it, changing the cooldown to the point where it becomes unusable just doesn't feel good for any party.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leon Etoile","date":"2015-10-05T22:21:44.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qWGbZX8N,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-05T19:00:29.491+0000)\n>\n> We've been talking about possible TP changes for the preseason.
