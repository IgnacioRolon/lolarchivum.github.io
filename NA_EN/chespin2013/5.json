That doesn&#039;t necessarily label him as a juggernaut at all really, sure he is bulky but not slow at all. I get that you guys were planning a rework for him and all but Skarner&#039;s whole identity of a champ doesn&#039;t really synchronize with what you guys are planning for him with this train of thought for a rework. So far from what I read on the pbe he seems probably better wait till we see but its just kinda strange how you guys associate Skarner with the other champions in terms of a Champions Role.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T06:12:19.218+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"We actually agree that Skarner is probably the odd one out amongst the four releases coming up, but we're actually okay with that.

I wanted to ask you something about Skarner but I don't have a PBE account so I couldn't post this when I saw it.\n\nYou said on the forum that you want Skarner to be a \"best in class objective control\", but all the MS and AS in the world isn't going to take that spot from Nunu.\n\nI play a lot of Nunu. A LOT of Nunu. I have played Nunu against Trundle (another champion with a large zone of high AS and MS on demand) and I can tell you that it doesn't matter how fast the champion can take dragon or baron (Sated Devourer Shyvana? Nope) it won't stop a good Nunu from Flash + Q + Smite and then dying. One death for a huge steal is definitely worth, especially when dragon is a permanent buff. \n\nNow, you could reply that Skarner will control the objective in other ways, but your words were \"Best in Class Objective Control\". If you really want Skarner to be better at objective control than Nunu, well A) I'd dispute that goal simply because it's already Nunu's thing and if you take it away from him successfully that's not very fair to Nunu players and B) There's no way for you to make a champion that is better at controlling neutral objectives than Nunu when Nunu's entire kit makes him a monster counterjungler.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T08:27:01.557+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good question.

That all makes sense. \n\nI do have another question though. It's slightly relevant, but I hope you'll indulge me (You've definitely been answering my questions all night, so thank you for that). \n\nWhen we had the Warwick rework up a while back, the guy working on it (Can't remember, maybe it was Zenon, maybe Xypherous) said that Riot was discussing the validity of suppression as a CC type and how it feels for both sides. Because of this, the Warwick rework he was working on had made Infinite Duress a 2.5 second stun rather than a suppression.\n\nNow you have a chance to rework Skarner but you're leaving Impale as a suppression. Is there a reason for that? Has the topic of changing the CC type come up in your ideas stage at all?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T17:35:28.009+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Now you have a chance to rework Skarner but you're leaving Impale as a suppression.

This probably won't be a popular opinion, but if anything, I'd actually prefer to make Suppression stronger by making QSS not work against it, and force all counterplay into \"interruption\" effects by enemies. Imo, this would let us balance the spells around their intended duration and counterplay, and not have as much of the feeling that all the characters with Suppressions would be better off with long duration knockups or something. That said, in that model specifically, Skarner's ult may make more sense as a stun, because there is no interruption counterplay currently.","replies":[{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-08-10T18:29:33.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well his surpression is also the hardest to apply out of a (Malz and Urgot is ranged, Warwick is a blink) ll so he could keep his suppression because instead of interruption counter-play, its a keep away counter-play, similiar to how Udyr melee power is balanced by the fact that for him to get to you is very hard  \nAnd kudos for not taking the stance of nerfing suppression and making it the ultimate cc.

Now he isn't a \"regular\" damage threat anymore, he just transform into the god of death in his zone and become sup-par outside of it. And plus, \"kill-threat\" and mobility are not mutually exclusive on a tank. In comparision with other Juggernaut, Skarner is very single-target focused and I think that's a good trade off for his rush down gameplay, where-as Darius can pull multiple people, output significant aoe damage with 40 cdr Q and passive and then chain execute, Garen has his E and Morde kit is chockfull of aoe. In comparison, Skarner only has one aoe , Q (E is pityfull damage wise), and its main-usage is to proc single target sheen, even his cc require him to manually auto-attack people.\n\nHistorically, Skarner has been one of the zoom zoom guy who speed into battle at Mach 5 and ruin one person day, similar to Rammus and Hecarim. Why was this deemed to be in need of change, an almost 180-degree identity shift from speedy blitzkrieg into a slow and heavy tank?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2015-08-10T15:49:32.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qspfgcMr,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-10T06:12:19.218+0000)\n>\n> We actually agree that Skarner is probably the odd one out amongst the four releases coming up, but we're actually okay with that.

So he has a passive that functions similar to Zeke's Harbinger. As he moves around and does... Skarner things... it charges from 0 - 100. At 100 He's given some sort of boost. Damage, Speed, Shield, whatever. The rate at which it charges and the intensity of the buff depends on how many of said Obelisks he currently controls. So basically, if he controls none, it doesn't charge at all. If he controls all of them, he's like a fully charged battery, with constant power bursts. \n\nI think this solves his issue of his power being greatly gated by how small the current bubbles are and the likelyhood of a fight even occuring within it. It feels less... oppressive.\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-08-10T08:30:28.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kinda seems more like Skarner is the \"I am the best character in the entire game in every aspect when under the effect of my passive.\" And gating his power that way?\n\nCause he outdamages pretty much everyone else inside that passive too.

Since you are already adding this objective grab to the game, how about going a little bigger; make it more of a realistic reward. Have you thought about lowering the power of the passive but extending the area where it can affect him? You try to grab an area and three enemies show up. Wouldn't you just skitter away? Passiveless and useless in this tiny area for the time being.\n\nOnce again... call me crazy, but I think that there should only be 4 shrines on the map located in the 4 specific corners of the jungle. These shrines (when captured) buff the entire jungle sector (some sort of blue crystal effect on the ground or in the air, red on the enemy team). This effect would only be seen in the jungle when your team has vision of the shrine. Or at all times, however you feel is best. I understand that In order to get this balanced you would have to make the passive bonus a fraction of the current benifit, but with this passive there would be much more time spent under the influence of the passive and much more incentive to ward against him. Also, the minigame of teams controlling shrines would be much more beneficial... \n\nImagine being that skarner in the current state. \"Ok team... if we are going to fight them... make sure it's in this tiny bubble so i can actually dish out some useful damage! Thanks team!\"\n\nVersus what i propose, \"Oh crap guys... skarner has control of this jungle, keep your eyes peeled and stay on our carry!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrSoullessness","date":"2015-08-10T20:15:38.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qspfgcMr,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-10T06:12:19.218+0000)\n>\n> We actually agree that Skarner is probably the odd one out amongst the four releases coming up, but we're actually okay with that.
