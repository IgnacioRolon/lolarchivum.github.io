Yes there is always gonna be a champion at the bottom of the winrates and such but how kassadin is right now needs some love. I think the buffs to his ult on the pbe are a step in the right direction but I just think his laning is a absolute mess that and he needs like 4 items or so to be relevant in a game is kinda bad for a champion. Do you guys have any plans in the future for Kassadin? Because he really isn&#039;t fulfilling his role as a antimage where every mage can pretty much beat him?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T06:17:17.598+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'll say straight up that I don't know exactly what the long term vision for Kassadin is, but I think I can accurately describe the issues we need to overcome if we were ever to be comfortable with him being in a position of power.\n\nEveryone knows that extreme mobility is Kassadin's thing, and that's cool.

Well, to be specific, I want to keep the anti-mage angle, and I want to keep the mad scaling, but I think it should be possible for him to win lane without transitioning smoothly into the late-game power fantasy.  My thoughts:\n\n– Just because he has an advantage against mages doesn't mean he's got to win the lane.  His pre-6 gankability is a serious window of vulnerability that could be further widened by weakening the self-peel of his E.  What if it only slowed people who were moving away from him, or otherwise didn't help him survive a gank?  I think the tactical-level gameplay of LoL is fantastic, and I want more attention paid to the strategic level: vulnerability to ganks or lane swaps is important vulnerability.  \n\n– Another laning consideration is that he should be susceptible to the \"push the wave to tower and roam\" strategy, since he has trouble clearing it back.  How could you change his laning such that traditional mages can clear a wave against him post-6 without opening themselves up to an all-in?  Essentially, is it possible to maintain his advantage over mages in a protracted situation like laning without him having a powerful all-in?  I feel like if any assassin needs a weak all-in, it's this guy.  Maybe you should lower CDs, mana costs and damage numbers so he's got the same damage over time, but doesn't frontload it as well.\n\n– You know what I loved about Ryze?  Mana scaling.  Now his scalings are all muddled, and there aren't enough mana items that he wants to buy since he's been told forcefully to leave Frozen Heart alone.  Kassadin already has some mana scaling.  I think more mana scaling could help because, outside of Seraph's and Rod of Ages, there isn't a lot to buy with mana and AP.  Replace some of his AP ratios with mana ratios, which leads me to...\n\n– Delaying the late-game fantasy.  Just because he's won lane doesn't mean he's in position to be powerful in the midgame if he's put his gold into slow-burn items like RoA.  What if he was forced to choose between rushing AP items for the faster power spike with a lower peak, or buying the slow-developing mana-oriented items for a weaker midgame and that lategame fantasy?  Maybe the mana ratio on his ult could scale with level so that the full power of Seraph's and RoA only unlocks at 16.\n\nSo, in short, I like the anti-mage, I like the scaling, and I'm willing to sacrifice burst damage and midgame power to achieve it.  How's that sound to you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-08-13T08:35:21.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xBGnIEBd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-13T06:17:17.598+0000)\n>\n> So I'll say straight up that I don't know exactly what the long term vision for Kassadin is, but I think I can accurately describe the issues we need to overcome if we were ever to be comfortable with him being in a position of power.\n> \n> Everyone knows that extreme mobility is Kassadin's thing, and that's cool.

But Galio is more or less the opposite of Kassadin, an immobile anti-mage tank who will wreck an entire team if he can get into position. If Kassadin was reimagined as a high-mobility \"mage assassin\" who had the tools/passive to shred down AP users and mitigate/avoid magic damage, while being less effective but not INeffective against AD types, I at least would be happy with it.\n\nAs for Kassadin's late-game fantasy, perhaps you guys would be willing to see if you can't apply that fantasy to Veigar? With his ult, he's already kinda-sorta fulfilling the same \"more mage than thou\" thing that late-game Kassadin did, and from what I've seen, people weren't happy with his mini-rework. Maybe take another look at him with the intent of turning him into the late-game super mage if you remove that aspect of Kassadin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nekusen","date":"2015-08-13T21:56:18.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"About being strictly anti-mage, that kinda messes him up in blind picks, get a yasuo or zed in your lane and you will be making your team a favor by going afk.\nSo his small niche becomes even smaller as you can only use him as a counterpick, and even then he struggles.\n\n---\nSome suggestions:\n\n* Passive- Void Stone\nKassadin takes 15% reduced magic damage and ignores unit collision. \n\n>  - -**NEW**  \n**In case Option 1 is chosen for spells**: Kassadin ignores unit collision and takes 5% (+5% per 100 ability power) reduced magic damage.\n- - - \n* **In case Option 2 is chosen for spells**: Kassadin ignores unit collision and each time Kassadin casts a spell, he gets 1 charge, a charge is consumed when Kassadin will receive magic damage.
