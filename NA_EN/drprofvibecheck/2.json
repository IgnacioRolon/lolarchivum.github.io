Hell, right now I'm complaining about people complaining. But nowadays, whenever I see a QQ thread, the poster acts just acts immature. People forget their manners. Also, while they whine and bitch about the shit they want fixed, they ask \"OMG RITO WHY U NU REPLY\". Then they start to whine even more.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying to stop the QQ threads, I'm just saying if you acted mature and calm while typing, maybe Riot would at least reply. Honestly, I'm just tired of all these people starting angry mobs.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-24T21:26:00.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot only listens to pros.
