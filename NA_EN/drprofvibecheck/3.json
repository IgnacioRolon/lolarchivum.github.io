It also lets him heal his ADC a bit. All together its just the best item for him of the 3 we have.\n\nNow that said, I use coin on some tanks, that have a defensive ability like a shield or resistance steroid. Yes Thresh can shield himself, but its not instant cast, and he stops moving on top of the time it takes for the lantern to hit the ground.\n\nGalio support is one of my favorite coin users. All armor/MR runes, combined with his W heal and coin heal mean hes so hard to poke. Spellthief isnt so good on him cause of the high mana cost on his Q and him being melee. Relic is OK and all on him, but the coin just does slightly better at letting me go in for a melee + Q combo once each minion wave. That plus regen and W heals with the coin means full health for a minor trade.\n\nSimilar story for Maokai, his E can get him some decent gold with Spellthief, it can proc twice per cast, but its still expensive. Coin lets him heal up more and stay in their face more. Though he can also sustain with Relic with his healing passive too. Mao is so versital in his item choices.\n\nI could go on a bit more. Personaly I think the coin is pretty decent, but is undervalued. Its one of those items that people dont use cause it isnt blatantly OP or used in pro scene.\n\nI do have a buff proposal though:\n\nThe Talisman of Ascention instead of giving 10 HP per minion... could give 1% of max HP per minion kill. On a 1000 HP max champ, it would give back 10 HP per minion kill. It would still be tied to not giving the killing blow and this would keep it from being abused by other laners. No top lane tanks cant abuse this, they have no room in their items for a zero health/resistance item that would give them back a few hundred hp for minions they didnt kill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SleepyLionCub","date":"2016-03-25T18:11:41.355+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"they need to give its passive movespeed back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-03-25T20:04:43.796+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean it sorta makes sense that it sits under Relic Shield and Spell Thief.

The coin has a bit less combat stats, but it fits a passive play style a lot better. \n\nFrost queen requires you to get in an enemies face in order to generate gold. If you're losing the lane this could be very dangerous, meaning you might not be able to do that. Then you're not generating gold which makes things worse. It also does nothing for health sustain. The active is great, but more focused around creating picks than the coins general purpose active.\n\nFace of the mountain similarly puts you in danger every time you want to use it. In order to get the gold, you have to get close enough to execute a minion, giving the enemy a chance to poke you. It comes with some healing, but only enough to offset some of the potential poke that comes from getting close to enemies. It also does nothing for mana regen, so depending on who you play you have a decent chance of running out of mana fast. The active fills such a different strategic role it's like comparing apples to oranges.\n\nThe coin fills the 3rd niche which involves sitting back, and helping your adc if they get into trouble. You don't need to do anything dangerous to generate gold, gold just happens to you. At the same time, if you do get into a fight it sustains both your health and mana, allowing you to stay in the lane a lot longer/indefinitely. In addition the active is great for team fights giving an instant speed boost to everyone nearby. Since the kind of champs that take coin are focused on engage/disengage, this active is heavily beneficial to those champs.\n\nTbh I've always found gold efficiency to be a bad metric because you don't just need raw stats. You need the stats/effects that benefit the champ you play, and the things you want to do with them.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-03-26T23:41:21.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Relic Shield line also has one other substantial downfall; post laning phase, FQC will give you gold for participating in team skirmishes like normal, and Talisman STILL just passively generates gold for being in a lane where minions are dying.
