There's actually a lot of Rioters that read the forums but don't post. The lurkers are out there, reading more than you might suspect and we all get excited when someone has something encouraging to say.\n\nWe understand that the reason people post on the forums is because they are SUPER passionate about the game. No matter what gets said if players didn't love LoL they just wouldn't even bother. It is frustrating for me sometimes because a lot of posts I read I agree with as a player, or have no insights to add, or can't comment on because no official announcement has yet been made and I have to just sit there and think 'I feel the same, but I can't post anything that will be more than just frustrating'.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-06-28T22:31:39.935+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":">The lurkers are out there, reading more than you might suspect\n\n(Not directed at you since you actually talk to us, and thank you for that.)\n\nThat's the problem - they're lurkers, not posters.  One of the reasons they hate coming here is that it's a hostile place.  Maybe they should spend less time on Reddit with the mindless esports drones and more time talking to real players on the forums they forced us to adapt to and then seemed to abandon.\n\nThe thought of Rioters coming back to the forums are just empty words now for how many times we've seen this claim.  It hasn't happened yet, and when it does, it's grossly short-lived before the \"rare\" Red name goes into hiding again...or back to Reddit with non-player spectators pretending they play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-06-30T05:06:05.535+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I'll point out that it's not an obligation, and most people don't have time during work hours then have family/other commitments outside of work. I try to comment as often as possible but that ends up being ~1 hour every few nights. Also I try not to post unless I have something useful to say and make the commitment to answer any follow up questions so it doesn't just seem like I drop a comment and disappear. Sometimes I see something I want to comment on but if I'm really busy and know I don't have the time for any following conversation then I won't.\n\nI don't think the few negative people on the boards really put Rioters off, it's just that it's a time commitment that not everyone can or chooses to make. I think there are more Q&A's being scheduled (including a Tahm Kench one I'll be around for on Wednesday 11-1pm PST) which helps but even then it sucks if you can't make it. KateyKhaos puts in a huge amount of her personal time to be active on the boards, I know because when I get in in the morning and when I leave at night she is usually at it - often my first act of the day is to grab some broccoli to munch on and ask KateyKhaos how the boards are doing today. I guess another thing is that not everyone is confident in their ability to communicate clearly. When you are posting with a red name you know people will analyse your every word and, though we speak as individuals, Riot's reputation is in our hands. They will even take screenshots and bring them out 5 years later and ask you why you haven't done what you said you would. For example I got rightly slammed for comments I made about Pool Party Ahri, and that kind of blunder might deter a lot of people from repeat posting. But not because they are scared of making a mistake, it's because they don't want to disappoint players.","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2015-06-30T09:34:34.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I found this a while back and I thought it might help any Rioter, knowing how stressful your job can be, so here is this article that explains why cat videos \"lower stress and makes you happy\"\nhttp://theconversation.com/cat-lovers-rejoice-watching-online-videos-lowers-stress-and-makes-you-happy-43460\nAnd here is a Documentary about why and how it all works, notice it is a documentary, so it isn't a short video by any means, but it is **cute**, so if you know about any Rioter having a stressful time, this might help them out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_dMD2NokTg\nI could only find it on youtube, sorry 'bout that.\n\nWhile we're add it, I might as well add this website, it gives you a rather new perception on how to deal with illiteracy, which might come in handy depending on the line of work the individual Rioters do.\nhttp://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html\n\nTake care.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-01T20:18:33.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks dude!
