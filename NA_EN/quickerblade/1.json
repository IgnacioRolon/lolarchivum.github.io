The problems are obvious by playing against it. Twitch has zero reasonable counterplay in his kit with too much power. A rework is needed. Azir was dumpstered until rework, why isn't twitch? Ahri's been retardedly strong for many many patches all because her power isn't shifted correctly in her kit. Lucian's broken because of the buffs and bork buffs at the same time. Draven got HIS NUMBERS BUFFED for whatever fucking ape reason they decided that it was a good idea. Lulu's busted because of her point-n-click hard cc and blatantly overloaded kit. Power needs to be shifted in some way to allow counterplay.\n{{item:3165}}  is literally a staple item for 99.99% of mages in the game because its component gives infinite lane mana, 50% of the max cdr cap, a fuckton of ap, and mana.\nIt only takes a LITTLE BIT of brain cells to actually address the problems. \n\n**Not even going to mention all the problems (both being broken, op, or under powered) with Zac, Trynd, Kayle, Karma, Kled, pantheon, Eve's perma stealth \"mechanic\",  Kogmaw, Fiora, Thresh, Galio, Lux, Annie, Syndra, Trundle, Voli, Lissandra, Ivern, AD Kennen.**\n\nI mean what the FUCK are these RUMBLE BUFFS???? Oh yeah it's because Riot has to make the Pros look good by buffing LCS champions at the start of the comp season and then nerfing them after worlds. Say hello to Sivir, Ashe, Gnar, Braum, Gragas buffs up and coming.\n\n> I don&#x27;t know what your previous cases were like so I can only comment on your current case right here, and in your case you&#x27;re constantly verbally abusing and harassing other players for doing things that you don&#x27;t like.

Constant violent thoughts and nightmares that I've bottled up for 18 years.
