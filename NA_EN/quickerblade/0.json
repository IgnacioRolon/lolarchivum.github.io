Nothing hypes people up more than simplicity, originality, and GOOD MUSIC.\nJinx/Braum were my fav champ for a long time after their releases and there was a ton of hype. Not even gonna mention THRESH release.\nI&#039;ve actually turned off login music for the past couple years because the shit&#039;s just been garbage.\n\nI mean for real LOOK AT THAT DRAVEN LOGIN SCREEN. \n\n\nThen there&#039;s this stupid shit like Taliyah, Sol, Kled etc. Less than 1% pickrate since their release. Nothing has felt like it&#039;s had depth. They are shiny on top, but just so shallow that they are meh.\n\nHonestly, new content is just becoming very unappealing and unoriginal. Or so original that it takes away from actual gameplay.\n\nBesides the point I'm trying to make, I've actually been very disappointed with the music lately. Music connects with people on so many different levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Sakuri Ono","date":"2017-06-18T09:36:09.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey QuickerBlade,\n\nLogin Screens, and all feedback related to them and other League of Legends art assets, do not go in the Gameplay board.
