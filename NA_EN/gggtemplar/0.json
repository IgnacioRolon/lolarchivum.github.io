I am left-handed and play with the windows default setting of my primary and secondary mouse buttons reversed. League of Legends client has never acknowledged this change from the start and you had to go manually edit values to do it in the LoL files\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4821315&amp;page=1#post49602674\r\n\r\nI no longer see my input.ini file in the Config folder though. I don't know how to fix this. Game is unplayable with my mouse buttons backwards\r\n\r\nHow do I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T15:48:49.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many keys in league are reserved and can't be modified, including the mouse buttons.

Surely you shouldn't be neglecting the amount of people in the LoL community who are left-handed. It's really poor customer service and the fact it hasn't been adressed for years makes me wonder. Yesterday is a prime example of this happening again, with settings being defaulted and no official response being provided other than \"some people had this issue\". What about people losing games because their settings were changed without their knowledge?","replies":[{"poster":"Haadhun","date":"2018-02-11T20:36:50.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. And for me I'm right-handed but due a health issue can't use mouse with right hand. Since there is no easy way to reverse mouse buttons, it seams I'll stop playing.

The left handed 'setting' works for everything except LoL, and so over time everyone sorta uninstalled LoL because we would rather play a game that caters for said person.  I reinstalled LoL for the purpose of seeing if I can get a left handed configuration because if I can we would all start playing again.\n\nAs mentioned this has been discussed for many years in many forums, and so this is a last ditch attempt to request a proper solution.\n\nI could not find a matching support ticket/FAQ and so I will open a new support ticket to do so.","replies":[]}]}
