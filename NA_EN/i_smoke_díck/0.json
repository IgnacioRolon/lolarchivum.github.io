A little less than 7 months ago I had gotten my main account permanently banned for foul language. I know that most of you guys will already decide that &quot;you deserve it&quot; and you&#039;re right I did but I have truly changed. With my new account I striven to do better and be a better person after putting in the consideration of how my words actually affected others through the online community. But what I had recently found out has been unacceptable in my eyes because I feel as though a friend of mine is getting special treatment. I will admit to knowing that he had cheated, hacked, and scripted exploiting Riots game League of Legends and ruined it for many people before he got &quot;permanently banned.&quot; This ban wasn&#039;t so permanent as he emailed the support team and they decided to lift his &quot;permanent ban&quot; and he receives his account back next month after its been nearly a year. So I would like to know your guys input on this matter as to do you think that Riot is being irrational about my ban and not think that I have changed? Even though my new account is clean as ever, and proven of change. But Riot lets someone who has hacked, cheated, and scripted exploit their game but is able to recieve their account back after doing so?

I'll quote it all again with the source.

In fewer than three months since the creation of this account, the Veigodx account has established a consistent record of in-game harassment, abuse, and poor behavior:\n58.8% of reports against Veigodx were for Offensive Language, Verbal Abuse, and Negative Attitude.\n\nWorse, however, are the violations in Jensens gameplay history:\nOn multiple occasions, he has publicly and unapologetically admitted to engaging in a series of DDOS attacks against high-Elo players.\nHere is one example:\n\n\n\n**Jensen has been permanently banned twice before. In August of 2012, a majority of players on the Tribunal voted to permaban Wizikx, a previous Jensen account. After reviewing the facts, the Riot player behavior team upheld the ban.

The decision to let him play again does in fact show that a permaban is only NOT permanent if it deals with pro players, regardless of what they'v done.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-01-19T17:42:34.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> No, you are cherry picking what you want to support your idea.

He was not suspended by the NBA or the CNBA (National Basketball Association and College National Basketball Association). If you want to compare this to League of Legends, this would be like team SoloMid suspending a player on their roster from playing on their team indefinitely. In such a situation it is not the overarching organization (Riot) barring him from playing, it is his team/teamowner/teamcoach that will not allow him to play with them.\n\n3 - It's college basketball. And Allen Grayson is listed as the #1 pick to go to the NBA. Duke University gets MILLIONS of dollars for their sports program if they keep him playing, do you really think they are going to let their coach bench him when he does this? The big 16 college sports universities do not care if their team members are awful people, they only care that they perform well. This is potentially exactly what happened with Riot. Professional LoL players are to the LoL community what professional NBA players are to NBA fans, and what professional football players are to football fans. There are a significant number of people who would not bother paying much attention to LoL if certain pro players were to disappear. You see it through a lot of games in fact, just this last year a professional project M player (console fighting game) named Lunchables (I think) retired, and Project M lost a significant number of traffic because there were people who came simply to watch him play. The Street Fighter franchise has had to deal with this multiple times when any of their professional players hung up his controller. The difference here is that we are not discussing players who retired, we are discussing players who were punished because they cheated severely (Jensen) or were physically violent in spite of the spirit of the game (Grayson) both of which were protected from the very system that was put in place to make sure that they adhere to a standard.\n\nThink about it this way, do you want people playing sports who are using steroids? Do you think any player caught using steroids should be banned from playing in professional sporting events for it? Do you want people playing E-sports using hacks or sabotaging their opponents? Do you think players who use hacks or sabotage their opponents should be banned? if you say yes to any of these, then why would you allow a player found to be guilty of these things, on multiple different occasions, to be allowed back into the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-01-20T21:46:17.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indefinite is synonymous with unlimited, but they do not have the exact same meaning.

What makes this even weirder to me is the fact that you say your friend is getting his account back next month. If Riot officially decides to lift a permanent ban, from my knowledge they would do so immediately, or at least faster than what you claim. I have never heard of them deciding to lift a punishment, but then wait a while before actually doing so.\n\nAnyway, this is just my thoughts on the topic. I just have a feeling that there's more to the story than what's being said, whether you know what it is or not. Of course, I'm not a Riot employee at all, so I can't really do anything except state my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Grandis","date":"2017-01-19T02:15:54.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm going to point out that Incarnation, the pro player who was banned in 2013 for DDOS'ing his opponents in live and tournament matches, was allowed to start playing as Cloud 9's mid laner in 2015.

Here, the following links are Riot's official announcement about his ban (it's the 2nd one on the list) and then the confirmation that he's allowed to play again, as Cloud 9's mid lane.\n\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1015978&page=1#post10180118\nhttp://2015.na.lolesports.com/articles/2015-mid-year-long-term-suspension-reviews","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-01-18T01:31:24.717+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I had gotten my main account permanently banned for foul language\n\nKinda doubt it was for foul language. Foul language is fine. Foul language used to verbally abuse someone is not.\n\n>So is it fair that I got permantetly banned without thought of getting my account back? or is it fair that someone who has hacked, cheated, and scripted gets their account back? who deserves their account back?\n\nYou didn't include a, \"Both should remain banned\" option.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CancerBasedGod","date":"2017-01-18T00:52:42.707+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stop pandering to random people on the boards about the ban you deserved...","replies":[]}]}
