This can happen if your HP laptop is running an older version of Windows, if part of the re-install is updating to a newer version of Windows that it didn't originally ship with, or if you're required to use a separate driver loaded disc after reinstalling your copy of Windows.\n\nIt's hard to tell what may be missing from your computer without adequate information, but I'd definitely start with [updating your video drivers using our guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq2) and [updating DirectX](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq3).\n\nAfterwards, try starting a Custom Game by yourself to see if you continue to crash out. If so, please [contact my colleagues through the Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) so we can go through your logs and system settings and determine what might be the problem.","replies":[]}]}
