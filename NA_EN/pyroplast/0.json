I'd like us to run through a quick reset of the file together. First, **log into the Client** then jump into your config folder, which should be in this directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete the following files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these files, hop into a custom match to confirm the reset worked. You're now free to try changing your settings in-game, hopefully they stick now!","replies":[{"poster":"Inglemoose","date":"2017-04-04T08:14:54.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Targons Blade, this solution worked for me. Really happy someone had this problem like I did, helped me get past another great feature that LoL offers its users! \n\nThanks again :)","replies":[]}]}]}
