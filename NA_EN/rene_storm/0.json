It makes more sense for it to be an AoE! It is so weak and barely does any damage, atleast increase the slow duration to make it effective.\r\nW: I literally can die while on the way TO my ally. I've been stopped by Veigar Cages, Rammus Q's and I genuinely feel like they should increase the ratio because maxing it doesnt feel beneficial at all.\r\nE: Ratio is way way way too low, it's a heal, and it takes too long to charge.\r\nR: This spell brings nothing to a team fight, it's like a weaker form of a Neeko E and a Maokai R.\r\n\r\nBuff her ratios and her auto attack range and maybe she will be viable but right now she is extremely disappointing","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-05-16T17:33:08.024+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Rene Storm,\n\nI totally understand the passion that you have around Yuumi--as a Support main, I'm also intrigued by her release; our designers and balance teams are closely monitoring Yuumi. HeyItzSteve is correct that there's a better sub-board for this topic, but I noticed one of our designers tweeting about some hotfixes they have for her so I wanted to quickly mention it here since you haven't made a new thread on the Gameplay sub-board: \n\n- [Twitter Link](https://twitter.com/MarkYetter/status/1128828744758546432)\n\nTry her out again to see if anything feels better or worse. If you still have feedback, hit up the Gameplay sub-board with your thoughts.\n\nP.S. I'm not on the design or balance teams--no one would want that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2019-05-17T06:57:03.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"counter point: don't hotfix buff anything days after release. this has happened a lot and has ended up making the champions broken once people learn them","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2019-05-16T05:38:43.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This topic is not suited for the Ask the Community sub-board.
