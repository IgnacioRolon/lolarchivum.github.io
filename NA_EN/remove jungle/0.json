How can you have a hard time with Xerath when you can Easly farm under tower/far from range. I mean if he gets a kill or 2 meh whatever but 0/4 in 10mins man... \r\n\r\nafter that that Yasuo started to get fed because my team was scared of him even know we had a perfect team comp to lock him down L. Thank god I was playing support Sion. I told my team to just follow he is easy to lock down trust me. and what do you know we won the game.\r\n\r\nI use to main Yasuo Season 4-5 never had a problem in lane against him even on veigar lately I am playing him on mid.","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-20T05:25:25.356+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"xerath can't farm as easily as that\n\nbut dying 4 times in 10 minutes is unusual regardless of who the enemy laner is, even against yasuo","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-20T05:03:17.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is funny and sad.

They whine and say windwall is OP, yet they fail to say how long the CD is on it. If you can't make a play in a CD window, that's YOUR problem lmao.  Then they say his passive is OP, well, who recently just got a better improved Yas passive? Malz. It blocks 100% of the dmg, and it blocks CC!! Yas's does not. \n\nHe has infinite dashes!! No, he can dash to only the same minion once every so often. Irelia has infinite dashes. And can dash to the same thing more than once. (i think, idk haven't seen an irelia for a long time). No minions = no dashes = less damage when he uses his dash on you since he couldn't stack it up. Learn to manipulate lanes and you won't have an issue.\n\nI find the number one issue with Yas, is that people don't understand how to play against him, they are so busy QQing that they don't figure out how to beat him. Windwall has a long CD, passive get's off with 1 tiny auto attack, pick a ranged CC champ with decent mobility, or a in your face gap closing champ melee champ, like Zed, or even Kata or Talon. No minions = no mobility. Very squishy, very vulnerable to cc. Can easily lose burst trades. A Yas E, Q, Auto will not do as much as a Zed E, Q , auto lmao.\n\nSo when people feed him, and he gets his phantom dancer, 100% crit with IE, and some lifesteal/MR/Armor, he becomes just like any other champion would if they got fed. \n\nI had an Annie calling Yas broken when i was playing him. I mean really i shouldn't of been able to beat her, but she never once timed her Tibbers for when i DIDN'T HAVE MY PASSIVE UP. That's not my fault lmao. All it would of taken was 1 little auto attack, and then she could have easily 1 shotted me in a stun. But nope.\n\nAny champ is useless without brains :D Any champ is useful WITH brains. ANY champ is OP late game. I know people complain about how hes a problem late game even after losing all match, well, so is Singed, So is Vayne, Jinx, Any ADC, any top lane tank, any super burst JG. ANYONE is OP late game.  Iv'e seen SOOOO MANY Vaynes go 0-9 and proceed to go more negative, then late game they can 1v5 penta. Like, come on, i don't see people bitching about her lategame, but if Yas can do it, NERF IT. Plz, logic xD.

Malz. It **blocks 100% of the dmg**, and it blocks CC!! Yas's does not. \n\nNO! That is NOT how it works! It gives him damage reduction! Malzahar still takes damage from whatever pops his passive! Unless its a crowd control effect that doesn't deal damage... In which case he would just lose his passive.\n\n> Void Shift\n\n> Innate: Malzahar receives Void Shift if he hasn't taken damage nor been affected by crowd control in the last 30 / 24 / 18 / 12 seconds. Damage from minions does not interact with Void Shift.\n\n> Void Shift phases out Malzahar, making him immune to crowd control and **taking 90% reduced damage**, lingering for 0.25 seconds after taking damage or blocking a crowd control effect.\n\n> Additional Information:\n* Void Shift will not mitigate true damage but the buff will be still consumed.\n\nYasuo's Resolve shield on the other hand actually DOES take the damage first and negates some of it as seen here: \n\n>Way of the Wanderer\n\n>Resolve: Yasuo generates 1% of his maximum Flow for every 59 / 52 / 46 units he travels by any means, requiring a total of 5900 / 5200 / 4600 units travelled to obtain maximum Flow. At maximum Flow, the next instance of champion or monster damage against Yasuo consumes all of his Flow and shields him for 100 - 510 (based on level) damage for up to 1 second.\n\n>Additional Information:\n* **Any damage dealt to Yasuo when the conditions are met is instead dealt to Resolve's shield.**\n* Damage that is negated by the shield appears as a white indicator.\n\nAs a {{champion:90}} and {{champion:157}} player I had to point this out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mafia LeBlanc","date":"2017-01-20T05:12:15.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing about Yasuo - even if you shut him down and play perfectly.. when he is 0/5, and you start roaming to get objectives and help your team, he is CSing and waveclearing instantly with complete safety and healing to full with warlord's bloodlust if he happens to actually take any damage.  I've never seen even the most retarded incompetent yasuo have less than 250-300 CS by the end of a match, when everyone else is sporting ~150-200, no matter how shut down he was.  Compare that to an underfed Lux/Annie/Viktor.  They won't be able to oneshot the wave, and they spend mana and put themselves at risk to do it.  And if they get hit by a single ability and they're underfed, they're going to get at least 1/4 their hp chipped away instantly.  Yasuo just heals it if he somehow is boosted enough to miss his windwall.\n\nNo matter what, he is going to be a bitch to deal with late game, that's what I find so ungodly frustrating about him - and if he's on a team with Janna/Malphite/J4/etc, all he has to do is wait, flash R, and he just won his team the fight with 2 button presses.  Even if you don't get hit by the knockup itself, if you're near the knocked up teammate when Yas ults, you get CC'd and bursted anyway.\n\nI used to scoff at all the Yasuo hate because of how easy he can be to shut down in lane, but when it literally doesn't matter a single bit how well you play against him, he becomes an extremely frustrating champion to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-01-20T06:25:40.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is it the Yasuo that is OP and not Xerath who played poorly?\n\nI mean, pretty much any champion is going to appear to be OP when they are fed, so how is this surprising?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arya Riven","date":"2017-01-20T05:36:10.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rovin beats yasuo","replies":[]}]}
