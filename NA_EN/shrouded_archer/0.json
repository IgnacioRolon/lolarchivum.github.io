That said, one criticism I have to share is that Evelynn&rsquo;s voice lines are extremely overly-sexual and I find it demeaning to women in general and insulting to the player. \n\nPlease consider re-working her VO and giving her a more appropriate tone. Let me know how I can help.\n\nEdit: sorry no, hadnâ€™t read her lore. I guess that makes a bit more sense.

There's times when it doesn't even use seduction, it'll just wait until it can get the most bang for it's bang and rip you to pieces in front of your family so you all suffer. It just went with whatever works, it's VO sounds sexual but most of time it's talking about killing you. Example:\"Awh I thought you'd last long~\" a play on premature ejaculation and dying sooner than expected from the torture","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-24T02:22:50.942+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unsure if this is a bait or if you never bothered to read her backstory or bio.\n\nIn this case it makes sense and is fitting.

Evelyn is LITERALLY a sex demon.  Over-sexual is the word that best describes pretty much her entire character.  Taking the \"oversexed\" out of Eve would be like taking the Demacia out of Garen, or the \"ninja\" out of Zedd.   They're... kinda integral to the characters.  Honest to god, she'd be far, FAR worse if this wasn't a game for teens... just be happy her /joke doesn't involve her eating a banana or something.\n\nIf the former... well played merry shitposter.
