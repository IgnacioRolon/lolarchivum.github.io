They block them because they literally never want to play with them ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-02T18:47:48.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe and I say MAYBE 1 dodge every 3 days at the maximum. I would lose my freaking mind with how many times I have been in a game, oops someone left, ok now someone didn't accept it, and ok they didnt accept it again, FINALLY...... oh shit I have been autofilled.","replies":[]}]}
