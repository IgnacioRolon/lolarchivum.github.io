Before he was able to come out of stealth and QQWEQ you extremely fast, with most of the damage being dealt in the first QQ. Now he has to QEWQ, with most of the damage being dealt in the last Q. Therefore he needs to be in melee range for a MUCH longer time than before to do his thing, and cleansing a CC is exactly what allows him to do so.\n\nFear is awesome to get away from a bad situation, but Shaco's JitB are the most unreliable source of fear in the entire game. They need 2 seconds to be activatable, they can be taken down by 1 AoE spell from a mage or 1-2 Auto Attacks from any AD champion (or just die to randomly thrown AoE effects in the team fight), and are instantly deactivated with {{item:2055}} {{item:3364}}. If you are tryng to put those down to get out of a bad spot during a team fight, you're gonna have a BAD time.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure you have played those champions enough if you really have this opinion, because their Engage+Escape potential is really low in comparassion to any other Assassin.\n\n>obvi not all assassins can jump into a fivestack and live, to be fair none of them should be able to, but escaping a second or third opponent is what they can do well\n\n>Especially with some prep time.\n\n\nAgreed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2017-01-26T16:31:49.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The assassin is to not go in and out, in an out. it is about picking off the lonely straggler before a fight, and then picking off the low stragglers at the end of the fight. \n\nGoing in and out of the fight makes you look like a diver.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2017-01-26T16:36:19.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, I'm an Assassin main (a Shaco main at that, if it matters).
