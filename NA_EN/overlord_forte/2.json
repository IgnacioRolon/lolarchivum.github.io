{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2015-06-12T03:53:56.004+0000","title":"[Gameplay] Syndra's Broken Kit: 25 Patches and Onward","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":110,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hello.\n\nIn general, the following bugs have existed in some form within Syndra&#039;s kit for months, if not years, by now. With an exception of the champion specific ones (Veigar E, Zyra plants, etc), I&#039;ve kept an eye on them for over 25 patches now. Syndra&#039;s Q+E stun bug in particular, and the related E knockback bug, have proven perhaps the worst one of all, completely robbing the reliability of her incredibly important stun combo. You&#039;ll find the threadnaught I created on that in its entry article below.\n\nI could say a lot about Syndra&#039;s competitive balance, but I&#039;m going to be honest, these bugs are the biggest issue I will put my credibility on. No one wants to use a champion where every vital part of their kit can - and will - fail randomly, without warning, and quite possibly at the worst time. No one wants to deal with the one window they have to win their lane slip away because a stun didn&#039;t land like it should have. No one wants to watch a jungler chase them down and walk through their only CC like it didn&#039;t even exist.\n\nI&#039;ve often alluded to the plethora of bugs plaguing Syndra&#039;s kit, not just her broken stun. To help centralize this knowledge base, and expose all the wonky broken parts of her kit, I&#039;m creating this thread. Any evidence you have, particularly video/gif/gycat, would be very useful to me for analysis. Thank you.\n\nI&#039;ll be updating this post generally on the status of each individual bug. I&#039;ll refrain from spam dumping videos in this thread due to how poorly this forum takes huge media posts. You can find my real time video bug tracking list here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6o_Jh1Wm2f54JKXGW6zJwe5r4t4mawU4\n\n---------\nBugs still being researched:\n\nW throw cursor bug (When grabbing/throwing an object, player cursor turns into a ping menu/stops working, requiring clicking of the mini map and or escape menu to unbreak)\n\nQ+E max range whiff bug (Using E at a max range casted Q will sometimes just not launch the sphere. May be a bug or a small 10-20 unit dead zone, but this radically affects her long range stun sniping sometimes).\n\n----------\n\n>**Syndra Q+E Stun Bug**\nBehavior: Any Dark Spheres launched by Scatter the Weak have a strong and reasonably consistent chance of not working as intended. In general, launched Dark Spheres will: Not stun, not knockback, not apply damage. They will phase through their targets as if they don&#039;t exist, causing the combo to functionally break.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Create a Dark Sphere. Simply dropping one with Q is enough, more have a higher chance of generating the bug.\nStep 2: Launch a Dark Sphere by using Scatter of the Weak, preferrably into multiple simultaneous targets.\nStep 3: Observe for lack of knockback, stun, and or damage. May require repeat application (bug consistently intermittent.)\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYf30zbsoRk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a__sNUck6bo\n\nAdditional thread of more evidence: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/8UbfJEPt-gameplay-syndras-broken-stunkb-10-patches-and-counting (Warning: Massive load time).\n\n**NOTE**: This bug was largely fixed in Patch 5.13, however fringe behavior is still occurring. Please report any situations you run into. \n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra E Knockback Bug**\nBehavior: A relative of the Q+E stun bug, this is simply Scatter the Weak&#039;s knockback component failing. Any pulse wave from this ability may hit the target, sometimes do damage, and completely fail to shove back one or more entities it hits.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Sit in range of multiple targets, either stationary or moving.\nStep 2: Use Scatter the Weak, observe for targets hit but not shoved or moved by the ability in any capacity.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU1Z_UbRTz8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHOgmteuRF8\n\nAdditional notes: I've never seen the E bug work on a single target. If it triggers, it has exclusively been on a minimum of TWO targets, scaling upward. Solo targets to the best of my experience and memory remain 100% effective to knockback.\n\n**NOTE**: This bug was seemingly fixed in Patch 5.13. Please report any new occurrences of the bug in this version or later.\n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra Q+E Bounce Bug**\nBehavior: A relative of the stun bug, this is rarer but even more bizarre. Any Dark Sphere hit by Scatter the Weak has a chance to completely bounce backwards from the direction _it should have launched in_. This is not a graphical glitch: the Dark Sphere is still a valid entity (can be manipulated by W and R) and stun targets in its new flight path.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Use Scatter the Weak on Dark Spheres. (Possible modifiers: near by terrain, number of targets hit by Scatter)\nStep 2: Observe for any Dark Spheres suddenly flying in the wrong direction. This bug is very intermittent, but consistently occurs.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeSKBIWLoFA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDXVShGjkD4\n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra Q+W+E Slow Bug**\nBehavior: Dark Spheres thrown by Force of Will and launched by Scatter the Weak lose their stun and knockback properties. Instead, the launched Dark Spheres acquire Force of Will&#039;s slow property, effectively turning it into a long range slow skill shot, not a stun.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Create a Dark Sphere, then grab it with Force of Will.\nStep 2: Throw the Dark Sphere.\nStep 3: Use Scatter the Weak when the Dark Sphere is in mid flight, observe for the launched sphere failing to stun/kb.\nStep 3.1: Alternatively, use Scatter the Weak on a Dark Sphere that has /just landed/, observe for failed stun/kb.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLa-0HGL49g\n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra Q Damage Dislocation Bug**\nBehavior: Dark Sphere, upon being cast, will sometimes simply not damage targets in its blast zone. The hitbox moves sometimes, or selectively ignore random targets, for reasons that are unclear. It can happen in any part of the ability and doesn&#039;t necessarily seem related to how many targets its hitting.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Cast Dark Sphere\nStep 2: Observe the damage of all targets, their locations, and their relationship to the blast zone. The cast marker can be useful for this, but sometimes it&#039;s blatant enough to just stand out.\nStep 3: Repeat as necessary, this bug seems infrequent largely due to how hard it is to notice it in motion sometimes.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcAWFrICaj0\n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra W Dislocation Bug**\nBehavior: Objects thrown by Force of Will do not have the impact zone align correctly. Often the graphical animation and actual damage hit box operate in completely separate ways. One will generate in one location, the other in another.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Grab an object with Force of Will. Dark Spheres are the easiest, followed by minions, but it generally doesn&#039;t matter.\nStep 2: Throw the object, observe the impact zone. The thrown object will usually jitter/move around, and the &#039;explosion aura&#039; may be completely set off to the side.\nStep 2.1: To assess the hitbox, throw the object into minion waves. Observe the graphic animation, the ability cast icon, and the impact of the object. You will see damage apply when it shouldn&#039;t, or damage not apply when it should.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f9xvL99yx4\n\nAdditional notes: Thrown objects behave incredibly weird with Force of Will. &#039;Living objects&#039; (minions, monsters, etc) are the strangest as they actively fight being thrown, quite possibly torking the hitbox in their own way. Dark Spheres behave the same, though they don&#039;t move.\n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra W Break Bug**\nBehavior: Force of Will breaks when CC is applied during it&#039;s &#039;grab&#039; and &#039;pre-throw&#039; phase. CC (stuns/silences/fears/suppression, anything that prevents abilities) will cause it to go on cooldown while the held object is still grabbed and simply let the leash time expire.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Grab an object with Force of Will.\nStep 2: While Force of Will is grabbing, or &#039;about to throw&#039;, apply disabling CC.\nStep 3: Repeat as necessary, this bug is timing sensitive for a specific window of process.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f3djTdQhI4\n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra W Throw Break Bug**\nBehavior: Force of Will can break when throwing &#039;special creatures&#039;, namely Heimdinger turrets and Zyra plants, though this CAN happen on normal minion/monsters. Essentially, the thrown object flies, but usually half way into its flight, it will &#039;break&#039; by stalling in the air, jittering, then falling immediately to the ground or even going backwards. This is not a visual bug as the entity&#039;s location is legitimate and the damage moves with it.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Grab an object or special object (Heimer Turret, Zyra Plant) with Force of Will.\nStep 2: Throw it at any range, though max range is the easiest to observe.\nStep 3: Repeat as necessary, the bug is intermittent.\n\nVideo evidence: \n\n\nThis bug may have been stealth patched or fixed. Unable to reproduce on 5.11, but will observe (I&#039;m pretty sure it still exists).\n\n-----------\n\n>**Syndra Q+E vs Veigar E Bug**\nBehavior: Veigar&#039;s Event Horizon stops Dark Spheres launched by Scatter the Weak. While it depends on the angle, and how many targets are hit, Event Horizon will stop Dark Spheres at its edges. This is not a graphical issue: the hitbox itself full stops.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Create Dark Spheres, let Veigar drop Event Horizon.\nStep 2: Launch Dark Spheres with Scatter the Weak into the &#039;walls&#039; and &#039;pillars&#039;, respectively.\nStep 2.1: For additional bugginess, be sure to hit minions/champions in or near the Event Horizon boundary.\nStep 3: Observe for stopped stuns and frozen Dark Spheres.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hb72fdkPFM\n\n------------\n\n>**Syndra R Stutter Step Bug**\nBehavior: Unleashed Power causes Syndra herself to &#039;frame desync&#039; and her model just stutters around in place for a few seconds. Her actual movement doesn&#039;t seem to be interrupted, she&#039;s just visibly skipping all over the place. This tends to go away after a second or two, it varies. Sphere count doesn&#039;t generally seem to influence its likelihood of triggering.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\nStep 1: Fire Unleashed Power, it will sometimes trigger regardless of a kill or dodge effect.\nStep 1.1: Fire Unleashed Power at someone who Zhonya&#039;s/Dodges (vlad pool, etc), causing the ability to whiff. This can generate the stutter step bug.\nStep 1.2: Kill someone with Unleashed Power, usually causes the stutter step bug.\n\nVideo evidence: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMoOHMz_zh0\n\nAdditional notes: This bug has varying severity. Sometimes it's very noticeable and she'll frame skip a whole champion length away, otherwise it's a kind of in-place buzzing. Regardless, it's difficult to tell if her hit box is moving with her model too, so dodging can be an incredible pain when it's active.\n\n-------------","replies":[{"poster":"EmeraldShift","date":"2015-06-12T06:12:40.757+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is probably one of the most comprehensive, well-written bug reports I've seen in a while.  {{item:2054}} Have a poro-snax.","replies":[{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2015-06-12T07:46:46.589+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~Forged by a year of agony.~~\n\nThank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"OnanThaMan","date":"2015-06-13T02:31:26.653+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gratz, shame riot will probably ignore it though.

Her Q+E / E arsenal provides a very powerful, but situational, means of self-defense and team fight utility that no other character in the game has. Her long range damage means she can reasonably kite/siege/poke, and rather than being forced into that role hard (Xerath), her kit ramps up into one of the best single target bursts in the game. Notably, however, she is **always** on the edge of victory or defeat - Syndra has very little to no room for error in playing. Good Syndra's will kite and dance at the edge constantly, but a badly positioned or performing one will get steam rolled in seconds.\n\n\nA lot of people utilized her pre-6 Q damage as her 'strongest virtue', but I can see why Riot finds her original Q to have been oppressive. I don't agree with it per say, other midlaners with similar abilities have gone relatively unmolested (Azir/Cassopeia/Zed/Ahri/Leblanc/Xerath). With the exception of Xerath, and possibly Ziggs, virtually all of her contemporaries have mobility/self-utility skills that lessen the lack of mobility she herself must always address. \n\nI mostly hate this nerf because it allows 'passive' Flask+Pot spam farmers to exist in lane. Syndra's mana costs are very strong, so she has a lot of trouble ripping through 900~ extra HP that early in the game. So, rather than her opponents having to respect her, she's forced into this 'lets do nothing for 7 minutes or maybe a jungler will gank' cramped spot. Non-flask laners largely came down to skill, with melee picks usually having trouble (as they normally do against ranged control).\n\n\nOnce you got past laning, team fighting is pretty much the same it always has been, save the E width nerf (which I'm 100% fine with, frankly). Syndra kites, applies damage, and constantly monitors the rhythm of her dark spheres with the flow of battle. If she goes in at the wrong time, her ultimate wont cash out as much damage, or she'll lose her one big opportunity to win the fight, so there's a constant check to be _very_ particular about fighting. She exerts a lot of influence in her stun combo, often becoming a major source of initiation/counter initiation on her own because of it. But, if the enemy really wants to, she can be ran down and forced from the fight, and all her attention has to be spent on surviving because there is no 'get out of jail free' card (Flash excepted).\n\n\nWhen she works, she does well. I don't think her numbers need to be changed, per say, because the _reliability_ of her skills is the main issue. If her stun fails, her best tool is gone; if W misses, a huge source of damage/slow is gone; if Q misses, well big source of damage gone; etc, etc. Once her bugs are addressed, I'll be a lot more comfortable about saying buffs/nerfs because I'll be able to see how strong she is when she's _working as intended_.\n\nOtherwise any buffs may quite possibly make her overbearing once her reliability is where it should be.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-06-12T17:20:06.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"F for Fish","date":"2015-06-13T19:23:18.093+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"On behalf of Syndra mains everywhere, thank you for putting the amount of time into this that you did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2015-06-12T15:40:50.525+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just watched all those videos; this is F'ing ridiculous.

The closer they are the easier and faster the W gets to hit the enemy. When enemy champs get mobility from getting or upgrading boots, it becomes a hassle to even get the edge of the skill shot to hit them. Probably harder to land than an Xerath Ulti from my personal experience.)\n \n* The stun bug itself I have yet to see happen on champions on patch 5.11 although on minions and monster camps its really easy to replicate. I probably have to play more games to see if it occurs. I was sure that the stealth fix Riot added was helping a bit but I guess it'll be continued to be [monitored](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/XAE2whzZ-pbe-feedback-new-missile-system-rewriting-skillshots). \n \n* Haven't seen the Q+E bounce back bug on this 5.11 patch so it could be gone, but who knows. Riot didn't announce anything but hey, bugs can easily fly back and annoy you.\n\n* Stutter step bug is just annoying.\n\n* Veigar one is new to me since I hardly play against a Veigar.\n\n\n Syndra is love, Syndra is life.

Woah, yeah I'm talking about Zed, Riven, Gragas, Rengar. Zed is probably the best one in all of them, still you can outplay it, not like Rengar who can delete you in 0.00001 second, not like Riven who can 1vs5 pentakill and escapes with full hp with her skilled, balanced shield.

It supplements normal dodging with a heal mechanic, so anything that does hit you, you can eventually shrug off. As Syndra gets more AP, she can heal up massive amounts really quick on minion waves/jungle camps. Her ultimate makes up for her single target healing, and can rip out 100-400~ HP on its own (depending on AP vs MRES).\n\nIt's best suited for ranged kite/control style playing, and for teams that will stay out in the field for longer than normal (constant objective rotation/pressure, etc).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-06-13T03:33:47.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can say I've experienced all of these bugs but the bounce bug.  That one's new to me and mystifies me as to how the hell it works.\n\nOn the flip side, there's one I've been wondering that wasn't included here: Syndra used to pretty reliably place down a sphere and immediately E it while it was forming, which would result in passing on the original dark sphere damage in addition to the E's stun damage.  While you can still pull this off, it's in an incredibly tight sweet spot to try and hit, which usually if you do it too early will result in the sphere not moving at all.  I didn't see this as one of the changes to her E in the initial collision nerf patch, but it is incredibly persistent and annoying to deal with - trying to rock the combo to get the maximum potential out of your champ while continually resulting in disappointment when the sphere doesn't move is absolutely upsetting.\n\nThere's also, if you have time, a bug that I noticed when you face LeBlanc with Syndra - in theory I was originally using Syndra early on as a counter to LeBlanc, as Scatter the Weak, correctly timed, should stop LeBlanc's dashes, effectively preventing damage.  While this should work flawlessly, there have been multiple times in which **LeBlanc has been pushed to the side during her dash rather than back and away**.  It leaves her in range to then continue her combo, and on top of that is such a jarring thing to happen because you never expect it - I've had it happen three times in a single game and each time I was still surprised because it's utterly inconsistent.  I'm not sure if this happens with all dashes, but if you'd like, it'd be another bug to check out to add to the report.  Hopefully enough bugs will force Riot to actually acknowledge how badly they've fucked up her E.","replies":[{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2015-06-13T04:12:32.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Syndra used to pretty reliably place down a sphere and immediately E it while it was forming, which would result in passing on the original dark sphere damage in addition to the E's stun damage. \n\nSo a moving Dark Sphere would inherit Q's damage (outside of its native blast zone),  stunning AND applying E's damage? If I understood that right, because that's a really weird inheritance mechanic that shouldn't work that way. \n\nOtherwise 'still forming' Dark Spheres can still be launched by Scatter the Weak, there's just a visual delay because the sphere hasn't 'appeared' yet, but it does exist as a hit box. Would that be right?\n\n\n>LeBlanc has been pushed to the side during her dash rather than back and away. \n\nYou're generally correct, Scatter will shove LeBlanc back, _but_ there are certain odd angles this isn't necessarily true. Depending on how an enemy champion runs into Scatter, they can sometimes be launched sideways, simply due to knockback direction. You notice this the most with using Scatter at the base of Syndra's model, where its hit box is the tiniest and can send objects in almost any direction. Now, if you're hitting LeBlanc dead center with Scatter and she's moving 90 degrees to the side, that's probably a bug. If she's being hit by the edges on the sides, bit of a different story.\n\nI've not run into any odd behavior with Scatter vs LeBlanc over all, but I haven't fought her this patch (surprisingly), so if it's new it might be related to her missile speed change. I'll probe around and look into it.","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-06-13T06:08:01.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice.  Thanks for responding.\n\nFor the sphere, it would be if it was in the process of forming and you flung with your E, if timed right this would cause the sphere to do the spawning explosion mid-flight, and if it is on top of an enemy during this time, it would deal damage normally.  This was before the E \"fix\", which now, for some reason, will not allow me to perform this trick anymore other than on rare, odd occasions when I seem to hit some sort of timing sweetspot.  Actually genuinely upsetting that I can't regularly do it anymore.\n\nFor the LeBlanc one, it's spotty.  Once it was dead center and on top of her going to the side, she wasn't stunned, so it's like the epitome of sadness right there. Maybe I used it while she was closer to me rather than near the edge, but either way, I'm not fond of the haywire-nature of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2015-06-13T16:16:17.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, I see. So a sphere would be spawned in mid flight and its blast zone would move with it. Yeah that cannot be intended behavior, but it's curious to note that it was possible. That would mean the actual explosion of Q was tied to the location of the spawned dark sphere, rather than just 'this zone has an explosion' from cursor clicking. Hmmm. That might have cross relevance in her W mechanics, I wonder.\n\nYeah, I can understand the LeBlanc frustration. I'd really have to see how she hit Scatter because the angle is very important ... but a dead on hit sending her 90 degrees to the right isn't correct, I think. I normally run into that when they're basically touching the base of Syndra's model, rather than in the middle or at the front of Scatter, though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stackless Python","date":"2015-06-12T21:56:36.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well written and documented, shame none of this will be fixed for years.
