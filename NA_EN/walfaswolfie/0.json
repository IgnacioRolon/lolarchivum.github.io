So let's move on to the other points.\n\n>Can you honestly say i deserve what i got for 1 game of slipping up and letting loose on a player who's sole purpose was to ruin the game for 4 players on his team...\n\nI can, yes. I understand frustration, and I understand anger. I even understand that people can lose control every now and then. Your chat log, however, is entirely full of insults, racism, and worse language. That's not a brief moment of control lost: that's a conscious decision to take your frustration out on another player (already inappropriate) in a racially-charged and completely offensive manner.\n\nIf his goal is to ruin your game, that's pretty awful, and you should definitely report him for it. But your actions did nothing but make the game even worse for the other players on your team: responding to toxicity with toxicity just creates MORE toxicity.\n\n>But this guy managed to press the right buttons to send me over the edge both through his behavior and his actions that i just couldn't bring myself to ignore this guy\n\nUnfortunately, that's not Riot's fault, and they don't owe you a do-over because you couldn't hold back.\n\n>but at LEAST let me know this Toxic yasuo player will / did Receive the same tier of punishment as me for his actions and attitude that game.\n\nRiot pretty much never gives players information about other player's accounts unless that player requests it. Chances are he may have been punished, although if he was simply idly farming and trash-talking with the sort of comment you posted it's unlikely he escalated to a 14-day ban unless he's been punished before: what you posted is definitely offensive, but it's not at the level of extended racism.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe big takeaway here is that Riot does NOT take the behaviors of other players into account, nor does it count \"I was really TRYING not to be toxic\" or \"I couldn't control myself\" as valid excuses. You are solely responsible for the content that you type into chat as it compares to community standards (not your previous behavior).\n\nFortunately for you, you avoided escalation to a permanent ban -- which is lucky, given that chat log. Just take this as a rather strict lesson on what is and isn't tolerated, and you'll be back to playing in two weeks. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-04-16T19:08:53.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate your sincerity.
