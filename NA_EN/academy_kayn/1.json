Read pretty much all of the comics and the books that held &#039;em, and there is a pretty good similarity between Zoe and Calvin. Both have their own agency, both hate school, both are wildly imaginative, and they take very little regard for other people in their grand scheme of things.\n\nMore importantly, a common thought being passed around people on the boards at the moment, is that they both share a lack of empathy towards other people, alongside the fact that neither seem to be able to see things from other people&#039;s perspective. The more popular post on the boards talks about just how unlikable Zoe is, that she&#039;s a sociopath. \n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/top25calvinandhobbesstrips/_/rsrc/1276117809363/home/ch890401.gif?noredirect\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/candh/images/9/9e/C%26H_Susie_Gets_Pummeled.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081126000434?noredirect\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A1s-04OAZCc/VR04fvdmzAI/AAAAAAAAAnA/4cRFfGyXjns/s1600/ch150402.gif\n\nhttp://garretthicks.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CH-100-Friends.gif?noredirect\n\nCalvin likes doing some pretty shitty things, especially to Susie ~~ah childhood love~~, and it&#039;s only really by his parents scolding or forcing, does he ever really feel any guilt about doing so. The only time he acts &quot;nice&quot; as well, are the times when his own sense of agency is fulfilled, like when Susie found hobbes when he was missing, but even then he yoinks all the cookies. Calvin doesn&#039;t have a huge ability to self reflect, and when he does, it&#039;s very rare. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DfTEBcI.png?noredirect\n\nLike the time when he locked his babysitter outside the house, and then gorges himself on oreos, until his parents come home and let&#039;s her back in. He doesn&#039;t feel guilty or bad about it, until he get&#039;s scolded by his parents, and forced to apologize. Yes, he&#039;s kinda a sociopath, but a lot of it is because he&#039;s young, and doesn&#039;t think much about consequences until they happen. \n\nhttp://3e.org/feeds/ch/89/ch891005.gif?noredirect\n\nZoe is largely, in my opinion, the same when it comes to this path of thought. A child who has only her own urgency at mind most of the time, whose allowed a huge leash on using her powers. There is no one to scold her, to reprimand her, to force her to feel guilty about things. Allow that type of behavior to go on for several thousands of years, and you have that mindset pretty locked in.  \n\nNow, the second trail of thought being lead around, is that what Calvin is doing is much more akin to being a Trickster, than what Zoe has done. For this, I&#039;d like to separate two trains of thought. \n\n1) Calvin is doing what he is able to do with his circumstance. He&#039;s just a kid, with a bunch of snow, doors, or water balloons at his disposal, versus adults, kids, and College students forced to take babysitting jobs. Zoe messing with A. Sol may seems like Torture to us, but on her power level, that&#039;s the kinda of stuff you&#039;d see as a trick. Getting tied up, and then petted by some small girl, embarrassing maybe, but torture? I don&#039;t see it. \n\n\n2) Zoe blowing up the Guard tower and/or guards, not the whole town as clarified in the &quot;I dont know why people hate Zoe&quot; thread, she does not have to be a trickster 100% of the time. She is also a Messenger, and her revealing the World Rune via her destruction of the tower, was just apart of the job that she seems to follow by instinct, or influence, from the Aspect. Calvin has his own agency, Zoe has less of her own, still abiding by some ancient responsibility. \n\n(There&#039;s also the bit about the Aspect being the Trickster one, and not Zoe, but enh)\n\nMy point being, is that a lot of the things that people are hating on Zoe for, are pretty intrinsic to being young and spirited. Being lazy, not wanting to study, not understanding empathy, they are child-like traits that have only been set in stone by being whisked away from Runeterra. She&#039;s remained untaught from the social norms that we were raised by, and likely never scolded by the Aspect within, who likes and enjoys those traits. \n\nDoes that make her unlikable? Maybe, but she&#039;s honestly just a kid whose never been taught any better. The only difference between her and Calvin is he at least has a higher authority to make him feel guilty about what he has done. Zoe doesnt, so I don&#039;t think that makes her a sociopath. It just makes her a child.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-11-23T01:59:18.796+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"I’m a huge Calvin and Hobbs fan!

Watterson wrote Calvin in a very believable way. Calvin uses his imagination to make the world around him more magical.  Calvin gets into harmless trouble like throwing water balloons or a snowball. Calvin is endearing because you see the softer side of him with Hobbes.  Calvin feels remorse when he sees the hurt he's caused.  He feels guilt and shame.\n\nZoe, by contrast, doesn't get into harmless fun.  She obliterates humans from the face of the earth in one badly written sentence. She has never played any trick on anyone as far as I've seen or read (despite constant claims she's a trickster?).  Zoe feels no remorse.  Rioters try to say Zoe gets along with Aurelion Sol?  How does that work?  He's ENSLAVED. A sapient being tied to the will of others and forced to see his life's work destroyed if he attempts to create, only to be used as a weapon. How can Aurelion Sol possibly like Zoe?  It makes no sense.\n\nZoe is nothing like Calvin.  She isn't mischievous, she's malicious. She isn't endearing, she's dangerous. If the color story had been better written I might be inclined to agree with all these random tidbits we've been fed on the board, but as it stands Zoe is terrible.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-11-23T08:49:09.391+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Calvin feels remorse\n\nLmao. He feels remorse only when his parents scold him or he gets caught. There is one time in near memory when he actually feels remorse about being mean to Susie by himself, and actually apologizes, but he after getting that apology, he runs off to do whatever he feels like doing. It was really more about ridding himself of guilt then it was to meaningfully say sorry.\n\n> Zoe feels no remorse\n\nSee back to Calvin, who only really feels remorse/guilt when he's in trouble. Zoe has no one to hold her accountable, she's been doing what she's been doing for thousands of years without reprimand. So, you have someone detached from reality for a millennial, who has been indulging her own fun, and has the power of teleportation, meteors, and time (with sight into past, future, and spirit world). \n\nAnd you're telling me, that she should feel remorse for the death of people who, to Aspects and Targonians, are fleeting life forms? People keep acting like she is *just* a child, but she isn't. She has the attitude of one, but she has the perspective of something much greater. What is your basis for the claim that she **needs** to feel remorse for people? \n\n> Sol's enslaved\n\nBut she's not torturing him. While it might be embarrassing to be tied up and petted ~~albeit my guilty pleasure~~, but how exactly could you hate someone who's just being a kid? You talk about her having no remorse, but do you really think that with A. Sol's gigantic ego, he would lower himself to killing a kid, who may not even know the fullness of what she's doing? \n\nIf you were enslaved, and broke free, would you really kill a kid who may not have an entire grasp of what's actually happening? \n\n~~besides what if he likes being petted....~~\n\n> Zoe is nothing like Calvin\n\nShe is exactly like Calvin, we just have more books, comics, and sources to judge Calvin off of then we do on Zoe. Malicious also means with purposeful intent to do harm. Do we really categorize her wanting to pet A. Sol as harm? Maybe you can say that about the Guards, but to what degree does she have control over that, when that was her Message to deliver in the first place? She didn't hurt them to hurt them, she hurt them because they were attacking her.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2017-11-23T19:14:19.803+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"There's plenty of strips by Watterson showing Calvin's fear and care for others.  He cares for the planet and is regretful people trash it so much.  He's beside himself when Hobbes goes missing.  He finds an injured raccoon and goes running for his mom so they can help it.  There's plenty of examples of Calvin _caring_ and being _sincere_.  It's these glimpses into his character that show us he's human.  That he's relatable and  that he's growing and learning.  Saying that we don't have enough of Zoe isn't good enough.  If all we have is her obliterating people from the face of the earth and then _giggling_ not moments after the fact you'll have to forgive me if I think she's horrible.\n\nIf I were Aurelion Sol and I wanted to travel the expanse of the universe, creating life and light and was _forced_ to stop, torn from my one love in existence to be reduced to a pet at the beck and call of a _monster_ in children's skin?  One that denies my sapience and free will and trivializing my existence to that of a dog? Yea. I'd annihilate my slaver given the chance and opportunity. \n\nIt's fine for Zoe to be horrible.

That isn't remorse, so you're kinda moving the bar, alongside the fact that those types of issues are on Calvin's level of power, things that actually effect him. \n\nThere are also several examples of Calvin being selfish and mean, but like said, we have way many more instances of him that show both sides of him. You're also, like said, looking at her from a mortal perspective. There are a few greek gods who care about humanity in lore, but a lot of them don't give a shit. Because that's what Zoe is, a God to most people on Runeterra. You're throwing a mortal perspective onto a god, and then judging her by human standards. \n\nIt concerns me how you'd murder a child who may not even know the fullness of the actual situation. You're telling me that Sol, 100%, would treat Zoe the same as he would Pantheon? I don't see it, and I think your depiction of A. Sol is much further off base of reality than it really is. \n\nShe is not a cutesy kid. She's a cutesy kid _Goddess_, with a much different perspective on Life in Runeterra than ours.

Why feel sad that something died, when you've seen everything die, realities crumble? Death becomes a natural part of a cycle, and when she's delivering messages, it becomes near akin to Destiny at that point. She has the agency of a kid, but the perspective of a God. \n\nAnd when you talk about concern, empathy, and remorse, who are you referencing? The ants known as humanity to most Targonians? Why should she feel anything for them? Explain to me why. Why?\n\nTaric has been an Aspect for meer minutes compared to Zoe. He was also an adult when he was made an aspect.

Think about it like this\n\n* Zoe is a messenger, but has no idea what the message she is meant to deliver. So she just teleports on impulse half the time, and follows her own sense of agency (the cute critter and approaching the kids playing Tag).\n\n* Yet by doing this, she somehow follows into the plan of the message she was meant to deliver. In her story, this was her destroying the guard tower and revealing the world rune. It's only after this, is she able to teleport again, and continue with her next message. \n\nSo, from what I read from this, is that her ability to teleport was being blocked by the higher ups (or her Aspect) until the message is delivered. Yet, she accomplished this entirely through her own indulgence, to want to play with the interesting boy? \n\nSo that's what intrigues me, her sense of agency leads to the message being delivered, which allows her to go on and deliver the next message. How is what she wants to do, linked so heavily with the message that need be delivered? \n\nIt'd be like if you wanted a pudding cup, but along the way to the store, you end up saving someone from being mugged. Your desire for pudding put you in the correct circumstance to save someone, and this doesn't seem to be anything new to Zoe. \n\nShe's literally a creature of Impulse somehow achieving goals unbeknownst to her until the final result. \n\nThe, much shorter, other thing that intrigues me, is just what on the world would happen if she threw a tantrum. Her ability to deliver messages seems entirely linked to her sense of agency, so what happens if she's just *steaming mad* or _absolutely depressed_. \n\nHow does her change in emotions affect her agency, which would affect her medium in which a message is delivered.","replies":[{"poster":"IDreamOfJhinie","date":"2017-11-23T23:10:19.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, yeah it's interesting when you put it like that.
