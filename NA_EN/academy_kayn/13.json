Since then they have quite a few sponsors, don't have to hand hold teams moneywise 100%, they have streaming deals just like players do, and the list goes on and on.\n\nThey are also owned by a VERY wealthy Chinese company called Tencent, who puts a lot of money into ESports in general.

Tbh, I wouldn't be surprised if Tencent, a Chinese corporation, directed Riot to ommit the Halloween event in favor of Worlds, as the holiday isn't very popular in the Far East and could theoretically affect the amount of people watching the finals.

Its a small arena, and probably doesnt cost too much to rent out (in comparison to a soccer arena in Berlin like the Olympiastadion, which seats 75,000). And remember - performers have used that Arena before too, and musicians like Rhianna or One Direction make money off those concerts. Riot didnt charge as much as musicians do - they charged about half as much - but they dont need to turn a profit from live sales. its very likely that Riot at least ran even on costs from the live tickets alone. \n\nNow, online viewership for 2014 worlds was 32 million. This year its probably higher. How much do you think Twitch, Youtube, and Azubu paid for that kind of viewership? In comparison, the NBA finals were viewed by 20 million, and made over $200 million in ads. And keep in mind that the NBA only takes 3 hours per day, while League takes closer to 5 or 6. \n\nThen comes the sponsors for each of the teams - look at each of the team jerseys and/or the brand names like SK Telecom. Do you really think the sponsors arent forced to give a little cut back to Riot? \n\nAnd if you still dont believe me on how profitable Esports is, read this article [http://fortune.com/2015/05/12/coke-esports-big-screen/](http://fortune.com/2015/05/12/coke-esports-big-screen/). Esports in general made about $200 million last year. This year its expected to be around $500 million. And remember - League takes over half of the Esports market. Its difficult to say how much of the total revenue Riot makes, but it isnt crazy to assume its about half. No, thats still not the majority of their business (Riot made close to $1 billion last year).
