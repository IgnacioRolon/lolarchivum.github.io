Stay in a fight. And paired with a Sona, whose only skillshot is her ult, both of them have unavoidable damage and Sona can help Vayne shrug off any damage with heals, well benfeiting her already power AA with Q.\n\nBuuutttt that's just my thoughts.\n\nTL;DR: I guess what I was trying to get at is that I'm not a fan of how much damage I can't avoid.  Sona's Q bolts are autotracking and Vayne's kit is built to get in those AA, so when your cc is down, its really easy for her to kite while behind ya.\n\n(BTW wanna thank people for not being toxic, but actually quite reasonable)","replies":[{"poster":"KidSpectre","date":"2015-03-06T00:28:30.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought Vayne was about weaving in and out of the fight to avoid damage while selectively choosing her targets, then cleaning up stragglers using her passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-03-06T00:56:55.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Right you are sir, but what I care to see is that all her damage is focused directly into AA.

It makes her unique. \n\nGraves has high AD burst in comparison to a lot of adc's, Caitlyn excels at harass with her crit passive and long range, Jinx is a hypercarry with an AS steroid and a passive that either gives her a free escape or lets her clean up after a teamfight, Ashe has an ultimate with teamfighting utility that could make a support cry, Kalista excels with a support and her rend can be more powerful than smite when it comes to objectives (don't even bring up her mobile passive), and so on and so on.\n\nYes, Vayne has a lot of damage with her AA, but that's what makes her unique. That is her identity. She is the aa reliant adc... which makes her especially weak to {{item:3075}} that nobody seems to buy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-06T00:40:28.650+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vayne has a crappy early game, tbh, if you know what you're doing.

Supps who can keep a person in the same place. \n\nWhen it came with Sona, it felt that nothing we were doing was having an effect. To a point that throwing out poke was as useless as throwing a rock in a pond. Sure they're is an effect but it's gonna settle out to as the same as before. She just complete shut us out by well, being a Sona?\n\nBut yeah, people use supports differently and using Sona to balance out Vayne's early game weakness was pretty smart, if they planned it that way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-03-06T01:55:28.684+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Light24o1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9QzjOpmL,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-03-06T00:54:15.726+0000)\n>\n> If you care to take a relook, a support like Sona, who does it all, can poke for her, heal any poke she takes, and buffs her Passive with her MS buff.
