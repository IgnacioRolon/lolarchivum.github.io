She has simple mechanics and an easy learning curve. Now by all means, I&#039;m as much of a fan of simple as the next guy, but why does someone who is as simple as Annie, get to wield around so much power?\r\n\r\nLook at the mechanically intense champs, like Azir, Ekko, or Gnar. They get to handle a lot more power, due to the fact that they have a higher skill floor, while getting to retain a high skill cap. People put hours learning these champs, to get a feel around these champs, to try to get their full potential.\r\n\r\nPeople can pick up Annie and do the same, with less time and thought. So my question to you, is Annie the definition of a burst mage to you? Do you believe that Annie&#039;s state of mostly uncounterable burst, is healthy for the game? And finally, do you believe that having that much damage, coupled with an AOE stun with Tibbers, makes up her identity of a champ?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-15T04:19:33.033+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> is Annie the definition of a burst mage to you?\n\nI do think I'd say she's a burst mage, yes.\n\n> Do you believe that Annie's state of mostly uncounterable burst, is healthy for the game?\n\nThe burst part, probably not. The reliability of her stun, however, is probably somewhat good for the game to keep mobility in check.\n\n> And finally, do you believe that having that much damage, coupled with an AOE stun with Tibbers, makes up her identity of a champ?\n\nAoE initiate/burst probably makes up her identity. It may shift slightly from initiate to counterengage when behind.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-08-15T04:32:46.870+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cw995EuN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-15T04:19:33.033+0000)\n\n> The burst part, probably not.

It absolutely makes no sense that Veigar's instant stun was removed from the game, while he keeps a one-click one-shot-kill spell, and proclaiming that instant burst is unhealthy. WTF.\n\nAnnie's instant stun only make no-mobility champions all that much weaker against her and in no way serves as a crutch to balance mobility within the confines of the game. If Annie was that essential to the meta she would literally be picked/banned 100% of the time. Tibbers requires a cast-travel time just like Corki's Q, which was also a skill that historically had an instant area of effect.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"toonpang","date":"2015-08-16T14:49:36.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if we just nerfed her 80% ratios to 70% or 75% across the board and left it at that?\n\nI reckon that would make her far \"healthier\" while retaining her simplicity and anti-mobility kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-08-15T04:27:05.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Annie were to keep her identity as a Burst/Engage-counter-engage nuke, what would you do to make her damage, less... unavoidable?

Other champs that have stuns are tied to their cooldowns and mana cost so they can't abuse the stun.\nAnnie's very identity is abusing the stun and delivering substantial damage. A champ who can stun with such reliability shouldn't be able to deliver such a high magnitude of damage with the same reliability. You guys have stated repeatedly that you didn't want to lock players into buying 1-2 items to effectively counter a champ (BV, QSS)\n\nYeah, she has low mobility but does multiple accurate high damage AOE stuns balance her?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WITH0UT A TRACE","date":"2015-08-15T03:19:15.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She has no escape.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-08-15T03:58:48.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plenty of other people don't have an escape either.
