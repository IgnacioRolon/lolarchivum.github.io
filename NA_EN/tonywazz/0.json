Which made games really painful with an ARAM team with 2 people vs 5. Or one ARAM was 2 vs 3 because of connection issues on both sides. Does leaver buster get adjusted for this?\r\n\r\nEven today, black screen at champ select. I don't know if I'm even in champ select after the screen change or if it's another LoL connection error. Does leaver buster know this? It's just a program, I know, but it is human controlled/coded/adjusted. How does this work and why are there so many issues lately? I've only been playing a few years, but it seems worse than ever, which is a bummer, its a fun game! Is there a Quality Control department or something (with a professional coder, not just some gamer dude that knows a lot about the game)?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-18T15:53:23.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen you're seeing is usually an issue with your network failing to download assets and transition from pvp.net and into champion select.  There were no server issues from what I could find, but this could happen if you and the other players are under the same network, area, or ISP.  My suggestion would be to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure everything with your network is in order and able to get through our services without issue.  \n\nLeaverbuster treats equally, regardless of why or how someone left the game because all leaves cause others a negative experience.  Your best bet is to resolve whatever is causing the issue and complete the required games.\n\nI hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"TonyWazz","date":"2017-03-19T00:42:05.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The connection issue I am referring to was even listed in the \"Exclamation Mark\" on the game panel last week that \"We are aware that people are having connection issues.....we are working to solve the issue...\" paraphrasing here. That seems to have been fixed. The black screen is something I got today, although I seen it about a year ago, too. I just did the repair install last week because I was reading the help menus and decided that a repair couldn't hurt. \n\nI think my point is that last week everyone was having issues. Did those issues stack up in leaver buster despite Riot's message that there are server wide connection issues for everyone?\n\nI agree that those connection issues had a negative effect on games. Those that could connect had reduced teams, those that couldn't connect couldn't even enjoy the game. So, again, my question is did those Riot side connection issues (please don't make me search and post the Riot post...) stack up in leaver buster. I'm not sure how leaver buster works, which is why I'm posting. In years of playing, I've only seen the timer twice. I think the first time was last year when my son was home from the Navy and we had several people on the home network trying to play. I think someone disconnected and for whatever reason we all got the boot. This was okay, we had a group of people to pass the 5 minutes with healthy conversation. Today is more of a \"Why am I penalized for a software issue that I didn't write?\" Which lead me to the question of how these things are tracked.","replies":[]}]}]}
