His parents owned a house outside of Bandle City where there was just about everything a young boy needed.  When he was young he possessed a knack for magic.  Then one day he left to explore Runeterra with his brother Soanis and learn what his books of study could not teach him.  They soon came to the Institute of War where he learned a much stronger magic.  He learned a magic that could remove completely the magic from any object.  When he came back home he boasted of his power by turning the village leaders pet golem into a pile of rocks.  The townspeople feared him so much that they decided to punish him.  So one night while he was asleep they lit his house in fire.  His magical abilities protected him but by the time he realized what had happened his whole family had been killed.  He then went on a rampage destroying anything in sight as he channeled all the magic he could project into a full on assault on the town which had done this to him.  It did not take long for this news to reach the council who immediately had him captured and completely confined.  After several weeks of sitting in his cell he devised a plan to escape.  Once he escaped he knew that he could not raise any more attention so he traveled to Noxus.  There he once again started to learn new and improved magic which would help him on his path for vengeance.  eventually his rage left him and he realized what he had done.  He immediately turned himself in to the council and begged to be added to the League of Legends so that he could cause no more harm to his fellow citizens.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nDamage - 42 ( +3 per level)\nHealth - 540 ( +80 per level)\nMana - 380 ( +63 per level)\nMovement Speed - 340\nArmor - 24 ( +4 per level)\nMagic Resist - 20 \nHealth Regen - 6.5 ( +0.7 per level)\nMana Regen - 6.5 ( +0.9 per level)\nAttack Speed - 0.6 ( +2 per level)\nAttack Range - 425\n\n**Roles**\n\nMage, Support, Can be built tanky, Can also be helpful for team fights\n\n**Abilities**\n\nPassive:  Saeon drains mana at a rate of 1 mana per second to all enemies within 400 units of him.\n\nQ: Cost 80/95/110/125/140\n  Saeon blasts a circle with a radius of 100 units of him draining health and mana and slowing all enemies in that area.\n\nW:  Cost 100/110/120/130/150\nSaeon gains and aura within 500 units of him that slows and drains all enemies of 10 mana and 10 health per second. \n\nE: Cost All Mana/All Mana/All Mana/All Mana/All Mana\nPassive: Saeon's basic attacks have 8% manasteal.  Manasteal drains a percentage of the targets mana equal to how much manasteal you have and how much damage the attack does.\nActive:  When Saeon's mana reaches full he may activate this to deplete his entire mana supplies and deal bonus true damage with his basic attacks for a short time.\n\nR: All of his mana\n  Saeon locks himself in place draining his own mana and converting all he drained from himself into true damage.  Has a range of 100 units\n\nSaeon is all about countering opponents and destroying them in a few charged up hits.  He's really good for team fights because of his area of effect attacks.  He should be built with speed so that he can get in for team fights, ganks, and counters almost everytime.","replies":[{"poster":"CritterZoid","date":"2015-01-01T20:45:46.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the champion concept! Yet, I feel as if his Q and W are more like Karthus's abilities. I'd also recommend (even though your champion drains mana, although it is very low per level) putting the E ability with an actual cost rather then all mana, the R ability should be the one that costs all of his mana since it make sense. Overall I think that champion with his mana costs need to be thought out a bit more especially with his Q and W abilities, because they sound much like Karthus's abilities. Everything else (aside from his normal mana [especially if he is a AP mid laner] I'd say put it down to 250) is okay. \n\nHis Q and W are also way to high in terms of mana cost. Shorten them down to at least a rounded number (like 10 or 20 mana per level, as it scales better and doesn't like kill half your mana reserves instantly). I'd also hate to say this, but he sounds like (with the last paragraph) that he has no counters. Which every champion needs. His E needs to be thought out a little bit more though. Like I get what you are going for, but it wouldn't work well at all. He also seems to have no 'get away' moves to help him get out of a bad situation. \n\nI think you should change his E to be a 'get away' move (say if he was in a 1v3 and he couldn't get out, if his E was a move to say like make him go to the nearest thing [like a mana fountain for example] within a 200 unit radius of him it would work). His passive, is a bit iffy. It could uses a rework, honestly you could make it a double passive like Azir's passive. Like you can keep the mana drain on targets within 400 units of him, but a 1 mana drain? It's way to small since his abilities cost so much mana. You'd have to bump it up to like 5 to 10 mana for a good decent drain in order for his Q to work.\n\nThe idea I had for his passive was that he could create a 'fountain' of mana [within half of his AA range] that drains enemy champions mana within a 200 unit radius. Of course if you bump the drain for him up to 10 mana it would drain half of his normal mana drain, per minute (so it wont be OP). Now what I was thinking is that if he is within range of a mana fountain his E could turn him into pure mana and teleport him there refilling his mana with whatever it drained. Although the fountains can also be destroyed, but the mana will remain (much like the souls thresh collects, and after a short time it will go to him. If he dies the fountain will instantly be destroyed [once again so it is not OP] and the mana will vanish).\n\nAlso one last thing the fact that he has two slows especially his W is a big no since if he keeps it on (assuming it has no cool down which you also need to add, even if it is a toggle ability, it needs a cool down) he can just stay on his opponents back and spam his abilities. You do not need a slow on his W or his Q, now if it were on his R it would make sense since his R seems to be an AOE ability (which you'd only need one of, unless it was a global ultimate then that is different). \n\n**TL;DR:** needs counters, mana costs on Q,W, and his E need to be changed dramatically. His passive can be kept but the mana drain needs to be upped. His E ability needs to be changed to a move to make him 'get away' from risky situations. Remove the slows make his R the only slow it's easier. Also one more thing I forgot to add, the name needs to be changed it sounds to much like Sion when pronounced.\n\nOnce again a good idea, but it does need a lot of work, I can help if need be, since I making a champion (or two) myself, and I would be glad to help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"conchay3","date":"2014-12-30T21:17:14.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ult isn't too well thought over i can guess from how dangerous it is without guaranteeing a kill. I would say dont distribute evenly and less hp being taken away. Also this champ is all about draining stuff from other people and this champions e doesnt fit in at all.
