The following step by step process for how to design a champion was originally posted  by RiotAmes\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that numbers change a lot over the course of designing a champion, so save them for when you've solved your other design concerns. My usual approach to champion creation is:\r\n\r\n1) Come up with a core thematic.\r\n2) Develop a character(not champion) around that thematic.\r\n3) Analyze whether that character makes sense in the world of League of Legends.\r\n4) Determine what role in the game the character best fits. If there is no fit, re-analyze the character.\r\n5) Search for or create art that creates a compelling visual for my character. Often, this entails multiple, different pieces of art that explain my idea.\r\n5) Begin to flesh out the character as a champion.\r\n6) Explore the new champion's Lore. Where is he/she from? Why do they want to join the league?\r\n7) Analyze the results of 6. Are those compelling reasons? Would the League accept such a champion?\r\n8) Begin to flesh out a kit. No numbers at this phase.\r\n9) Try to do a mental play through of a game utilizing that kit. How does the champion lane or jungle? What do they contribute to team fights? Are they fun to play as? Play against? Mirror lane?\r\n10) If the 'game' goes well, potentially attach some numbers to it to better explain how I expect the champion to perform. If it goes poorly, return to 8.\r\n11) Shop the idea around to some friends or coworkers and get their feedback. Incorporate it where needed.\r\n12) Polish, polish, polish.\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is create a discussion, describe everything about your champion in that and put a link to that discussion in the comments below.\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy!","replies":[{"poster":"Dylanor","date":"2015-03-19T01:46:05.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a cool champion idea by kostama.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/kostama","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dylanor","date":"2014-12-29T17:30:11.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a champion that I thought was a really neat idea and I would love it if you could tell me how to improve him.\n\nPresenting,  Saeon the Reaper of Magic\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/sWBXXNWr-saeon-the-reaper-of-magic","replies":[]},{"poster":"Invite him","date":"2014-12-29T15:48:57.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall a nice one, to point out for real, its helpful of some of us, all though ive made a lot of CC around, i dont get much attention, but i think that if people do more CC, everyone will get enough views, so its a good post, upvoted from me ;)","replies":[]}]}
