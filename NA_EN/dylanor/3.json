I have been playing for quite a while now and would be very able to play ranked and succeed at it.  Sadly LoL does not allow you to do that until summoner level 30.  And here I quote the LoL Wiki\r\n\r\nAssuming an average XP gain to be about 110 XP per game, one can reach summoner level 30 within 365 normal games.\r\n\r\nSo as you can see it takes approximately 1 year of playing a game every day to reach level 30.  Now that may not seem very long but for someone who actually does more in their life than sit at their computer all day long.   There is also the fact that people who smurf(or have had their accounts banned) can&#039;t play ranked on those accounts either. \r\n     So I conclude, Riot please lower the summoner level requirement to something more reasonable than playing for nearly 275 hours,  or at least explain why you have it set at that.\r\n\r\n{{summoner:4}} Thanks and please comment if you want to say something about this.{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Miku Lv99","date":"2015-04-16T01:23:40.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bad idea.  No one wants people that have literally 0 runes in ranked.  That's probably how many they'd have considering they'd still have to own 16 champions and not yet be level 30, so they probably spent all their IP on champions.  Not to mention they'd probably play bad, too, so their teams would be at a big disadvantage until they got all the way down to the MMR they should be playing it.\n\nAlso it doesn't take nearly 365 hours to get to level 30.  365 games maybe, but that's probably only like 25 minutes per game or something like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2015-04-15T21:41:15.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hit 30 a month or 2  back, and am still not doing ranked, because i know i suck. I'm glad that it takes that long, because most new 30's or near-30's that i meet just haven't mastered the basics that they need to be competent in ranked. \n\nSeparately, I am 100% sure that i have played less than 365 hours. Far less. no idea if your numbers are off on the xp gained, or whats needed to level, but I don't play a lot due to school, and i hit 30 decently quickly. \n\nAlso, play the games -_- you have to have full rune pages to do well in ranked, and those are effing expensive.
