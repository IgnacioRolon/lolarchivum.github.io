However, my shards appear to be broken. Is there a problem with the loot system right now? Because when I click on my shards, nothing happens. Right click, left click, doesn't matter. I don't even get the menu that gives me options (disenchant, activate rental, unlock, etc.).\n\nIs this a temporary issue? A bug? Or did I miss my chance? Has loot been locked in preparation for preseason? If anyone from Riot can tell me what's happening, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nEdit: Nevermind. It seems to be working like it should now. No idea why it wasn't working earlier.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T21:39:47.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible your loot menu just went a little wonky after a game or something. It happens sometimes if the loot portion sort of loses it's connection with the server. Usually, it's just a minor problem that will fix itself after a relog or simply switching to and from the loot screen.","replies":[{"poster":"BubblyRainbows","date":"2017-11-05T22:15:52.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for getting back to me. I still don't know what the issue was, but it worked itself out somehow. When I logged back in it was fine again.","replies":[]}]}]}
