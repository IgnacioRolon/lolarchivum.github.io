This is purely hypothetical because I eventually (many months from now) will need to know...\r\n\r\nLet's say I have three champion shards in hextech crafting, but I own all the champs already. When a new champion comes out, how long would I have to wait before I could trade those three shards in for a guaranteed unlock of the newly-released champion? Could I do it the very minute the new champion is released? Would I have to wait six hours? A day? Three days? I'm working very hard to unlock all the champions, and eventually I'm hoping to reach the point where I could do this. So I'd really like to know the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-21T21:27:02.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'd say wait about a day.  New releases may not update right away from hextech crafting.  This is also mentioned in our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide), so definitely hang on a bit before making your move.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"BubblyRainbows","date":"2017-07-22T10:57:10.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks. As I said, it will still be a while before I have all the champs, so this was really just for future reference, but I wanted to be sure. It would be unfortunate to trade in three champ shards and get nothing for them.\n\nIs that what would happen? If you already have all the champions, you would trade in three shards and get nothing? Or would it not even let you trade them?","replies":[]}]}]}
