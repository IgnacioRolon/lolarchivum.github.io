But yesterday he had to unfortuantely leave a game which gave him a ban, but for some reason he only had to wait 5 minutes. He has been in a 20 minute ban before so im really confused, is this supposed to happen?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-28T21:45:55.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understood correctly, it sounds like your friend only had a 5 min LPQ this time instead of the 20 min LPQ they had in the past? If you go long enough without any type of punishment, those timers might shorten to lessen the burden.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-28T10:25:28.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A ban lasts longer than 5 minutes, and is completely different from a leave buster. If you get repeatedly punished, your punishment will be increasingly greater, but if you have been good for a long time and then get punished, it likely won't be as severe. Of course this varies based on the offense being punished for. A leave buster is more like an extended queue time as punishment, not considered a ban.","replies":[]}]}
