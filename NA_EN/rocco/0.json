All day my ping is fine and at a static 40-43 which I've grown accustomed to.  BUT, any time past 7 PM my ping goes bonkers and to 400 at least. I don't know why this is since I can still play CS:GO and Terraria just fine without any problems at all. I'm assuming something happens to the servers at 7 PM EST. If this is not a server problem and this is some weird problem I have with my connection please tell me. This has been going on for months now it's not only today it's just that now's the only time I've felt the need to report it as it's causing me to play horribly and my teammates to flame me. Also, during some random games my ping will go from the 40-43 that it was at all game to 200 or 300 for a good minute or two then drop back down. This second issue happens at any given time in any given date and only happens once every few dozen games. Regardless, any help would be greatly appreciates \r\n\r\n -   Truly yours, Some silver scrub","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-12T16:05:07.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When latency (ping) increases after a specific time, it's usually due to an ISP changing the way they route traffic to a server in order to mitigate network congestion.
