I Have had a friend gift me a skin and then it has been removed from my account after about a month and a half, 9 months ago. I would appreciate it if I could get my skin back that you have removed from my account, sorry for the in convince of this ticket and have a wonderful night Riot Games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ActuallyArrow","date":"2015-03-27T20:40:30.888+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They would be happy to assist you if you submitted a ticket calmly explaining the situation.\nOr they are working on it, and you will get it back eventually anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2015-03-27T23:46:00.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I had the same thing happen to me. A friend of mine's account had been in refer-a-friend fraud, but he also had paid legitimate money to get skins for himself and I. Like, I SAW him in person, at his house, pay with his card and get skins with it while we were hanging out. And then Rito took not only the stuff he'd gotten with the fraudulent RP, but the stuff he'd bought as well.\n\nMeh, it's been a while though, and I've since moved on. Still sucked when it happened though. :(","replies":[]}]}
