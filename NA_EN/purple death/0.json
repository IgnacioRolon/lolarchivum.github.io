Here me out. Every single game I get people doing the wierdest shit with biuld like getting a tear on the jungler or something else strange. I also take a look at my teammates match history 70% of them are low silver or mid silver  and have gold MMR. Wierd right? I see their history and they have most of them 40% winrate. I know some may be regular players but HOLY either lots of players are boosted or are smurfs or they just got really lucky getting to gold MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-10-31T01:08:31.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, people just have bad games.
