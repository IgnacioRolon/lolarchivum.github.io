Why does there seem to be such an influx of toxic behavior with little to no recourse? \r\n\r\nLet us take a look at the system as it is. Someone is &quot;toxic&quot;, they get reported, they enter the tribunal, and then a decision is made by the player base. Right now we only have the end score and a full chat log. In some cases this is enough to make a judgement. But in a lot of cases, feeding, throwing, and in general making another players experience less than expected is not possible to see. This is a major problem. \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends has moved from an indy company with a large player base the one of the most played, and dare I say largest online competitive base. We can&#039;t continue on the way things are. The tribunal itself has done a fantastic job clearing out a lot of the chat based hate and leaving/disconnection reports. But what it has failed to do is consistently keep the rift an enjoyable place to be. \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is a game where you rely on every member of your team to work together to achieve the same goal. If one person disrupts this synergistic necessity it won&#039;t only cost a game but in most cases the enjoyment to play the game. \r\n\r\nIf we take a look at the ranked environment it&#039;s even worse. Most people don&#039;t go into champion select with a positive approach most of the time. As players we are at the constant fear of trolls, disconnects, feeders and afk&#039;s, on top of the pressure of playing a ranked game in hopes to win and raise yourself in the ranked community. \r\n\r\nWe shouldn&#039;t have that fear. We should be able to go into a queue, ranked or not, and be confident that we will have a good time. We should be rewarded for our hard work, our effort to win the game and above all else being respectful summoners. \r\n\r\nAs it stands now, there&#039;s not much loss to a normal game. When you get into ranked however, the balance is disrupted. Rather than being encouraged to play our best as a team, it&#039;s more often than not incentivised to play a carry role otherwise you risk losing a game. This is both a fault of the system and as well as the community.\r\n\r\nLets take a look at most of the common issues ranked games tend to have. If you&#039;re are within your level of play, you will gain and lose a steady amount of points. \r\n\r\nIf you play a really good game, you&#039;re not rewarded, whereas if you play a bad game, you&#039;re not penalized more either. \r\n\r\nIf you play poorly, but your team helps you into winning the game, you are rewarded the exact same as everyone else, even though you were an anchor. Whereas if you play excellently, but you have someone on the team weighing you down and you lose, you are penalized the exact same as everyone else. \r\n\r\nThis is not a good system. One players anchor or one players forklift shouldn&#039;t determine YOUR outcome. You should be held accountable based on your actions, positive or negative to the team. I&#039;m not saying you shouldn&#039;t lose points for a game, but you shouldn&#039;t lose points due to someone not connecting and being forced to surrender at 20. As well as you shouldn&#039;t be rewarded for winning a game while dragging your team down, purposely or not. \r\n\r\nThis is a serious issue as we are consistently met with players either too ahead or behind a current rank, people disconnecting, people not connecting at all, people feeding, throwing and the list goes on. \r\n\r\nAn idea that works well with the champion mastery system is checking individual play at the end of the game to determine point gain and loss, and as well as IP gained. If you get a S+ and win a game, you should be rewarded for that. If you get an F (Or whatever the lowest rank possible is) and still win the game, you shouldn&#039;t be rewarded as much as the other player who put more effort into getting a better score. This is the same when losing, only the S+ player shouldn&#039;t lose as much as the F player.\r\n\r\nNot only will this give incentive to improving play but it can insure people reach their respective rank faster, while not falling below their respective rank too quickly due to toxic behaviour. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to add incentive towards initiating a report, which then gets seen as appropriate by the tribunal. Too many times have I seen toxic behaviour and after game, people don&#039;t even bother to report the player and queue up right away. This will help stop those players from sliding between the system and continuing to ruin everyone else&#039;s experience. \r\n\r\nThis is just my two cents on the league community as well and the system in place to stop toxic behaviour. I honestly do believe we should be rewarded more than we currently are for being respectful players. The honor system doesn&#039;t count. I haven&#039;t seen anyone with icons consistently since the realease of it. We also need a better system in place to make sure toxic players improve their behavior, or at least a system that doesn&#039;t put good players at a disadvantage because of toxic play.","replies":[{"poster":"X Anivia X","date":"2015-10-06T13:30:49.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but rewarding people who get better grades = more \"kill steals\" = more \"reasons to be toxic\" = more salty toxic people.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoopy","date":"2015-10-06T13:32:11.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case a look into damage done to champions as opposed to actual kills would work far better.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-10-06T14:14:46.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has to me a mix, otherwise those AoE Mages always come out on top, regardless of if any kills or objectives come from their poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoopy","date":"2015-10-06T14:49:16.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that they are applying pressure is part of the concept.

Would you think it was because I was playing bad or was it because 2-3 people on our team didn't have a good game and as a result I got caught in the crossfires during team fights?

It was my fault the game went downhill therefore I should be shown I need to up my game next time. In a situation like that most people would either start warding or start roaming, depending on the camp style. Failing to do so would result in someone \"snowballing\" on me, which is a poor choice.

Just because you show up doesn't mean you helped. You NEED all 5 members of your team to win the game. There are rare cases where you don't, but that's another story. \n\n> This already happens.\n> \n\nIn what way does this already happen? It's very far from being where it needs to be. It's not done on indivifual levels, it's done on game win rate. Someone given a platinum account needs to keep losing and falling in the ranks until they reach where they should be, rather than the system looking at their score and consistently lowering their rank based on that rather than just the loss.\n\n> Don't play too many games every night.
