Okay, so a troll pick, whatever I guess. Just farm hard and win right? Well, that is until she sits on me and helps with my leash only for me to realize she brought {{summoner:11}} . She proceeds to {{summoner:11}} my first camp, taking the level 2, and refuses to detach all the while smiting the most valuable camps whenever the spell is up (probably took summoner spell cdr runes just to dig in even more). Now I am being held hostage all game with literally no way to stop this griefing cat from being attached to me or taking my camps. I was starved of CS and levels all game and was even almost reported by my bot lane after afking long enough for the Yuumi to get off me.\r\n\r\nI really hate that there is no apparent way to stop this form of aggressive hard grief. The worst part about it is that their KDA looks perfectly normal afterward. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how either players (or the balance team) can avoid this?\r\n\r\nThe only solutions I was able to come up with were to have an option to either kick {{champion:350}} off of you (or never allow her on in the first place) and or to not let her take {{summoner:11}}  or any of its respective items.","replies":[{"poster":"2gudaiya","date":"2020-02-28T18:05:20.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's just a player doing what a degenerate player does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalexUwU","date":"2020-02-28T17:32:18.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a player issue...

It is VERY unlikely that they get a team of 4 people who all have it out for them and won't let them attach.  Im kinda thinking about this like {{champion:429}}  Ult.  It can be used to troll and grief but has a cooldown. And again I run into the issue of being able to just be on another part of the map than her. You cant do that with the Yuumi whos attached to you till you die while she cant even be tartgeted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BloodStormxx","date":"2020-02-28T19:21:03.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paroe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Gpx5w6EU,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2020-02-28T17:49:37.661+0000)\n>\n> Yes it does.

Using certain champion mechanics that were used as a detriment to the team. \n\nI dont have much to say to your second point. \n\nNot \"every champion\" can do this. In fact, no other champion can make themselves untargetable for an indefinite amount of time, while concurrently being attached to your every move no matter how much faster you are than them or what routes you take. The closest example that I can think of would be Kayn, but there are many differences. 1.Its his ult that doesn't unlock till lv 6 (not spammable) 2. He cants use it on teammates. 3. He cant use abilites (or summoners?) while untargetable. 4. His untrargetable period has a definite leingth before it can be used again (still not on teammates) \n\nI never said Yuumi was a terrible champion. I would have dodged as soon as I saw one on my team if that were the case. I never thought about them being a smurf originally. I **_am_** talking about trolls being bad and toxic for the game. But if you do get one usually you have ways to solo play back into the game. I couldn't really do that because of the mechanics of Yuumi specifically. \n\nAgain, I will say I don't think the champion is bad, I think that Yuumi needs to have some attention on how players can abuse her to troll without making their post-game show it.  When you see am 0/3/25 Yuumi lose you think ok, they did really good, high KP but had a bad game. In reality she stole levels and gold from me and there was no way I could be anywhere without her on top of me. \n\nTo conclude, I suggested 2 ways this variation of trolling with Yuumi can be avoided. \n1. Not let her take smite as she will never be a viable jungler (or solo laner for that matter) \n2. Allow players to reject Yuumi's attachment or boot her off of them with some sort of cooldown on reattachment. \n\n\nMe saying remove the champ from the game was full tilt.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MikeJ122O","date":"2020-02-28T15:31:36.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should probably use an app to lookup stats for you about your teammates so you know when to dodge.
