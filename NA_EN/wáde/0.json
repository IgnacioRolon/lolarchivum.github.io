I am from New Brunswick, Canada and have had a decently steady 39 Ping ever since the server moved to Chicago. As of the last few weeks I noticed that I am now hovering around 55 ping. Now, I'm not whining over it saying that it's unplayable, I am just curious if anyone else has noticed/experienced the same thing as me, and maybe some fix is available for it? Also, I have Bell Aliant/FibreOp, if that helps for who are wondering. It could be a me thing, could be for people that have FibreOp, I don't know.\r\n\r\n~Cheers","replies":[{"poster":"LaZboy Marksman","date":"2016-02-17T07:40:37.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a ping of 42 since the change of servers but as of recently I've steadily noticed the ping climb. I'm now consistently 58-60 on the ping where as before it was lower. A jump of nearly 20ms without any reasonable explanation is kind of scary to be honest. Either Bell has started to do a different hop to Riot's servers or Riot changed something recently. \n\nI'm in Nova Scotia, on Bell FibreOp as well. 200mb down/75mb up.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-03-13T17:52:46.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It gets worse the further you are. I'm from the caribbean and after the eastern move of the server i got between 70-80 ping. It climbed to 100, 110, 130-140. It seems to be a problem with how FibreOp networks are routed as they take A LOT of unnecessary roundabout routes. However the thing is this only happens with League. I play a few other online games and my ping for those lie between 60-85 ping, nothing else seems to be affected so harshly by the FibreOp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wáde","date":"2016-02-17T14:02:44.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange.
