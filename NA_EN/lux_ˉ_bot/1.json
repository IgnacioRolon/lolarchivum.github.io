Since the loot system was undergoing maintenance, I hopped into a quick game. My game ended and the loot system was no longer under maintenance, however, my capsule wasn't there. I tried logging in again to see if it would refresh, but it still isn't there. Has anyone else experienced issues with the hextech loot system while it was under maintenance? Perhaps a chest not awarded or not receiving a mastery token after a match?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T00:47:41.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that's definitely odd. Typically you won't see any kind of notification when the hextech system is down, so this is a pretty interesting situation. There's a pretty decent chance that this could have been a delayed message, since I noticed you had already gotten one capsule about a week or so ago. It doesn't look like the system had attempted to give you a capsule today, so this was most likely some type of visual error.","replies":[{"poster":"Lux ˉ Bot","date":"2017-08-22T02:21:10.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks for letting me know!","replies":[]}]}]}
