{"poster":"DangoDoof","date":"2017-05-31T20:06:08.295+0000","title":"Unable to connect to the login queue.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been wrestling with this error for several days now, and I've seen only [one other thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/qapnu1wV-unable-to-connect-to-login-queue-since-windows-updated) that is talking about this... When I start up the League client, everything is normal, but when I enter my credentials, it gives me the error \"Unable to connect to the login queue.\" It offers to check server status and then gives a page for viewing possible solutions. I've tried them all and the server is fine, but I can't log in. I've downloaded the hextech repair tool and ran all of its functions, to no avail. I've reinstalled League twice, to no avail. I've even checked other pages like the [general connection errors one](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for solutions, but nothing works. If it clues anyone into the source of the issue, after every  attempt to log in after the first, it shows a loading circle and the word \"Authenticating.\" Each time, however, it stays up for a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nI would've submitted a support ticket a while ago, but the website for some reason is keeping me from signing into the support section, I can sign in here and post, but I can't submit a ticket over there. It tries to sign me in, but then gives a \"signing out\" message before saying it encountered an error and leaves me to surf the forums for similar problems, finding the earlier linked thread where [robochomp](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/robochomp), also from NA, seems to be experiencing the same problem.\r\n\r\n*I would also like to point out that my brother Flexchagalaga experiences the same error message on the first sign in attempt, but then it bypasses it and enters the game normally on the second or third attempts.*\r\n\r\nIt's technically redundant to post this, considering there's already a thread (maybe more) on this and I've already commented on the one I know of, but I feel the other one(s) has been drowned among all the other posts by now... Please fix this soon, I'd like to continue playing League because I find it a lot of fun, but I can't enjoy your game when I can't log in.\r\n\r\nThanks to anyone who can offer assistance!","replies":[{"poster":"Dedasasin","date":"2017-06-01T21:10:59.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue for me.
