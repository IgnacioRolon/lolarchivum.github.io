Before it was a firwall error but now for some reason ques are not popping for me. Whenever i que with friends i can hear the que pop through them, yet for me it doesnt. So i tried hitting the end que button and it brings up the accept/decline options. When i click accept, i join the lobby for the other people in the game but i immediately dc, yet i never get into the pick/ban stage. When i hit decline my client gets stuck and i need to relogg. This has only started since this patch. If a rioter or someone could help me with this that would be great. Ive tried repairing my client, and the problem is persisting. this only seams to happen in blind but its infuriating. ive gotten some time restrictions to joining ques and its really dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T00:13:07.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you are in queue and accept, your network is trying to transition you over into the same room with everyone.
