The shield value is also silly because the average champion at 20 minutes is around lvl 10-13, not lvl 18. A Yasuo in a 20 minute game would have the vast majority of his shields at below 200, let alone an average of 275 like you claim.

Irelia clearly has a huge edge even if the shield is used to its full potential which is rarely is. Yasuo's shield is meant to give him windows of power and weakness in lane which, given his extremely high level of agency around minions, is to the benefit of his opponent, not him.

Still, I think Riot is misguided in trying to make Yasuo an anti-AP champ. I assume these changes are aimed at weakening his early game while making his trades against AD champs worst. The problem is he is already super good against mages. I hope whenever his kit is reworked if you end up going through with that, that you will take into account that a big reason for banning Yasuo is how frustrating it is to play against him in lane (especially as ranged champions that can't outrage or out-sustain him), not necessarily his overall win rate, as that balances out late game","replies":[{"poster":"Solemdeath","date":"2017-08-12T05:02:50.692+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeadUnborn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MKb9ElYY,comment-id=00060003,timestamp=2017-08-12T01:54:37.391+0000)\n>\n> The problem is he is already super good against mages.\n\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:84}}<(Not a mage, but still destroys Yasuo) {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:13}} <(arguable)   {{champion:112}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:101}} \n^ All of these are AP champions that counter Yasuo in one way or another\n\n\nYasuo is very niche,  he may be super good against some AP champions like {{champion:136}}, but against an experienced {{champion:69}}{{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:10}} , he will get steamrolled in laning phase. \n\n{{champion:69}} can Q, then E 3 times to get him to half health, then do the exact same thing again to either burn his flash or get first blood at level 2, and unless Yasuo upgrades W at level 2 (which almost nobody does), there is nothing he can do to avoid this unless he manages to dodge the Q\n\n{{champion:127}} can press R, while the enemy JG gets a free kill\n\n{{champion:90}} can press R, while the enemy JG gets a free kill\n\n{{champion:10}}'s auto attacks can't be blocked by Yasuo's windwall, so he will either be denied cs or repeatedly getting bullied out of lane due to poke.
