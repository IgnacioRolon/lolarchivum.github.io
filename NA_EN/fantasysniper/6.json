This same tactic may be effective against Demacians for the same reasons. It does, however, ruin your future crop of soldiers and cause massive logistical problems over the long term. Whatever 'devious' commander elected for it here was going more for moral shock value than anything strategic probably. Zed's observations affirm this just as much.\n\nVersions of this tactic, both with literal children and otherwise, is prevalent in our own history. Cats were wielded against the Egyptians, who wouldn't fight on the chance they'd hurt something so very sacred. The brutality of war quickly mandated they change their views on that matter, though.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-07-03T20:35:23.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also note that Noxus is a huge place.

That being said, you take an entire _nation_, and you'll probably not be worse off for using a small platoon of children for shock tactics.\n\nBut then, there's the second part; difficulty in training. This, I have to half-agree, half-disagree - I used to train youths in taekwando, and we ran a \"termite\" class of kids younger than 12, I think it was. Whatever the case, there are two things to be said about training children in combat;\n\n1. They are indeed malleable and most effective training sticks with them.\n2. They are also young and training them effectively requires dedication and patience.\n\nTraining children in martial arts for self-defence is a long-term thing, and while it's not _difficult_, I wouldn't say it's entirely _easy_ or _reliably quick_. Use of untrained child soldiers is likely for quick, effective shock tactics to screw with Ionians more than it is an actual military strategy - refer to Solideus' point in his comment string.\n\nBut, going back to the example of cats - how is it a poor example? It's people using a type of tactic involving preying on someone else's apprehension to attack something to keep them off-guard.\n\nFor Ionians, it's children, because they're considerably innocent.\nFor Egyptians, its cats, because they're sacred creatures.\n\nThey're similar tactics, so how is the one a bad example? (and you can't say that it's because they're easily reproducible or difficult to train - the former is a poor comparison to children, and the latter is debatable.)","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2017-07-04T15:36:34.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cats can reach sexual maturity within a year, and they have around 3 to 5 kittens per litter.
