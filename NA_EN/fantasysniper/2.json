We should know this by now. If you want proof just check out the rise and fall of fotm and meta champs, and how quick they can get spammed after pros use them or that how fast they can tank their play rate because of a nerf, or something.\n\n\"Fun\" argument only holds so much weight. We know what kind of animals gamers are, please don't kid yourself.\n\nHence, a bigger factor in question is less to do about the arbitrary \"fun\", but the pragmatic effectiveness (as well as say, players agency in a sense that how much \"control\" them have in any given situation).\n\nAnd it kinda shows a problem, just like how Lee was NOT in the Devourer meta but was still equally competitive nevertheless anyway, Lee is not in the Knight's Vow meta but is still equally competitive regardless. Now consider unlike Dota's balance, here in League you just either swim or sink with the rise and fall of meta shifts (Riot's balance philosophy would require another thread). So it really proves that his kit is just fundamentally broken that can not be not useful no matter the meta currently running rampant. And it shows Lee's a big trouble, as it has been proved and said for eons.\n\n\"Staple\" or not, Lee really needs to get some revision and rework done about him. Big or small, doesn't matter. Something. Because his kit's problem lies in the core design hence it can only be fixed by touching his core design one way or the other.","replies":[{"poster":"FoamingStuff","date":"2017-09-06T14:29:05.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"so what do you suggest, if you believe his kit is broken because \"he works\" in meta's that allegedly don't support him\n\nYour argument is flawed because you assume that a champion's viability, or OPness, is defined by its place within a perceived meta. This is simply not true, particularly not with metas that aren't  \"do or die\", much what the cinderhulmeta is. He's a completely fine pick, just as many other allegedly non meta champions are fine picks.\n\nI know and understand better than you think about fun vs fotm and player loyalty. In generic terms, this applies, sure. However there are some cases where fun actually really beats out fotm. Lee is not a \"favourite of some\", the way old poppy was, that had some small fanbase that would play her no matter how much she sucked, how much she did not fit any meta. He carries a really big gathering behind him because the champion, much like yasuo, and someone mentioned lucian, feels really GOOD to play. He's unique, his kit is unique, the skill requirement to play him to a certain level unique and honestly very satisfactory. Not playing Lee myself, even I can understand this. There's only very few of such champs, and with those, no matter how much you nerf them, they'll always be played. It's pretty hard with these champions to gauge power relative to how much they're played. \n\nSaying he's \"broken\" just cause he's being played in alleged out-of -meta scenarios is too easy. Particularly because, EVEN if it was a do or die meta, you're looking at a playerbase with vastly different skill levels. I can only assume that by most played jungler, we're looking at generic player base samples, not just the actual players with a clue.\n\nReworking him, like there are plans for yasuo, is really rough. Where you can look at several parts of yasuo's kit to make him less irritating to play against, without gutting the feel of the champion, lee really doesn't have these options. To compare: yasuo is defined by 1) hasaki 2) dashing thru minions 3) his ult and maybe 4) arguably his windwall. What makes him frustrating is 1) his movement shield, 2) windwall, 3) dashing through minions. Already here you can alleviate two of the three problems by small reworks and touches in his abilities without completely gutting the idea of teh champ. Heck, even if you REMOVE windwall and shield, you still have yasuo. \nNow take Lee. He is defined by three things: 1) mobility, 2) insec like plays, basically his ult and 3) his q. What I can only assume people find annoying is 1) insec like plays 2) his q? and the damage? and 3) his mobility. Touch anything in Lee, and you risk the gutting I mentioned before. Touch his q, may as well remake a whole new champion and name him Luu Sun, because Lee is no more. Touch his ult, see the q. Then you have the mobility, his W to allies and his wardhops. Sure, you can nerf that. Remove wardhop and you'll need to compensate, because we all know that without that, Lee essentially becomes useless. Sure, we can look at his shielding-friendlies thing. But even if that is nerfed or even removed, will teh champion really feel less annoying to you? If Lee is a problem, then  fixing him also is, which is why I asked you \"what do you suggest\".\n\nTo sum up what I think, I don't think Lee is broken or a problem. You can ward well against him, you can pick into him, you can play correct against him, you can outplay him. His damage is not ridiculous, but if you get combo'd you can expect to suffer for it, much like with a plethora of other champions in this game. He's not obscure, he doesn't have tooltips the size of the newest game of thrones script to go with, or abilities that make you wonder wtf just happened. He's straightforward for both player and enemy and yet has a lot of depth. I find Lee, if anything, really balanced exactly because he works no matter where and no matter what without feeling oppressive.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-09-07T07:03:38.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Your argument is flawed because you assume that a champion's viability, or OPness, is defined by its place within a perceived meta.

When Riot says something is meta, that something IS meta, and there's very little you can do about it. League's balancing is NOT dynamic at all, that's the reality of League's balancing; we have almost the entirety of this game's history to back this claim up and no one can dispute it.\n\nYour entire argument is invalid because everything you bank on is derived from the sentiment that contradicts the above statement.\n\nWhat I'm saying is simple, in this kind of environment where you either sink or swim according to the demand of the meta shift (which is true), where Lee remains not only viable but also average to strong at the very least in all of the meta to date, shows that Lee has fundamental issues.\n\n> what do you suggest\n\nI do not need to be the solver of issues, I only need to point it out since Riot has turned a blind eye to it for the last many years that's almost as long as the game's entire lifespan. And if I actually have the grand solution then I won't be here in the first place as I would already be working in Riot already.\n\nLee was an Apirl Fools joke for christ sake. He's kit IS BS, he was MADE TO BE SUCH FOR THE JOKE. I have no idea why they're still keeping him around because the dude clearly has issues in his core, and that should be reworked ages ago. \n\nI mean, when you have a champ that can be easily proven to be trouble, for the longest time has been a gigantic stick in the asshole, remains viable and strong in metas that doesn't favour or even counters him, and after a billion nerfs still remain a ticking time-bomb ready to go off, but can not be touched meaningfully or else they become hot garbage...
