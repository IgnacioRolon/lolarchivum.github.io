Use Grievous Wounds items {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} . It makes it much easier to deal with sustain and even makes picking up the Health Relic in fights less rewarding.\r\n2. The minions in ARAM are still worth gold. Try to leave them for your carries and those who heal off of minions, especially champions like {{champion:45}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:86}} that gain _permanent bonuses_ from killing minions!\r\n3. Support items {{item:3301}} {{item:3302}} {{item:3303}} are practically free gold and health and/or mana with how difficult it is to share CS, and you can still pick up your Gaurdian&#039;s item as well as two pots. Their final upgrades are also usually worth it because of their CDR and active effects that you don&#039;t need to feel shy about using.\r\n4. Gaurdian&#039;s items {{item:3184}} {{item:2051}} {{item:3112}} are actually worth it. Especially Guardian&#039;s Horn because it massively contributes to your health sustain.\r\n5.  Rush Grievous Wounds items {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} . _It makes it much easier to deal with sustain_.\r\n6. Health Relics should go to those most likely to take damage for the benefit of the team! If you&#039;re a back-line sniper Xerath, you shouldn&#039;t even bother!\r\n7. {{item:3083}} is the go-to item for tanks. Make sure to get it once you can hit 3000 health!\r\n8. {{item:3211}} can make it feasible to survive poke-fests early on, and is worth sitting on because both upgrades are invaluable against such compositions.\r\n9. Get Grievous Wounds items {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} ASAP. _**It makes it so much fucking easier to deal with sustain**_.\r\n10. Overdosing on mana is never an issue! (So long as you buy some CDR with it) Spam to your heart&#039;s content!\r\n11. Don&#039;t sit on your gold. If you have enough to buy 2 core items, go ham while taking down half their team&#039;s health pool with you.\r\n12. Focus one person at a time. Even if their tank is practically feeding, it&#039;s better to try melting him instead of wasting your time chasing their back-liners.\r\n13.  **You better fucking get Grievous Wounds items {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} ASAP. _IT MAKES IT SO MUCH FUCKING EASIER TO DEAL WITH SUSTAIN_.**","replies":[{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2017-02-15T02:16:14.984+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just one thing missing.\nYou failed to mention grievous wounds...\nPlease edit.\nThank me later.","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2017-02-15T09:23:19.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he should really consider mentioning {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} \n\nGood call","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ExHentai","date":"2017-02-15T02:10:43.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WTF are these items? {{item:3123}} {{item:3165}} ??
