For the past week my game has had SERIOUS lag at the worst of times, and i've NEVER had lag before. I've checked, it's not on my end. I thought it might be until today, when I say your update about players having login issues. I was in the middle of the comeback game of my life, a 4v5 with no jungler where we were just starting to come back, taking down turrets and even acing the enemy team, when all of a sudden the game decided to disconnect me and my two party members at around the same time, swiftly ending the game And as it is I cannot log back in at all, the Sign In bar is just grey. \r\n\r\nI'm kinda salty right now because of this, the last game I had where it was a 2v1 on top with me against a Lux and Garen (Which, why? And why didn't my jungler lane with me??), and because Riven and Yas have the legendary skins and not Talon, or Vel'Koz, or Zyra. So I know that you're all probably working as fast as you can but I just really want to play my favorite game to hopefully make up for the crap storms of the last two games.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-15T22:30:03.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap that's some pretty bad timing. I really wish I could get you back in that game, if not just to hear that comeback tale!\n\nWe know a good number of players are being affected by that weird sign-in issue, and we want to help where we can. It'd be best to look into what happened on a case by case basis, so go ahead and reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get the ball rolling!","replies":[]}]}
