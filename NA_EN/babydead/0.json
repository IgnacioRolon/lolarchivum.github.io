This, according to my calculation, would be 695 damage without any extra&#039;s and such. \r\nRanged minions had 500 hp, 0 armor, 0 magic resistance. Yet, my fully charged Decimating Smash did only 407 damage. \r\n\r\nNow, I realise that his Q only does 80% damage on minions. However, 695 * 0.8 = 556.
