You took some good steps but not to completion- for example, you'll want to delete your entire config folder to reset your config.  Doing this may resolve the issue:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nYou should also try another mouse to rule out hardware possibilities as well.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
