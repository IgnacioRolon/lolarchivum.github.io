Also, it wouldn't be a good thing for someone building full AD to jump in with melee form unless their kit allows for it. Other melee champs that actually dive either build tank or have something that specifically makes them good at diving (Zed/Talon are assassins with ways to get in and assassinate someone without getting hit by CC, Tryndamere can use his ult to stay alive, Riven has tons of dashes, a shield, and CC). If mega gnar is actually strong enough to go in after building like an ADC, then he probably needs to be nerfed. Similarly, if the ranged side is so strong that it can outdo other ADCs, then it probably needs a nerf. I just don't see a scenario where a well-balanced transform champion should ever be able to be an ADC.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MaizeCraze","date":"2014-08-05T18:39:54.192+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have two questions regarding Gnar's gameplay.\n\n First, when mega Gnar throws a boulder, and then transforms back to mini Gnar, mini Gnar can then pick up the boulder to reduce boomerang's CD.

The most interesting spell that didn't make the cut was Devour.  He'd eat an enemy champ, removing them from the world for 3 seconds.  During this time he wouldn't be able to move but could spit them out in chosen direction.\nDidn't see the final kit for 2 reasons: first, it felt like bad Skarner R and Fiddle fear.  You \"stun\" Volibear for 3 seconds but during this time your carry can't kill him and then Volibear comes back and murders your carry.  Second, Gnar isn't a werewolf.  He isn't about running people down and eating their face off.  He's more just a big angry kid so I wanted his ult to have more of a \"bull in a china shop\" kind of feel instead of something with such targeted intent\n\n2. I wouldn't be surprised to see Gnar played in comp (his R is pretty strong and ranged top laners have certain advantages) but I would be worried if he ever showed up as a prominent pick without a specialized team comp built around him.  Our pros tend to highly value reliability which is in direct conflict with Gnar's unreliable transformation.  If he becomes a staple it likely means he's way more reliable than we intended.\n\n3. We decide kit designers based on interest, synergy with the ideas, and availability.  We have a small team of champ designers and when a new champ is getting slotted we assign someone to it who isn't currently working on a project.  If multiple people are available we think about interest and expertise in the role (I love making girls from Piltover and CertainlyT is very skilled at making mechanically interesting experiences for example).\n\n4. At a base level the mechanics on the characters are similar (3 hit percent max health and knockback into walls).  In the case of the R I think the similarities end there as I feel the use cases of Condemn and GNAR! are so vastly different.  To me, Vayne's silver bolts is a brilliant and satisfying way to say \"my character is target agnostic.\"  I needed this to be true to some degree on Gnar as he is ideally forced to build a mix of offense and defense but still needs to feel relevant when small. Does it make Vayne feel bad?  I don't think so.  She gets true damage and Gnar can't build magic pen so she's always going to hit tanks way harder.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-08-05T18:19:31.006+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If he becomes a staple it likely means he's way more reliable than we intended.\n\nOkay, this sounds like a devblog worthy topic, but do you think you can talk a little bit about *intended unreliability* and why you would build that into a champion?","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2014-08-05T18:50:27.879+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"> > If he becomes a staple it likely means he's way more reliable than we intended.\n> \n> Okay, this sounds like a devblog worthy topic, but do you think you can talk a little bit about *intended unreliability* and why you would build that into a champion?\n\nYeah sure.  Gnar's unreliability was put in place for two reasons:\n\n1. We wanted to provide a new gameplay experience.  Similar to how Draven mains feel amazing for being AXE CATCHING GODS, we want the people who master Gnar to feel like they're CRAZY RAGE BEASTS who've learned to master their anger and transformations and bend them to their will.  Honestly, some players won't like Rage Gene's uncontrollable nature.  \n--------You're going to be running Kog'Maw down in Mini form, have him one hit from death, and then transform into Mega Gnar, miss your boulder, and helplessly try to trundle away as he kills you from 700 range.  Some of you will come out of that game not wanting to play Gnar again because WTF I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A KILL BUT MY TRANSFORM KILLED ME.  That's okay.  \n---------Hopefully if you stick with him you'll then run into the game where you bounce off the enemy tank into the fight as Mini Gnar, assassinate the ADC, get brought down to 5 HP, TRANSFORM JUST IN TIME, hurl the rest of the enemy team into a wall, and watch in satisfaction as your team collapses on and eliminates them (try /dancing).  It's all about those high intensity transform moments and the feeling of trying to wrest control of this epic transition out of the hands of the game.  Sometimes it screws you, sometimes it wins you the game.  The uncontrollable mechanic is not going to be for everyone, but I feel that it will FEEL GREAT for those who do want to engage with it.\n\n2. We wanted to finally make a transformation character who felt good in both forms.  Historically we've had problems with achieving this as our other transform chars (Elise, Old Nid, Jayce) can transform at will.  Because of this we can't give the forms meaningful weaknesses (you can just swap out) and instead have to balance the character around whatever form is their best case.  When Old Nid's cougar form was strong human form was a glorified heal and scouting tool and when Old Nid's spear throwing form was strong Cougar form was a 3 second CD dash.  She never got to feel great about both forms at the same time and building to the strengths of one made the other suffer immensely.  We hope that by not allowing Gnar to swap when he wants to we can truly give both forms meaningful weaknesses that players can exploit in the moment.  This means we can also make their strengths REALLY strong.  Human form Nidalee isn't a problem in isolation.  You jump on her and kill her.  It's when she gets to turn into a cat for free and pounce away that she becomes an evil spear monster that can't be dealt with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"forsenE","date":"2014-08-05T20:08:20.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"would you ever consider doing a spell like devour for a new champ?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-05T22:22:03.775+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely.

Second, Gnar's Mega and Mini spells share cooldowns which I feel doesn't translate to a long cooldown ultimate.  I tried the paradigm on Vi at one point during her development.  She had a super meter with an ultimate that changed depending on how much it was charged.  Turns out she'd always just use it in the moment and never really think about possibly saving it for the other spell.  When Zed is about to kill you the decision is always USE R NOW.  Didn't want Gnar to have to make this choice with his R as I'm not sure it really is a choice...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cameron Woof","date":"2014-08-05T18:00:02.858+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are there any lessons you learned while designing and playtesting Gnar that we might see applied to champions with similar abilities?

Some of those we'll be looking to apply to other form/stance swapping champions where possible, though in a number of cases they're lessons more applicable to newly developed champions than modifcations to existing ones.\n\n1. Keeping the same targeting type on a button in both forms makes it a lot easier to learn a form swapping champion and offers a smooth flow back and forth between forms. In Gnar's case this means Q is always a line skillshot and E is always a ground targeted leap. Not every champion's going to be a good fit for that approach (we've got another character that swaps stances basically, rather than forms, under development that doesn't for example) but where possible it's valuable to offer. \n\n2. Clarity of form purpose is important, both for the player and when looking at how best to balance a champion. Mini Gnar early in development didn't have a ranged basic attack for example or particularly high auto attack damage and so struggled outside of poke situations. Identifying that Mini-Gnar should therefore be the sustained damage, kiting form, in contrast to Megar-Gnar's immediate impact, high CC, slow form, really helped give clear reasons for each form to exist and distinct strengths and weaknesses. Some of our other form swapping champions accomplish that well already (Nidalee in particular has clear reasons to be in Cougar or Human form), others less so (it's often unclear to Quinn whether she should be using her ult mid team fight for example). \n\n3. Limited access to a form swap allows you to give each form really distinct strengths and weaknesses, since the player can't just swap back a few seconds later, thereby nullifying the problem. In Gnar's case that meant we could give him two powerful skillsets that don't overlap, given he shares CDs between forms too. \n\n4. Itemization for two different roles is tough. Building different forms so that they can bring some item indepedent contribution (CC/toughenss for Mega-Gnar, some guaranteed damage via his W proc for little Gnar) helps with that, there's still conflict between what each form really needs though. Ultimately we've ended up with Gnar being able to use a wide variety of items depending on how tanky or damage focused he wants to be. That allows for some cool choices on the Gnar player's part, there's still a bit of conflict between form needs there though unfortunately.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PhantomCorsair","date":"2014-08-05T17:55:27.809+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Was the Champion Concept for Gnar always the same?

What we did spend a while exploring though was what sort of creature he should transform into, with various big forms inspired by dinosaurs, bears, oxen, etc. We eventually chose to go with a version inspired by the proportions of a gorilla - really front loaded body with enormous muscle mass, huge hands and so on.\n\nThe rage mechanic was on the kit right from the start, with the back and forth only somewhat controllable transformation the core of what we wanted to capture with Gnar's gameplay. It did go through an enormous amount of tuning in terms of how fast in should generate, what should generate it etc - getting the feel right on that, both in lane and in teamfights, was critical to Gnar feeling good to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2014-08-05T18:38:10.980+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"In planning to use Gnar as a champion that excells in teamfights, I was considering using runaan's hurricane to deal multi-target damage and complement Mega Gnar's aoe damage.

Given the differences between his forms, how would you recommend itemizing him? Do you find it more advantageous to itemize for his mini form (focusing more on AD and attack speed, marksman style), for his mega form (focusing more on tank stats), or for some kind of midway as a bruiser/fighter (going the Triforce+tank route or BorK + tank, like many toplaners do these days)?\n\n2. When you use an ability at max fury, does it trigger as the mini-Gnar ability or the mega-Gnar ability?\n\n3. How fast is the decay on the fury outside of combat? If you focus on just last-hitting in lane and don't harass an incredible amount, should you expect to build up enough fury to transform? I know that his early-game fury generation is much less significant than his late-game fury generation, but I can see it being an issue if you're just trying to farm and play passively against an abusive lane and you can't keep your fury low enough.\n\nThanks in advance!

Gnar's itemization is admittedly a little wonky and everything I say here may be disproved once he goes live and AP SUNFIRE Gnar becomes the terror of solo queue.  \n---------My rec is as follows:  For a balanced Gnar build that should be pretty effective in both forms you should start with 1 offensive and 1 defensive item.  Always get the offensive one first.  I suggest TriForce, BotRK, or Youmuu's for offense and Randuin's, Banshee's, or Visage for defense depending on situation.  After that build offense or defense based on what you feel you and your team need.  A more offensive Gnar provides great damage but has to be much more opportunistic when big.  A defensive Gnar is less effective at killing people while small but is much more effective at getting to big form safely and then wading into the fight for maximum disruption. \n\n2.  Max fury spells trigger the Mega version of that spell.  Crunch/Hop is special in that when cast to transform it becomes a hybrid of the two spells, allowing him to bounce and deal the AoE damage.\n\n3. Rage takes a long time out of combat to start decaying (12-15 seconds off the top of my head).  It also decays slowly. It's tuned to ensure that as long as Gnar is trying to do standard things in the lane/jungle (like kill minions/monsters) he will eventually transform.  This isn't like Tynd where you can zone him off the creep wave and cause all his rage to disappear.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZeronEve","date":"2014-08-05T19:09:53.196+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"How much of Gnar's kit do you actually think is necessary? Slows, stuns, and utility tacked on everywhere. He hasn't even been released yet so it's obviously very hard to say anything definitive, but seriously just look at that kit. It's kits that look like these with ridiculous amounts of utility, random slows and other cc that make for champions that straight up overshadow others of the cast. Probably the only balancing factor about it though is that he doesn't have all of it on demand with transformation like Elise/Nidalee/Jayce do.\n\nDesign wise, WHY does he have all this crap tacked on him? Why does his mini Q have a random slow on it? Why does mini W have a random MS steroid on it especially if he already has a gap closer? Why does mini E have a random AS steriod? It's design choices like these that make champions so much harder to balance and ultimately get revoked (Lee Sin losing his AS debuff is a start for instance). As per Riot's design philosophy of highlighting weaknesses and strengths, Gnar shouldn't have so much packed into his kit to hide or compensate for his weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-05T19:30:26.586+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gnar's got access to a lot of stuff, no argument, the thing is though that he doesn't get it all at once and doesn't get to choose which skillset he wants on demand. You could describe him as having two line skillshots that hit multiple targets and slow for example, but that's not a realistic desciption - he's getting one or the other, never both (especially given his CDs are shared between forms). His passive gives him a lot of stats, but that's because it's a way of expressing how his base stats are radically different in each form (and his 'actual' base stats apart from those listed on the passive are very low as a result). \n\nTo answer your specific questions:\n\nMini Gnar's quite squishy and has a very short ranged auto attack for a ranged champion. In order to survive at all he therefore needs to be able to kite enemies. We wanted to ensure the tools he had to do that were in combat mobility though, hence he's got a slow on his Q and a movement speed boost accessed via auto attacking rather than just a large haste buff to use whenever. \n\nThe attack speed on the mini E is there so that Gnar has a reason to use it offensively in lane. If he wants to put out as much damage as possible he can't just sit on his E and only use it to disengage and, as a result, has to make a trade off between offensive power and being more vulnerable to getting engaged on (jungle ganks especially).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenTheOlive","date":"2014-08-05T18:21:05.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I understand that having his transformation impossible to avoid is part of his design, but do you ever think in the future you will make it a toggle able spell for many gnar if he is too weak or will you try to balance him elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-05T18:47:31.989+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gnar's limited control over his transformation's core to both his kit and his personality/background.

He has a very unique passive, is it your goal to make mega Gnar stronger than small Gnar. I know it is not your goal to make small Gnar stronger than Mega Gnar because that would punish players when they are in team fights and suddenly change into a weaker form. What I'm trying to ask in 2 simple points is\n1. Will it be more difficult to balance Gnar when compared to {{champion:102}} or champions like {{champion:76}} and {{champion:126}} ?\n2. Is it your goal to have Mega Gnar be more powerful than Small Gnar or for them to be equal in strength?\nThanks, I love your work on these champions and Gnar looks super fun :D","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-05T18:56:57.670+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The goal is to have both forms be equally useful but in different ways, with each form being stronger under certain circumstances. \n\nBalancing Gnar's probably going to have its fair share of challenges, we do have a couple of useful advantages from the way his transformation works to draw on though. Since Gnar shares CDs between forms he can't throw out as many different abilities in a short period as some of our other form swappers. Additionally since he can't shift/deshift at will constantly he's locked into dealing with each form's weakness for a period of time, which gives his opponents opportunities to take advantage of said weaknesses.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheFujiApple","date":"2014-08-05T18:21:13.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys have plans for more uncontrollable transforming champs?
