{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2016-09-20T19:38:49.065+0000","title":"[RE-INTRO] August \"groovylord\" Browning, Champion Design/R&D","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi friends, I&#039;m August.\n[I did an intro post a couple months ago ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/GMbEvaqv-intro-august-gypsylord-browning-champion-designer) and I figured now would be a great time for another as I&#039;m about to both change my screen name AND change teams.\n\nWHO AM I?\nI&#039;m a megagamer who loves thinking about how to design resonant characters.  I grew up in Alaska, majored in economics at Dartmouth, and then started at riot immediately after graduation. This month marks my 4 year anniversary with the company and I&#039;ve loved every day of it!  I used to be an almost-pro TF2 Scout/Medic(logged like 1400 hours into that game) before switching to League around the Malzahar patch. Am currently a D2 support main.\n\nOn the subject of the name change.  I&#039;ve used the name &quot;gypsylord&quot; for the past 12 years.  It was a homage to my first doggo, Gypsy.  Growing up in the US (and Alaska especially), I never realized how racially charged the term &quot;gypsy&quot; is in parts of Europe.  I&#039;ve gained a more global perspective over the years and so I&#039;m making the personal decision to move on from my old handle and start with something new.\n\nWHAT DO I DO AT RIOT?\nFor the last 4 years I&#039;ve been a champion designer.  I designed the mechanics for Vi, Jinx, Ekko, and Jhin.  Also worked on Gnar w/Meddler  I spent the first 4 months of this year working on what was to be my final champ, but ended up handing him off to Jimmy &quot;BeatPunchBeef&quot; Steorts in May.  He&#039;s still a long ways off, but you guys are gonna love him for sure. Super exciting character, can&#039;t wait to see where Jimmy takes the concept.  \n\nAs of about a month ago, I&#039;ve moved off of champion and onto a team in our R &amp; D department.  Sadly, I can&#039;t say much about what I&#039;m going to be doing asides from we&#039;re still trying to get that &quot;S&quot; into Riot GameS and I&#039;ll be continuing to leverage my strengths at designing characters.  Hoping to learn a lot and eventually deliver some awesome experiences to all of you in the far future.\n\nAsides from direct mechanics design I have done other things!\n\n - Was heavily involved in early concept ideation for many of the champs developed in 2014 and 2015. \n - Headed up the keystone mastery project with Stashu and Squad5 and convinced them to add a 3-hit passive to every champion in the game.  Thunderlord&#039;s wooooooo.\n - Worked with our skins team on gameplay clarity (if there were any unclear skins released over the last year you can blame me D:)\n - Moonlighted as a live designer for a month and half where I proceeded to bop Kindred (hopefully for the last time) and attempted to Unbench the Kench.\n\nWHAT DO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT?\n\nThis will be similar to my last thread.  Feel free to ask me about any of my past champs or projects.  I&#039;m their #1 fan and know A LOT about them, be it theme, lore, or mechanics.  Also , if you want to know anything about growing as a designer (or just as an employee at a company) I can speak to some of that.  I started out here as a baby, and had the immense privilege of being able to learn from a lot of talented people older and more experienced than myself. Perhaps I can pass some of those learnings on to you!\n\nAnd of course, if you have anything you want to talk about outside of those topics feel free to bring it up.  This can be an AMA of sorts. Can&#039;t guarantee I can respond to everything, but I&#039;ll try when it falls within my sphere of knowledge.  I&#039;m on a recruiting trip in Boston at the moment so I&#039;ll be hopping in and out to respond to things over the next week.\n___________________________________________________\n**UPDATE --- WILL BE HOPPING IN ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

You get this binary experience where if he can hit you he'll keep hitting you and never die and if he can't hit you he's squishy as hell and dies in the blink of an eye.  Original Skarner had similar problems when his shield refreshed from basic attacking.\n\nOverall Morde's kit is too binary as a whole, he needs more variant actions that result in differing levels of success, right now it feels like he just statchecks you. (similar to old AP sion)\n\nPS, he is ult is mega awesome though.  Enslaving the enemy ADC and Dragon is great thematically and strategically.  The base kit is what needs work.\n\nAlso feel like the real thing we need for Morde is a VGU on the scale of Poppy and Sion.  This guy could be our METAL AS HELL DEATHKNIGHT.  I think there's sooooo much potential in that thematic space.  He could be so cool!","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-09-20T20:32:31.412+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Defense scaling on offense is a really weird thing in general as there are way too many variables in that equation.\nEnemy MR, your own damage output, etc.\nThough you gotta agree that it's very Juggernauty in a sense that he gets tankier the more people he faces head on, could be made a ton more healthy though by changing it to a fixed amount like Darius and Illaoi(Do you even spell it like that??).\n\nI strongly agree on the binary part though. Morde's entire success relies on getting items and just trying to flatten you, there's no middle ground. He gets in range and he'll win, he gets kited and there's nothing he can do.\nKinda comes with his entire kit being 100% damage with...more damage.\n\nHis conquest over enemy souls is certainly one of the high points of his kit and makes him very unique (though new yorick does tap a bit into the spoooooky ghost unit aspect) and it would be a shame if it would not be preserved in his future VGU.\n\nOn the topic of his passive though, which I only now realize is kinda similar to VI's blast shield in a sense, do you feel a damage oriented melee bruiser would potentially work with a shield that has a very high up time (current Morde having shield 100% of the time) or do you feel it creates this unsatisfying experience of never being able to truly chip away at his health?\nStrong shielding certainly is Morde's second most defining aspect but it just feels... Unfair? I guess due to how little downtime it has.\n\nMore intuitive shielding would certainly be something that would be less painful to balance, huh?\n\nAlso sorry if I just go on and on about Morde, I kinda enjoy talking about him with Rioters^^","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2016-09-20T20:41:15.502+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"You enjoy talking about Morde??!?!!?  Never would have guessed ;)\n\nI think IDEALLY, better patterns are stuff like Yasuo and Vi shield or Darius and illaoi Q's. More gated moments of large healing/shields instead of repeated moments of small shieling.\n\nThat doesn't mean that repeated shielding can't be solved.  I think a version of this that worked really well was old Vlad's drain tanking (once we got his laning under control). Old Vlad was a squishy dude that relied on large amounts of healing and spell vamp to keep himself alive during fights.  What made it work on him I think is that he never really got that tanky, so even if his health bar was constantly moving up and down, bursting him with Veigar was still always an option.\n\nIt's really about, when this character is going off what can opponent do (that isn't a stat check) to still have a chance vs. them.  If we can make a repeated shielding pattern where there's still options for the opponent (that don't leave the player feeling like trash) then I think it'll work.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-09-20T20:56:04.158+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel what kinda contributes to Morde's shield becoming like this huge grey wall the opponent can't seem to crack is how negligible his health cost seem to be.\n\nWhich brings me to the topic of resources.\nYou've designed champions who use mana to resourceless ones like Gnar (well, technically he works on a certain rage-bar for other abilities)\n\nRecent champion releases have been either mana users or just resourceless but there wasn't a single recent champion who uses health as a resource.\nIs there a particular gameplay element to HP users that made them trick to balance or was it just a thematic reason?\n\nBrings me just back to Morde (funny how it always gets back to this, huh?) who has been a terror back when 13hp pot and a rejuvenating bead start used to be a thing, even worse when a revolver was his first buy.\nA shield whose efficiency relies just on SPAMMING with no real decision making (was kinda amended with his new E) and that costs only a little bit of health for such a big reward just seems to be unintuitive by design.\n\nWouldn't some kind of proper resource management be what would differentiate the smart from the dumb usage of a shield?\n\nAlso, it really shows how out of date Mordekaiser is with all the new champion design philosophies and I'm honestly amazed how he managed to remain like this for a very long time. Might be due to him being Shelved like some other champions whose kits aren't really in line with League's current design.\n\nI've seen you comment on FroMA being somewhat of an icky thing regarding Gnar using it so efficiently and just had to think about Morde's own unhealthy relationship with Rylais.\nSo, on a design standpoint should there be an item that provides CC for champions to make up for some of their shortcomings or does it just create abuse cases of those building it who wouldn't need it in the first place\nGnar himself having a ton of mobility, CC in his kit but still end up getting the item.\n\nIs there a place for these items and can they be part of certain champions core build without just becoming really huge gameplay problems if champions just end up overly reliant on them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guardman","date":"2016-09-20T21:01:54.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=groovylord,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=TibiO6u0,comment-id=0008000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-20T20:41:15.502+0000)\n>\n> You enjoy talking about Morde??!?!!?

The reason I ask is that his new kit seems to have all the same problems that Kogs update did.\n\n1. He is very, very feast or famine.\n\n2. If he reaches you, you are dead and you can't kill him. If he doesn't reach you he does nothing. And in effect he mostly becomes a stat+proximity check (or a tonberry -> Chef's knife, stabby, stabby).\n\n3. While there are other offenders, Morde feels like the biggest offender by far with Rylai's. While most others are strong or annoying with it, his power is almost entirely tied to its slow.\n\nA revert wouldn't exactly put him a good spot like Kog since he was never exactly in a good spot to begin with, but old Morde seems healthier (more counterplay, less stat-checky), more dynamic, less game warping (especially around rylais), and has a better fallback pattern in pushing/waveclearing.","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2016-09-21T04:06:45.197+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Guardman,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=TibiO6u0,comment-id=00080000000000000001,timestamp=2016-09-20T21:01:54.329+0000)\n\n> A revert wouldn&#x27;t exactly put him a good spot like Kog since he was never exactly in a good spot to begin with, but old Morde seems healthier (more counterplay, less stat-checky), more dynamic, less game warping (especially around rylais), and has a better fallback pattern in pushing/waveclearing.\n\nIt's this pretty much.

That's not a criticism of the new Taric however and more just a personal design yearning based off of how we tend to rework characters (point and click \"easy\" successes tend to be removed).\n\nAnd yeah, his new theme is GODlike.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-09-20T20:39:07.196+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I am trying to get a response from someone in this Department that cares about Karma.

What you really need to do is finish her visual update and maybe give her a new passive. None of this is too much to ask for. You haven&#x27;t cared since then. At least do this.\n\nI never said we botched her, I just said that old Karma may not have been as bad as we originally believed.  It's possible she didn't need that rework.  New Karma, in the grand scheme of things, is not an awful character though, and we need to care about her fan base.\n\nYou can believe what you like about things we do \"on purpose\" but at no point ever does anyone here say \"let's just sit on it for 3 years and maybe the problem will go away.\"\n\nThe harsh reality of working at a game studio (even a big one like Riot is now) is that every single thing you do is taking resources away from something else.  Good particle artists that fit with your company culture are like magical unicorns in the games industry.  We can't just throw money at a problem until it's fixed.  We just straight up don't have the qualified manpower.  We have X employees to do Y work in Z amount of time.  Doing one thing means you don't do something else.\n\nI'll give you a personal example.  I once found a bug on Vi that made her basic attacks sometimes lockup after using E.  Obviously it needed to be fix.  Simple right?  After looking into it I found out that wasn't the case.  It would take about 2 hours of design time for me to make it right.  I wanted to go fix the bug because I CARED about Vi players, but I was also working on Jinx at the time, and another champion that ended up getting canceled, and helping ideation team out with Braum (back when he was a spunky piltover girl called CeCe), and doing design one-on-ones with Meddler so I could grow and learn, and trying to go home and sleep before 1 am so I wouldn't get tired and sick.  It ended up taking me a month to get around to fixing that simple bug.\n\nLook I understand that you're frustrated.  We took a character you loved and changed her and you see all these things that would make her so much better.  I feel you.  The problem is that a lot of things are not as easy as they seem.  I know you feel like we're villians here, but we're not trying to be.  No one at Riot is trying to be and if they are they should probably be fired.  We care about Karma, possibly not as much as you, but we care.  We just also care about Poppy, and Yorick, and Sion, and Ivern, and Tank Ekko's frustration problems, and the client update, and a seemingly endless list of things that makes any \"easy\" change a lot harder than it looks.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-09-21T22:32:06.416+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for jumping in. \nI have to start with a big **thank you**. Thank you for being honest, thank you for being kind, thank you for answering hard criticism with a detailed picture of the actual problem. Thank you for trying to enlighten us. Thank you for caring as much.\n\nBut let me return this kindness with a picture from our side:\n\n* **It hurts** to read that you (Riot?) now seem to realize that Karma didn't need the rework as much as you thought she did. What the Karma community has/had been telling you for years.\n* **It hurts** to read Meddler admitting that Karma has become bland because you didn't spend enough resources (thought, time) on her rework. \n* **It hurts** to see old Karma concepts (lvl6 abilities, shieldbomb) being salvaged and reused on new Champions, because it meant they were good concepts that didn't need to be removed, but also that they are unlikely to return to her, now that they are \"taken\".\n* It hurts to read you saying, that the current Karma and her current fans need to be considered, when no one ever mentions that old Karma fans need to be considered. Or her valuable lost identity.\n\nBut I do agree. Those fans are a part of the Karma community now and time is precious. That is why I keep producing high quality rework suggestions, that try to be enjoyable for both sides. And try to save some time for you guys. Maybe you sometimes find the time to check out my latest two. They took me two months each to create:\n\n* [A Detailed Post on Karma and her Twin Dragons](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/oxNbhh7j-a-detailed-post-on-karma-and-her-twin-dragons) (273 upvotes)\n* [A Post about Duality, Overwatch and Karma](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/xh09E7aj-a-post-about-duality-overwatch-and-karma) (10 upvotes)\n\nIf you want to rework her theme, the first one is to be recommended. \nIf you want to hammer down her current style, read the second one. \nOr maybe just keep them in mind if you ever want to check some opinions from the community. If you don't have the time personally, I do understand.\n\n> Personal opinion, is that at this point we should prolly focus on what is currently cool about her and make that as good as it can be\n\nNo offense, but there isn't much. And the life update team managed to make her worse with every touchup since her rework (5.10 prominently). They don't know what's \"cool\" about her. Currently, Karma consists of boring overbuffed values and nothing unique. Fun things about her were her mantra mechanic, tether-touch mechanic and shieldbomb. Which was replaced with Heimer's ult, was removed and was removed. Her current version has too much of everything. She could have a niche as a battlemage/enchanter (not currently in the game). For that we would need to cut her CC, poke and burst and focus on her shield, speed, emergency heal and consistent damage. My reworks try to do this.\n\nYou don't have to answer, but I'd appreciate it if I could discern whether you read this or not.

Think it's a bit harder to get right in League because of things like having heal power on a spell naturally needs it to take power hits in other areas (Ezreal W being the #1 example of where we had trouble with this stuff).  Nami certainly does this well with her W and R (Heal/hurt and haste/slow).

I think her overall personality is pretty good though.  \"Uptight serious sheriff\" isn't all that cool alone, but makes  for a great fit when put up against crazier people like Playboy Jayce, Punchhead Vi, Cray-cray Jinx, and Smarter-than-thou Ekko.
