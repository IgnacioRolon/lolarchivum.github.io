Me and my friends are all enjoying it.\n\nBalance notes:\nBard and Kayn both need tuning on their passives for this mode. Kayn takes far too long to collect enough damage to upgrade most of the time (since the damage to passive meter conversion is time gated), and then if he wants to wait for the other form he has to wait (an infinately more vital in this mode) 4 minutes. Bard just doesn't collect enough stacks, and while I haven't played them yet, I have suspicions about the spawn placement of their chimes as well. Bard seems like their stacks should be relatively simple to tune, though, since it has been changed in other modes before.\n\nAlso, just played a game two days ago where the King of The Hill spawned in the enemy base?

In the background we've also been working on a LARGE features that you'll be seeing in 8.17.\n\nThe MR changes from last micropatch panned out pretty well.  Sustained AP damage and tanks are a bit weaker (they were too strong) and marksmen and fighters who don't like getting bursted are stronger (they were a bit too weak). \n\nIn terms of overall balance, the power spread across different champs and classes is still looking great! All classes are worth taking, and the vast majority of the cast is viable in the jungle with the right partner!  We're still worried that AoE mages are slightly too strong and assassins are slightly too weak.  May need to look at future class changes to bring them up.

Just wondering about King of the Hill placement. Is it completely random or is it influenced at all by where the minions, towers, and champs are on the map? I just had a game in which we were losing really quickly - the enemy team was at our inhib turret and luckily we got them to back off before the event started. It was King of the Hill and it spawned near our nexus, which the enemy didn't even try to contest. We got GA's and managed to turn the game around from that event. So it was really welcome for us, but my duo and I had a talk about whether or not that was really fair - me being of the opinion that we were so far behind that the enemy should've just played around our advantage before pressing us again. I think randomness and how people deal with it is an essential part of the mode, but I also think being given assistance to come back when you're so far behind is a nice twist, especially when the game tends to snowball hard with winning teams being able to win events more easily.\n\nOn another note, in the event that this becomes a permanent game mode, is there any consideration to make it Bandle City themed?","replies":[{"poster":"Shadamence","date":"2018-08-22T08:51:31.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've heard, event placement will usually try to favor the losing side","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Omní","date":"2018-08-21T23:07:44.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am still seeing instances where King of the Hill ends up in the enemy's zone or even their base as the first or second event.

In these instances the event can absolutely throw the game into the other team's favour and then reward them with one of the overpowered rewards like an immense shield or GA.\n\nI am also still under the perception that ranged champions are quite powerful. Lacking the initiation option of a snowball in ARAM, melee champs are often poked down before they can get close by a coordinated ranged team. It's even worse if one of them is \"on fire\". Allowing teams to make a few key bans might solve this, but otherwise I'm still seeing a big power discrepancy.

This is a terrible idea prior to worlds patch.  This will not stop Ryze from being picked in a pro level.  Since we all know that is what the goal is.  The fundamental problem with how you are trying to hit him is \"If he doesn't have a bunch of damage, maybe the pros won't pick him.\"   The problem is, look at the old metas where Ashe Vatus Jhin Sivir and MF were picked.  Utility.  Ryze has a game changing ulti in pro play.  \n\nRemoving 10% ap from his Q doesn't solve anything either.  \n\nAll ypu have done is change a basic q w q e q to a q w q e q auto e q. And since E is on a 1.3ish second CD its not even like that 10% is going to be noticed in pro play.\n\nThe 10% AP change really only affects ryze during early game to mid game.   When you take into account how risk adverse Pro Play is it wont affect anything.\n\nIn pro play its always a 2 v 2, where ryze has a 2 seconds snare at level 2.  Ryze doesnt need damage to get the level 2 kill.  He just needs to make sure the enemy waste spells on him and his jungler can get the kill.\n\nSo bad idea.

Aside from a decay game I've only played this mode for the most part since it came out:\n\nGeneral stuff:\n\n* On fire buff is way too strong. A champ like Irelia with the buff will 1v9 people with little the other team can do about it. A support like Soraka with the buff is legit spamming full hp heals left and right and is completely broken because you can easily position far enough away that the increased squishiness doesn't matter.\n* Balance for the most part feels similar to ARAM or many other rotating modes in terms of what's broken. Artillery and poke mages, as well as supports are too strong, while 1v1 type champs like assassins are weak.\n*Snowball is way too high. It feels like you rely on getting a lucky event spawn to come back.\n*Double jungle with a random person is frustrating if you aren't on the same page.\n*Game time feels great. I love the shorter games.\n*Overall enjoyment for the mode is great.\n\nEvents:\n\n*Scuttle racing is really cool, but positioning in the middle doesn't work well when one team is pushed in.\n* Positioning for some events feels unfair. I'm fine with events slightly favoring the losing team but sometimes it's just unfair and even can benefit the winning team sometimes.\n* Loot Teemo is really fun but sometimes runs around one teams side the whole time and is unfair\n* Bardle Royale shouldn't center around a turret. Random Juggernaut choice can feel unfair as well. I wish there was a better way to pick it.\n* King of the Hill putting half the area under a turret is lame\n* Snowballs should go through minions and the CD on regular summoner spells after it ends should be increased because people are fail flashing still.\n\nBuffs:\n\n* GA and Shield feel awful to play against. They're basically a free teamfight win so it discourages the other team from interacting.\n* Rewards like the cannon and blitz hook minions feel much better and promote more interaction and fighting, and are generally more interesting than a big shield.\n* Overall impact of the buffs feels too high. \n\nThis game mode is really fun and all this feedback is given out of love btw. I'm glad there's a mode that's quick to play but actually lets me pick my champion. I don't like ARAM and much prefer this mode since I usually queue up with a few champs in mind I want to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pigi","date":"2018-09-07T19:14:47.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im oce and adding bans ruined the gamemode for me. there is literally no other game mode where i have the freedom to pick whatever champ i want. literally every game mode has a draft setting except blind pick and aram (TT on some days) . to me it ruins the purpose of fun when i can ban a champ that maybe someone else is having fun playing. but ive played about 350 games of nexus blitz and its a fiesta but its fun, its random its fast paced but with bans it just inhibits what i can play so that's why i don't like it. if bans are here to stay its fine :( ill just go back to blind pick and arams i guess xD but maybe in the future you could make another blindpick game mode or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Mephiisto","date":"2018-09-02T09:59:46.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rly like the new nexus blitz game mode and also like the new changes, despite the reward \"blessing of caitlyn\": its too overpowered...
