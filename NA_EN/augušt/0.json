You don't get nothin' on me in terms of having your champ changed.\n\n\n\nAnd you got \"this shitstorm\", which could only be considered a shitstorm to the most sensible of snowflakes would call a shitstorm, because your argument is wrong.\n\n\nCrit on Garen is vestigial, and actively harmful, considering even one crit item sacrifices his juggernaut set-up. Crit is a current nonfactor, and as such taking it away warrants no compensation buffs.\n\nAlso, Dr. Mundo woodo hypothesis? IT's called a metaphor boy.
