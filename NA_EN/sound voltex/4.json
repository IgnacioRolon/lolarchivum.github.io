Yes I heard you both times. I didn&#039;t respond because you&#039;re not worth my time or energy (I needed all the energy I can get for my jog). &quot;How does anyone get that fat?!&quot; I got this fat because of people like you chipping away at my already low self esteem. I hope you never get so depressed that you go on a slow and painful binge eating sudoku mission, I wouldn&#039;t wish that on anyone so you go ahead and laugh with your friends and call me a whale. \r\n\r\n&quot;Why not lose some weight fatty?!&quot; ... seriously? its pouring down rain and I am out jogging, do you think I find this fun or enjoyable? why take a shower inside my warm house when I could do it in the freezing rain!? I have been working my ass off to lose this weight and to in general be a healthier person. It&#039;s been a very long very exhausting struggle and I know I still have a long way to go. I&#039;ve spent the last 2.5 years getting myself mentally healthy now I&#039;ve started to make my body healthy. Oh, I&#039;ve lost over 100lbs already. I&#039;m sorry that my body in someway offends you or upsets you but I have a very quick very easy solution for you, don&#039;t look at me","replies":[]}
