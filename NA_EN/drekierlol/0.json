I've tried logging in through all servers and I am unable to login. Will I get replies via E-Mail? I ask this because I was logged out when making the ticket and this account is a new one to make this post.\n\nI am also worried that my card may be used to purchase items or that my RP would be spent.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T17:46:37.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you used the recovery form then you would be able to manually input an email address you have access to.  Our account team will review the ticket and respond to that address, not the one registered to the account.  Let me know if that clears things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Drekierlol","date":"2017-03-02T18:06:01.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that makes sense, thank you :)\n\nI dont suppose there is some ETA on any response?

They'll also be able to help with any necessary reparations too, so don't worry!  You'll be in good hands.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Drekierlol","date":"2017-03-02T19:16:41.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for all your help and the quick responses :) I'll wait for an E-Mail and play with this account for now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
