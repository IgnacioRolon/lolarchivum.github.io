I wasn't able to see the video you linked for some reason (says unavailable), but the way you describe makes it sound very similar to most connection based issues. It doesn't mean your internet isn't working, but it's not uncommon at all for someone's network to reach some servers and have a hard time hitting others (most often due to routing issues). \n\nBe sure to also check out your firewalls/antivirus settings as well, or just try turning them off completely while you're trying to login. Sometimes those can block your network from reaching our servers, and this would be my next troubleshooting step if port forwarding isn't working. Check out your antivirus and firewalls settings for me really quick with [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3), but if those don't help be sure to hit up our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Send them your League Logs [which you can create with the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool)] and they can take a closer look that way.","replies":[{"poster":"DeviationLark","date":"2018-01-12T21:01:29.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how long will it take for them to look into it?and can you see the video now?","replies":[]}]}]}
