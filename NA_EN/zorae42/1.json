Yeah, you WOULD get more rerolls. I just don't like to play certain champs, and when I say certain champs, I mean EVERYONE I don't own. I already have everyone I want, and I enjoy playing all of them in ARAM, although I do prefer champions like Vel'Koz, Yorick, and Kog'Maw (Well, before they gutted AP Kog'Maw). Seriously, a good AP Kog'Maw was the single most terrifying thing in the entire game.\n\nPart of the reason I got so upset though was because I've seen WAY too many posts saying how they want all champions to be available in ARAM, and it was beginning to really get to me. Especially since the OP didn't mention it at all, and you seemed to bring it up out of relatively nowhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-09-03T13:30:44.605+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> although I do prefer champions like Vel'Koz, Yorick, and Kog'Maw (Well, before they gutted AP Kog'Maw).

I mean, I like playing Vel'koz in ARAM, but he's just as annoying as Lux. **And this is the reason we want all champs allowed. You are glad that merely anything that pops up from the \"random\" selection will be viable for you and you'll have easy fun with easy champs while others will have to somehow go through the 20-minutes suffering. We're glad YOU are the only one who should be having fun as you've already customized it that way for you.**\n\nBut you know, there are people who bought some champs before ARAM was even a thing, before they started playing it or discovered it or bought some champs as test. I suppose as punishment the mode should become somehow automatically less viable for them because reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2016-09-03T18:05:06.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Vel'Koz is definitely a power-pick in ARAM, but he requires you to actually AIM your skillshots, unlike Lux.

To force people into playing champions that they don't enjoy? Has it ever occurred to people like you that people want to play a champion they actually BOUGHT, and that they bought that champion because they ENJOY playing as them? Of course, this isn't the case for everyone, but from what I've seen, it's the case for the majority of ARAM players.\n\nAnd, contrary to what you think, not every single damn champion I play in ARAM is a poke mage. I play my fair share of tanks, fighters, and hell, even supports sometimes, too. Hell, sometimes I don't even perform well with mages, such as Fiddlesticks. I simply enjoy playing them, and that's why I bought them.\n\nAlso, yeah, there are people who bought champs before ARAM was even a thing, or before they started playing ARAM, such as me. I started playing ARAM only a little less than a year after I started playing League as a whole. But here's the catch: I bought champions that I enjoy playing as in ANY gamemode. If you get a champion you don't enjoy in ARAM, that's YOUR fault, since you're the person who bought that champion in the first place.

In fact, I enjoy playing champions like Udyr, Renekton, Warwick, ect. In ARAM. In fact, Warwick is one of my favorite champions to play in that gamemode.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-09-03T19:05:40.022+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Vel'Koz is definitely a power-pick in ARAM, but he requires you to actually AIM your skillshots, unlike Lux. Her skillshots are easier to land than Warwick's fucking ult. So no, he's not as bad as Lux, LOL.\n\nI know you are exaggorating for effect and try to take it less seriously but this is just bullsh!t considering Lux is one of few champs, maybe the only one, who has to AIM her friendy shield ability :D . Like even her shield isn't point-and-click (because it can affect multiple targets, so it has reason, just sayin'). You have to deal with the fact she must aim Q, she must aim ult and it's pretty dodgeable If you pay attention to game, she must aim her shield. The only ability that's pretty easy to land while still rewarding you with a lot of damage is her E (I think). Finally, Lux must take the distance, risk and time to basicattack you to trigger her passive to deal her full damage bounty.\n\nMeanwhile Vel'Koz can only complain his E is harder to predict and use since it has more dodgeframe while affecting smaller area and feels like dealing less damage. But it offers much better CC. His Q can hit more targets and can reach further than Lux's Q if you can use the geometry mechanic, his W pierces through targets and his ult also pierces through targets. To trigger his Passive which not only feels more rewarding than Lux's but also deals true damage, you just need to land three instances of damage from abilities which isn't that hard If you play Vel a lot (I try to main him).\n\nBoth Lux and Vel are annoying in the fact they need to land one ability (similar to Xerath) and they can trigger their combo and easily use ult effectively without much trying. For Vel it's E, for Lux it's Q.\n\n> Also, tell me again, what's the reason you want all champions to be allowed in ARAM?

Buying a champ that you enjoy playing and is viable on Summoner Rift but is nearly useless in ARAM is automatically making the MODE less viable for you. The more champs like that, the less viable.\n\n2) You would want that, too, trust me. You, unfortunately, obviously encounter more people like us, who buy champions not specifically for ARAM. But should you encounter Malphite, Lux, Veigar, Annie, Garen or Katarina in groups of at least three in nearly every game, making it decided before first minute, and all that because those players at the MMR you'd reach would buy only these champs to play them in ARAM, you'd feel how the \"fun\" mode turns unfun pretty quickly.\n\n**3) You'd still be able to play them. This system might go hand by hand with easier access to Rerolls and more Rerolls. Also, you would be sure that should your teammate have the champ you want, you are guaranteed to trade with them as they will certainly have the champ you have. Imagine someone can't play the champ they want because the other person doesn't own the one they have so they can't trade...**\n\n> And, contrary to what you think, not every single damn champion I play in ARAM is a poke mage. I play my fair share of tanks, fighters, and hell, even supports sometimes, too. Hell, sometimes I don't even perform well with mages, such as Fiddlesticks.

If you get a champion you don't enjoy in ARAM, that's YOUR fault, since you're the person who bought that champion in the first place.\n\nThere's difference between enjoying the kit of said champ (like just Evelynn) and enjoying to play the champ in certain area with certain objectives against certain meta (playing Evelynn against team full of Juggernauts and Pokers isn't that much fun).\n\n> And no, before you say anything, I DON'T only play mages in ARAM. In fact, I enjoy playing champions like Udyr, Renekton, Warwick, ect. In ARAM.\n\nIronically the only champ of these you've listed that seems unviable in ARAM is Udyr. Especially Warwick may have hard to useless early game but If you have one more tank with you and bursters that finish the job you initiate, you can get early gold from assists, build tankish and end up still soaking much damage while dealing enough damage. His main problem is lack of gapclosing which is easily fixed with Snowball or Ghost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"forresto","date":"2016-09-04T02:50:02.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you imagine if you had to put up with mr eye laser ult in aram? oh god the nonstop poke and ult penta kills.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-09-03T12:44:38.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with the current system of ARAM is that if you want to fully enjoy the gamemode (guaranteed a champ that you like), you have to focus your account entirely on ARAM.
