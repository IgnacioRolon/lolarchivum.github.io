Pre level 30s have the same issues as diamond+ players because they make up such a small percentage of the population. Both see much longer queue times and frequently have matchmaking disparities. For example, masters/challenger players get paired up with diamonds players which causes some frustration for everyone. Same thing happens with pre-30 and lvl 30s.\n\nI can understand the frustration but you need to understand that the alternative is 20+ minute queue times. Additionally, even if we restricted games to only pre-30s you'd still usually have at least 1 smurf in your games. I'm leveling up a new account right now and most games I play with have at least 2 smurfs in it.\n\nTry to be positive and learn from more experienced players. And if they're acting like asses just mute them.\n\nBelieve me, I feel your pain. I'm only gold and I regularly go up against diamond players. In the long run it will accelerate your learning and make you a better player though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-10-11T11:50:57.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what if I want to play with my lower level friend?","replies":[{"poster":"CormanClan","date":"2017-12-16T18:20:18.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that what bots are for...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Power Of Syndra","date":"2016-10-11T10:41:43.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"True.
