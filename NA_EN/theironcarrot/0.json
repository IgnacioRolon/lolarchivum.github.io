If I go for the ADC and the support is a blitzcrank, he can pull me and I won't be able to kill the ADC. While on the other hand, if I went for the support instead, the ADC would live but the value of the support when killed would be lesser.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-03-11T10:47:31.708+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ganks are more about gold income than holding someone down. So more just ask yourself, \"Who's more likely to die?\" Sona has no escapes and is fairly squishy. Tristana has Rocket Jump. Kalista can pull her support back. Thresh has lantern. You just have to assess from their kits, cooldowns, and positioning, who's more likely to die.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-03-11T15:13:12.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\n\nI think another good tip is not to tunnel too hard on a kill. A lot of times I see a gank where the ADC has 10%HP left, but is all the way under turret, meanwhile the support is at 70%HP and is behind you in side brush; imo the best thing you can do is turn around and melt the support, then go do something else (farm, buy, counterjungle, take scuttlecrab/drake, etc) assuming your teammates are healthy and you can't get the enemy ADC within the next like, 5 seconds (chances are the ADC will back, or your teammates can pick up the kill without you). A lot of times I see junglers just sitting around wasting time in front of the enemy turret when they can't really get anything else done; there are a lot more productive things you can do than just sitting in front of their turret and waiting to see if the enemy ADC has a brain fart and suicides at you. I think jungling is a lot more about not wasting time than making some huge play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-03-09T13:20:38.092+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's a Tank/Fighter, they are harder to kill, so always go for the ADC.\n\nIf it's a Mage/Assasin, both can do drastic damage and both are squishy. Attack whoever seems easier to kill at the time then try to get the other.\n\nIf it's a Support, they can usually prevent the ADC from dying, so go for the Support first. this is especially true for Soraka.\n\nHowever when you see an easy kill, go for that first.\n---\nIf you'd go for the Blitzcrank for example, you give the enemy ADC time to kill someone in return. Sure he could prevent the kill if he lands the hook, but killing means nothing in this game.\n\nYou still achieve a lot: The adc is out of lane and no one on your side died. You may even still be able to get the Blitz or at least he will have trouble stopping the three of you from getting the Tower or Dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-03-09T13:49:57.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree, it really doesn't matter if it's a tank/mage/assassing/peeler for me. Generally, you just need to evaluate the kill potential on both and determine which kill would be more secured. \n\nFor example, if the support flashed and exhausted and the ADC healed, I'd go for the support. Chances are if you go for the ADC, he will burn flash but survive but if you go for the support, you can kill him, and basically zone the ADC a few waves until the support returns to lane.\n\nOr if ADC burnt Flash and Heal, but support still have both, go for the ADC. \n\nAlways be aware of mobility. For example, if it's an EZ/Cait/TristADC and a raka/taric/thresh/blitz support, I'd always go for the support as they don't have a skill that could allow them to escape but their ADC do. Vice versa, if the enemy ADC is Varus/Kog/Mf and support is Braum, I'd go for the ADC since Braum can jump on to the ADC for safety.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-03-09T18:27:29.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Valid point, but for me preventing escape is secondary, While getting a kill is always good, not dying is more important.\n\nNot all of them even try to run, some will rather try to kill one of you instead. Killing one of them doesn't give you nearly as much when they manage to get a kill in return.

This is denying them gold and experience and above all wasting their time. If they have no ability to contribute to their lane, in lower elo's, they tend to run around and effectively achieve nothing for their team in that time. While your team that secured the kill and didnt give up a kill in return effectively has a free lane to farm. With proper ward coverage and map awareness this its a prime time to freeze the lane and make the most of the time where you have nothing contesting you, or pushing the lane into the turret and denying even more farm while you safely back and keep scaling up. \n\nGreat point!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-03-09T18:42:30.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, I disagree lol.\n\nIf they kill one of you, 1 of them will be rewarded the killing gold and the other will have the assist gold. \n\nBut if you kill one in return, 1 of you will get the killing gold but TWO of you will get the assist gold.\n\nAt the point of a global gold, it's worth to trade 1 for 1","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-03-09T19:45:10.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, you don't know: more assists don't give more gold.

Priority will always be the ADC in bot lane, if its an unconventional bot lane your ADC may not be a marksman, go for the \"damage Dealer\" that is priority one. But if anything like FHMarshy just said is true and you feel like the support is guaranteed kill and the adc is not, then go for the support. There is more value in killing the ADC under any circumstance, usually worth more gold, you keep their damage dealer away from farm and xp for a while, supports have little to no damage so they are easy to bully and take towers when they are alone and it is the biggest win scenario for bot lane ganks. But again, if there is any reason that makes ganking them unlikely to succeed and the support is an easier kill, just take the gravy.","replies":[{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-03-09T20:08:45.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice seeing you here buddy lmao","replies":[{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-03-09T20:09:50.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt even check to see who wrote the post, lol!
