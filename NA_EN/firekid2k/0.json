Still, sorry to hear it's resulted in an LPQ and I recommend testing things out in customs for now.  To help troubleshoot and make sure your pc is in good health, I suggest running through each step of the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide.  That should get you squared away, but let me know if you run into issues.","replies":[{"poster":"firekid2k","date":"2017-05-26T16:34:19.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is weird.... cause it works just fine for the rest of the day. most no lag or anything.","replies":[{"poster":"firekid2k","date":"2017-05-26T16:56:37.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I ran through those tips. Didn't look like it found anything. Tried a custom before I did all of that, but it didnt freeze. Ill try my first PVP game after this 20 minute wait....
