I can still do everything else, I can buy and sell items with my mouse and at the shop my mouse works. I tried to create custom games and do literally everything, recall and use the shadow of zed. I can even flash in any direction I want but still my champion doesn't move.\r\n\r\nCould you please help me? \r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nSeb","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T21:14:37.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like this may be an issue with your input file that's saved server-side.
