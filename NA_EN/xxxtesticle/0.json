Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"XXXTESTICLE","date":"2019-08-23T22:25:38.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i get that but like i had honor 4 and now its gone like its so dumb( this was a very good way of looking at it and i appreciate it) ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-08-23T19:13:15.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XXXTESTICLE,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4i5JRwms,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-08-23T18:53:05.130+0000)...and if you did your opinion would be different.\n\nI *promise* you I would still find this behavior unacceptable.

The system checks for *1 or more* reports, and if it finds one or more it flags the game for review. The subsystem that actually *reviews* the games doesn't know *or* care how many times you got reported.\n\nAdditionally, you don't always get an alert when someone else is punished, so it's possible they faced punishment as well.","replies":[{"poster":"XXXTESTICLE","date":"2019-08-23T19:30:58.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"it does though and it states so in the report email they send you \"I know these can be subjective concepts.

Have a good day.\n\nFirst off, us volunteer forum mods don't work for Riot. We're just fellow players with special privileges.\n\nSecond off, there's standing up for something and then there's just refusing to listen to reason. Multiple people in this thread have tried to explain to you why you were punished, where you went wrong, how the system works and how even if the chat logs of the other players in the game were given the outcome of your case wouldn't change, but instead of listening you'd rather complain and get mad that you're not getting the answers you want to hear. That's how a little kid acts, and you're definitely acting like one right now. You may claim that you don't care about the punishment, but clearly you do and are just mad that the \"they started it/were worse\" excuse doesn't work here. If you were hoping to get Yesman answers only here then you're out of luck.\n\nIt's fine if you disagree with how the system works, and you're welcome to have a civil discussion about it by offering up actual feasible solutions to the problems you have with it. That said you can't ignore the fact that your behavior in your logs was problematic to the point where you were issued a punishment, and no amount of excuses, finger pointing or sticking your fingers in your ears will change that. At some point one has to be willing to recognize and accept where they were in the wrong at rather than be stubborn and act like they are always right.","replies":[{"poster":"XXXTESTICLE","date":"2019-08-23T20:26:16.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is where I'm getting annoyed, IM NOT SAYING I WASNT TOXIC.

I fail to see what's so hard to understand about that. As for equal punishment everyone has their own punishment history, so behavior that got Person A a chat restriction might end up giving Person B a 2-week or permanent ban depending on their punishment history and vice versa.

All it means is that the US government can't make laws limiting speech but it not only doesn't protect you from the consequences of speech but it also doesn't apply to privately owned establishments such as Riot Games.\n\nAs for me trying to pick a fight I'm not trying to.

Only 1 report is needed for the game to be flagged for review\n\"I definitely did not flame\" Are we going to pretend that the 4th line in your logs is already flame and it doesn't get any better the further down we scroll\nYour logs are just full of toxicity and flaming\nI don't really understand what context we would need\nYour logs were toxic and you got banned for it.

Because The Djinn said that the emails don't have any of what you're claiming they have. And without proof i'd much rather believe them than you\nWhen others are being mean to you, you can either be mature and walk away or star being equally as mean to them and act childish\nI mean, nobody is forcing you to walk away and \"be a pussy\" but you actions have consequences\nAnd if you break the rules, you'll be punished","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
