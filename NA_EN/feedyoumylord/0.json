DTN provided some great information here, and also have a [PBE FAQ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pbe-faq) that might also help.

In the links to the right from the page you sign up from you can find PBE FAQ, the status of your application, and the PBE boards (you must have a PBE account to post on them, but not read).\n\nPBE invites are sent out about every 2 weeks with each cycle, but they only accept a small handful of players according to their needs. They may target individuals that play a certain role or champion they are testing, and having a punishment on your account will reduce your chance to be picked. It is random, so you may get it in the very next cycle, or never.","replies":[]}]}
