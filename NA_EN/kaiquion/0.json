Currently annie is pretty oppressive; High base damage+AP scaling abilities. Reliable stun and Ult. Her mere presences is scary. The thing is her damage is fine and understandable, she&#039;s a short range mage, however one thing that needs to be addressed is her Ult/Passive, starting with her Ult.\n\nHer ultimate is pretty hefty; bulking High damage with great synergy with her passive, can obliterate a team. However because her ult is a instant cast and usually always combo&#039;d with her passive. It&#039;s pretty oppressive, leaving no room for any sort of healthy counter play. Like other threads suggested, make her ultimate a aoe skillshot, aka she throws her bear to a target location, upon arrival it does its thing with the firey entrance. Now because her ultimate is turning into a aoe skillshot, this calls for increasing her ultimate range, but only by a little. The travel speed of the bear should be about the same speed as anviva&#039;s Q but faster or as fast as ziliean&#039;s Q. This will add interesting gameplay/mechanics and healthy counter play to her kit, while not touching her damage output.\n\nA second suggestion is addressed to her support role and this will affect her mid lane role. Now any passive is strong without a doubt but when it comes to support annie this makes it possible for her but it&#039;s oppressive mainly for this reason. She can sit on her passive. What I mean by that is once she get it charged up, she can just have it until she decides to use it. While this isn&#039;t has big of a issue compared to her ultimate being a instant cast, it could use some tuning to its mechanics. What Should be done is adding a degrading effect to it, similar to ryze&#039;s new arcane mastery, the degrade time for her passive should be between 8-12 seconds; when ever she uses a ability it refreshes the degrade. This makes it so annie can&#039;t just simply  sit on top her passive, making her support/mid lane manageable.\n\nOverall these balance changes for Annie will keep her strong without touching her numbers ( damage), and add healthy Game play to her kit as a mid lane mage and a bot lane support.\n\n\n-Edit-: For the stack degrade, upon reaching 4 stacks, Annie must use her stun (In the given degrade time), if she fails to do so, she loses all 4 stacks. (Her stacks is still affected by degrade).\n\n\n--------------------LeBlanc-------------------------\n\nAs everyone knows the hate for Leblanc, I believe people are going about it the wrong way. While a zed treatment to her would be a nice hotfix to her, it wouldn&#039;t exactly solve the problem. We all know the problem with LB is her W and her W damage. Now Leblanc is a assassin, She&#039;s required to have single target burst damage, a way to get to her opponent and get out; Leblanc has all of this. However her mobility move is particularly the problem. Now first question that everyone should be asking is this, \"Why does a assassin mobility ability is doing this much damage?\". Now when looking at every other real assassin in game that has a mobility move (non ultimate) that has high damage AND can allow them to escape at the same time. Her W having 85/125/165/205/245 (+0.6 per ability power) scaling and having a 18/16/14/12/10 seconds is pretty overtuned. In fact this ability has been buffed so much that Leblanc users are actually taking it first and maxing it first. While this isn&#039;t exactly a problem to those might see, this actually removes some of her \"suppose\" to be weakness aka weak waveclear. But thats not the point on this. The point being is that a move that&#039;s suppose to be her get in/get out, and proc her Q (or stay in range for her E) is doing too much damage. Now I&#039;m not saying her W shouldn&#039;t do any damage, it shouldn&#039;t be doing this much, this also applies to her Mimic W which is doing 150/300/450 (+0.9 Ability Power) damage on impact. What I suggest is to nerf the damage and AP scaling on both abilities; for her Regular W: 75/105/135/165/195 (+0.45 per ability power), and for Mimic W : 150/275/400(+0.5 per ability power). This will take away the overtuned power she has with her current W and mimick W, Also Reduce her teather range (after landing E) by 100, making it so that she has to stay pretty close to get it off, adding room to fight leblanc, And make her missile width smaller to match the actual misslie. Overall this will keep her theme of deceiving enemies, while not adding insult to injury for having a mobility move that can do high damage on its own.\n\n\n-Edit- : Due to the fact she will be losing some power, Leblanc will get small compensation In her Q and E\n\nQ will increase from 55/80/105/130/155 (+0.4 Ability Power) on both damage output to 65/90/115/140/165(+0.5 per ability power) on both damage output. \nAnd for E from 40/65/90/115/140 (+0.5 per ability power), to 50/75/100/125/150(+0.55 per ability power).\n\n-----------------Cho&#039;Gath----------------------------\n\nNot much to be said about this terrifying void beast but one thing that is not okay is Full ap Cho gath and have 3.2k Hp from 1 health related item (Rod of the ages) and doing around 1.2k-1.4k true damage. This needs to be address, have the ability to just walk over to someone and deal that kind of damage in TRUE damage meaning nothing can be done about it is unbalanced. especially due to the increasing popularity of AP Cho and the buffs riot gave to make it easier for cho to stack awhile having his ult ready in 40 second or less. What will fix this is to first nerf the ability power scaling on his ult from a 0.7 to 0.5 and the base dmg from 300/440/580. While I don&#039;t have any real ideas for this, i suggest adding a scaling that scales the health gain from his ult that he&#039;ll get better hp per stack if he&#039;s already building tanky (aka hp items). But I don&#039;t know.\n\n\nAny thought?","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-05-25T16:09:14.476+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I get why people could complain about Leblanc, but Annie and **Cho'Gath**?\n  Seriously Cho'Gath?

And 3.2k hp without a lot of resistance isn't still squishy but he's not Unkillable. While yes he's immobile that can easily be ignored in a team fight, and or be ignored by getting hit with his Q. But regardless, the ability to do 1k-1.4k true damage; meaning there's is nothing you can do about that damage instead attempting to build warmogs or another high HP item which won't benefit you as much (cause he can already kill squishies i.e marksmen, mages, assassins with just q and w.) is not okay at all for the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarksideEric","date":"2015-05-26T02:48:20.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's so odd to see people claim Annie as being \"oppressive\" or \"overpowered\" when she hasn't been either of those like... ever, except for when \"regular\" Supports were weakened and she was moved down to Bot Lane, partially because she had zero presence in Mid Lane.\n\nHer Ultimate is an instant cast?

Velkoz, for example, if neither he nor Annie have Flash, never has to worry about taking damage from her, and to use your quote... \"if they're a good Velkoz\".\n\nVelkoz is one of many that can, in proper practice and on paper, completely dominate her simply because of his kit. Her Passive being visual indicates that he should be no where near her range (especially if she has Flash), he out ranges her, they both have a lack of mobility so there's no way she's getting in on him and they're both squishy so there's no way she's out tanking his damage.\n\nWe don't even have to use Champions that completely out range her to make comparisons to the various portions of her kit.\n\nWhat \"healthy counterplay\" does Taris'c Dazzle have? It's got the same range as Annie's Q, has a shorter Stun but NO visual indicator that he can use it. Flashing away from it doesn't matter because it follows you. Everything that stops / counters Annie's Q stops Taric's E... but yet somehow Annie is \"overpowered\" because she can sit on her Stun stacks, yet Taric, who does not have to stack anything, is not overpowered.\n\nAnivia's Frostbite has a longer range than Annie's Q and is also point / click, can deal 200% damage if the opponent is already Chilled and has no visual indicator that it can be used.\n\nKassadin's Null Sphere, longer range, single target.\n\nThere's so many Abilities / Passives in this game that have no visual indicator that they are up and ready to go... and you're complaining that Annie is overpowered? Seriously? You think her Passive should degrade? How is that a serious balance decision?\n\nAlistar can Headbutt / Pulverize you from the same (if not slightly longer) range that Annie can... but Annie's Stun Passive is \"oppressive\" because once she has it she can zone you. I question why you think you should be in this conversation in the first place if you feel Annie's visual indicator is \"oppressive\" when there's Champions like Lux, Morg and Velkoz that all out range her by sometimes **double** and have no visual indicator that their abilities are ready to use. \"But they're skill shots!\" you'll say, cool, amazing, they're skill shots... tell that to pros who still get Dark Binded.

And thats the problem with this, Because of all the changes riot had place, Its now becoming her main tool. For wave clear I can understand but one thing about leblanc that should've been her weakness is weak wave clear, which W says otherwise. I'm not saying nerf it hard enough that she can't even use it to assist in wave clear but the damage for it's cool down on a move thats suppose to be her only mobility move (besides her mimic'd one) and one of her guaranteed combo proc'ing move for her Q needs to be addressed. Her w shouldn't be her identity for damage, it should mainly be the identity of her deceiving her opponent. And while it does bring her into melee range, also note that she can instantly blink back as soon she reach her end of her travel. Some people might be able to get a good cc off (if they have one) when she does it in lane, but its highly unlikely that someone can otherwise.\n\nAnd cho does have a oppressive laning once he hits 5 and didn't die. but this thread isn't addressing his laning, its more focus on full ap cho Ultimate damage. The damage would been fine, if it wasn't true damage. Because its true damage, it means theres nothing you can even do about it if he manages to use it on you. The only real counterplay to that is its short range but even still, for someone to do that kind of damage, in true damage in a single ability needs to be addressed to.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-05-26T02:43:03.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but thats the problem with nerfing the W and compensating on the Q or E.

You do around 650 +70% AP true damage on a target close to you - and without flash, that target will probably be a tank.

Cho's ult does 1350 true damage, Lux's does 1250. \n\nOn the TANKIEST of the tanks, lets assume 200 MR lategame. With void staff, 200 is reduced to 130 MR late game (because lets be real - AP cho still needs a void staff for his other 3 spells). 130 MR reduces to only 43% for lux only - that means after resists, lux would do 538 damage with her ult.

One spell might do 1/3 of the damage, but its not like he can one-shot tanks with one rotation (Hello, Malzahar). \n\nLux's ult isnt a particularly hard skillshot to hit. if you dont hit multiple people with it in a teamfight, youre either sniping a carry or not playing lux to her full damage potential. \n\nCho's ult is a single target, melee ranged nuke. other mid-laners with a \"single-target nuke\" ult do the same amount to squishies (Syndra/Veigar/Malzahar) due to superior scaling, while having a huge range advantage. If Cho does decide to ult a tank, then hey - thats a ult that wont hit your squishies! Blowing all your single target ult as an AP Mid on a tank is never a smart thing to do if you can avoid it, but Cho is practically forced into it (unless there is a melee assasin on the enemy team). Yes, killing a tank might \"open the door\", but imagine a teamfight-  if the enemy APC blew his entire rotation to kill a tank, that means all his spells are on cooldown.
