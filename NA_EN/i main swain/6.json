During laning Vayne will almost never land silver bolts on you if you play smart, or if she does she will propabky hurt herself more in process.

Not so. She gets them in exchange for short range and some of the worst laning in LoL. She has to work to get her farm, and she basically hands her opponent a free lane (assuming no jungle involvement).\n\nThe entire idea behind Vayne is for her to be a heavily scaling, late game hyper carry. If she is strong before late game, it's because someone fed her. When Vayne gets fed, it's because she's a LOT better than you, or her jungle is WAY outplaying you. It's similar to Nasus, but in an ADC. I hope this helps you understand why she is that way.\n\nTL;DR - Yes, she's supposed to do that by design, and she's also supposed to pay for it with early game weakness.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-06-02T18:48:05.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny you should say scaling, because aside from the small ratio on her e, her q is the only ability she has with an ad scaling.  that's what i was just about to edit in my post, that they should either make it a large flat amount of true damage or lower the base a bunch and give it a scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-06-03T00:41:49.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne scales best with attack speed, not AD. Her lack of AD ratios has nothing to do with her weak early game; you're at least correct about that.\n\nHer damage also isn't lacking early game, and I never said it was. The issue is her short range, which can easily be abused to win trades and keep her from cs'ing. Fighting her at an even all-in is inadvisable at all levels, in my experience.\n\nAnd this is the crux of the matter; I only disagree with you because she NEEDS %health true damage to be balanced. If they buffed her early game, she wouldn't need it anymore. The only reason I disagree with you about %health true damage being unhealthy is because Vayne is the only example, and she needs it.\n\nIf they buffed her early game, okay. Then you're right.
