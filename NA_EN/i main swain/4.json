Those are balanced changes, not changing his identity. He was deemed too strong with what was taken away and thus it's gone. Additionally I don't think they removed the MS bonus from ult hitting the lit target.\nHis identity is the same, they just took some excess power away.

He still plays the exact same, his ult just does more damage and does that damage at a constant rather than more damage if he has an extra level because of the AS/lvl. \n\nHonestly, if you think his ult change is significant enough to say he's now boring, then you were never enjoying Lucian to begin with since everything else about him is still the very same.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-11-15T03:01:38.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to me that wasn't as much a playstyle thing as it was a buildstyle thing.  im not saying his ult change was enough to make him boring, im saying that it was the final straw for me in a long series of removing unique qualities from him.  to me, the changes they made to his ult are like making it so hecarims passive is now flat bonus damage rather than scaling off ms","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-11-14T17:45:44.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"playing this game for a while, I noticed that Lucian had very few unique powerspikes. Mostly in the sense that he could make multiple builds work. Prior to patch 4.10 (the marksman patch) He was a able to use BT + Tri force, for a powerful earlygame presence. After the patch, people did a Double blade build (Yomue's + BotRK) because his passive applied on hit effects, giving him a powerful mid game. And later game a more normal late game carry build with crit chance. \n\nWith all that in mind, I think focusing him more as a caster is a better fit for him. The changes that they made to his ult mean that he doesn't have to rely on AS. He can now build more Caster, (probably getting the new ER.) But even if his build is similar to other casters ADC's such as Ez or Corki, his kit and his abilities give him a significantly different playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-11-14T19:09:26.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that's not my point.  im not saying hes bad, im saying hes no longer fun.","replies":[]}]}]}
