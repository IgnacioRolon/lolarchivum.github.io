The vast majority of what I hear is basically people saying that they liked how before she could burst people with her q and w as well, but now her power is focused in her e.  That sounds perfectly balanced to me, considering that if the target is poisoned her e cooldown is reduced to almost nonexistent.  in fact, I think that being able to both burst with her q and w and deal high sustained damage is probably a little (lot) too strong.  And yes, ive played several games as her and found for myself that she is perfectly fine, incredibly strong at that.  yes, her scalings are low, but that is necessary because again she can spam her abilities so much.  and for those of you complaining about how hard she is to stack up, she really isn't.  based on the time her poison lasts, you should be able to get 98% of your cs while they are poisoned.  no need to worry about mana problems either because her e refunds its mana cost + some extra.  that coupled with the heal at 75 stacks (which you should have by 10 minutes) she ends up with some rather strong sustain.  and imo her damage early game is actually pretty good once you hit level 2 and 3.  you just poison them and e e e e e e e e e e e e poison e e e e e e e e e e e poison e e e e e e e.  lets shift to the higher elo players.  whenever I spectate a diamond/challenger match with a Cassiopeia they always do fine.  why? because Cassiopeia IS fine.  so please, spare the rest of us and stop complaining and either play a different champion or learn how to play her better.\r\n\r\nthere, im done.  downvote away","replies":[{"poster":"Drakexionyx","date":"2014-11-17T00:16:25.283+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not going to down vote you for a rant that is just crying out to be martyred by that kind of attention.\n\nInstead I'm going to offer you my own (rational, I like to think) opinion on the subject. \n\nFirst and foremost, I've been playing league since preseason 2. I never played Cassiopeia then, and apart from trying her on the PBE when her rework was announced, haven't played her since. I am not going to talk about those games regardless. My perspective is that of a mid lane main who has played hundreds of games *against* Cassiopeia.\n\nPrior to the rework, all her damage was focused around poison harass and then shredding people if they made a poor engage or capitalizing on positioning, zoning and her team mates CC, kiting around like a slippery snake. It was honestly tough to play against her at early levels, but the fact that she had exposed weaknesses with her damage being primarily over time and only her ultimate for hard cc. Once you hit level six in most match ups you could play around her long CD's for her ult, while her E was near useless apart from extra damage to enemies you were kiting.\n\nPost rework her damage is now focused on her E. It's almost exactly like playing against Ryze, where she has a machine gun spell but only through spamming it does she get much meaningful damage down. Her poison does almost no damage anymore and gives no incentive to dodge it when still without hard cc, she has to all in to make any impact of the damage. On any champion with a snare, knock-back or stun (Swain, Ziggs and Syndra, for example) you can land your higher burst combo on her and back away after you've cc'd her and you inevitably win the trade, because she hasnt had enough time to continuously E you. \nThis style of play works on Ryze because he is naturally durable, has sustain built into his kit with his ult, and even bonus AOE effect added to all his skills for greater team fight effect. Cassiopeia can only hit one target with her E however, and she has no innate sustain. Her wonderful max stack bonus does make her late game strong if she lands a good ultimate, but all of her AP ratios are lower early game to compensate for this. Thus it is incredibly easy to irreversibly snowball against her while she's waiting for stacks to be impactful. \nOn Swain, one of the champions Cassiopeia traditionally used to counter, I haven't lost a game to her post rework because you can bully her around until you hit level 6 first and then safely tower dive her solo with the level mismatch as her damage is so negligible at that point. \n\nHer pattern of play revolving around her E is much easier to predict and dictate as a lane opponent when it used to be she who was the beguiling serpent dictating your moves, waiting to spring a trap. \n\nThese are just my experiences playing *against* her, and while I enjoy having an easy win whenever I see her, I'm sad that there is one less viable champion (albeit a niche pick, pre-rework) in League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"kanacho","date":"2014-11-17T00:33:45.898+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The incentive to dodge her poison is to avoid her Machine Gun E... If you dodge it, then her DPS is non-existent being unable to reset her E to that fraction of a second. Her power comes from good synergy with her abilities. Q gives a speed boost W gives a slow E is her damage. Q and W provide the ability to reset E thus requiring you to actually land at last half of your abilities to do any damage. Cassi has more AOE CC than Ryze (A lot more as Ryze without a rylai's or something), which is the trade-off here. Ryze has tons of complaints for being so durable yet being able to blow up for huge damage ontop of all the stats he naturally get for itemizing for mana. He's not fun to play against for that reason, but still beatable. Cassi is a high skill control mid-laner who has an extremely powerful team-fight ultimate once one of the teams engage, and her W provides and AOE slow, while her Q provides her additional mobility and a more targeted poison for who she wants to attack with her E. You will generally want to throw your W into the middle of the team, and ultimate when you get a good shot at it, and Q the target you want to focus and follow up with E's to finish them off given you have the ability to. She does really high damage still, which is sustained damage that is spread, which is still like it was before with her DoT spam which was sustained over time damage too.","replies":[{"poster":"Drakexionyx","date":"2014-11-17T00:50:46.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't dispute that at all. However it is my experience in playing against the new Cassiopeia that you can bait her with almost any champion that has CC by letting her hit a Q so that she comes in to trade with e, when she does you CC her, drop your combo then back away. She will have at most got two E's off, which with her miserly Q damage is not near enough to win the trade.\n\nIf she doesn't take the bait and try to trade with you then her Q is on CD, the poison wears off, and you have a 4 second window in which to bully her where she literally has no DPS to trade with you until Q is back up. You can then repeat this pattern of play to zone and bully her more and more, and she cannot do anything about it. Once you get boots 1 dodging the Q is simple, the only time you should get hit by her after the first back is when you;re baiting her. Miasma's slow cast animation makes it painfully easy dodge as well, and it really is only an effective zoning (or farming) tool, but when she cannot trade with you there's nowhere she can really zone you, because you're never threatened by her in lane.\n\nThe pit falls I find most people get themselves into with Cassiopeia is they giver her present iteration *too much* respect and allow her to get stacks and farm without bullying her exceptionally weak early game. That is when her single target E DPS scales really well and she gets a strong late game... Assuming the rest of her team hasn't fed XD.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2014-11-17T00:26:02.286+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"first off, a few things I forgot that that reminded me of.  meant to put a poll in there.  anyways, I do agree that her actual dps on her q could use a buff, but aside from that I think she's fine.  and thank you for using actual points instead of like many people have been doing and just throwing a hissy fit.

You would think this does nothing, but what it does it allow her to have the power level of old cassio, but in the early game before she has stacks, she is far from the power level of old cassio. The fact that her early game is put on a cap is a hard nerf to her in general, and an unnoticable buff to her lategame as it is so small. You would think that this wasn't so bad, and they could buff her for this, but they made it so the stacks she would gain would be through poisoning the enemy, and csing a poisoned minion. This creates a 'minigame' for cass which makes the player more focused on poisoning the enemy and getting poisoning and csing minion than focusing on the many parts of this game that make the early game quite complex. The cass will not even care if the enemy is csing or securing the dragon with her team if she has to focus on this, and even when she doesn't need to focus on the minigame, her earlygame is so lacking that it doesn't matter, as she cannot help much with securing dragon or roaming for kills.","replies":[{"poster":"Drakexionyx","date":"2014-11-22T23:45:51.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps because I *did* mention it...\n\n> \"Her wonderful max stack bonus does make her late game strong if she lands a good ultimate, but **all of her AP ratios are lower early game to compensate** for this.
