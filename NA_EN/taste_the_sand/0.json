While I agree that there should be consistency with the model and the splash, I think this is more of a minor detail, as compared to the color variation when the splash and model was released. Originally, the model was a completely different color from the splash, but, thanks to player feedback, the color was successfully changed to match the splash more. \n\nSplash art for content is meant to give a general representation of what the content looks like. Of course, we can do a lot more with splash art than we can with in game models, which is why you'll often see some awesome detail in the splash art (take Arclight Vayne's cloth detail in her splash art, for example). \n\nIf you cruise through some splash art, you may notice bits here and there that aren't 100% accurate to in-game; it's usually about 95%.

If you have feedback for PBE content and you don't have a PBE account to post on those boards, feel free to leave feedback on these boards. The sooner you can leave feedback the better because that'll give us more time to discuss it and potentially make changes.\n\nAgain, thanks for taking the time to leave feedback!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-07-19T17:56:58.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=apy4fjMH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-19T17:49:56.327+0000)\n \n> If you cruise through some splash art, you may notice bits here and there that aren't 100% accurate to in-game; it's usually about 95%\n\n\na great exemple for that is bloodmoon akali's mask\n\nwith time, we learn to not care that much about skin/splash mismatch","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipi99","date":"2015-07-20T20:40:03.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His crab arm also looks extremely small ingame compared to the splash art.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2015-07-19T19:38:49.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"So it's really that hard to make little changes to his boots to make them look identical?
