{"poster":"Bayard","date":"2015-01-13T23:19:48.840+0000","title":"Ernest, The Mirror Manipulator","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In this concept i'm going to shy away from numbers as they don't really do anything for the design except give people stuff to complain about . >_<\n\n**Role**: AP Mage\n\n**Physical Description**: Ernest is a young man, who wears fully white clothing and is blond haired. He is thin and walks with pupose. He is very arrogant and has a jelous personality.\n\n**Upon selection**: \"The mirror is clearly mistaken.\" in reference to the mirror in Snow White, as to say that he is the greatest.\n\n**Passive - Mirror Mirror on the Wall**\n\nTo Ernest all walls are mirrors, thus, all of Ernest's projectile abilities  reflect off walls. After bouncing their range is reset and travels the full distance but can only do so once. Also an ability can damage a champion a second time if applicable. This has no cooldown. Reflections do reduced damage\n\n> **Design notes:** This passive gives needed damage to Ernest and thematically makes sense for him to have a reflecting capability as he is a mirror champion. This also makes him unpredictable and strong in the jungle where walls are all around. Also making the reflections do less damage prohibits four damage procs from one q doing insane damage.\n\n**Q - Shard of the Mirror**\n\nErnest flings a thin (think {{champion:99}}  binding) shard of his mirror at 800 range, passing through all enemy dealing magic damage. For the next three seconds he may fire an additional, thicker shard for an increased mana cost and at a lower range (500).\n\n> **Design notes:** This is Ernest's primary source of damage. I envision it acting like an Irelia ult without the heal and, the ability to cast it twice will give him the ability to have more wave clear and farming under tower potential if needed. Also itwill be proc-ing the passive more creating lcs big plays. .This will give him some burst. The player will also have to choose if casting it again is worth it for the mana cost increase\n\n**W - Splitting Mirror ** \n\nErnest summons a thin mirror facing him at 500 range lasting 3 seconds. Firing a Shard at the mirror makes three shards come out of the other side in a fan. (think {{champion:22}} w plus {{champion:126}}  acceleration gate). Shards may only gain the bonuses from passing through it once. Shards that pass through it only go an additional 500 range. Summoning a wall of reflection on top of the splitting mirror makes a wall come out on either side. Each side's wall procs separately.\n\n> **Design notes:** I wanted Ernest to have at least one ability that created real reflections of the original. Also this will give him more damage, wave clear,  and poke, as well as making the slow a bit more Inntimadating. I wanted his e and w to have some sort of interaction. His passive is proc'ed by the mirror. This will keep his damage in check.\n\n**E - Wall of Reflection**\n\nErnest Projects a Long mirror at 850 range. This mirror impairs vision of the other side (enemies only). If two shards hit the mirror or a champion walks through it, it will explode on both sides dealing magic damage and applying a slow.\n\n> **Design notes:** I Figure that having more stuff for the player to bounce stuff off in the lane faze is a good thing. Also giving him some area control and cc were needed in this design, as a result this ability was formed. The sight block made sense because you can't see beyond a mirror\n\n\n**R - Real Or Virtual**\n\nErnest selects a champion as the center of his circle of clones. During the duration, Ernest may **not** move normally but by left clicking Ernest may switch his location with one of the clones (Whenever Ernest switches all the clones ripple for a moment). Clones copy his **Q** move at 10% of it's normal damage and go to where Ernest's Q goes (like {{champion:238}} ). During the duration clones can be killed with one auto attack but are not effected by {{item:3074}}{{item:3087}} {{item:3085}} or abilities or auto attack abilities like {{champion:29}} 's ult or{{champion:131}} 's passive. During the duration, he may be damaged, but his opponents will have **no** indication of it. He can't be cc'ed during the duration (#No knockups). He can activate the ultimate again to cancel it, But the clones remain for a short while to confuse the enemy team.\n\n> **Design notes:** This ultimate is **very** complex. He becomes a juking god while able to maximize his q and multiply his w's damage. Because the clones only take one hit, his opponents have some counter play. If his enemies play smart eliminating clones close to his team will make it so cancelling his ult will bring him close to them. This ult is cool but takes some mind games to really win with it.\n\n**Lore**\n*Ernest always got what he wanted. Him and his parents lived aristocratically in Piltover. For his family their appearance was everything. Ernest became accustom to living in front of his mirror, and it became regular to converse with it. One day while wandering his mansion, he came upon a wing of his house he had never seen. Inside he saw many paintings piled, and golden artifacts lying around. As he looked at these treasures he saw a small, cracked silver mirror, which seemed to be very out of place. When he picked it up, it repaired itself and Ernest saw his face in it. It spoke independently of him and told him that he could give him the fun that he never had. With the power of the mirror, Ernest became arrogant and mischievous. He always asked his mirror about the phenomenons of the world. When he heard about the institute of war, he and his reflection were enticed by it's mystery and secrets that they didn't know. They signed up as recruits, slowly climbing until they entered the League of legends. He fights to prove his skill and superiority over others.*\n\n**Final Notes**: It's good to get this idea off my chest. Ernest is a simple character who's damage can multiply on itself. He doesn't have any mobility but has tricks to deal with others and bait them away. Since he can't reflect much in the laning faze, using the q into the w would be the way to get off alot of burst. The ult is mechanically complex, but allows his q to do tons of damage and create zoning during fights, only thing is he could be trapped by his own ult, much like {{champion:101}} or {{champion:161}}     except he'll be even more *in* the fight. I see him building standard mage, because he is a poke mage.\n{{item:3165}} --->{{item:3089}} ----->{{item:3135}}\n\n\n\nComment plz\n\n*Here's another one of mine*:\n[Cultos, The Locust's Pawn](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/b6H385Az-cultos-the-locusts-pawn)\n\nImage at the end shows his rough look.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-16T01:23:15.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Bard, I haven't gotten a chance to look at the concept yet, but I can tell you right now that people won't take you seriously with that reference image you chose.
