His clothes are ragged but nice matiriel and his hood is activated when his dance is performed and taken of the same way.\n\n**Upon Selection**: Take it, so I may rest!\n\n**Allies**: none\n**Enemies**: People who flaunt beauty, maybe{{champion:103}} {{champion:119}}.{{champion:43}} hates the idea of karma's logic, he thinks he was cursed for nothing while doing great deeds.\n**Health**: 550(+77)  **HP5**: 3.5(+0.45)\n**Mana**:0(+0) **MP5**: 0(+0)\n**Range**: 125(melee) **Attack Damage**: 54(+3.25)\n**Armor**: 16(+2.25) **Magic Resist**: 27(+0.25)\n\n\n**Passive**: *Infinite Affliction*\nCultos uses *Disease* instead of mana. He gains it passively and gains one bonus armor and magic resist for every fifty *disease* missing.\nDisease: 300(+50)\nDisease Per 5: 10(+0.6 )\n\n**Passive**: *Infectious touch*\nCultos’s basic attacks and abilities, apply a de-buff that reduces the armor and magic resist of all affected target by the same amount  as that of his current bonuses from *Infinite Affliction*.\nDuration: 3s\n>**Le Notes**:  These passives combo well and make sense thematically. He uses his diseases and loses some of it and gets stronger. Also his disease lost is equal to the portion he gives. I hope disease would work like energy.(my nubers are off for this) I mean in the way that it costs alot to cast spells and the regen is high. This would be so casting a spells at the right moment gave you significant resistances.\n\n  **Q**: *Cloud of locusts*\nCultos spews out a small cloud of locusts at a target location dealing physical damage every second. If the cloud damages a unit, it will persist longer and grow larger up to a cap. Cultos can activate again and left click to move it. The larger it is, the slower it moves.\nCost: 60/70/80/90/100\nCooldown: 10s at all ranks\nDuration: 3s/4s/5s/6s/7s\nMax additional duration: 3s/5s/7s/8s/10s\nRange: 500\nDiameter: 100/115/130/150/175\nMax Diameter: 150/190/225/250/300\nPhysical damage per second:5/10/15/20/25 (+0.15 AD)\n\n> **Das Notes**: This ability gives him some much needed wave clear and damage. Because it moves slowly, champion who can get to him in lane can outrun his locusts and get to him for the true damages. This counteracts its bullying potential and adds some counter play. It slowing down and the fact that the locusts feeding the duration and size give its individuality.\n\n **W**: *Plague’s Reminder/Momentary Recovery*\n\n**Passive**: Plague’s Reminder\nCultos’s basic attacks deal additional magic damage to enermy targets who are **already**diseased.\nMagic Damage: 15/25/35/45/55\n\n**Active**: *Momentary Recovery*\nFor a Brief moment Cultos loses all of his *Disease* and expels it from his body, applying *Infectious touch* to all enemy units in the radius. He gains **double** resistance bonuses from infinite affliction. *Infectious touch* is** not** affected by this doubling. Cultos cannot control the *cloud of locusts* during the duration. Also he can't regenerate disease during the duration.\nCost: 100% current disease.\nCooldown: 14s/13s/12s/11s/10s\nExpel Range: 550\nDuration: 3s at all ranks\n\n>**Noterinos**: I'll start with the passive. Since it is plagues *reminder* I felt it should only affect diseased targets as its damage is quite good. The passive and active together act as a rumble passive while also applying the debuff allowing him to apply it and stick to the target of his choice without being irrelevant. Making him not be able to move the cloud will require him to be well aware of his positioning.\n\n**E**: *Locust Form*\nCultos's form becomes locusts.  On reactivation (he may move for a short time before reactivating) he dashes to a target enemy. If he dashes to a enemy he deals physical damage (every quarter second) to them and temporarily fears them. On cast, if *Cloud of locusts* is persisting, it stays centered on him and ignores the movement reduction based on its size.\nCost: 55/65/75/85/100\nCooldown: 14s/13s/12s/11s/10s\nDash range: 400\nFear/Damage Duration: 0.50s/0.75s/1.00s/1.25s/1.50s\nPhysical damage:5/10/15/20/25 (+0.10 AD)\n\n>**The Jottings** (notes): It has a very small range but powerful cc and, it having the ability to center the cloud on him will allow him to walk up in the team and, instead of using w, do aoe damage and dash and fear! The fear is a cc that works well with plagues in my opinion.\n\n**R**: *Conndition Relocation*\nCultos chooses a champion near him to share his disease with. This does physical damage over a Three seconds. Any Enemies who gaze upon the target are silenced for as log as they look at them.\nRange: 650/700/750\nDuration: 3s\nPhysical damage: 200/300/400 (+0.3 AD) (full duration)\n\n>**Penultimate notes**: This ult is awesome! Even though it only targets one person it still has an aoe effect that doesn't do damage. The silence is aoe and makes sense because everyone is so disgusted by this mutation they cant even speak. I imagine him screaming \"How does it feel!\" or \"would you like to keep it\" or \"YEEESSSSS\" as to show that no one understands him.\n\n**Lore**:\n*Cultos was a worshiper of a great deity of his people. When he was assigned to guard a relic one night, he knocked it over spilling a great plague of locusts upon his people killing them all in one fell swoop. He woke up surronded by their many whispers, torturing his flesh and mind. In the aftermath, Cultos grieved and cried at the corpses of his loved one. He screamed for mercy to the skies and begged for the plague to leave him as he had learned his lesson. But still the plague persisted. He tried to repair his ravaged temple, but the locusts destroyed it again, and again and again. The locusts whispered in his ears of a place where he could rid his disease from his body. The league of legends. Blind by the cruel pain of the insects, he traveled there. Killing all in his path, and straying from his once pure path. By the time he arrived, he had left a scar across the land, and was hated by many. Cultos will ignore all horrid actions to rid himself of the plague.*\n\n\n**Additional Notes**\nCultos is a champion i thought about for a while. He has similarities to champions like {{champion:68}} who sacrifices spells for damage, with a combination of {{champion:33}} 's w. At heart he is a unique champion who is tank and does damage over time. He is like singed in the d.o.t way but not in the abilities. Also his damage is good if ignored because of his passive. I see him being a mid/late game tank who does massive reductions and has a huge cloud around with him. Also i seem him jungling with q to start and using e for ganks. items...{{item:3074}} then{{item:3111}} {{item:3143}} to slow them for the cloud. and then more tank items. for the jungle {{item:3725}}  and tank, maybe a {{item:3707}} or{{item:3723}} . Also i think his abilities make sense thematically and could have some cool interations with {{champion:69}} or {{champion:83}}. \n\nComment plz!","replies":[{"poster":"Bayard","date":"2015-01-12T12:23:20.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changed ult, its now awesome!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T18:59:19.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=a bearded bard,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=b6H385Az,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-12T12:23:20.424+0000)\n>\n> Changed ult, its now awesome!\n\nLove the new ult!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T03:53:31.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, this is a really smart, novel and well thought out concept!  I quite like it.  Here are some notes-\n\nPassive seems a touch strong overall.  I could really use some practical numbers to help bench it into reality.... are we talking 20 armor/MR or 100?  I like the directly proportionate give and take concept!\n\nThe Q is really neat and I love the thematic relevancy- as the locusts feed, they grow in size or volume- very smart!  I assume it works similarly to Viktor's Ultimate, actually, right?  No need to alt move- just re-cast Q and then left click.\n\nThe passive component of W is very, very strong.  Check out Teemo's similar passive for comparison... I imagine it should be about 30% weaker than that, lest this champion turn into an auto-attacker as his primary build path.  The active seems smart... I think?  It's very difficult for me to imagine due to the complex nature of the ability tied into his already somewhat complex passive.  I'm sure in execution it would be seamless to the user but from a mechanics standpoint, it's tough to wrap my head around.\n\nE is another very jam-packed and powerful ability with a lot going on.  I would consider reducing some of its hidden power by tying it specifically to dash to enemies; otherwise you open him up to having a dash that lets him go over walls and all that nonsense- something I think we need much less of in League overall, as it reduces the impact that the map environment has on positioning and team fights.\n\nThe ultimate is very cool thematically but I can't help but imagine it as being very similar in appearance and effect to Q and W, as well.  Overall there are a LOT of damage sources being doubled and tripled and augmented in different ways.  It's hard to say for sure but it seems like all these multipliers could get out of hand very quickly.  Be mindful of that.\n\nOverall I really like the theme of Cultos.  Some of the numbers seem a little out of hand but that's to be expected and I try not to judge harshly on that front (especially since I usually intentionally omit numbers from my own concepts for exactly this reason).  My biggest concern/complaint is that I just had a hard time envisioning all the interplay between his passive(s) and the rest of his abilities.

The passive should be nerfed but the concept will remain. The Q recast is a very smart idea, thank you! The w was a bit strong and i've tweaked it well stil keeping its wierdness that i like about it. I hadn't thought about e, it just seemed like and ability that did alot. With the double giving movement speed, the e doesn't need to be and escape. I've taken you're advice, thanks again. The ult seems like an ability that is meant for blowing flashes, which ori and nunu already have. I dont want this ability to be like that. I'll have to make it more unique...FUN!
