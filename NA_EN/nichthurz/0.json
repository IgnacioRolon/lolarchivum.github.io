It takes really long to open the loading screen and then it'll take anything between 5-30 (sometimes even more) seconds until I can see all players and start actual loading.\r\nMy laptop's slow and certainly not made for gaming, but I don't have such problems with any other games or most applications I use and it's quite annoying to me. In Game my performance is just fine and my fps normally stay between 55-60fps on highest settings.\r\nThe old laptop I used before was from 2008, had several technical problems, was super slow when in the actual loading screen, but I got into the client and loading screen way faster and quite normally with it. \r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what I could do to have the client load and loading screen appear faster and without this weird kind of delay?\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nThis are the basic specs of this slow ass laptop:\r\ni5-4210U CPU @1,70Ghz\r\n4GB RAM\r\nNvidia Geforce 520M GT \r\n(feelsbadman, but man I can play Borderlands 2 fluently, so why I can't load the lol client properly? ._.)\r\n\r\nGreetings \r\nNichtHurz","replies":[{"poster":"Hakyzor","date":"2017-12-05T10:46:52.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The graphics card is the thing, Borderlands 2 runs on cpu power and you have that, but the graphics card is bad and cant load a whole game in a little time...","replies":[{"poster":"NichtHurz","date":"2017-12-05T19:21:28.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, problem solved.

There could be other issues causing this, but my bet is that this is a network issue that's failing to maintain a strong connection, which is needed to download game assets.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, and going through each step to rule out possibilities.

The ping I've had with these connections always was between 20-45ms ping (general WLAN problems not included).\nIt might have to do with too low amounts of RAM if it's a hardware problem (as said, my laptop's not too fast), but I've never had any comparable probems with other online games I play.\n\nI'll check the connection issues guide, but I don't believe it'll help. Maybe I just have to get a proper gaming pc again :p .","replies":[]}]}]}
