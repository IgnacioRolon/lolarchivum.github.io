When the game started I wondered why my fps were as low as 50, but didn't worry about. Then as soon as we meet in the middle they go down to 25 and then jump around drop lower to like 14 fps after a few minutes. It makes the game literally unplayable. Changing the settings to the lowest level makes no difference, pc is running smooth besides that and even restarting didn't change a thing.\r\n\r\nAny idea what could be happening here?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T03:20:40.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a couple different reasons for this happening, though, without your system logs, I'm taking a best guess based off of what has historically caused these issues.
