The countdown timer will not go forward and I will see no one pick or ban for a few minutes until either 1.) the client stops freezing, 2.) the actual game loads, or 3.) I'm booted for \"\"dodging.\"\"\r\nI've yet to get more than a 20 minute time penalty for my \"dodging,\" but it's been happening with such frequency that I'm afraid I'll eventually get much more hefty penalties.\r\n\r\nIs anyone else having these issues?? A way to fix it? It didn't happen when I first downloaded the beta or when I used the legacy client months ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Escru","date":"2017-03-06T03:21:13.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens to me frequently, my internet is fine because I alt-tab and go to different websites and play youtube videos just fine. \n\nIt can't be an internet issue on our end, Riot needs to look at what's going on with the internet traffic or ISP or w/e is appropriate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T17:44:15.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sudden freeze sounds like a connection problem that's cutting off, so you'll either get kicked off entirely or fail to load your masteries.
