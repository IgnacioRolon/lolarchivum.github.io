Jhin's weapon is powered by (or enhances) his own innate magic.  These are two very different forms of technology.  One is self-contained while the other functions as more of a focus for the wielder's own abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-07T22:13:11.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no Ionia's making hextech of their own.

Gold type was inlaid into the blackish-green metal. It spelled the smith's name: This detail spoke of its creator's pride and confidence. **It was not a Piltovian weapon** - those gaudy things that attempted to function with the minuscule amounts of magic available in those lands. This gun was made by a true forge master. Magic pulsed from its bronze, Ionian heart.\n\nOn that note I'm wondering if there are places beyond the Kashuri armories in Ionia actively working on hextech development. Would make some modicum of sense I feel.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-12-07T22:25:01.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FbVuNkf3,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-12-07T22:13:11.515+0000)\n>\n> Oh no Ionia&#x27;s making hextech of their own.

The really powerful (and expensive) stuff is made actual namestones.  Everything else uses the synthetic substitute that Clan Ferros invented.  Given how revolutionizing this technology is, it seems wildly unlikely that Clan Ferros would share a trade secret like that with anyone ever.  As far as I know, if anyone wants hexcrystals they have to go through Clan Ferros to get them.\n\nOr.\n\nY'know.\n\nGo murder some more crystal scorpions and make Skarner even more lonely.\n\nSo *if* Ionia is making hextech equipment (which is a specifically defined term now that we actually know what hexcrystals are) they would no doubt be forced to pay through the teeth for those synthetic crystals.\n\nBut why would they?\n\nJhin says it himself.  Ionia is *full* of magic.  Innate magic is *much* more common there.  If this new technology isn't simply acting as a focus for innate power, then whatever is power it probably isn't a hexcrystal, but some other magical power source native to Ionia and distinct from the false-namestones the Pilties use.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-07T22:40:27.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given Ionia's effectively adopting the powers from other areas but still being very much their own people I can see their approach to hextech being to create a different power source, potentially just straight out of the air or from the user. I can imagine Ionians looking at hexcrystals and figuring out a more elegant and natural form for such a power source, potentially imbuing the devices themselves and their materials with magic. It might not even be consistent since this is even newer technology to Ionia than Piltover, Zaun and Noxus.\n\nAlternatively they heard about the approach with the Brackern and said \"Hey we have creatures like that\" and began harvesting the native wildlife, sentient or not, for their innate magic that they could form in to something substantial with which to fuel their creations.\n\nDunno. We'll have to dive in to an Ionian hextech armory to see their methodology.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-12-07T22:51:22.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FbVuNkf3,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-07T22:40:27.314+0000)\n>\n> Dunno.

Since hexcrystals are what define hextech these days rather than it simply being vague 'magical technology'.  Just as you could have a ship run off a diesel engine or a nuclear reactor.  The same tool with the same purpose, but a diesel ship and a nuclear ship are quite different in their application.\n\nI really want to know how Ionia's new technology works compared to what Piltover creates.  Because IF Ionian tech requires innate magic to wield, that could have some very interesting story consequences in the event of stolen weapons.  And if Ionian tech needs heavy ambient magic to function, then that might cause a rude awakening when taking the gear elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-07T23:21:23.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If it isn't using hexcrystals, but something else, then it wouldn't really be hextech, would it? \n\nI wouldn't say so because it all falls in the realm of techmaturgy. I mean hell such a name implies that the whole concept of hextech is machinery that can do miracles. How it's specifically powered makes little difference since in the end it's all using magic, like how the ships all are powered by energy. Energy's just that, even if the origins are different. Magic's probably similar. Sure it has different shapes and forms when encountered in the world, but down to its base it's still magic.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-12-08T00:05:40.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FbVuNkf3,comment-id=0000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-07T23:21:23.581+0000)\n>\n> I wouldn&#x27;t say so because it all falls in the realm of techmaturgy.

I think 'techmaturgy' is a great generalist term for this stuff, machines that run on the principles of magic (whatever those might be, we still don't even know what magic IS in this setting =P) rather than the laws of motion and thermodynamics.  Hextech with hexcrystals, whatever the heck Ionion techmaturgy is because whatever it runs on.\n\nI'm just one of those silly people who likes to precisely define things.  That's why I made that 'what the hell is magic?' topic I did months ago.  Understanding how a setting works at its most basic levels tells you a lot about the nature of the setting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-12-07T22:42:41.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all the cool stuff I've found in the map and Piltover lore.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_osjZVy2Ug","replies":[]}]}
