Have you ever actually played alistar or are you theorizing because you clearly have no idea what the hell you're talking about. I don't build gold generation items because to make up for them I have 5.3 gp5 in runes, it gives a much better survival ratio and a heavier lead which by the way leads to a lot less gold wasted and more generated in the long run.

Meanwhile, he can proc Thunderlord's Decree with a Q and basic attack with passive for additional burst when harassing.\n\nAlistar's heal is AoE so Windspeaker's Blessing lets him provide an armor and MR buff to his team during fights similar to Locket of the Iron Solari.  Grasp of the Undying is inefficient since you won't be in combat long enough to activate it frequently during laning phase and there are better options during teamfights.\n\nGold generation runes make you more squishy early-game than defensive runes and they provide less gold generation that the support items at all stages of the game provided you proc them competently.\n----------------------\nYeah, I managed to hit Platinum last season by not knowing how every role works and being able to competently fill them when necessary.  \n\nAs if.\n---------------------\nHonestly, if your \"build\" were as effective as you seem to believe it is, it would be the meta build.\n\nIt is not.  \n\nPlayers far better than you or I have determined that the current meta builds are the **m**ost **e**ffective **t**actics **a**vailable.\n------------------\nHowever, don't mind me.\n\nYou do you.\n\nSee how far that gets you.

If you aren't, you are an idiot since it provides additional free gold generation.  At that point, Flat Hybrid Pen or CDR with Thunderlord's Decree is better than percentage magic penetration for most of the game.\n\nYou don't take Winderspeaker's Blessing on Alistar to increase the value of his heal; you take it to provide additional resistances to your entire team and mitigate damage.  As  I had previously explained if you are incapable of reading.\n----------------------\nFace of the Mountain provides more sustain than Ruby Crystal (for both you and the ADC) after you have proc'ed it twice and gives you an additional potion.  Ancient Coin provides more sustain after 30 minions die and Spellthief's Edge provides more gold and damage than the alternatives.\n\nBut please, tell me how 5 GP/10, Ruby Crystal (150HP) and 2 Potions makes you more durable than 12 Armor (Quints), 72 Health (Seals), Relic Shield (70HP, 40 heal per proc) and 3 Potions.\n\nIt's hilarious.\n------------------\nHere, have a nice resource which can show how Platinum+ players typically build: http://champion.gg/\n\nIt won't help you much if you can't understand something as obvious as the above, but it might let you know how to build until you learn the basics.","replies":[{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2016-05-10T14:15:55.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guy stop talking, you have literally no games played with any supports of whom you speak, NONE, so stfu, you really don't know anything about supports other when what you've read, all you play it top meta champs that require 0 skill because they're all /faceroll right now.

Zyra is way different then janna for one thing her main defense is instant, you root them instantly it doesnt take 3 seconds to wind up, second her plants make it very easy for her to never actually engage directly, she stays at a nice distance while they do all the damage, finally she doesn't heal in any way shape or form.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Master Yiseeks","date":"2015-11-11T23:58:59.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you SEEN Soraka and Sona?!","replies":[{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2015-11-12T00:27:43.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I main sona, so yes I've seen them and played them.","replies":[{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-11-13T04:39:52.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pick better masteries m8","replies":[{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2015-11-14T00:03:32.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've picked the only masteries available for a AP support, despite rito trying to make it seem like you have choices, you really don't.
