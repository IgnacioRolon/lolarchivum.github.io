While that was far from a perfect system it was tolerable. It was reasonably ok, but now they have gotten rid of people entirely, your conversations DO NOT get reviewed, if you are reported in a row the system will autoban you, and here&#039;s the funny part, it will give you the conversation you had in those 3 games. Now you look at the conversation for all the games and there isn&#039;t even a swear word in there, no bullying, just basic talk. It becomes very clear that they are nothing but bot banning. So say goodbye to your accounts because any report at all will stack up until you get banned out of the game.\n\n\nGame 1\nTactrix: good for us\nTactrix: bad for them\nTactrix: lol yea\nTactrix: no we are blue side\nTactrix: nj\nTactrix: nj\nTactrix: wtb tank who actually fuckin tanks\nTactrix: malph thats twice in a row they went in on us and u just stood there\nTactrix: should what?\nTactrix: speak english\nTactrix: really what\nTactrix: i did nearly full dmg to him\nTactrix: report him\nTactrix: not my fault ur gonna get banned after this game\nTactrix: by being a worthless player\nTactrix: everyone report him for no coop with team\nTactrix: and toxic\nTactrix: plz report malph completely useless and refuses to play with team\nTactrix: we only blamed you for what was your fault not on us if you suck\nTactrix: how many times did u gank bot?\nTactrix: oh tahts right none\nTactrix: he talks a lot since he doesnt actually do anything in the game, he can run his mouth all game instead\nTactrix: keep talking malph its all ur good for\nTactrix: we dont have a team\nTactrix: we have 4 people\nTactrix: 2 of whome spend the whole game crying\nTactrix: because malph is too retareded to play\nTactrix: and nid is just too focused on feeding them all\nTactrix: LOL look at chmp dmg at the end of the game fail malph\nTactrix: and then shut ur mouth and go back to bots where u belong\nTactrix: thats the problem ur not playing as a tank\nTactrix: ur just sitting back and doing nothing\nTactrix: see what i mean\nTactrix: hes the tank that sits in the back\nTactrix: doesnt ult\nTactrix: does do shit\nTactrix: just sits behind our entire line\nTactrix: and does nothing\nTactrix: the second u stop feeding the enemy team\nTactrix: malph compared to u everyone is amazing\nTactrix: those minions are amazing\nTactrix: hey malph if u spent as much time playing as u do running ur mouth u might win ever\nTactrix: yea because u play 2 games a year\nTactrix: and get carried in 1 of them\nTactrix: report malph toxic and worthless\n\nGame 2\nTactrix: so support poppy\nTactrix: should be fun\nTactrix: we dont actually have a wall to get hit into\nTactrix: so that will be easy\nTactrix: we dont have a top now\nTactrix: saving for a BF?\nTactrix: have u ever even played trist before?\nTactrix: yea i have\nTactrix: which is why i have kills while u dont\nTactrix: u didnt even ult\nTactrix: u werent CCed they hit me\nTactrix: close\nTactrix: ok and u just sit there while they destroy sion\nTactrix: ...\nTactrix: nj\nTactrix: no do something\nTactrix: do AA\nTactrix: anything to try to help\nTactrix: heres the lesson you should take away from all this\nTactrix: dont play ranked\nTactrix: go do a bunch of normals\nTactrix: because u have no clue how to adc\nTactrix: yup just keep feeding its what ur good at\nTactrix: 5 times?\nTactrix: because u seem to have a lot of excuses\nTactrix: no skill\nTactrix: but a lot of excuses\nTactrix: take ur own advice\nTactrix: yes u do sound like a retard\nTactrix: lol when the person whos so bad at ADC they don't know that they're bad tries to talk its hilarious\nTactrix: no you'd be way worse\nTactrix: you could be as bad as u are\nTactrix: meanwhile trist does... nothing\nTactrix: as usual\nTactrix: u werent at base\nTactrix: but nice try liar\nTactrix: i just saw u at the turret\nTactrix: whatever liar\nTactrix: i have some\nTactrix: unlike ur dumb ass\nTactrix: who cant even do anything\nTactrix: yea can you spell loser? because thats what u are\nTactrix: easy\nTactrix: your playing\nTactrix: yea i know\nTactrix: gg report trist for being toxic and useless\nTactrix: its a fact you are useless\n\nGame 3\nTactrix: for u dying?\nTactrix: u died on your own\nTactrix: it had nothing to do with me\nTactrix: no u died because u went in afterward against 3\nTactrix: thats on u\nTactrix: thats because u play in bronze\nTactrix: go for it\nTactrix: nj varus\nTactrix: guys its retard varus, its called a hybrid u moron\nTactrix: yea when urs adc goes mid because hes uselss sure lets call it feeding 1v2\nTactrix: you are bronze\nTactrix: you\nTactrix: do you?\nTactrix: is still crying?\nTactrix: i muted him ages ago\nTactrix: gg\n\nThose are the chat logs.","replies":[{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2016-10-20T00:39:36.377+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Incorrect: the automated system reviews your games and makes strikes against you.","replies":[{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2016-10-20T00:42:50.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"And how exactly does it review your games? it doesn't because it's a bot, it's obvious when you feed but beyond that it literally does nothing but count the complaints against you and autobans.

If punishments for starting a fight were in any way different from the punishments for joining in or reacting to inflammatory behavior, then the bot would have to be better able to read context.

This is your reform card and no one elses, and it's your actions alone that led you to this point. It doesn't matter if someone else started it, you got punished because you retaliated negatively. In the future if someone refuses to stop acting up then just mute, report and move on. Doing this ensures that you don't get punished for something that you didn't do. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nFrom [Riot Tantram](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/unobngtr-how-player-behavior-penalties-affect-hextech-crafting?show=rundown): \n\n>Actually, Erdrik is correct here.\n\n>A report flags a game for review.

All of this is stuff that you are blaming rather than looking at your own reactions. You aren't taking any responsibility for your actions.
