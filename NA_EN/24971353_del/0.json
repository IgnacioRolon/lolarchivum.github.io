We can't adjust stats or LP, but I'd like to help get the issue resolved.  Unless you have any third party programs running, your issue might be caused by a network problem that's failing to receive your selection, and ultimately leaving you behind.  You should run through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this.
