Do whatever is fun for you... If you like the game for the playing aspect, keep your account safe and play the game. If you like it for the social aspect, enjoy it until your account is banned and move on. Completely your choice and no one can tell you how to have fun. You just do you.

Also if someone else is flaming/being toxic you should just mute them and report them after the game that would be the no.1 solution. Being toxic is not beneficial in boosting your team's will in winning the game but rather demolishing it. Just keep it simply, say GL HF then mute every player in the game :) GL in your games !","replies":[]}]}
