HOWEVER, every time I try to play a game of league, it always gets super laggy and becomes unplayable. This happened for the past 2 days and I really don't know how to fix this issue, since I would restart my internet and it would still lag, but i could still go on youtube and everything would be fine. Please give me suggestions on what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"HighWard","date":"2017-04-11T21:55:22.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's been a few days and it's getting better.
