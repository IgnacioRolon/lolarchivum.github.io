I am making this post because I am sick of my client crashing during ranked champ select. I recetly lost 2 promo games due to my client crashing in champ select. It just frustrates me way too much to get 2/0 in my promos to silver then lose 3 straight games to crashing clients. I'm just sick of this, anyone else have this problem recently?","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-07-25T23:08:00.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reinstall the client","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T20:30:49.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashing during promos definitely sounds frustrating, and I'd like to help!  Can you provide some more details about the crashes that you're having?  Are you receiving any errors for examples, or provide some information on what is happening and at which point?  This can help me figure out what's going on so I can offer some solutions.  Looking forward to hearing back!","replies":[{"poster":"TrueeMu","date":"2016-07-25T18:52:09.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response and I appologize for such a late response on my end. When I go into champ select the menu doesn't load fully, I don't get any error codes but some of the text won't be there, I won't be able to see who my teamates selected, then when someone either bans or selects a champion the client just closes\nEdit:  I've also recently had this problem with crafting masteries, I recently got mastery 7 with veigar and when I clicked forge the client just closed itself again, I didn't lose my mastery or the essence I used but it was frustrating having to go through everything again\n","replies":[]}]}]}
