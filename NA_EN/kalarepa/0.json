Taric got owned by Janna. Nunu also by Yasuo and Lux. Braum by Shaco. I'm just skimming through my match history here. About half of them counter your claim. The other half are tank vs. tank or squishy vs. squishy and don't relate.\n\nSo far my entire experience shows the outcome is dependent on two things:\n\na) The SPECIFIC champ matchup. Not types of champs.\nb) How much your teammates feel like derping out constantly, which so far, I've found they do more in this game mode than most. Shocker.\n\nYou must have just gotten some bad SPECIFIC champ-v-champ matchups. And were probably stuck with players who don't understand counterbuilding in this game mode (which is far different from any other game mode, and yet, doesn't govern 90% of players. Half of who would probably be perfectly willing to spam-rage meta strategy in regular queues, but will only put half a thought into what works in a new game mode, where no one has yet told them what to do.
