Not to mention the constant bombardment of hate speech, foul mouthed talking about my mother and family. An absolute joke. Absolutely no notice of them being banned (as was typical the handful of times people I reported actually got punished). Riot may as well just dig in my pocket and steal from me. 9 out of every 10 games have people leaving, afking or spending the entirety of the match spouting homophobic or racial slurs and they take no issue with that. \r\nAbsolute rip-off.\r\nDO NOT INVEST ANY MONEY IN THIS GAME.\r\nPlay something else where you won&#039;t have to listen to vile hatred being spewed and they can&#039;t just absolutely steal product from you when they deem your cusswords too offensive cause some hateful troll wants to punish you for arguing back at them.
