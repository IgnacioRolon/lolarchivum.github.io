(Rather Important!!)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":16,"down_votes":8,"body":"I feel as if this is an important topic considering the fact that I noticed that some of the players were going after the developers, threatening them and making them feel unsafe??? The developers put up contact information so that players can contact them about bugs and ideas to try and make the game better. Players shouldn&#039;t be rude and threatening towards the devs, as they are doing their best to provide a fun and rather exciting experience in the gameplay and in the community.  Everyone should respect the devs as well as their fellow players in game. Players that are all around toxic to everyone are the reason as to why my fianc&eacute; doesn&#039;t like to play PVP much. And it explains why most of the rioters seemed to have changed their usernames and such on sites like Twitter, they seem to feel unsafe. Disagree if you want, but the Rioters have most of the power to remove accounts, so people should really treat them with respect. They are there for the community, not for people to make their lives terrible. _**PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL!**_ That is all. Enjoy your day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-11-11T14:15:29.118+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":5,"body":"Did you make a little announcement for Rioters too?
