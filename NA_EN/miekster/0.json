And while it's not because of any driver updates that could be doing it, new hardware, change in configurations/settings or anything, it's just been crashing once every few days.\r\n\r\nSo now, because it crashes during the champion select (I'd like to point out this is on multiple computers too, so it appears to be a software related thing and not a singular cause such as the PC it's self), I get punished for abandoning games?\r\n\r\nNow, while this may be a great excuse to \"take a break\", get out, go outside, or whatever.  When I log on to play a game for the very first time that day, and it crashes in the first game I get into during the champ select, and since it's been crashing... I know have a 15 minutes or even longer wait time til I can queue up?\r\n\r\nCan Riot not put in a better protocol to detect if a player dodged, compared to if their own client is crashing?  At this rate, we are being punished because of something that isn't our fault.  I would normally just ignore it and move on with my life, but given that it is happening consistently now ,and I'm constantly being punished for a longer and longer time, it's turning into an issue.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2016-05-09T23:12:44.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also thought I'd report, every once in a while I still get the 'black screen instead of champ select' when i queue, and then as a result get queue timer. This doesn't happen often but a couple weeks ago it happened like 4 times. I have recently reinstalled LoL completely about 2 months before that. It may or may not be related.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-09T23:01:26.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an aside, we generally leverage these queue timers to give time for the errors to clear up or be fixed.  Normally it's just a one-off here and there and not a huge deal, but if you're running into these types of issues, we *want* you to reach out to us so we can help resolve the issues so you're not continuously waiting 15+ minutes to enter queue.\n\nNow, as to the problem at hand: Depending on where in champion select you're actually crashing (before champ select begins or after it ends) the cause could be slightly different, but these types of issues are usually caused by an error in the connection between your network and our game servers.\n\nI don't see that you've submitted a ticket before, so as a beginning step, I'd recommend checking out our [Connection Troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and following the steps in there.  It gives some quick solutions to the most common causes of connection errors and, if it isn't fixed,  gives us information to help continue to troubleshoot :) Let me know if it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Blitzzor","date":"2016-05-09T23:02:40.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/j2m2JyRq-i-cant-get-into-a-game?comment=0006 please take a look at this, ive found a lot of people having the same issues, but no one from riot has addressed this in a few days, not complaining, just trying to be proactive.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-09T23:07:35.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
