Black screen and error message.\r\nI have tried making 1vs1 bot matches and same problem.\r\nThe bitch of it is that it first happened last night just as I was trying to start a 5v5 pvp match.","replies":[{"poster":"Goston","date":"2015-10-20T16:35:58.090+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue, its completely ridiculous that this is happening. The whole time my internet connection is flawless, can open web browsers and log in with 0 issues, but loading screen keeps on doing the same thing. No matter how many times I try, just the same thing and no matter what I do it results in a loss and a leave for my account. This is very frustrating and I hope Riot can at the very least look into this issue or acknowledge that they are aware its happening. I will keep my eye out for any info on this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pickled Egg","date":"2015-10-20T16:35:34.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUMP. . .same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-21T23:57:18.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may want to write in a ticket then if the KB didn't help.
