My map awareness was on point, I made excellent calls on drake, my ganks were perfect, and I peeled for adc and got our vayne fed, i was quite pleased\r\n\r\nNext game im determined to win another and I go top. We get an afk yasuo that absolutely ruined the game, but because he wasnt fully dc'ed( it was going on and off) the /remake option didnt appear (This bronze is absolutely depressing, last game i had to /remake because of afk) this time the option didnt even appear so we fought a 4v5. To make matters worse my lane opponent took jayce ( I was riven) I roamed got a few kills but even with an afk bot lane fed super hard. As did the jungler. I think it was for the best that mid was afk in the first place\r\n\r\nIts unfair on players like me to have to suffer. Not because of feeders, no i can handle those, but because the 'Remake' option does not appear for afk's at the beginning of the game\r\n\r\nIt made me incredibly sad that after adapting a good low elo mentality, playing well and carrying the next game i lose because of afk\r\n\r\n{{champion:32}} {{item:3073}} {{champion:32}} \r\n\r\nI just hope its not like this in mid - high elo\r\nBut the worst part is reports do nothing so this player will continue to ruin games","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T04:35:22.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The /Remake System marks any player that is inactive for 90 or more seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match. If any player is marked, the remake goes to a vote after 3 minutes and needs 30% of the team in order to pass. If for some reason, someone wasn't inactive long enough to be marked by the system, a remake will not be available for the map. I strongly recommend checking out our [/Remake FAQ ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ)for complete details on how the system works.\n\nReporting this player was definitely the correct action to take, as reports **do** help us prioritize who to look at. Note that even if you don't see direct results from someone going AFK, any continuing trends of them disconnecting could land them in a low-priority queue as a penalty. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
