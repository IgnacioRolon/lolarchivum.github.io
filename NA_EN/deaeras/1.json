You have no armor and the shield is not going to save you due to it actually rapidly decaying the instant it is activated. So unless the shield is activated by Zed's ult damage you will just die. Why not actually go for something like Randuins or Sunfire or Deadman's? at least they will give you some armor along with the HP so that will help mitigate his damage somewhat and like i said a damn Bloodthrister would have been better than Steraks since the shield doesn't decay and you get a bunch of lifesteal to try and lifesteal your way through his combo. You can keep building steraks, it's a terrible item against anyone that does delayed damage","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-01-29T07:18:01.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably better off with a ga instead of steraks.
