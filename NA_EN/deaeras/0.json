It's been happening for a year but I'm posting now because suddenly it's happening every 30 seconds and I can't even get into a game. I have uninstalled League 3 times, Riot support has given me a bunch of stuff I've tried that have had no effect, and it's really pissing me off at this point. Can anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T02:51:07.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're already working with a tech specialist on this, I recommend continuing to work with us in your ticket. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
