But I don&#039;t get toxic, unless someone blatantly calls me out, or fails to do what I told them to do several times. Game 1: Jayce loses lane to Tryndamere, by screwing himself over roaming down mid and taking enemy jungle camps when he should be farming his own lane, puts himself behind. Proceeds to blame our jungler, says he&#039;s not going to go top anymore, and roams mid to take my CS. I get pissed off at this, because he&#039;s actively losing us the game, as there&#039;s literally no one else to deal with Tryndamere. Eventually I carry the shit out of that game, and we win. Jayce receives no punishments or anything for griefing, simply because he wasn&#039;t &quot;toxic&quot;. Game 2: Bot feeds hella bad, I don&#039;t say a word. Suddenly Sivir calls me out for losing first tower to a Teemo, as Sion, when I ulted bot 3 times to help bot lane. Then proceeds to say that I single-handedly lost us the game, because there&#039;s no way 4/7/3 Sivir or the 0/5 Blitzcrank  are causing their Vayne to pop off like crazy, no it&#039;s the 1/2/4 Sion who lost lane to Teemo that&#039;s at fault, and before you say &quot;just mute her&quot; that&#039;s a fucking bitch&#039;s move. I&#039;m not gonna take shit from some Bronze 3 asshole who thinks they know the game better than I do, and calls me out for no reason. Game 3: I decided to listen to my teammates for once. I&#039;m fed AF on Ryze, they tell me to splitpush to distract, so I do. I go top and 2v1 for a double kill, and then proceed to die to Darius and Maokai. Team does nothing, I say nothing. Later someone suggests that Yasuo should splitpush, I say no because the kid&#039;s absolute trash, and behind as all hell, and group with the team for a few fights, which we all lose because someone got caught early. Later it&#039;s 5v5 and I split top again to distract, and they send 4 top again. Rather than push mid or bot, they roam up to try and save me, lose the fight, and then they get baron. I ask them if they don&#039;t know how to play vs Gangplank, because obviously they think his barrels are little sunshine bubbles, and they get all super pissed off at me. So they proceed to call me out, saying my splitpushing lost us the game, which they all asked me to do, and when I get defensive towards myself, I&#039;m the one who deserves a report, not any of the people who called me out. I believe that the justice system in place in this game is total bullshit. I should not be punished more severely for defending myself, simply because I&#039;m more savage, honest, and I swear more than the guy that calls me out. People who instigate the fight should have the same responsibility over their actions,  if not more then the person who defends himself. Things like harsh language shouldn&#039;t be judged at all, and things like brutal honesty should be taken with a grain of salt. I&#039;m not gonna sit there and feed lies to my team, because then I&#039;m just sugarcoating the situation, and that does fuck all for winning a game. I&#039;m not gonna tell the 0/4 in lane Yasuo that &quot;he&#039;ll get him next time!&quot; No I&#039;m gonna tell him to back the fuck up, play safe, and let the other lanes win and stop feeding, AND I&#039;m gonna get reported for saying that, because being honest with someone regarding their skill level, is toxic apparently. And don&#039;t say that I could drop it nicer, because welcome to the real word jackass. There&#039;s no justice system when your boss calls you a fucking retard for not doing the job you were supposed to, there&#039;s no justice system in place for that random old lady on the bus who proceeds to call you a &quot;disrespectful youth from a bad generation.&quot; There&#039;s no justice system for that random guy on the street who calls you a &quot;fucking n*gger&quot; There&#039;s none of that. League of Legends isn&#039;t Club Penguin, people need to learn to take some shit, instead of just sucking Riot&#039;s dick hoping for a report. I will accept this chat restriction, as it was deserved, but those other assholes who proceeded to be as toxic as I was, got off easy because they weren&#039;t as much of a savage as I was, and they get to keep their chat, and they get to keep their Loot Box privileges, because that&#039;s fair, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nDeaeras: wtf\r\nDeaeras: whats this
