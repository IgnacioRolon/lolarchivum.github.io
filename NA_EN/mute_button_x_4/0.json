I would just like to know if such a problem is known to exist so I an quit trying to download it for tonight.

Getting stuck at 0% during patching usually indicates that League doesn't have the right privileges in order to scan your League directory before it starts grabbing files (after 32%). I'd recommend you [**configure your permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) for League in case this was the exact cause.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mute Button X 4","date":"2016-12-14T02:48:05.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also understand the common answer to this is 'It takes a long time to download'.
