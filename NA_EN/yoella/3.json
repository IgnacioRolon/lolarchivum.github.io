What if...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Veigar has two major problems right now. The first is the fact that his passive is absolutely awful, not to mention boring and nearly unnoticeable. The second problem is that his early game is abhorrently bad. I mean this guy is a squishy among squishies, a bruised peach among coconuts, soggy bread among a flock of geese. He&#039;s **squishy**. Not to mention he&#039;s completely immobile and no longer has a reliable stun. _(About the stun, I know it sucks in lane now but it&#039;s usable in teamfights and honestly was broken in it&#039;s original state)_. This is how I might fix both of those problems at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhat if his passive had something to give it a little kick in the pants? You know, to make it really feel like it&#039;s even there. What if Veigar was also given a mini-Morgana passive. 3/6/9% spellvamp. It would be such a small amount that it would take considerable time to heal you up, but would give him sustain in lane without making him harder to kill if you go all in. The recovery would also give you a low level of interaction with the passive, which is better than it just being tacked on there.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-20T09:23:32.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 60% AP) UP TO MAGIC DAMAGE: 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 / 260 (+ 60% AP)","replies":[{"poster":"DrCabes","date":"2015-04-20T18:47:47.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This ^ would be a nice buff","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-20T18:52:03.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course that its!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-04-20T08:29:42.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive is better than it seems, but not noticeable late game.\n{{item:3027}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3152}} \nThis ends up being my build late game most of the time.\nRod of Ages gives some decent baseline durability while WotA gives me great sustain late game, and if an assassin jumps me, I can often save myself with the shield from archangel's.\n\nNot saying Veigar doesn't need a buff, though.
