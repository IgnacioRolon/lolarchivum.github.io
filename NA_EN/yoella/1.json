Makes sense for there to be Teemo top, but I don't think there will be too many team comps with Anivia and Fizz / Talon.\n\nBut this does bring up an interesting point about whether it's worse if your own team or the enemy team makes fun of your champion pick...\n\n\nBack on topic.\n\nWell, champions like Darius and Xin are simple to play mechanically, but it won't be easy to play them against experienced opponents who know what to do against them. Darius is extremely vulnerable to kiting and his Q will push lane quite a bit, and Xin does not have any escape abilities where he will basically have to flash to escape if he goes in and things don't go well. And I guess there just aren't as many Darius and Xin players as back when before they got nerfed where people played them because they were OP (I don't think Darius was ever over powered, though).\n\nIn terms of Anivia, well, she is a champion with a kind of high skill floor, where it's not too difficult to do decently with her, but her Q and wall does have very, very high skill ceiling (and I guess a very high skill floor for her Q).\n\nBut really, though, Anivia is a champion that needs to have a strong front line to peel for her. She has low movement speed and low health, where if the other team baits out the Q, she will be busted down very quickly. Unless you are just landing crazy Q's and walls and getting solo kills, your front line must have been doing something right to peel for you or to draw attention by going for their carries.\n\nThe Xin and Darius probably should have had better sportsmanship, but they probably made some good calls and made some good plays, even if they are relatively straightforward in terms of mechanics...","replies":[{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-10-31T01:13:15.257+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius with his full ult reset (no time limit, just a full CD reset if he got a kill) was a tad op. \n\n-hits 6\n-dunks lane opponent\n-lane opponent gets back, dunk was never on cd, gets dunked\n\nBasically if he got ahead, it wasn't even worth going back to the lane unless you were ranged, or your jungler brought a tent.","replies":[{"poster":"JunkÎ¿","date":"2014-10-31T17:16:46.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Another reason Darius had the full reset (and the mercy reset) removed was because Darius players would just take every kill with it and starve the rest of the team from gold (and since he serves no other role than being a tank late game, that was a problem)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2014-10-31T03:04:20.346+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"My team was Darius top, Xin jungle, Anivia (Me) mid, Nami support and Trist bot. Their team was GP top, Fiddle jungle, Akali mid, and Ashe and Thresh bot.\n\nI was almost completely denying Akali CS with my Q (I'm pretty good with it) through pokes, and once I reached level 4 I was about to use my e to finish off the ~90 health she had left when Xin flashes ahead of me out of the bush and steals it \"so he can get ahead\" as he put it. Keep in mind I did all the damage myself, he only showed up for the KS. So I recalled to heal and I TPd back to my lane and farmed. Eventually I won my lane and at this point Darius is like 4/1/0 and Xin was 2/2/1 and we had won all but bot lane which was more or less a draw, both sides lost the tower within 2 minutes of eachother. So then we get to teamfighting and I get several assists with my R and Q and I wall to secure a few kills/escapes for the team and I even get a kill myself during all this. At this point Darius stops teamfighting and farms alone for a while, killing a few gankers and gets pretty fed. Meanwhile Xin, Trist, Nami, and I are still fighting together.\n\nSo this continues pretty similarly for a while until Darius comes back, and I'm fine getting a lot of assists because I like to help my team. However, on 4 other occasions I'm about to land the killing blow on someone and Xin flashes or rushes in to steal it. That's what pissed me off, not the teamfights but the fact that I'm about 1/2/16 and this guy is still taking my kills. I don't like to be toxic to my team so I bite my tongue and tell him to \"cool it\". About 3 minutes after that this Xin (who's been acting like he was invincible the whole game despite his 7/6/6 score) charges into dragon to steal it at 3/4th health, and he's charging right into Ashe, Gangplank, and Fiddle like it's nothing. Meanwhile I'm in the bushes between Red and the 2nd mid tower and I see him do this and I move as fast as my frozen ass can to try and Q stun the guys and wall them so he can escape (Because any rational person wouldn't dive into that mess) and to my dismay he runs straight into them and attacks Gangplank, not Ashe or Fiddle... GANGPLANK. Realizing he screwed up he attempts to retreat and I land my Q on Ashe and Fiddle as Xin turns around but Ashe quickly shoots off that 5 arrow slow of hers and GP ulties. I still use my wall to block them, but Fiddle flashes over the wall and uses that leech life thingy on him and kills him. I plop down my ulti so I can escape, but Xin then goes on all chat and calls me a useless teammate. So then I just told him off as it is, and then I told him that at least I'm playing someone with a skill level over 15. He had no response to that, and he was silent for a while after that but DAMN it pissed me off. He ended 8/8/9. 5 of those were my kills....","replies":[{"poster":"Joker775","date":"2014-11-06T19:05:13.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey if u are good at anivia. do u have any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2014-11-06T21:15:42.669+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I sure do. I'm not sure of your skill level with her so I'll just do a broad spectrum of tips unless you tell me what you specifically want.\n\nFirst thing you've got to know is that Anivia has a maximum skill level for a reason, she's potentially amazing but can also be a major drain on your own team.\n\n1) Your W wall can block most jungle paths at skill level 2 if placed correctly, you can use this to help your jungler turn around a jung v jung fight or help your team escape a chase. Your wall can also block Sions ultimate. **Be careful with your wall, it has a small cast time so place it slightly ahead of an enemy, and take extra care not to trap your own team behind it.** Your wall can turn a game on its head when used correctly, but can be a total toss if used poorly. If your wall is placed directly on top of an enemy channeling an ability it will interrupt them.\n\n2) Your Q is your best friend. It's your primary damage, your stun, and your main escape all in one. Anivia's Q takes some practice and skill to aim, as it's a slow projectile with a fairly long range. Aiming it is something you really have to teach yourself through experience, however I can tell you to take advantage of it whenever you can. **Your Q can do 2x damage to an enemy and stun them. When the projectile goes through an enemy it deals damage once, and when you detonate it by pressing Q again it will deal the same damage again in an AoE slightly larger than the projectile itself. So let it pierce an enemy, and then detonate. Do not detonate unless it hits them first for maximum damage.** Reading the enemy's movements and aiming ahead of them in conjunction to the above is crucial for Anivia and separates the average from the great.\n\n3) If you are being chased you have 3 options: You can send back your Q and stun the pursuers, if you're in a jungle or at a river entrance you can wall it off with W, and if all else fails or your enemies are too far out to stun with Q you can plop your Ultimate (R) behind you and usually get away.\n\n4) Your E is amazing. Truly this ability is what makes Anivia a cold feathered killer. And the best part is everyone underestimates it. It's well known that your E will do double damage to an enemy recently hit by your Q or R but most people don't realize how much damage they'll take with your full combo wombo. Double hit and stun them with Q, keep approaching and hit them with E. Next follow up immediately with your R (they should be running away from you by now most of the time, if they chase you and you cannot kill them, wall and run) and after placing your R if you are close enough and have a chance use your W wall to make them walk *sideways* out of your R, as this gives you an extra tick or two of damage and your Q might be off CD by now to do it all over again.\n\n5) My starting build is a {{item:1027}} sapphire crystal and potions, then I build {{item:3070}} Tear out of that and then I rush {{item:3020}} Sorcerers Shoes for the magic pen. This gives me some extra umph in lane. Next I build {{item:3003}} Archangel's Staff out of Tear for the mana regen, extra AP, and the shield that comes later when it reaches 700 bonus mana. Next, and this is **crucial**, build {{item:3151}} Liandry's Torment as fast as you can. I cannot stress this enough. Liandry's will turn you R into a swirling vortex of frozen death. It will make you do immeasurably more damage. After Liandry's I usually go for {{item:3023}} Twin Shadows for the combined CDR, Movement Speed, AP, and the extra slowing ghosts it sends out when activated. It can also be used to discover a gank if you suspect you're being watched, as it seeks out the nearest 2 enemy champions and slows and reveals them. By this point I've often already won, but if it drags on I pick up {{item:3089}} Rabadon's for the AP, and either {{item:3001}} Abyssal Sceptre for the magic resist and penetration, or {{item:3157}} Zhonya's for the armor and active. The last two are situational.\n\nAnd with that I'm out of text space on this post lol. Anything else? Egg tips?

The op played it off well and didn't chew Xin out. It wasn't until Xin complained about him/her that the OP responded. It isn't about a KS issue alone. It's the whole picture that matters. The combination of the Xin player denying the OP the full gold amount s/he rightfully should have earn t and then saying that s/he is useless.

Xin obviously used this flawed scoring system to make a false claim.\n\nI have my own way to judge how good a person did, I take their kills as one point, deaths as -1 and assists at .5. So by the end game, someone who has 4/5/18 (would be 8 points) did better then someone who is 6/2/6 (only 7 points). that's how i judge how people did in a game. \n\nThe underlying issue though comes with the last hit mechanism... For minion kills that mechanism is great, For any transferring of buffs, it's great, but for determining who deserves the kill it sucks. For this they would need to change the system to who dealt more damage to the single target. The one who dealt the most would get the credit for the kill, the one who dealt the final blow would get any buffs the target champion had.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sirin Gioro","date":"2014-10-31T20:50:31.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, the picture is adorable. 8)\nAnivia carry!","replies":[]},{"poster":"S0NA","date":"2014-11-15T23:14:12.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, but it's even funnier when the enemy Fizz you shut down says this.\n\nAnd refuses to acknowledge that he lost because he only knows how to kill Jayces and Zeds.","replies":[]}]}
