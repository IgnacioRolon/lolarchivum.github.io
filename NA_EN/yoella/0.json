Also, why are they in your top three? They don't need to be in meta or even good, just something you play often enough and enjoy.\n\nMine are as follows:\n\nNumber One: {{champion:45}} Veigar. Because it's so rewarding to farm 100 AP and think to yourself \"Sweet, I have bonus AP as if I had a Rylai's\", or \"damn, my deathcap is gonna make my power SPIKE!\". It's also pretty satisfying to stun someone for 2 seconds and kill them before they even know what happened or to save your whole team from a teamfight gone wrong with a well placed fleeing stun. I play this guy all the time, he's extremely fun to play with, albeit he's usually boring to just watch. I mean, check this out.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1FviIJY.jpg\nThat's 19/0/7 by the way ;)\n\nNumber Two: {{champion:30}} Karthus. Not very many people realize how powerful and fun this guy is, especially once he gets his RoA. His E is very strong, and with his passive he can wreck face even after death. His Q also hits like a truck lategame, talk about a fantasy. I also enjoy ulting fleeing opponents, and then regenerating Mana by killing minions as they rage at me in all chat.\n\nNumber Three: {{champion:17}} Teemo. Yes, I said I enjoy playing as Satan. There's something about going stealth in lane, and then ambushing your opponent the moment after they step on a shroom. Just having that global taunt that makes everybody wanna kill you... ah it's so satisfying when they can't.","replies":[{"poster":"Strzyga","date":"2015-01-03T09:15:41.547+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:77}} Because of his ability to make plays and carry games single handedly if played correctly\n{{champion:107}} Despite his long history of nerfs, his ultimate combined with his insane burst essentially gives him a free kill and can gurantee a teamfight victory if used right(also his Nighthunter skin makes him into NightCrawler)(Also his theme of being a predator makes you feel like a badass)\n{{champion:63}} Cuz If you kill a teemo you can use his dance to dance around the burning corpse of Satan \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LyRPUUX.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-01-03T16:28:03.397+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}}  thank you for your contribution (gif)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yulen Xoshxius","date":"2015-01-04T21:28:57.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This gif is wonderful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HyperZEROXL","date":"2015-01-05T00:03:31.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ROFL XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwoD","date":"2015-01-04T05:53:46.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAHALMAO","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2015-01-03T07:01:21.314+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"not telling, you fckn CIA spook","replies":[]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-01-04T05:16:21.373+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:90}}  the bases. the ratios. the silence. the tears of assassins are quite delicious. the low level dragon kills while not jungling. the low level dragon kills while jungling. the ability to get triple kills while dead. the ability to build AD or AP, tanky or glass cannon.\n\n{{champion:161}}  there's something really satisfying about the way he gets kills by puking out his abilities. maybe it's the sound effects, maybe it's the fact that they're there one second gone the next. also, geometry. geometry is op.\n\n{{champion:33}}  it's fun making the enemy adc's life miserable.\n\nhonorable mention: {{champion:131}}  if you gank her with under 75% hp, expect to be deleted. just as satisfying if not more so than a {{champion:161}}  kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirin Gioro","date":"2015-01-03T20:00:45.680+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I kind of abuse freelo\n\n1. {{champion:42}} \nWhat kind of ADC deals 3 types of damage without red buff? ROFL CORKI. Magic damage, physical damage, true damage. WTF. Yea no one plays him because I don't know why. He has high range poke (R) and can use Q or R to check brushes. AND WHAT THE FK he has a (not) reliable escape as well. This champion scales so well with double buffs it's amazeballs. Even though he hasn't got me to Silver IV yet I still think he's an OP champ. I once had a 5/1 W/L with him in solo queue. \n\n2. {{champion:412}} \nI just learnt him since he's free this week, but I see this really high potential of carrying idiot ADCs with this champion. Seriously, If you can predict the enemy's movement, your hooks are so easy to land. SOMEONE GIFT ME THIS CHAMPION LOL\nI like to get ignite on this champion because you already deal so much damage with your hooks and flay and box. If the enemy ADC is half HP while I'm like 3/4 HP, I'd gladly trap him in my box and flay them out of my box for the slow and hook them and ignite them. I proceed to type \"/all 1v1 me, idiots\" in chat.

I rotate through mid-lane champions a lot, but Malz is a constant comfort pick.\n\n2) {{champion:59}} Jarvan IV was the first champ to be released after I started that I really gravitated toward. Saw the spotlight and figured he'd be a champion I'd enjoy. 3 years later, I think I was right! I always feel comfortable playing him, and will often default to him for top/jungle.\n\n1) {{champion:21}} Picking up Miss Fortune was kind of an accident for me. I started playing her on a whim in Season 2, and found a more success with her than any other ADC. That has carried on to Seasons 3 and 4, where she's been my most-played in ranked, and just all-around favorite champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RasCaelestis","date":"2015-01-03T07:40:01.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:112}} **Viktor**:  Viktor is by far my favourite champion in this game.  I love his whole theme, his lore, his kit, and how so many people tend to underestimate him.  With more information about the Battlecast slowly coming out, I'm becoming more intrigued as to how  Riot's going to have that story pan out (if they ever do).  Viktor was the first champion that really clicked with me, and way back when I started playing this game (about 3 years ago) a few friends warned me that he wasn't very good and he was hard (one even called him useless), but after I got a quadra in my third game with them, they stopped.  I do a lot of RPG games, and tend to drop into character after playing long enough.  Viktor is one of the few characters in any MOBA (including Smite, DotA, and (RIP) Dawngate) that has this effect on me.  Also, I'm a huge fan of Warhammer 40k, and he reminds me of a Tech-Priest.  >_>  \n\n{{champion:111}} **Nautilus**:  I will say this first:  I don't like jungling, and it's the role I'm worst with.  Nautilus is the one champion that I actually enjoyed jungling with, and while I may never have carried with it, I always got my team fed so that I didn't have to worry.  When the preseason changes came into effect, tank-junglers were hit hard, and the few times I've played Nautilus jungle since then have been some of the toughest games I've ever done.  I don't know what made me first try it, but not too long ago I started playing Nautilus support.  It.  Is.  Fantastic.  He still has a few problems, but they're ones that all tanks are suffering from now.  His insane CC makes up for most of that though, and being in a support role just makes it easier to set up kills for my carries.  \n\n{{champion:161}} **Vel'Koz**:  I admit, when he was released, I wasn't too interested in Vel'Koz.  Liked his Battlecast skin, but that was about it.  His kit seemed interesting, but nothing really jumped out at me.  A friend bought him directly after his release, played one game with him, and immediately started ranting about how he was a terrible champion, the worst Riot's ever designed, etc.  (Yes, he fed hard in his first game, and I've never seen him play Vel since.)  This got me curious.  I did a custom game with Vel, and really liked it.  I couldn't understand what my friend was talking about, so tried it in a normal game.  I had a lot of fun, and utterly destroyed my opponent in lane.  I've since gotten even better with him, and Vel'Koz is my number two choice in mid.  Getting a kill with a blind split-Q is amazing, and I've made quite a few enemies rage and call 'hax' on me for doing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kirbyzama","date":"2015-01-03T08:16:14.133+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:222}}  I saw her champion spotlight followed by the music video. I talked about it with my friends and found out half of them played league so I started. She is the reason i play this game literally. Plus I love crazy girls. I play juri in street fighter, Tira in Soul Calibur, Nu-13 Blazblue, etc etc.\n\n{{champion:92}} Go on. Hate me. Hate me! It feeds me, makes me stronger Muhahah... Actually I didn't like her till I played her fed several games got angry and resolved myself to learning her. Now I love her. \n\neither {{champion:254}} or {{champion:113}} Vi was literally the first melee champ i played but most of the reason I like her is her relation with jinx. Sej seems like she could be a much more complex character but still like her as she is a lot. I mostly like them for their Honey badger like attitudes and gameplay. Also Poro rider Sejuani SOOO CUTE!\n\nI want to give {{champion:8}} an honorable mention because I love the idea of a mass murdering blood mage who has an obsession with bad puns.

There's not much to say, other than that Quinn is the first and thus far only ADC i have ever cared about playing. It took me awhile to get her after her release, but when i did, it was orgasmic. I took her mid, then top, and finally started rounding out with her bot lane, but everything about her felt fluid. A duelist, a ranger, and a pimp ass bird to boot!\n\n2. {{champion:74}} I was originally going to put my first main, the glorious Orianna here, but i've not mained her in a while, and i Feel heimer has been stepping up to the plate quite finely to represent my love of Tech Champs. Heimer feels like no other mage, his kill cards are tougher, battles are more indefinite, and overall my heart pounds like no other when i find myself having to trust my towers to get the job done when i can't.\n\n3. {{champion:16}} Before Soraka's rework, i hated this champion. She did practically nothing better than any other support other than heal at grudgingly low frequency, and i couldn't place her into any team and be confident.

I always liked the idea of rivens kit and when I started playing I mostly saw riven players feed and I was one of those who stayed away from her for a while because I wasn't good. Then one day my friend mystery gifted me dragonblade riven! This motivated me to attempt to learn this champion, and shift from maiming adc to top lane. After over 100 games with riven she is tons of fun and even when counter picked, mechanics and game knowledge can still allow you to carry. And when fed you can carry! But it comes with great risk. . . Most people will focus you... And you're allergic to cc, learn to play around that and she is a very rewarding champ to play! (Note: took me practicing her everyday after work for a month first in bot games and jungling to get down combos and there's still tons of room for improvement! This champ requires dedication and you're friends will get sick of you spamming her as your learning her!) \n\n2. {{champion:61}}  another champ that I always liked but never played. Now that I have a top laner and my first main was adc jinx. I've recently started playing her and it's been love at first sight! The outplays are reAl! And her mechanics feel very natural to me for some reason, definitely not the best with her but my gad is it satisfying to catch 3 or more enemies in that ult!!! :)\n\n3. {{champion:126}}  once again maybe have 5 summoners rift games on this guy and just started learning his mechanics but WOW JAYCE IS ONE SHIESTY BASTARD I mean just look at that grin^ everyone I know hates laning against this guy including myself and a friend reccomended I try him because of his complicated kit, and even though I feel dirty playing him IT IS JUST SO FUN to poke at a skirmish as you come in, front flip for style as you turn on your aoe and chase with aa then e right before they get away and if they survive you switch stances and q them for the kill! Maybe I just love champs with aoe but I get so hype playing this guy and orianna! AND WHETHER WE WIN OR LOSE WITH ANY OF THE CHAMPS LISTED ABOVE I STILL HAVE A BLAST!\n\nHonorable mentions. Champs that peaked my interest and pulled me deeper into the league machine!

I love AD bruisers, and I love sustain. He has a really cool buff/debuff based play style, that while relatively simple, has a lot of nuance that allows for some pretty epic plays, like blocking a 5 man charge with a Pillar, murdering a tower with your AD and AS steroids, and doing the Troll dance over you enemies' corpses. He hard counters a lot of champions really well, and can adapt to a ton of situations, because of how flexible his kit is. He is also one of, if not the strongest duelists of any bruiser in the game, again because of his numerous rebuffs and steroids.\n\n**2.** {{champion:78}} Poppy was a champ that I got that basically every smurf that played alongside me told me was a n00b trap when I first was starting out, and sometimes they were right. Most times though, I hard carried and 1v5ed the enemy team with over 20 kills at the end of the game. Hard to play, but her football tackle just makes me laugh every time I use it.\n\n**3.** {{champion:42}} I don't play ADC very often, but when I do, Corki is my absolute favorite. He is just incredibly fun to use, and combines some of my favorite attributes of ADCs into one champion. is both very safe and poke heavy, but can dive in and burst people at the drop of a hat. His mixed damage output makes him hard to counter, and his Moustache is just so epic in proportion that I feel obligated to play him.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n{{champion:27}} He was one of the first champions I picked up, and I love it when the enemy actually chases me because of how mad they get at me. He scales really hard into late game, and if he can get a bit ahead, he becomes an uncatchable move speed fiend a la Hecarim or Rammus. He has a simpler kit, but has enough strategic depth to still be really fun.\n\n{{champion:14}} After his rework, he is one of my top picks because of how fun he is. The only reason he isn't one of my top three is that if the enemy knows how to avoid his abilities and escape his passive, life becomes really miserable for him.\n\n{{champion:9}} I just started really playing him recently because of how good he is in the jungle, but he is starting to really grow on me. Getting a perfect combo off onto a laner (E-Q-W) is so satisfying, because you can usually melt at least 60% of their HP. Lategame, getting a perfect ult is ridiculous, and usually kills at least two people without any help from you team.\n\n{{champion:112}} I really love the Idea of a steampunk cyborg, and on top of that he also throws in my other favorite qualities of being a burst mage. His augmentations make him feel like he is making significant profess throughout the game. The rework they gave him made him a lot better, the only problem being that the removal of the burn on his E made my favorite Rylai's Liandry's build pretty pointless on him.\n\n**Dishonorable Mentions (The least fun ones)**\n{{champion:19}} Strong or not, WW is just the least fun champion to play in my opinion.\n\n{{champion:38}} ever since the rework, he just hasn't felt the same to me.\n\n{{champion:104}} No matter how well I play him, or how fed I get, he never feels like he has the amount of burst everyone claims he has, and feels like a one trick pony who dashes in, unloads his damage, and hope it was enough to kill the enemy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emmy Cha0s","date":"2015-01-05T20:24:10.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:222}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:103}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-01-05T17:55:27.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.{{champion:34}} First champ i played when i started playing in 2011, still my favorite champ in the entire game by far. when I play her, i don't feel like any matchup is unfair in either direction, I still regret walling away that zyra that managed to escape me because of it after i got a quadrakill near blue buff :( still no penta on her \n2.{{champion:55}} Second champ I picked up after anivia, still makes me feel happy on the inside just to play as her in a game, got my 1st ranked penta on her (duh)\n3{{champion:102}} 1st time I played her, I ended the game 31/1/10 with a penta... love at first sight, I still play her unlike anyone else (zephyr is core item on her I tell you all!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morribyte","date":"2015-01-05T17:06:16.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:1}} Annie: I love burst mage champs.

Ridiculously high risk-reward because she brings absolutely zero utility to a team, so she either kills everyone or ends up as dead weight.\n\nPre-rework/nerf Kat still holds my 33 kill record and I doubt I'll ever pass it, given that Dominion's community is circling the drain and I dislike the stupid fun of URF-esque modes.\n\n2) {{champion:113}} Boar Bitch for the win: very high damage for a (near-)pure tank, mobility, and lots of CC. Her rework pushed her damage into OP territory with the absurdly high %HP on her Q and her CC buffs (Riot cut her CC for some reason ...), despite the fact that she suffered from the exact same problem as before: why pick her when Cursed Touch means {{champion:32}}  will forever do more damage than her? :v Being viable for levels 4 and 5 isn't really a bragging point compared to how much he overtakes her afterwards.\n\nAnd then the new jungle completely pushed her out of viability due to tank/squishy champions dying to camps and invaders like Lee Sin losing nothing.\n\nIt'd be nice to see another boost to her first clear sustain and perhaps a slight CC buff.\n\n3) {{champion:43}}2 Every support Karma2 I see makes me warm on the inside, because that's a little more hope that solo queue will never figure out how to play her properly. As much as I disliked Riot effectively deleting Karma and replacing her with Karma2, I'll take her hilariously powerful Q as compensation for the relaunch ruining her shield and RE (mantra bonus not applying bug still not fixed ...). Take her mid or top, stomp on or outfarm anyone who can't outpoke you, and forever win any push or poke contests for the rest of the game.\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n{{champion:28}} Used to be my favorite champion in the game until repeated nerfs destroyed her.\nI absolutely loved what she looked like post-rework: a {{champion:92}} -esque light fighter hypercarry which actually pays for late game power with a weak early game, so long as you avoided the Sheen trap build (Trinity Force ruins Q's AD ratio and E's AS steroid) and built a bit of bulk to make up for her horrific base survivability (FH: mana, much-needed CDR, and a ton of armor!). Take her jungle or top, farm up and get kills, then split push or aspire to the glory of the 1500 ultimate shield. Unfortunately, Riot's rework failed to balance her W properly, her ult does next to zero damage late game against MR/L runes or Spirit Visage/GA spam, and Riot decided to nuke her entire kit from orbit when people discovered that DFG + AP burst + stealth = cheese instagib. Instead of, y'know, addressing that DFG is a god-awful item for this game and deleting it.\n\nAnd then the new jungle completely pushed her out of viability due to tank/squishy champions dying to camps and invaders like Lee Sin losing nothing.\n\n... That sounds oddly familiar.\n\n{{champion:45}} 150 Q farm by 30 minutes = I hit anyone {{item:3128}}/Q/Ult and they're dead now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FoggyPaws","date":"2015-01-05T03:26:50.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}}  40% CDR and unlimited mana... give him some {{item:3151}} and {{item:3020}} and he's just a never ending poke machine.\n\n{{champion:421}} Take her top lane, win vs every melee ever\n\n{{champion:77}} When I first joined League, this was my main man, I grew into league with Udyr.

Nothing makes me happier than seeing a squishy support on the other team and knowing i'm just gonna go ham on that fool.\n\n2. Number 2 - Lissandra\nI hated this champ when she was first introduced, and then I played with her. i don't even own her (not much of a mid player tbh) but every time she's free I spam this champ. I love the idea that I'm a mage who dives into the other team and unleashes hell. She's like the \"man mode\" of mid laners - yeah i'm squishy, yeah it's dangerous, but screw you I'm going in and murdering fools.\n\n3. Number 3 - Singed\nTrololololol. I'm not very good with him, but I love this dude. His play pattern is utterly unique and the few times you really get a chance to completely troll charge the other team, it's so worth it.

Her attitude, the sound effects, it just all meshes together. It doesn't hurt that I do well with her, but mostly I just enjoy charging in and beating the crap out of things as an unstoppable punching machine dual wielding giant mechanical punching machines.\n\n{{champion:113}} Another favorite, also because I can go in give no fucks and beat on faces. Not as damaging as Vi usually, but far beefier and packing a bit more CC. I can get away with all kinds of crap because of her CC and beef.\n\n{{champion:150}} Can you tell how much he's enjoying himself? Because that's how much I enjoy playing him. I get to dictate the flow of the lane mostly with his wonderful ability to just keep throwing out boomerangs. And then I hit three, and they're at half health, and my rage just peaked. RAWR GNAR GNOM FACE. I have won so many lanes off dinging three and just going all in.\n\nYou know, I seem to enjoy champions I can just charge in with and give no fucks while hurting things.

Her ult is also incredibly fun (if somewhat frustrating gameplay-wise) - turning people to stone just with your gaze is fabulous. And the rare occasion where it ends up in killing someone who was cocky enough to engage on you with low health is amazing. Twin Fang is also an exceptionally unique move. I think the rework has a lot of problems and very much prefer Old Cass as a champ but it's hard to ruin something as perfect as a snake lady.\n\n2. {{champion:134}} What can I say I love mid lane burst mages. Syndra's incredibly fun to me, I love manipulating her spheres, her quotes, her fabulous outfits (all her skins are wonderful) and her ultimate. Some will say her ultimate is unskilled for being point-and-click but it's not completely effortless for obvious reasons and there's not much I find more rewarding than seeing your spheres shooting towards someone and killing them. That said it's very anti-climactic when they don't.\n\n3. {{champion:127}} I don't play Lissandra much because I've yet to really pay much attention to top lane, mostly focusing on support and mid. And I don't like the sound of Lissandra mid. That said, on the rare occasion that I do get to play her I adore her. Her ultimate condemning a carry to death is just glorious and everything else about her has its perks too. I love how difficult she is to chase, how incredibly good she is at locking down a target, and the random irrelevant wall-dashing she gets because reasons. And her personality is just perfect too.\n\nHonourable mentions:\n\n{{champion:40}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:143}} My support mages. Love all of them, couldn't pick a favourite though. I love all of their ultimates, especially Janna's and Sona's. You get to do so many #lcsbigplays with Monsoon it's unreal and Crescendo is a team fight monster. Support with my ADC friend is something I do a lot and they're my go-to champs for it - I find peeling against really hard engages to be really exciting, and the same for engaging team fights I ensure are won. All of these champs can do both (less so Janna on engaging however) and setting up a perfect double kill and turning around a situation that really should be utterly hopeless both give me huge highs.\n\n{{champion:60}} Finally, Elise. I've not played her in PVP yet because I've not learned Jungle enough. I've been doing it with her and Nocturne, but Elise is by far my favourite. Excellent concept, cool mechanics. Very intricate to play, too. Bit awkward because of the nerfs but the buffs on the PBE seem really nice and when I do end up jungling in PVP, Elise is definitely the champ I'd like to do it with. Skittering Frenzy is just so cool at max rank. The speed of her and her spiderlings gets insane. And Rappel is so stylish too. Plus, Blood Moon Elise is definitely one of my favourite skins in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Yulen Xoshxius","date":"2015-01-04T21:45:28.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wait for bloodmoon Elise, all her other skins seem unappealing for someone who is supposed to lure people to the shadow isles.

Since the 4.20 patch he can't invade the enemy jungle early on anymore. As I my opponents grew better he sadly became less and less of a viable pick. With a heavy CC setup he still can do wellmin teamfights. But winning your lane against anybody post G III is impossible, his turrets die so horribly fast and  his cooldowns are horrible (24s / 11s / 18s). I love this champion, but I am afraid he'll never see the love and buffs he needs until low Elo suddenly realized that they should destroy the towers instead of factanking them, chasing Heimerdinger in a circle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niirho","date":"2015-01-04T10:17:23.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:43}} The Ionian Queen of Versatiltiy.
