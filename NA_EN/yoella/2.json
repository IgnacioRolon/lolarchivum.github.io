Pros and Cons.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":32,"down_votes":12,"body":"So as you may or may not know Veigar was married to DFG, and after its removal he was promised compensation. Today that compensation has been revealed (albeit it isn't on the PBE quite yet) and I have honestly mixed feelings about it.\n\nSummary of changes:\nQ, Baleful Strike, is now a **skillshot** but **passes through the first target and hits the second as well.** **Range increased from \n650 to 850**, and **CD is now 1 second lower at earlier ranks and 1 second higher at higher ranks.**\n\nW, Dark Matter, **mana cost reduced to 70/75/80/85/90 from 70/80/90/100/110**. **CD reduced to 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 from 10 at all ranks.**\n\nE, Event Horizon, now has a **0.75 second delay with warning particles before a stun, mana cost reduced to 80/85/90/95/100 from 80/90/100/110/120, Cooldown reduced to 18/17/16/15/14 from 20/19/18/17/16, and range increased to 700 from 650.**\n\nR, Primordial Burst, **AP ratio reduced from 1.2 to 1.0, mana Cost flattened to 125 at all ranks from 125/175/225, and cooldown reduced to 120/100/80 from 130/110/90.**\n\n----\nNow let's look at some real pro/con analysis of these changes from a **practical** standpoint.\n\nThe changes to Baleful Strike, Q, is a double edged sword.\n\nPros: Longer range, hits 2 targets, lower early CD.\n\nCons: Now a skillshot, less reliable, harder to target minions in a cluster, higher late game CD.\n\nOverall whether the changes to Q are a buff or a nerf depends on the projectiles speed. On one hand the range allows for safer farming and harass, but the skillshot element makes it infinitely less reliable.\n\n----\n\nThe changes to Dark Matter, W, are a straight-up buff.\n\nPros: Slightly reduced mana cost, and lower late game cooldowns.\n\nCons: None really.\n\n----\n\n**The changes to E, Event Horizon, are potentially disastrous to Veigar, and could render him and all other buffs useless. This is what has most Veigar players in a tizzy.** I beg Riot to reconsider these changes.\n\nPros: Slightly reduced mana cost, slightly reduced CD, and 50 more range.\n\nCons: **0.75 second delay on his stun WITH warning particles!**\n\nHo-ly-fuck. What was Riot thinking? I understand that an instant stun is considered bs by a lot of people, but if it were really as omnipotently powerful as people say then Veigar would be a steady pick for ranked and LCS, which he definitely ISN'T. The delay WITH WARNING PARTICLES will likely singlehandedly \"olaf\" Veigar. In the league of mobility 0.75 seconds is a lot of time to leap away, which leaves Veigar defenseless. Not to mention he now has 0 chance to stun the likes of LeBlanc, Kassadin, or Zed who all live in his lane and teleport everywhere. Veigar already struggled with people like that, now he has almost no hope of defeating them. \n\nDon't touch the stun Riot. Just, DON'T.\n\n----\n\nThe changes to Primordial burst, R, are.. uhm... not good either.\n\nPros: Mana cost flattened, Cooldown reduced by 10 seconds.\n\nCons: AP ratio took a huge hit.\n\nSo Riot decided to buff Veigar for removing an item that made him deal 20% more damage by REMOVING another 20% of his R ratio??! What. The. Hell. The cooldown is negligible seeing as most people build at least 1 Morellonomicon on him anyway, and while the flattened mana cost is nice the damage reduction is awful, especially with non-ap mids like Zed in play.\n\n----\n\nOverall I don't think this is a buff to Veigar. I think it's actually a slight nerf, which after the removal of DFG is a death sentence.\n\nNow how could Riot go about this differently? \n\n1) Revert the ratio on R back to what it was, give him some extra range on it.\n\n2) Get rid of that god awful 0.75 second delay on his stun, *maybe* reduce it to 0.5 seconds IF you disable warning particles and give him some extra base damage somewhere.\n\n3) Give his Q the Ahri treatment, Veigar is an immobile mage and that's a huge disadvantage so give him increased movement speed while Q is launched.\n\nPeople who don't play Veigar don't realize how massive the nerfs to R and E are. They make it so that the rest of his kit may as well not exist.","replies":[{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2015-02-13T23:28:43.641+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never build Deathfires on Veigar and I thought he was just fine.\nI personally dont think he needs to be touched.\n\nThe way his stun lands most of the time is at max range and the enemy walks into it at the very last second.

It's really easy to dodge and avoid the damage it deals, and attempting to use your E (Event Horizon) to try and land it easier will most likely not work. Your opponent can see where the edges will be, and walk out of it, or, depending on the champion, identify that you are defenceless against their attacks and engage, even if it means dashing into the middle of the event horizon.

You will hit a fair few, but you will in no way hit every last one. And then every time you miss, whether they be inside or outside the circle, the can just run around to avoid your dark matter while giggling like a schoolgirl at how slow it is. On top of that, they want to give it a very obvious delay particle AND make Q a skillshot, meaning the only time you will ever get a kill is when you straight up decide to flash-q-r the enemy, PROVIDED that has enough damage to do it now with the lesser ration on his ultimate. The way i see it this is a straight up nerf. What they could do to his Q to make it better to compensate is give it the power to instantly delete waves of minions late game. Say, if your Q kills the first minion hit it will keep going in a straight line until either there are no minions left or one survives.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-02-14T00:14:49.513+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they HAVE to give warning particles for his e then make it so the particles are on Veigar himself.

This is what has most Veigar players in a tizzy. I beg Riot to reconsider these changes.\n\nPros: Slightly reduced mana cost, slightly reduced CD, and 50 more range.\n\nCons: 0.75 second delay on his stun WITH warning particles!\n\nHo-ly-fuck. What was Riot thinking? I understand that an instant stun is considered bs by a lot of people, but if it were really as omnipotently powerful as people say then Veigar would be a steady pick for ranked and LCS, which he definitely ISN'T. The delay WITH WARNING PARTICLES will likely singlehandedly \"olaf\" Veigar. In the league of mobility 0.75 seconds is a lot of time to leap away, which leaves Veigar defenseless. Not to mention he now has 0 chance to stun the likes of LeBlanc, Kassadin, or Zed who all live in his lane and teleport everywhere. Veigar already struggled with people like that, now he has almost no hope of defeating them.\n\nDon't touch the stun Riot. Just, DON'T.<\n\nHe may not be a pick in the LCS, but I'm pretty sure the Koreans have been picking him up a few times because of how good that stun is (mainly in the support role). The stun was like {{champion:91}}  silence, if you got caught you could literally do nothing unless you managed to guess where he was going to plant it (unlike Talon who if you got to you, you are usually just dead) but if the veigar was competent that usually never happens.\n\nHowever I dont play Veigar but what I do know is that despite that, with this crazy mobility creep, I do agree this could potentially screw him over. \n\nI do think Riot should change the stun, whether this is the right direction I dunno.

Why don't they let veigar's stun work similar to thresh's box, in that the walls are individually consumed when stunning champions.
