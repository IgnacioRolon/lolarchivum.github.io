Fauna seems to vary immensely, showing similarities to specimens found in sectors \"Gold\" and \"Bronze\" at times. \n\nAt times, the fauna is capable of communication amongst themselves, showing coordination in action and developing strategies to adapt to threats. They have been observed collecting the maximum of the \"Creep Score\" resource as possible without hindering the community, and erecting crude observation  devices \"codename: ward {{item:3340}}\" to monitor key areas of the territory from safety, while destroying similar devices placed by their predators. \n\nHowever, it appears that despite this show of intelligence that would be a clear boon if encouraged to grow, there is an overwhelming popularity of subjects {{champion:67}} and {{champion:157}} in this sector. The abundance of subjects results in the destruction of teams as a result of refusal to coordinate with team for reasons stated as \"stfu %%%got\" and \"stfu you suck, I'm pro\" (Note: rough translation, full translation impossible due to language bond being absent) As a result, the community dynamic is destroyed and the area dissovles into aggressive shows of dominance to claim \"top\" \"mid\" \"adc\" and \"JG\" territories, while those who fail to be dominant are forced into the undervalued \"supp\" territory. These subjects, despite attempting to rally the team together, are ignored in favor of the pursuit of addictive substance known as \"KDA\" and \"S-rank\"\n\nIn seems that because of these harsh environmental conditions, the subjects managing to migrate to other territories such as \"Bronze\" or \"Silver\" undergo two possible metamorphosis. Either they create hardened carapaces and lose function to communicate with other subjects, and subsequently remain oblivious to nearly subjects, or they enhance communication capabilities and communicate with nearby subjects in a variety of ways. One subject was observed being hostile and vitriolic to his community, while another's was observed to be constructive. Due to the unpredictable nature of the subjects, further study is required.
