You had 3 penalties before the permanent ban. Additionally, your last 6 games were taken into account for your perma-ban, so it wasn't anything to do with a Chogath and a Kayle.\n\nPermanent bans are permanent, unless the ban was done in error.

Drastic team differences only really happens in very odd hours when there are barely anyone playing, but that's no longer a NA problem because you guys have League on basically 24/7 unlike say here in OCE.\n\nYou are also allowed to say, rank skipping after a promo if the system determines that your skill level is simply too great for your current league. And that happens a lot when high elo players play on their low elo smurfs.\n\nIn other words, the unskilled players can only drag you down so much, everything else is entirely on yourself.\n\nLast but not least, where is the evidence that 75% of the plat is in flame and that they don't report?

It's hardly a sucking issue or anything to fuss over.\n\nImagine us OCE players where the server is set on the very east coast of Australia (because our telecomm companies just says \"fk you that's why\"), meanwhile the west coast players are putting up with 50-100 ping just because they have to go across the entire Australia continent to reach the OCE server?

Not because the game is particularly great in scale or that it needs very high production values (though it actually does as a whole, but not that much per content wise). But more because of its management aspects.\n\n* How are you supposed to update your game on a weekly to monthly basis without putting in some money?\n* How are you supposed to routinely balance and rebalance your game on a weekly to monthly basis without putting in some money?\n* How are you supposed to produce and update your contents with upgraded graphics, champions, music/sound, artworks, skins, etc on a weekly to monthly basis without putting in some money?\n* How are you supposed to host tournaments for a competitive game without some money?\n* How are you supposed to maintain and upgrade your service and systems just as frequent if not more so than your own all of the things above without putting in some money?\netc etc etc?\n\nA lot of MOBA/ARTS came out and died for a reason, because it's a serious business. This is not me trying to trash your dream, but making games in this genre IS NOT EASY. You need money to get a lot of things done in this genre. The greatest challenge of all is maintaining a sustaining playerbase because this is a completely player-driven game. Meaning if you can't keep the playerbase to increase, it will only decrease and drive this game into a death spiral and eventually just die off because of it. This genre is the most cutthroat \"go big or go home\" genre there is in video games so far.\n\nThe closest game that have managed to come out in a low-budget-operating mode that I know is probably Battlerite. They achieved that because the game massively cut down a lot of things from the traditional MOBA/ARTS genre, removing lanes and items entirely, leaving the game as a brawler hence much easier to manage. But even then, it is backed in Early Access, and still requires real money cosmetic and possibly champion transactions to sustain its survival financially. \n\nGoing completely free to play is a noble idea, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's also a practical one. A lot of \"completely\" free games turned into unbelievable grindfests that literally forces people to pay for a reason, because money still have to be there somehow.\n**\nEDIT: But this is off-topic and derailing though.**","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CooL Ice Tea","date":"2017-02-03T10:04:40.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Each 3 negative votes for Massive Suicidal - Low-Priority for the next 10 games (+30% queue time; unable for compet. mode)\n\nso in your game i can go with 2 buddys and randomly report a person cause we are 3.
