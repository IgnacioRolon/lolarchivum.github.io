When someone is selecting/banning, the timer goes to zero when they are picking, while nothing happens. It's then stuck at zero until I get kicked for not picking my champ or banning. I am also unable to change masteries/summoners when this happens. I also get the message that 3 or 4 \"summoner x has left the lobby\", but seems like I am the only one disconnected, since I keep getting the \"left during champ select\" message even when I am lastpick.\n\nIt's pretty weird, as while this happens I am running \"ping 104.160.141.3 -t\" (EUW server, which I am playing at) in CMD with 30'ish stable ping. \n\nMy browser and everything else is also working just fine, no disconnects anywhere. Started happening a lot today, and my queue delays are getting out of hand because of it. I just want to play some normal games, but I cant queue up knowing this will happen 1/3 times. If I get ingame, everything is fine for the duration of the match, no DC's or anything.\n\nEdit: There is also some issues with accepting game, the menu does not pop up, but it tells me I didn't accept. It's like i'm not getting a connection trough the client at all for these long periods of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-11T16:45:44.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pinging to the game server wouldn't necessarily say too much here because champion select is a different service.  Though you're internet might seem fine, it sounds like you're having some major syncing issues during champ select that's leaving you behind.  To help rule out some possibilities, I suggest going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for the fix. \n\n I also recommend enabling [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode just in case of high pc stress being a factor.  Test it in a custom and let me know how it goes.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-05-11T21:39:07.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My husband and I play on state-of-the-art machines on an extremely fast connection from the middle of the US. We have experienced the same issue as the OP (though less frequently) only since the forced \"upgrade\" to the new client. \n\nWe'll queue up in the same lobby on the same internet connection, and one person's client will lag super hard or simply freeze before timing out. Under those circumstances, it's just not plausible that the problem is on our end.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lost Vein","date":"2018-01-06T20:16:32.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here riot pls help us ive been having this for a while and i cant even play league","replies":[]}]}
