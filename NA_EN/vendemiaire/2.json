It all depends on what said random thing is and how it interacts with the game.\nThis makes it to where there is more thought on picking upo drags beyond just getting them all.\n\nNow it makes it less snowbally since the buffs are randomize instead of set in a fixed order, meaning more thought goes into getting drags beyond \"we need to get drags or the other team will\"\n\nNow you have have to keep in mind what you are doing drag for and whether you are okay with the enemy getting it, whereas the choice before was always, \"no\". and getting 1 drag always snowballed the team that got it ad made contesting following drags almost impossible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasqureMan","date":"2016-04-21T04:31:12.478+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random teammates whaattttt","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-04-21T04:26:20.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It **IS** a cool idea.
