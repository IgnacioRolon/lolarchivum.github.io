I think it would be cool if Riot gave the chance to download an archived version of the game's source code based on what patch you wish to play under. I think the real problem with this idea will be in getting enough players on the same patch in order to even do anything. Either Riot would have to have a different server dedicated to running 'retro-games', based on which patch your client is running on, or you would have to have a local server to run the games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"regonas","date":"2016-04-25T13:20:24.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Don't listen to bellow lower intelligence people.

Read your own link \"Abandonware is a product, typically software, ignored by its owner and manufacturer, and for which no product support is available. Although such software is usually still under copyright, the owner may not be tracking or enforcing copyright violations. Abandonware is one case of the general concept of orphan works.\"\nRiot games do **not** ignore their product. They **do** provide support for it, and **can, do and will** enforce copyright. Just because it is an older version of the game does not mean it's abandoned. All of the characters, no matter how much they've been updated or changed, are under ownership of Riot games. Everything that was once a part of games, past present and future, is under copyright of Riot games. You **agree to this** every time you patch the game.\n\nThis is why Blizzard was recently able to shut down a privately owned  server called [Nostalrious](https://en.nostalrius.org/#announcement), which provided World of War craft as it was in the original patch ie when it first launched. This is basically what this guy is asking to do, and you can't do it.\n\nYou've no idea what you're talking about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2016-04-25T23:59:50.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lonely Flame,realm=OCE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=G8oXgrRu,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-04-25T14:20:10.399+0000)\n>\n> Except that League of Legends is not abandonware. \n>\n> Riot games do **not** ignore their product.

As long as a version of ***League of Legends*** exists, the game cannot be abandonware. Otherwise we could argue that any \"outdated\" version of software becomes abandonware, which is definitely not true. Windows, for example, isn't abandonware, although some of the earlier versions might count now (I believe XP is unofficial abandonware). Windows Vista, 7, and 8 definitely aren't though, despite Windows 10 being around. And that's for something that takes drastically different forms and SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES ITSELF AS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM.\n\n***League of Legends*** has always been ***League of Legends***, and until after the servers are taken off-line it will not count as abandonware.\n\nFurther, quoting that article again:\n\n>In most cases, software classed as abandonware is not in the public domain, as it has never had its original copyright officially revoked and some company or individual may still own rights. _**While sharing of such software is usually considered copyright infringement, in practice copyright holders rarely enforce their abandonware copyrights for a number of reasons**_ â€“ chiefly among which the software is technologically obsolete and therefore has no commercial value, therefore rendering copyright enforcement a pointless enterprise. By default, this may allow the product to de facto lapse into the public domain to such an extent that enforcement becomes impractical.\n>\n>Rarely has any abandonware case gone to court._** But it is still unlawful to distribute copies of old copyrighted software and games, with or without compensation, in any Berne Convention signatory country.**_\n\nSo yeah...it's definitely illegal. It's just that companies with very old and outdated software often don't care enough to pursue people hosting abandonware.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2016-04-25T02:53:51.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of course you would.
