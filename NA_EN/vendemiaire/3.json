But that didn&#039;t stop me, I was so hyped when I reached plat from silver after four years&#039; struggle. I was excited, I was ready to move on.\r\nThen season6 hit me like~~ a truck~~ **a hundred trucks in a row.**\r\nI never thought I would think of uninstall some day. I still remember just in season4 I talked to my friends like &quot;I could be still playing league when I&#039;m 60 years old&quot;.\r\nI really enjoyed league, and I get bored at other games easily after I have experienced that enjoyment.\r\nI still want to enjoy league, but I can&#039;t.\r\nThis is not a bitching thread and I&#039;m realistic, I don&#039;t expect Riot to change the game back, so I&#039;m not gonna list &quot;100 reasons why league is not enjoyable&quot; here.\r\nI don&#039;t know why I make this thread, I&#039;m not expecting change, maybe I just want to share my feelings.\r\nI stopped league for nearly a month by now, without any other reasons holding me back, this is unimaginable before season6. Every time I want to start a game I will remind myself that I&#039;m very unlikely to enjoy this game.\r\nBut the thing is other games don&#039;t please me either, not nearly as much as the old league, which is never coming back.\r\nI just.\r\nI just  feel like I lost  something important.\r\nNearly five years&#039; effort became in vain before I reached anywhere really high.\r\nAnd I will never find something as enjoyable as the old league.","replies":[]}
