We would prefer a shorter que time than an equal match?\nDo you even know how frustrating it is?\nYou are creating anger and toxic among your players, with your own hands.\n\nI remember that I can match with actual dominion players years ago, I understand there are less players now, and I wouldn&#039;t mind a 20 mins Que time, it is still better than getting stomped and annoyed because of all those &quot;first time this mode&quot;&quot;wtf is this mode&quot; &quot;this mode sucks&quot; teammates.\n**I don't want to pay this price for 3 mins que, I'd rather wait for half an hour.**\n\nPlease Riot, we dominion players, are also human beings, the same as all other kind of players, please stop treating us like homeless animals and think we can survive with whatever you left in the trash can. When the game is not balanced, we will have a bad time, and we will be angry, just like all the other human beings and all the other players.","replies":[]}
