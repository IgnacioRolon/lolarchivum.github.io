You're presumably hovering around entry-level MMR if you're getting completely new players. Experience (via number of games) is important, but skill level (via MMR) is often more useful for matching players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Opportunistic","date":"2016-02-07T15:49:31.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Give up, not enough people play dominion. It feels like there is only about 2k players that actually play that mode consistently. I used to play it a lot in season 3. I haven't since then though. Not because I don't enjoy it, I do, it's just that it's not popular among my friends. Honestly riot should probably just take it out and replace it with something else. TT on the other hand I could care less what happens to it. That mode is far more boring than dominion is. If they had a ranked version of dominion I would play hands down. I feel your pain but it's a lost cause dude.","replies":[{"poster":"Vendemiaire","date":"2016-02-07T16:02:22.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are still a lot of dominion players, enough to form a match within 3 mins.\nBut I'd rather have long que than playing with people who have no idea what they are doing.","replies":[]}]}]}
