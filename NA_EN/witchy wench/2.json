People also basically don't build Mercurial Scimitar; they build QSS and then if it's the end of the game and they have nothing else to build they finish the scimitar. Almost like they... build a completely defensive MR item in response to a threatening source of AP damage and crowd control.\n\nI will trade you Maw of Malmortius and QSS building into a lackluster AP item instead of a lackluster AD item for a nice AD item with the Zhonya's active any day of the week.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2018-11-08T15:10:12.036+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"And it's not like there isnt a boot that people can build regardless of AP or AD...\n\nBut this is a \"mages are trash and so are their items\" thread so logic doesn't apply.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2018-11-08T15:13:23.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found taking tabis against full ad team as swain to be super helpful.
