The amount of time it often took to get to a case made it unviable as a solution by itself.\n\nTaking months (and eventually years as the case load built up) would mean that trolls are effectively never punished, since they are far more likely to get bored of the game long before the system would ever get to them. For other players, getting punished long after the poor behavior is bad for two reasons;\n\n1. They may no longer remember the actions that got them punished. This will make them feel like the punishment was for something that doesn't matter anymore.\n2. If they believe they just did something that will get them banned, but only several months in the future, then they're liable to treat the account as already doomed.

Maybe.\n\nIt's not a \"maybe\", it's an \"absolutely\". Cases in the Tribunal, due to being reviewed by human beings, are naturally going to be umpteen times slower than those handled by a program designed to do the same job.\n\n> Old? Doesn't necessary means bad.\n\nIn this case, it is. Because, as DuskDaUmbreon pointed out; it's not just old, it's outdated.\n\n> Outdated? It's relative.\n\nAbsolutely. And with that being said, it is _absolutely outdated relative to the IFS._ The IFS does the job of the Tribunal faster, more efficiently, and with a margin of error that humans have a hard time coming close to.\n\nMeaning that, quite literally, Riot would be taking a _massive_ step backwards if they brought back the Tribunal in place of the IFS. Going backwards to worse systems is not a good thing.\n\n> Unreliable? If we speak about one-sided punishment of every person who said the \"f-word\" then yes. If we talk about looking at picture as a whole by real people - then no.\n\nThe IFS has humans beat in terms of reliability, because it doesn't have an intrinsic bias. It simply reads the logs, interprets the text and determines whether or not the player broke the rules, and then punishes them. And like I said earlier, the margin of error is very, very small.\n\nAnd you pose \"looking at the whole picture\" as though the Tribunal resulted in any different outcomes than the IFS would. Fun fact; it didn't. Virtually all the cases that the IFS punishes now, the majority of the playerbase would have voted to punish during the Tribunal. The IFS was built off of the review practices and behavioral expectations that the community set forward in the Tribunal.\n\nSo, humans being tasked to review a single player's behavior, it'd just be a less-reliable, less-quick version of the same thing we already have. Nothing new, just a whole lot worse.\n\n> In case you would like to defend automated punishing system let me remind you about recent YouTube and Google Account bans based on automated punishment system. Hundreds of thousands accounts got banned because system decided they are spammers.\n> \n> Here is a video about the incident by Mark:\n>\n> Spoiler: All accounts got unbanned and Google admitted they goofed.\n\nIt's good that Google unbanned those accounts. I'd heard basically everything else about that whole fiasco save that part, so, thanks for the update.\n\nHowever, you're comparing apples to oranges here. If we look at the whole picture, you'd see a good number of differences between the Youtube stream-ban case and Riot's IFS.\n\n- Markiplier had no real say in whether or not the viewers would get punished. As far as I know, he didn't set up his stream with rules about \"don't spam\" or anything like that; the spambot acted on its own. Riot, however, they _have_ rules for their space. They built their punishment system _in accordance to those rules_. That already is a big difference; Riot _wants_ the rule enforcement, Markiplier didn't.\n- The two systems, as far as the case is concerned, are different. One was a spam bot; it sees something posted multiple times in quick succession, it punishes. The IFS is a lot more complicated, using machine-learning to read chat logs and determine intent - which is no mean feat when you consider just how steadily our language is evolving.\n- The punishments dealt are also completely different; the spambot didn't just revoke posting privileges on YouTube, it _banned_ people's Google accounts wholesale. The IFS, on the other hand, does not outright permaban players from the game unless it is an _exceptionally_ egregious offense. There's a punishment ladder, and players progress through that ladder based on the frequency and severity of their offenses. And spamming, as it were, is an exceptionally low-tier offense, meaning the first punishment for it will virtually always be a 10-game chat restriction, outside of exceptionally bad behavior (hate speech, encouragements of self-harm, death threats, etc.)\n\nSo, if you're really going to try and raise an argument against an automated punishment system, you're really going to have to do better than using a case of a spambot for your argument.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-12-01T03:50:34.196+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Slow?

Those volunteers would then vote on whether to punish or pardon the reported player's case. This system's main flaw was that it simply took far too long due to LoL's huge playerbase. Participants would often be reviewing chat logs that were several months old, with a growing backlog. In addition to that, not every participant took the task seriously: some would spam the same verdict for every case without even reading the chat log, or even invert their verdicts on purpose.\n\nThe current system, called the Instant Feedback System, or IFS, is automated software that uses machine learning to determine what behavior should be punishable and when a player's behavior should be punished. It started with data from the Tribunal, and has been learning and adapting for years. It operates on the same basic principles as a spam filter: get a corpus of data (emails/chat logs), have humans categorize each item as acceptable or unacceptable, find patterns within each category, and then finally look for those patterns to automatically categorize new items without direct human evaluation. Each report is like clicking the \"spam\" button. When a new pattern starts to get lots of reports, the IFS recognizes it as a new form of toxicity.\n\nThe IFS is efficient and unbiased.
