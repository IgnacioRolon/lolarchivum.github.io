Thanks everyone for the feedback (positive and negative alike) and discussions generated. This has been really useful information and we would like to do more improvements in the future, but want to align on setting the right goals before committing to big changes. **\n\n\n\n\nHey there! This is a follow-up to [My last thread on the PBE boards](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/w0VLEOIj-diana-q-code-changes-coming-to-pbe) about testing a series of changes to Diana Q. I’ve gotten a bunch of feedback and data on it and it mirrors Live Q’s behavior in almost all cases, but should feel faster and more accurate to cast.\n\nIn the meantime I’ve also been thinking about ways to add small improvements to Diana's kit to make her more enjoyable overall to play as and play against. Patch 7.14 had significant changes to Diana that brought her closer to being a very single-purpose AP assassin, while also gating her attack speed behind spellcasts. I want to try bringing her attack speed back to a more normal baseline and reducing her reliance on AP to succeed.\n\nAnd thus I’d like to propose a small list of gameplay changes that I want to test on PBE starting next deploy: \n\n**These changes aren't going live with 9.11** but if anything that just gives us more time to workshop together :)\n\nGoals with those changes are the following:\n-Increase Diana’s Time to Kill by a small amount\n-Revert the “spell weaving” paradigm that was introduced in 7.14\n-Give her a little more mobility in fights and skirmishes\n\nHere’s the changelist that I’ll be testing initially:\n\nBase Mana: 372 (+20)  => 335 (+45)\nAttack Speed: 0.625  => 0.725\nAttack Speed per level: 2.25 => 2.30\n\nP\nCleave Ap Ratio: 0.8>0.6\n**_*NEW:*_** Grants 20% Movement Speed on proc\n_***REMOVED:***_ 30-90% Attack Speed after casting a spell\n_***REMOVED:***_ 15% of AP as mana on proc\n\nQ\nStill has all of the previous changes to it in testing.\nQoL: Reveals FoW on missile tip\n\nE\nCooldown: 26>18 => 20>12\n\nR\nReset time: 0.5 => 1.0\n\nLast thing: The current iteration still has the R>Q reset removed. I’m hoping that, combined with her changes above, R>Q near-guaranteeing Q's damage is enough of a strength that Diana still sometimes opts into this combo without needing the gamble of a potential reset as additional incentive.\n\nNote that none of this is final, so please share suggestions and ideas. The main consideration is that this work needs to stay low-scope, so we can't include any VFX changes or significant mechanic updates. This should also stay as close to power-neutral as possible since our focus is on making Diana feel better to play more than anything else.\n\n{{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mini Magnus","date":"2019-05-14T17:26:51.740+0000","up_votes":359,"down_votes":11,"body":"For reference, I am a Diamond 3 Diana onetrick with over 1,1 million mastery on her.\n\nThese changes are absolutely terrible and honestly just a straight up nerf to an already terrible champion. Her oneshot potential is the only reason why you would play her, because there is no reason to play her as a \"bruiser\" as long as Jax, Riven, Hecarim, Rek'Sai, Irelia etc. etc. exist.\n\nIncreasing her mana growth isn't gonna help when you remove the mana on passive. Why would you even do that considering how weak she is? \nIncreasing her attack speed is nice for cs'ing, but removing the E bonus hurts her overall damage and 1v1 potential and makes E a non-ability that's not worth taking until level 8 once again.\n\nThe R change will also do nothing else than make her feel more clunky.

Mainly because she has no out.\n\nIf u nerf Diana's ap ratios to try to force her to be an ap onhit skirmisher ur just turning her into a worse Ekko imo.\n\nOverall dont do small work to Diana's kit. Her kit is flawed massively and needs a rework to turn her into a \"viable\" champ. Mainly because of how one dimensional it is. She is either an AP assassin or an unbalanacable onhit carry with nashors wits rageblade. Either way it's a mess because of how little wiggle room the kit allows.\n\nJust rework Diana's e and give her w something a bit more skill expressive with a shield tied to it.

Also they nerfed the one part of her kit which scales with the on-hit bruiser builds, her passive damage.\n\nThe change to her ultimate might make it so she takes longer to kill you and that's fine, but that's all Diana has going for her.

Now with the extra delay on the R you might not even have enough damage and the movespeed is completely irrelevant because you die to get out your second R.\nReducing the E cooldown does nothing because it is essentially a waste of mana even more so becausenow you don't get mana back with your passive.\nTalking about mana, I feel like you can barely get three rotaions out without going oom late game.

Patch 7.14 had significant changes to Diana that brought her closer to being a very single-purpose AP assassin, while also gating her attack speed behind spellcasts. I want to try bringing her attack speed back to a more normal baseline and reducing her reliance on AP to succeed.\n\nYour changes do not follow this at all. To start, you said that you want to make her more enjoyable to play as and against with 'improvements'. The changes you made will actually make her even worse to play with for a few reasons.\n\n1. **The loss of the AS steroid.** This is essential to Diana's play pattern and satisfaction because her base abilities early are not very strong and she needs to have DPS to succeed. The loss of AS makes her lose a window of power that was necessary to trade patterns, could lower her jungle clear health and speed, and when combined with the passive damage nerf it will maker her tower/split pushing power much, much weaker than it currently is unless you build enough attack speed to offset the nerf. Don't get me wrong, the buffed base AS and AS growth are wonderful changes, however these changes would only truly be felt when you are already building a lot of attack speed and would only maker her high AP bulid more clunky and less satisfying to play\n2. **R reset time.** When combined with the lack of an AS steroid on her, this would make her even more clunky to play. You said you wanted to slightly increase her time to kill, that's fine, but this specific change comes with the downside that it makes her already weak and usually slow burst pattern early even worse. Diana is not going to one-shot someone early in most cases and will usually have to poke and then land a full combo with 2 R's in order to kill the target, and in clutch moments that 0.5 seconds could be the deciding factor in whether you die or they die and whether or not you can catch them before they escape. This is the exact same issue that arose when Pre-Rework Akali had her ult dash times messed with. This is also a slight nerf to her in-combat mobility, but the movement speed buff of her passive might heavily outweigh this change.\n3. **E cooldown buff not hitting the mark.** This change doesn't necessarily go against the goals you set, they just don't hit the mark for what she needed. Don't get me wrong, this is one of the better changes you made, but this isn't what we needed. The primary issue with her E in terms of satisfaction and usability is how unreliable it is. As it stands this ability is only usable when the target is already close to you. The problems start when the target starts getting to the edge of the radius. This ability becomes really weird and frustrating when they reach the edge. Even if they are in range when the spell is casted, they will either walk of range during the cast time, or the ability will just not pull them at all even though they were clearly in range. While the cooldown change is nice because it would buff her sticking potential top-lane and massively increase her sticking power late-game, it doesn't fix the core issues with the ability. Besides the problems with its reliablity at the edge of the radius, it is also a nearly dead jungle spell until lv6 and is only used for the AS steroid increase, it is also nearly useless against ranged match-ups pre-6.\n\nYou also said you are changing her AS so that she relies less on AP to succeed. This won't work because in order for her to succeed with less AP, her kit needs to be able to function with other builds that focus less on AP. Not to mention you nerfed the AP ratio on her passive, which would would make non AP builds weaker, and would require more AP to offset the nerf. \n\nThe only viable builds that would work for her that involve less AP are on-hit DPS builds and bruiser builds. The DPS builds could work with the base AS buff, would be a bit weaker because of the passive damage nerf. The bruiser builds would be less effective than pure DPS, because while you do have higher mana, base AS, lower E cd, and the new MS buff, there is no proper AP bruiser itemization, her Shield is too reliant on high amounts of AP to be effective, she does not have good DPS without Nashor's, and she has no form of tank-busting innately to deal with other fighters and tanks.\n\n_**SUGGESTIONS**_\n\n* **Lower her base AS (lower than 0.725, but much higher than 0.625. Keep her AS steroid after ability cast, but change its scaling to be less explosive and more manageable with the higher base AS.** In terms of satisfaction a mix of both changes would be ideal. Having a higher base AS would open up more viable builds and increase early game satisfaction and the AS steroid would still give her windows of power, but would have to be tuned so that her AS post change and pre change comes out roughly the same when using AS steroid.\n* **Don't nerf her early base Mana as hard, keep the Mana growth buff, keep the removal of passive Mana restore**. Overall these are nice changes actually. The reason I'm suggesting on making the base Mana nerf less harsh is because to try and keep some of the suggestions power-neutral, I will be suggesting lowering her Mana regen and/or Mana regen growth, and slightly uping some of her mana costs (by like 5, maybe 10 for her E or R, but not all abilities will get a mana cost change.\n* **Keep the passive Movement speed buff, or put the movement speed buff on her W.** I actually quite like this change, and honestly it could work on her W as well granted the MS increase is higher on her W because it would be utilized less often, especially if you are focusing on DPS. If the MS buff is good enough, then I would keep the AP ration nerf to offset its power a little.\n* **Keep her E cooldown buff, and make it more reliable to use when champions are closer to the edge by hitting the pull directly and/or messing with the cast time and channeling.** The buff is nice, and I would keep it, but the ability really only needs QOL changes to make it more reliable and satisfying. If the E is better to use and she gets MS on her passive, then naturally this ability should also get a slight nerf to it to compensate. Lowering the slow % would do the trick sich her sticking power is already more frequent and reliable from other changes.\n* **Remove the R reset Nerf.** There are other ways to increase her time to kill without making her clunky.\n* **Keep the fog-of-war change on her Q, it's actually kind of nice to have that option.**\n* **Increase her base AD.** IF AND ONLY IF YOU INTEND TO GO THROUGH WITH _YOUR_ ATTACK SPEED CHANGES, then please increase her base AD so it doesn't feel like she is hitting someone with a wet noodle. Would also help offset the AP nerf to her passive slightly and while may be hitting people is massive bursts of speed like she did, they are slightly faster on a base level and hit a little harder.\n* **Buff her base Shield, lower the shield's AP ratio, possibly add a bonus HP ratio or Mana ratio.** If you want her to succeed with less AP then her W ABSOLUTELY needs to be functional at less AP. Giving her a better base shield would already help her other builds and should be a nerf to her full AP build, and if you have to you could add the bonus HP or Mana ratios as other ways to the make the shield good without he need for a lot of AP. Naturally this change would come of a nerf to offset it, something like lower damage, slightly higher cooldown, or slightly higher mana cost, or a combination of them would do.\n* **Using R on a Moonlight marked target no longer removes all other Moonlight marks from other targets.** This is something a lot of Diana players want, while it would probably have to come with some kind of nerf, it would help her reliability and satisfaction a bit.\n* **Nerf her burst, but buff her DPS.** How you do this is up to you, but I think it is necessary for her health and balance based on the changes you presented. I have my own suggestion, but he only problem with mine is that is might require a VFX change, but hopefully it won't. The Suggestion is this: **_Enemies marked by Moonlight now take X(+Y% AP) bonus magic damage from Diana's basic attacks and Lunar Rush._** This change would be accompanied by a very slight nerf to her Q damage and a slightly higher nerf to her R damage, but would also work with your Passive damage nerf, and should NOT be done with by base AD buff suggestion. This would lower her burst a bit, but give her more dueling power and DPS in moments of power. Her ult would be less bursty overall except when reset with Q. I don't think this is a heavy Mechanic change at all, but the main issue with it is that you might have to add a VFX for when the damage is dealt. However, the VFX change wouldn't have to happen if you just don't make a VFX change at all, or preferably make Diana use her Crit animation when attacking enemies marked with Moonlight.\n\nMost of your changes, and some of mine, are either power shifts or buffs accompanied by compensation nerfs. Overall if the combined list is less power neutral then desired, then naturally you would have to make more nerfs to compensate assuming you can find the proper areas to nerf. Some of YOUR changes are nice in concept but they miss YOUR mark and would only hurt Diana in other ways that as you can tell do not make Diana players very happy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jean Théodule","date":"2019-05-14T17:36:07.216+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":2,"body":"From what i see there, that's a straight nerf.

Additionally, both versions will lose their lane tower killing potential which just feels bad.

Please don't go ahead with these changes since they accomplish nothing (not even more mobility, since at the same time you are delaying her R which makes her less mobile?).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vìxen","date":"2019-05-14T17:47:00.205+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like such a bad and un-needed nerf overall.

If this goes through, and we nerf the attack speed early, we wont be able to get this gold from the platings, because we wont be able to deal damage with the passive, and get more passives with the attack speed.\nAlso, diana needs to play safe pre-6, causing in a lot of scenarios a farm disatvantage, and a lane priority disatvantage, a thing, that now we can solve with getting some extra gold form the platings.\n* Removing the mana refund it's ok if we get this +25 mana per level.\n* If your goal is to make her more mobile, giving extra 0.5 secs on [R], and making it 1 second wont help her mobility in a lot of scenarios, for example:\nQ minion, R minion, and getting to an enemy fast, of getting through enemies while not beig oblitarated.\n* And adding to the last point, if you want to make her more mobile, it's no up to 20% movement speed, but as I think, it's more a about giving her more resets on [R]. Also, Diana, is a champ, that builded in a good way, going SpellBinder + boots + Rune(Relentless Hunter) gets to 500 movement speed, so she don't need more movement speed in exchange to less damage and pressure in lane.\n\n\nOverall, this proposal is not as good as RIOT may think, because the only think that makes Diana viable right now is the Oneshot potential, combined with some pressure that she can applie with the Passive and the Attack speed form the [E].\n\n\nThanks for your attention, if someone wants to discuss i'm open to it, and ofcourse if i'm wrong on anything i'm open to change my mind.\n\nPD: excuse my poor english. \n{{champion:131}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pls let me login","date":"2019-05-14T18:25:20.888+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's clear that you have not taken any suggestions from players seriously after looking at the PBE thread you've linked.\n\nI don't understand, why won't you do what people are asking you to do and instead deliver this....\nPeople are not asking for \"feel better\" changes... people want a mini-rework.\n\nDiana is not and will not get any better \"to feel\" than she is right now.

It is really hard to last hit with her with it being so low, especially since she gets bullied pre-6 pretty hard by nearly every matchup.  Her current base AD is 53, which is the second lowest of all melee champions, only above Kayle (who eventually becomes ranged and hyperscales anyways).  Other AP melees like Katarina (58), Ekko (58), Sylas (58), Fizz (58), Kassadin (58.9), and Akali (62.4) have much high base AD.  \n\nAlso, I think that reducing the AP ratio on her passive disincentivizes her attack speed build a lot.  Dealing base damage + 60% AP every 3 auto attacks (even if it a small AOE) is pretty weak on a melee champion lacking an escape.  Neeko has the same ratio on her 3 hit passive.  Kayle, Teemo, Varus, and Azir all have the same or higher total AP scaling over 3 attacks, and they're all ranged.\n\nIf you want to reduce the AP ratio on her third hit (and keep her base AD low), maybe adding a ratio to her first and second autos would help.  Maybe 15% AP on first auto, 25% AP on second auto, because a big reason why her attack speed build isn't that great is because ONLY every third auto actually hurts, and you usually only get 1, maybe 2 empowered autos off in a fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2019-05-14T18:48:20.893+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHY WOULD ANYONE THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA!?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meredith Stout","date":"2019-05-14T17:09:39.348+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":50,"body":"XD first hand balancing team\nYou know that Diana is not problem?

Mana changes are really bad when removing the mana back off passive.

E cd buff is really nice and honestly should be that right now and it wouldn't change Diana much but when looking at everything else it's just bad. The r change is soo bad and will just make her feel so much clunkier. \n\nOverall these changes are large overall nerfs to her kit and will make her feel WORSE not better to play.\n\nMy suggestion if you want power neutral is just buff e. Leave everything else as is right now. Just play around with e. It's an ability that has same cd as ult which feels bad and right now only real reason to get it early is for the AS steroid, which is nice for the 1v1-ing and tower pushing. Another possible thing is to add a moonlight interaction with e like if you q-e if consumes moonlight and does something like root for duration or half duration instead of slow or something like that. This would add a degree of complexity to her otherwise very linear kit.\n\nAs complete dumbass (EUW) said there is no reason to try and play Diana as an AP bruiser, like at all. Really bruiser champions just destroy her. You play Diana for the AP assassin. If you're concerned about her 1 shotting people then I'd suggest looking at more meta 1 shot champions first.
