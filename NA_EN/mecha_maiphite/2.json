They&#039;re disgusting little blobs of fat and fur that reproduce uncontrollably, spreading themselves over the map like a cancer. They do nothing but waddle around uselessly while leeching off the snacks of hard-working players. The majority of the playerbase stands with me in my hatred of poros, seeing as how Legend of the Poro King is one of the most disliked RGMs.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to let champions like Nunu eat poros. This would not only help those champions when greedy mage mains clear minion waves before they have a chance to get close, but it would also help limit the spread of poros. Ideally, everyone should be able to attack poros, but then ARAM would just turn into a game of pest control (future RGM, maybe?).\r\n\r\nFeel free to post your ideas on how else we can exterminate the poros.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sAfo6Lv.png","replies":[{"poster":"Okuma","date":"2017-06-20T16:49:32.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy anniversary! :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-20T15:26:36.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:201}} Won't be too happy about this thread at all.","replies":[]}]}
