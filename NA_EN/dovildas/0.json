His mobility is way tooo huge he can dash like huge distance in seconds (the are no champ that can move this fast) \r\n2. Windwall yea its his defence kit but why he has to have this defence since he had his broken mobility?\r\n3. his Q like yea you have to farm it to make that ranged attack.. but with his Q he can easly win lane hight mobility huge ranged attacks well thats op\r\n4.his R his R is like OP but i have to admit like ultimate attack it doesnt do like alot... he is samuray so why he isnt a samuray? now he looks like failed wind mage with a sword....  \r\n\r\nmaybe change his mobility like more cd on dash (that stops his huge mobility or/and atleast he wont be hurted that bad)\r\nwindwall something has to be removed windshield or windwall i preffer windshield cus windwall is cool for him\r\nhis Q..... well samuray isnt a stab mashine so why he has stab to farm from that thronado like failed wind mage? instead make like 2-3 normal hits with sword that can farm a new skill that can release wave of sword (like x form of slash that goes for some range he is samoray not dmn mage)\r\nhis R should be changed for some art of sword not dmn wind magic trick to kick all in air and look like losser... \r\ni think best would be change for his R to like fast dash to his enemie and do burst of dmg and leave like marks (for 1 or 2 seconds) from his sword.. \r\nanyway now im waiting for ur opinions not some yasuo mains that start to flame around (most of yasuo mains can only win with yasuo sad...)","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2018-03-28T11:39:41.189+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is fine, if he counters you then ban him out before you pick, if he doesn't counter you then just learn to fight him","replies":[{"poster":"Dovildas","date":"2018-03-30T16:45:25.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"after runes and masteries change he gone realy strong  armor pen and  100% crits what next ?  special item to yasuo just to make him even stronger,,,, that champ realy needs new kit! same as irelia was needed it but she now will be fine after rework....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2018-03-31T22:42:20.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with giving him a rework is just that. Yasuo is a very unique champ, his mechanics and dashing is what makes him fun to play.
