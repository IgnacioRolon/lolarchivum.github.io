I dislike how much you like the assassin concept and how you don't consider slow paced games rewarding. I'm sure you've directed this season to fit more of your vision, along with other developers help.

All the hard-core players who played for several years got bored of it, and when their gear that only they could get by their elitist raiding clique, became outdated due to expansions and other such stuff, and they could no longer flaunt it to their \"friends\", they got pissy, claimed that WoW was becoming more casual, and quit. Meanwhile, Blizzard is still raking in millions from the people who actually enjoy new content.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-07-16T03:21:22.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ydAqrpb4-ghostcrawler-and-his-failures?comment=0003\n\nhaha, he drinks on the job too apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2016-07-16T17:39:46.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow that's a pretty seriously toxic thread towards ghostcrawler.. poor guy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-07-16T16:02:50.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A company that allows employees to drink liquor at work?

The meta and game skewed towards CDR and while some need it (Kayle) while the rest don't, these people aren't casting abilities much. Tristana blurs lanes with Jinx, Kayle is basically a weaker version of Azir (Different abilities, similar effects when you really loook at it.) and Kog'Maw as the identity of a machine gun but needs Rageblade.

You have a million different factors weighing in on it\nClasses, Racial bonuses, Party perks, enchantments, jobs, specializations, mastery trees, pets, auras, Status effects, Weapon stats etc etc\n\nMeanwhile, LoL, while having less technical Depth as a WoW balance system, has its own issues due to inherent differences in the games, the largest being Items\n\nEvery character in LoL has access to every single Item (Give or take a few special exceptions). This presents a few problems. In WoW this is easier to balance because Items can be Class Restricted. You probably wouldn't see a Druid attempting to slash Deathwing apart with an Infinity Edge, for example.\nIn League the only \"Class Restricted\" Items are {{item:3074}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3085}}\n\nI'm probably just repeating myself over and over at this point, but basically, The two games work completely differently.
