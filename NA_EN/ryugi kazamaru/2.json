While Demacian weapons are, by contrast, both functional and aesthetically pleasing, seemingly valuing symmetry in design, Noxian weapons are anything but.  They&rsquo;re rough, they&rsquo;re brutal, and they are perfectly designed to tear your ass apart in some truly horrifying ways.  Sound interesting?  Well, let&rsquo;s get started...\n\n> #**Weapon Cross-Section and Design:**\n\nhttps://36.media.tumblr.com/2c785ee2e1f5c5e4e454b8d7bc0321b1/tumblr_inline_o21o35QgKB1sb0bc1_540.png\n\nSo, you&rsquo;d thing the V-Shaped cross section would be more useful for cutting, and you&rsquo;d be right.  However, it also means that the cutting edge is more likely to be ruined by extended use, and a little harder to maintain as well.  Considering the standard enemies of Noxus (DEMACIA!!) the cross-section on the right makes more sense for most Noxian weaponry.  But, why is that? \n\nPut simply, the one on the right is beefier, and supported by more material while it still maintains a cutting edge.  The end result is that Noxian bladed weapons would not cut quite as effectively, but they would SMASH opponents wearing ARMOR far more effectively.  You do not cut or carve through armor, and history has shown that blunt weapons typically do better against armored foes, usually by caving in joints or bashing in helmets.  While this approach may not pierce through armor simply by striking the target repeatedly, it would likely serve to keep them off-balance and open to more strikes.  Curved swords did not do as well in medieval Europe when compared to straight swords because they could not navigate through the vulnerabilities as easily as straight, flexible weapons like rapiers or the classic longsword. \n\nCurved blades saw use in cavalry, however, where slashing motions made more sense, or piercing weapons were used to go through plate or mail's vulnerabilities, like joints, but if you had to pick one, then smashing, chopping axes or heavy single-sided weapons would be your best bet to knock your opponent around, and prevent them from getting in close.  And this is what we see reflected in virtually every single Noxian blade design. \n\nSo, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of those weapons...\n\n> #**Invasion Swords and Axe:**\n\nhttps://36.media.tumblr.com/43f55edb47d2d7c2ff809aa2190af580/tumblr_inline_o21ntsmaH11sb0bc1_540.png\n\nThese lovely weapons are primary types used during the Noxian Invasion of Ionia.  How do we know this?  I watched Bard Mountain and picked these bad boys out.  Then I sketched some variations that I saw.  What you are looking at are very, very brutal weapons, for both the swords and the axe.  First, the swords.\n\nThe swords have either a straight or concave blade depending on what you&rsquo;re looking at.  This tells you that, depending on their swing, they can do some different things.  The other side of them is not sharpened, and so, can be used to deflect other blades without fear of ruining a cutting edge.  The curve of the cutting edge means that the blade does some of the slashing for you, even if you swing in a chopping motion, and if you hit an armored target head on, you&rsquo;re likely to impart a good deal of impact force because of how heavy these weapons are in their construction.  They&rsquo;re similar to falcatas or falchions, swords that behave a lot more like axes, made for chopping and impact. \n\nHowever, the curved front end of the sword also means that slashing is an option, but only when you&rsquo;re hitting from the weapon&rsquo;s maximum range, and the lower one still allows for stabbing, which can pierce mail easily as well.  So, against squishy targets with light armor or no armor, you can carve them up easily at a little range, but if they&rsquo;re heavier, you get close and smash and chop them into oblivion.  But, the spiked tip on the upper blade?  Just imagine the backswing flying in at the right angle, and puncturing your plate-mail.  That&rsquo;ll ruin your day...\n\nThe axe is straightforward also.  Scale it up about 5 times and it&rsquo;s also almost identical to Sion&rsquo;s axe in function, just hella bigger, and hella scarier.  Sion&rsquo;s is just a more unfair version of this basic design.  It&rsquo;s double-bladed, and can be used effectively on either side.  The larger flat-bladed section, as noted above, is perfect for bashing and breaking down armored opponent, while still being capable of chopping, while the curved smaller section is ideal for slashing attacks against lighter foes.  A skilled user might even be capable of looping the curve around an enemy&rsquo;s limb before doing unspeakable things to them.  In the end, both of these types are weapons of brutality, and as you&rsquo;ll soon see, this trend continues.\n\n> #**Katarina&rsquo;s Sinister Blades:**\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/cd30d8d12a4124a144773e2eecd4509b/tumblr_inline_o21p9a8aJD1sb0bc1_540.png\n\nSee what I did there?  Thing is, it&rsquo;s the truth.  Katarina&rsquo;s blades are dangerous, despite the awkward curve and bend they have (which they happen to share somewhat with a falcata).  Again, we see the concave edge, which functions exactly like it does in the above weapons.  And, we also have the curved edge in the front for slashing attacks, and the pointed tip for piercing.  AND, because Katarina&rsquo;s handles are straight, it effectively means that she can spin them around, in reverse, and bring those curved tips through armor via a piercing stab and into the unfortunate body of the victim below it exactly like a god-damn raptor claw, or snake fang. \n\nDespite being designed to hack, carve, slash, and pierce, Katarina&rsquo;s blades can also be used in reverse, or in any direction, depending on what she wants to do with them.  They&rsquo;re multi-purpose weapons, and her fighting style is likely to change depending on whatever target she happens to be facing at any given moment.  More often than not, they&rsquo;ll be most effective along the inner edge, near the pointed section, or at the slashing tip, but because they&rsquo;re sharpened all the way around, she can change things up, and still manage to cut you down.\n\nWith her greater mobility, and these weapons, it&rsquo;s no surprise that she can continuously clash with Garen on the field, and keep up with him.  These blades have a lot to do with that, because she can attack in ways Garen&rsquo;s blade can&rsquo;t.  Brutal doesn&rsquo;t mean inefficient...\n\n> #**Riven&rsquo;s Blackstone Runeblade:**\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/84e947eb86c91dcf4be284e48628b628/tumblr_inline_o21pwloY9c1sb0bc1_540.png\n\nI&rsquo;ve already looked into Riven&rsquo;s weapon fairly extensively, so this is familiar territory for me.  Like every other sword on our list, it&rsquo;s a single-edged blade, and that cutting surface is enormous.  The tip of the blade allows for stabbing motions, and the long, curved front section means this huge weapon is going to hit like a damn truck, bust or bend your armor, and impart significant impact force into whatever it hits.  Hit for hit, if Riven can strike you with this thing, it&rsquo;s going to hurt as badly as a solid stroke from Darius&rsquo; axe, if not possibly more, save for just one aspect I&rsquo;ll explain later... \n\nRealistically, no ordinary weapon could parry something of this size without risking the intercepting weapon breaking.  Fiora who?  Yasuo what?  Master huh?  A sword like this is not going to just stop if Riven gets it going, much like Darius&rsquo; axe.  Things like Tryndamere&rsquo;s sword, which shares similar design qualities for that matter, or Garen&rsquo;s sword, or Aatrox&rsquo;s weapon, or Pantheon, Leona, or Taric&rsquo;s shields could probably take a strike without much damage.  But once you get into things of this size, weight, and power, regular weapons just don&rsquo;t hold up.  That&rsquo;s part of what&rsquo;s so scary about Sion&rsquo;s axe too.  Riven, Darius, Sion, all these Noxians could potentially mow down foes with their weapons once they got them going.  You can&rsquo;t stop something that big, with that much force behind it, without magic.\n\nRiven swings this thing with her whole body, and the position of the handle on the blade means the largest chunk of the sword&rsquo;s weight is below the handle, making it perfect for chopping, like a butcher&rsquo;s blade.  The outer curve lends itself well to that, while the large portion of blade material means that, if it doesn&rsquo;t cut you, it still packs a wallop.  If you&rsquo;re not steadfast, you&rsquo;re on the ground, or knocked back and sideways, and Riven can pick you apart at her leisure.  Hell, canonically, she bisected an Ionian lengthwise in her judgment.  That&rsquo;s head to toe, not across the waist.  To do that, you need a lot more force, and this blade provides that in spades on top of Riven&rsquo;s strength. \n\n> #**Not Draven, Draaaaaven:**\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/76bde476f177a8b00f75c60beb54703b/tumblr_inline_o21qrsmXmH1sb0bc1_540.png\n\nAs expected, Draven&rsquo;s throwing axes are more detailed and showy than what I have here, and they&rsquo;re also, arguably, the most ludicrous weapons on this list, simply because of how they&rsquo;re designed.  But, that&rsquo;s Draven for you.  Plausibility aside, because who cares about that, Draven&rsquo;s axes should make you cry, and not with tears of joy because you caught a glimpse of him.  These things are the very definition of brutal.\n\nJust look at that tip.  That&rsquo;s shaped like a scythe, or more correctly, a pickaxe.  Because of how the blade and weapon is designed, it&rsquo;s perfectly along the intended arc that the weapon should follow when it&rsquo;s spinning.  That means it will have maximum penetration force.  Armor isn&rsquo;t going to do crap against something that big flying into you, and if it hits you at the right point, it&rsquo;s going to hurt.  A lot.  Of course, if it doesn&rsquo;t hit just right, well, it&rsquo;ll still hurt, but not as much.  That also goes to show you how skilled Draven actually has to be to use these things, as if the spikes everywhere didn&rsquo;t already tell you that (there are even more spikes on them that I couldn&rsquo;t show on this too).  So, despite him being full of himself, Draven isn&rsquo;t actually a joke.  He&rsquo;s dangerous, and honestly really terrifying when it comes to fighting.\n\nThe thing is, even if Draven decides NOT to throw these at you, they&rsquo;re still going to work perfectly to beat the every-loving crap out of you by puncturing armor or carving flesh and bone into little chunks.  He can pull an Olaf and double-axe you to death.  Oh, and a fun tidbit?  THOSE GOD DAMN TIPS ARE SHAPED EXACTLY LIKE OLD SCHOOL CAN OPENERS.  FUCKING CAN OPENERS.  What do Demacians wear into battle?  Shiny, glorious tin cans called armor.  That&rsquo;s frightening to consider, and very deadly if you happen to really like your plate.\n\nBut the most brutal weapon of them all I saved for last.\n\n> #**Darius the Skull-Miner:**\n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/a646f0e6ca133a177e1fbb296b389462/tumblr_inline_o21rmfE5gM1sb0bc1_540.png\n\nMy drawing of Darius&rsquo; axe does not do the real thing justice (seriously, go look up his model).  So, let&rsquo;s go over basic design functionality.  Darius can wield this monster of an axe in either one or two hands due to the length of the handle, and the curved, larger side means it can slash, as well as carve, depending on how he decides to use it.  This is why Darius is so easily capable of doing spinning and chopping actions.  His weapon is literally perfect for it.\n\nThe enormous weight of the weapon coming down onto solid plate armor will cause it to buckle and deform, and you&rsquo;re not going to be able to block or parry something of this size, unless you happen to be Garen, or Riven, or Tryndamere, or Aatrox, or Kayle etc, and even Kayle is iffy.going by blade alone.  You have to dodge it, or get out of the way.  We also know shields don&rsquo;t do all that much to stop it if he really goes for it, if cinematics count for anything.  Sorry Leona.\n\nThe edge is huge, and the swinging force is tremendous.  Compared to Sion&rsquo;s axe, which is flat in the front and designed primarily for chopping and smashing, Darius can effectively do both depending on where and how he decides to hit an enemy, or a friend that gets to close...  It&rsquo;s a surprisingly multi-purpose weapon for something so huge and brutal.\n\nBut the thing that&rsquo;s most terrifying is the small end, which so much artwork actually gets wrong.  Look at that.  Tell me what that is.  No, I&rsquo;ll just tell you.  That&rsquo;s a fucking spiked, bladed pickaxe, and similar to some medieval battlaxes.  That pointed tip is the single most horrifying thing on any Noxian weapon I&rsquo;ve seen yet.\n\nArmor is useless against the huge impact force concentrated into that single point.  Skulls are toast, even through helmets.  You will be IMPALED and then MANHANDLED around before he either tears the hook out of you in the most brutal, gory display you can imagine, or he will simply carve through you to get to the other three guys next to you.  And you wondered why he has BONUS ARMOR PENETRATION.  That spike is why, and it&rsquo;s absolutely deadly.\n\n> #**In Conclusion:**\n\nEvery single major Noxian melee weapon follows the same basic design principles.  They are all designed primarily for crushing, chopping, piercing, and occasionally slicing.  More often than not, they all rely on impact force and armor penetration to deal with their biggest rivals, Demacia, known for fielding armored soldiers.  From range, or up close, these weapons will find several different ways to ruin your day, simply from design.  This is a culture that is perfectly suited to killing their enemies on the field in as many different ways as possible, all through their chosen weapons.\n\nFrom standard-issue weapons in the Ionian Invasion, to the biggest, baddest weapons in Noxus, to the swiss-army-blades of its top blademasters, or even Talon&rsquo;s big poking blade designed for one strike, one kill (which is all his weapon is primed for via design) Noxus, as an empire, is build upon strength, force, and dominating their enemies with extreme prejudice.  Katarina says &ldquo;Blood for Noxus&rdquo; as one of her iconic quotes, and after looking at all of these weapons, it&rsquo;s no small leap to see why.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryugi Kazamaru","date":"2016-02-05T01:58:25.630+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, elsewhere, I received THIS as a reply about my post.  Wanna make sure I'm accurately representing where such things are due!\n\n> When it comes to swords, \"smashing and chopping\" at a person in armor is terrible. You were right on the more rounded blade being better, but wrong on the why. It wasn’t that it could “smash or chop” or “pierce” armor. When it comes to leather and mail? Yes, sure. But Plate? No. Swords can’t do that to articulated plate. But that’s where the sword’s design comes in.\n> \n> A bit about the longsword first: It is a two handed weapon whose design is similar to the arming sword (the one handed, two edged sword used in conjunction with a shield) that came into being once articulated plate did – knights abandoned the shield since plate armor offered equal protection (and a full suit was only ~50-60 ibs; the whole plate armor is heavy thing comes from jousting armor – a piece of SPORT equipment, not war) and articulated plate offered almost full range of movement the only thing that gave better range was NO armor.  \n> \n> This was done through multiple layers of overlapping plate; and why the long sword’s design was necessary, and why single edged weapons did not work in Europe; we had them, but they were not preferred.  Trying to damage plate armor is HARD; it is tempered steel shaped in such a way that it deflects, rather than absorbs, the blow.  It takes a LOT of force in a very SMALL area to damage it; hence the warspikes on the backsides of hammers and, yes, axes.  These were effective.  BUT there are records (and I have even seen a test) of articulated plate armor protecting an individual from a BALLISTA bolt.  Simply put, a person wearing it has very few areas of vulnerabilities.  And this means, rather than trying to pierce it, you instead went around it.\n> \n> A longsword typically weights some 3-5 ibs.  and has core made up of two metals; one hard, one soft, that are braided together.  This makes the sword strong and flexible; a properly made one can bend at an almost ninety degree angle without any damage done to it what so ever.   Combined with the wider blade of your concave design, this left it perfectly suited for a technique called half-swording.\n> \n> Half swording is when you pinch the blade in the middle with one hand while the other maintained its position on the hilt, (imagine wielding a quarter staff) and suddenly you have a lengthy weapon that you can wield with the precision of dagger.  Combine this with the 6 points used to fight/protect yourself/hurt an opponent (the tip, 2 blades, 2 points at the end of the crossguard, and the pommel) and the binding technique (Binding is when the blades touch and you then feel the muscle movements of your opponent through the blade by the shifting of force against yours and reacting accordingly) and you are now grappling in course quarters, looking to slide the tip of the point through the overlapping plates (those on the joints, arm, hips, and neck) to maim, wound, and kill your opponent; and because of the long sword’s ability to flex and bend, it could do this.\n> \n> That is why that blade design is popular; not because it could “smash and crush”, but because the longsword’s design offered: 6 usable points in combat, a weapon form that allowed for both simultaneous offense and defense, enough cutting/slicing prowess to sever limbs, and in the case of those wearing heavy armor: a long, precise, and flexible weapon that allowed for the circumnavigation of the armor by sliding and bending through the overlapping plates into the flesh beneath.\n> \n> I do apologize for the absolute deluge of asks i sent you with information about the long sword.  Your text on Noxian weapons was lovely and well written, but you had some things in there that I felt the need to correct; you had many good and correct things to say, but i just see the wrong information so often, i didn’t want someone with as wide an audience as you to send it out as well.  As for my credentials: I am a historian as well as a student of both eastern and western martial arts.\n\n\nThis very kind person educated me somewhat about some errors I seem to have made in my big post.  I’m not one to shy away from proper criticism and factual corrections when I make an honest mistake, so I’m sharing all of this with all of you as well.  Our friend here is apparently a historian and a student of martial arts, and thus quite qualified to speak on the matters at hand pertaining to the longsword, and why it’s such a badass weapon. \n\nMy intent was to explain that longswords, in their design alone, don’t pierce armor specifically well, or have any major effect unless you’re targeting joints or any vulnerable areas with the tip, or grappling in manners like they suggested.  The V-Shaped blade would also be less effective at dealing with repeated impacts against armor, if that’s what the weapons were doing, which is also why I suggested that particular edge would be more useful.  The weapons being wielded by the Noxians in my examples are far bigger and bulkier than most real-world equivalents, such is the fantasy aspect, so, while they still might glance off armor, they’ll still carry a good, solid hit behind them, as the impact force distributes through the armored plates of your typical Demacian warrior, for example. \n\nA real-world soldier in articulated plate isn’t going to shrug off a strike from an axe like Sion’s, or a hit from Riven’s blade, for example.  They’re going to feel that quite solidly, and it is very likely that their armor is going to be damaged in such a way as to prevent optimal use, especially if something damages a joint or impairs their vision, or even gives them a concussion or internal trauma, which is the overall point I was attempting to make.  Even if the armor itself is unharmed, the person under it can still take a beating.  This is also a world with magic, so everything I’m saying could be out the window anyway.\n\nThe weapons of Noxus seem to be designed around doing horrible things to targets without heavy armor, and when faced with such enemies IN armor, likely follow through with brute force.  Katarina’s blades, however, are designed to function more like a longsword in that case, not in flexibility exactly, but in flexibility of USE to deal with a variety of targets, armored or not.  She could target joints, unarmored areas, or any host of other places that an armored knight might not be able to see coming.\n\nEither way, I thank this person for offering some insight into the longsword.  I’ll try to edit my post to make it a little clearer pertaining to the longsword, as per their feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"JusticePauldrons","date":"2016-02-06T07:49:09.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another point I would like to make is to reiterate the previously stated point that plate armor is capable of stopping something as powerful and pointed as crossbow and Ballista Bolts. People seem to think that things that are pointed go through armor; they don't. In fact armor was invented for the sole purpose of stopping the enemy from putting their stabby bits into your inside bits. This entire trope of *Piercing > Armor* seems to have originated on the premise of weapons like warpikes and crossbows being effective against armored opponents (commonly depicted in movies, videogames, etc) when in reality these weapons couldn't do anything more to a plate donning badass than any other weapon. Hell, even chainmail with a gambeson was adequate protection against *ALL* forms of cutting and _most_ piercing attacks (save for the situation where a thrust could snap through a chain link, but hey that's what the gambeson was for). Throw on an extra layer of plate armor on top of that? Forget about it.\n\nThe best offensive choice against plate donning opponents was blunt force trauma, it is the same reason why so many arming and two handed swords often had mace like pommels. When all of your cutting and piercing options become unavailable, the only real choice was to try to wear the opponent down or crush their ribs/crack a skull. Even in the case of heavier weapons such as axes, it would be incredibly difficult to land a solid hit on the opponent, as the focused edge would cause it to deflect off of the plate. It is for that same reason that MANY of Noxus' weaponry would lose their savagery when facing an opponent in full armor, because of all their edges, and lack of blunt areas.\n\n {{champion:55}} blades would be just as effective as any other dagger when targetting joints or unarmored areas. Most blows would be easily deflected by armor. Even then, forcing an opponent to target specific points of your body while you target the majority of them is a huge advanage for you as the armored guy.\n\n{{champion:119}} Would be almost entirely useless from a ranged perspective against someone wearing full plate for the same reasons as above. Most of his attacks would just bounce off or be deflected by the armor. Unless he managed to get lucky and land one of the blade points through the visor of a helmet or something insane like that. \n\n{{champion:122}}{{champion:14}}  Would lose all cutting potential, having to rely on sheer momentum to deal damage, even then armor would deflect most of the blow. People aren't static walls, if you get hit with a powerful force, you will be knocked back; which would cause them to move/roll away from the blow if it were powerful enough to deal damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-02-05T11:27:02.581+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"A very detailed and impressive analysis.

It's absolutely huge, and anything that gets hit by that much weapon is going to have a bad day.

It doesn't matter how armored up you are if you soak a blow with enough momentum to overcome your inertia or your stance.  You'll go flying just the same.  Even in fantasy, physics can be a real killer.  The blunted tip is good for chopping, and the rounded section can manage a slashing effect.\n\nBut regardless of WHERE you get hit, Sion's weapon, and Sion, are so big and have so much power behind them, that just getting hit by either of them is going to be a very dangerous prospect for anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Rendarkan","date":"2016-02-05T05:35:53.949+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":">Hell, Sion's axe might weigh more than some fully-kitted soldiers, which means he certainly sends people, literally, flying.

Any thoughts on how it might function?\n\nStated simply, Talon’s blade is for stabbing, maybe some light slashing, and not much else.  Though, theoretically, it could also be used as a defensive implement, like an arm-mounted buckler of sorts.  And, depending on the model or illustration, it might be able to be used to disarm an opponent, but don’t let all that fool you.  Talon’s blade is an offensive kind of weapon, made for stabbing and killing a target in a single stroke.  Or, rather, you’d better hope it kills you, because otherwise, you’re going to be in a LOT of pain afterward from the gaping wound in your body.  \n\nBut you’d be able to have some solace in the fact that a good hit from his blade will leave you to pass out from blood-loss not long after being shanked before you finally die, assuming you didn't die as soon as he hit you.  Talon's weapon is a different sort of blade.  It's still brutal, but it wouldn't work so well on armored targets.  He's an assassin, so killing you instantly with a well-timed strike would fit his style, and that's what his blade would do best.","replies":[{"poster":"Whut Thuh ","date":"2016-02-06T00:40:20.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"low entry size long length thin construction but has little manueberability and as such is intended to stap you in the spine before you can react","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CarameI Frappe","date":"2016-02-05T01:30:02.005+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"..

Demacia is also very strong when it comes to magic with many of their weapons using enchantments and them having good magic use.\n\n**Noxus**\n{{champion:122}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:55}} \nPure brutality and efficiency. Masters of bladed weapons and extremely efficient in what they do. Simple as that. Not quite as armored as Demacia, but their weapons make up for it.\n\n**Freljord**\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:106}} \nA huge mishmash of every form of combat. Freljord is the survival of the fittest at it's best, so it's not surprising that every inhabitant has a vastly different way of fighting, whether it be precise archery or brutal axes and swords. A recurring theme, however, is they are not very heavily armored. Probably the toughest innately of every combatant however.\n\n**Ionia**\n{{champion:98}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:202}} \nA combination of magic and extreme technique in order to fight. Ki, shadows, and whichever path you choose can be attached to your weapon, armor, or even fist to enhance your fighting. Huge on fighting styles, bringing their strength through extremely exotic and technique oriented fighting rather than flat out overpowering their enemies.\n\n**Bandle City**\n{{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:42}} \nI see Bandle City military and all I see is two things. A.) Use of the environment and B.) Pure shock and awe. Yordles use EXPLOSIVE war technology to fight their opponents, using cannons and machines to blast their enemies all over the mountain sides. Then there are the Scouts who are much more adept in the subtle yet deadly fighting style through deadly, poisonous kills. Bandle City is either going to be the loudest army or the quietest squadron.\n\n**Piltover**\n{{champion:254}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:126}} \nExtremely technology based and, might I dare say, hardly even fighters. However, if they do fight, I would say Piltover has the advantage through pure technology. Force fields, electrical pulses, and flight would probably be key things they make use of. To put it simply, as long as they have their technological goodies, they are likely the most adaptable and advanced fighters out there that require attention to detail in order to fight against rather than, similar to Ionia, overpowering them.\n\n**Zaun**\n{{champion:27}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:29}} \nWhile Zaun is at least a little bit technologically advanced, their big advantage is their chemicals and holy crap are they deadly. So deadly, in fact, that even Noxus, a country built on the philosophy of one's strength being his primary way of fighting, used their chemicals. Biological warfare is their expertise and simply breathing the air they are fighting within will likely kill you or do nightmarish things to you.\n\n**Bilgewater**\n{{champion:41}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:105}} \nThe tricksters of the arena, Bilgewater is a mix between strong firepower, similar to Bandle City, and dirty fighting. They don't follow the usual roles of combat, likely using cheap tactics, traps, and such to win a war. While likely the weakest country as far as war goes on land due to them relying on tricks, they kill in the water. The strongest navy of ANY nation in Valoran, a naval fight against Bilgewater spells instant defeat since, for some champions here, even the waters are against you.\n\n**Shurima**\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} \nGods man. They are gods. While their individual army is likely small due to Shurima being a wasteland, they are the definitions of super soldiers. Who cares about brutality, technique, or firepower when you yourself are near invincible and/or can summon an army of infinite soldiers yourself? That is Shurima for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Whut Thuh ","date":"2016-02-10T23:01:40.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}} {{champion:267}}  he he hehe....\n\nkill me please \nlol jk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gear Kitty","date":"2016-02-06T10:17:32.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Ok.**\n{{champion:33}} \nOk.
