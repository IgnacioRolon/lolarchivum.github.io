Most of you know this has been a change we&#039;ve asked about for nearly a full year.  The Rioter who responded to the support ticket has said they can implement the change for us after they alert the correct Rioters.\n\n**THIS MEANS ACCOUNTS POSTING WILL NEED TO BE AT LEAST LEVEL 5**.\n\nSo, if you&#039;re one of those people who have been roleplaying with a Level 1 account, you&#039;ll need to increase it to Level 5.  I don&#039;t have a timeframe to give you, but I can assume it will be fairly soon, and certainly sooner than the year we&#039;ve been waiting.  So, get those smurfs to Level 5, and do it soon.  You can probably do it in just a few hours, and even sooner if you feel you want to buy an EXP boost or something.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to alert all of you to the situation so you&#039;d have time to prepare.\n\nHave a good Sunday.\n\n--Kaz\n\nEDIT:  Also, I'm sure Kam would be willing to work with people if your posting is delayed due to you needing to level the smurf account.  It would make sense since this is sort of sudden, and we don't want to lose people in the transition.","replies":[]}
