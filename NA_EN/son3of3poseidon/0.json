The stats didn't load at the end of the game and now it keeps on trying to get me to load into a game that doesn't exist. I have been trying to log in to play for about a half an hour now. Does anyone know anything I can do to tell the servers I am not in game or any other fix/bypass? Thanks!

At no point during the match did I have a connection issue on my end. It seems to be entirely server side. Really frustrating. I'd appreciate Riot making a formal announcement and find a fix, because pretending this isn't a widespread issue isn't working anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T00:53:02.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ghost games happen because the game never sends a notification that it's over. Essentially the servers still think you're in the game like you said, and it seems like the only fix as of right now is to wait for that match to be properly recorded.","replies":[{"poster":"Son3of3Poseidon","date":"2017-09-21T01:09:31.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen that this bug is really prevalent in NA right now. Do you think it deals with a bug in the code in the most recent patch or more of a server problem? \n\nEdit: Also thank you for the quick feedback. It is greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2017-09-21T01:26:08.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to add some info: It's unlikely (hesitant to say impossible cause I'm sure the minute I do is the minute it happens) to be a result of a code bug in the way I think you intend it.  Ghost games happen because of a problem in the connection between the game server and your client.  Normally when a game ends, the game server sends a message back to your client telling it you're out of game and ready for another one.  Ghost games are what happen when that message gets lost along the way.\n\nTL;DR - Unlikely to be code bug, not whole server problem, but type of connection problem","replies":[{"poster":"Son3of3Poseidon","date":"2017-09-21T02:35:34.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info! I didn't know if it was a bug or what. The connection problem makes sense, but it seems to be on the server side since so many players are having problems in NA.\n\nIt is working again, but I didn't get my quest from playing the PVE game mode.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FPS Over 9000","date":"2017-09-21T01:45:59.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I'll get my last ranked loss erased haha.
