Flaming is against the rules, and there's no exception to that. The mute feature may effectively negate flaming, but it is a _reactive defense tool_. Muting comes _after_ the flaming has started (unless you're a mind-reader or have some outstanding form of prescience), meaning that whatever damage flaming would cause would still get caused - only minimized by the use of the mute feature.\n\nFlaming is punished because its negative effects wholly outweigh any positive effects it might have. Flaming offers virtually no benefit whatsoever, at the cost of team cohesion, morale, and individual sensibility. So, let me ask you; with so many negative effects coupled with so few positives, why shouldn't flaming be punished?\n\nBetween those two factors - flaming having virtually no benefit with great cost, and the only reliable defense tool being a _reactive_ one - there is plenty of good reason for flaming to be punished.\n\nAnd again, it's not a double-standard. A double-standard would be, to use a hypothetical scenario, if Riot only enforced punishments for flaming if you _instigated_, but not if you _retaliated_. _That_ would be a double-standard. But, since flaming of all sorts is against the rules, there's no double-standard here.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2018-12-26T20:34:03.781+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">any \"toxicity\" in the in-game chat is met with bans and punishments that just dont fit the crime at all, riot employees need to understand when 2 sometime 3 other players are being toxic toward you 1 or 2 things are said in return, \n\n Toxicity is never an answer to toxicity.

There is no weight; riot bans with an algorithm that deals in ABSOLUTES.\n\nThe reality also is that people report simply out of spite, and if pre-made, they team up on those outside their group.  I’ve seen it happen on both ends of the spectrum: a summoner who said literally “1” word, who earned a chat restriction while “defending” a teammate, AND I’ve seen chat restrictions towards people who had the most toxic chat logs ever. \n\nIn RIOT’s eyes, these people are equals.\n\nNow, DUE PROCESS is a system within the rule of law that allows people to defend themselves whenever accused, or treated unfairly. Under due process, the summoner in my example who was simply defending another person in the chat log would NOT have been banned; unfortunately, he was outnumbered against a pre-made team.\n\nRIOT doesn’t see empathy in its algorithm. Riot doesn’t see people ganging up on the rando (or outsider). Riot doesn’t differentiate between emotions (surprise, aggression) and banter. They merely check to see if you said a word on their list, and if so, then, was it reported. Check. Check. Ban. (No due process).\n\nThe human element is completely ignored by the current algorithm. So what happens afterwards? You lose honor levels, end of season rewards (unrelated punishment imo), etc. all because of an unjust chat restriction placed upon you.\n\nGoing further than that, permabans and chat restrictions encourage people to create additional accounts (so the primary issue of toxicity doesn’t really get solved, or swayed).

The IFS doesn't care if you've been reported a lot, and it doesn't care if you use a single curse word.

Four reports, nine reports, one report, however many - all have the same weight.\n\n> They merely check to see if you said a word on their list, and if so, then, was it reported.\n\nThat only applies to cases of hate speech/encouragements of self-harm.

Four reports, nine reports, one report, however many - all have the same weight.\n> \n> That only applies to cases of hate speech/encouragements of self-harm.

Open Lane,” then both parties are punished.\n\nThat isn’t right! Had it not been for the trolls, the other party would’ve not been punished. Clearly the trolls instigated additional bans by getting on everyone’s nerves. People don’t like having their time wasted in such games, and riot comes along and penalizes all of them, because they ALL report each other. \n\nI can’t spell it out any clearer than that. You don’t have to be a toxic player to get banned or restricted, just pissed off is enough to warrant a brutal penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-27T04:34:51.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Non-Toxic players can still get chat-restrictions and bans, because the current system is seriously flawed and I’ve personally seen it happen.\n\nNon-toxic players can still get chat restrictions and bans because you don't have to be toxic to break the rules.\n\nIf you've seen someone get punished without breaking the rules, provide links.

The troll/griefer goes without saying, and the person who opens lane gets punished too, because _opening lanes is against the rules._\n\n> Had it not been for the trolls, the other party would’ve not been punished.\n\nNo, had it not been for their decision to throw up their hands and say \"fuck it, I quit\", they wouldn't have been punished. Had it not been for their decision to break the rules, they would not have been punished.\n\nThe trolls do not make the decisions for the other players. If someone opens lane, they get punished. And they can't pin that decision on the troll.\n\n> I can’t spell it out any clearer than that. You don’t have to be a toxic player to get banned or restricted, just pissed off is enough to warrant a brutal penalty.\n\nIt's one thing to be pissed off, it's another thing altogether to spill that anger into chat or into the game.\n\nAnd the penalties are only brutal if you're a repeat offender who makes it up to the ban tiers, and even then, they're still harsh but fair.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hazy Shade","date":"2018-12-27T04:54:27.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SovereignKing,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=zkyvpEXE,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2018-12-27T01:45:35.848+0000)\n>\n> ************************\n> I agree w/ you to some extent: “Don’t feed the trolls” or “Don’t fan the flames;” however, the reality is, Riot has an algorithm where a single curse word (either direct or not) coupled w/ you already having several reports against you (again games w/ 1+ curse words) DOES in fact warrant brutal chat restrictions towards you. \n> \n> Whether you played 10 games and said “F$&amp;@k” once per game and it goes reported, or you played 10 games and cursed 20x, then in both cases, bans are issued. There is no weight; riot bans with an algorithm that deals in ABSOLUTES.\n> \n> The reality also is that people report simply out of spite, and if pre-made, they team up on those outside their group.  I’ve seen it happen on both ends of the spectrum: a summoner who said literally “1” word, who earned a chat restriction while “defending” a teammate, AND I’ve seen chat restrictions towards people who had the most toxic chat logs ever. \n> \n> In RIOT’s eyes, these people are equals.\n> \n> Now, DUE PROCESS is a system within the rule of law that allows people to defend themselves whenever accused, or treated unfairly. Under due process, the summoner in my example who was simply defending another person in the chat log would NOT have been banned; unfortunately, he was outnumbered against a pre-made team.\n> \n> RIOT doesn’t see empathy in its algorithm. Riot doesn’t see people ganging up on the rando (or outsider). Riot doesn’t differentiate between emotions (surprise, aggression) and banter. They merely check to see if you said a word on their list, and if so, then, was it reported. Check. Check. Ban. (No due process).\n> \n> The human element is completely ignored by the current algorithm. So what happens afterwards? You lose honor levels, end of season rewards (unrelated punishment imo), etc. all because of an unjust chat restriction placed upon you.\n> \n> Going further than that, permabans and chat restrictions encourage people to create additional accounts (so the primary issue of toxicity doesn’t really get solved, or swayed).\n\nSomeone else responded to most of this and explained more succinctly than I could how misinformed you are on how the system works so I won't rehash it.\n\nI was being rhetorical when I asked what due process was. This isn't the legal system. These are rules set up by a company that say follow them or leave which you agree to do when you sign up. \n\nYour 'defense' is prebuilt every game by not breaking the rules. If for some reason it is legitimately an error, a support ticket can be opened. \n\nIt seems like you keep fishing for a way to break the rules but be able to get out of the punishment through some justification except there aren't any. Riot doesn't say, \"Please do not use homophobic slurs or you will get chat restricted **UNLESS** the other person called you a feeding monkey brained dog poop and stole all of your jungle camps.\" There are no exception clauses. \n\nI'm going to throw my anecdotal evidence in here. I've played the game for a while. I've flamed, told people they are feeding, they sucked, argued, and been afk. The only punishment I've received is a extended timer thing for afk. Why for nothing else? I assume it's because I don't do these things often and I try to get myself back under control when I do. Does honor give you a cushion maybe? So when people say they get in trouble for saying fuck, you have to see how I'm going to seem highly skeptical.","replies":[{"poster":"JayB33","date":"2018-12-27T08:19:44.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or because people haven’t reported you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hazy Shade","date":"2018-12-27T12:30:19.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jobent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=zkyvpEXE,comment-id=000a0000000000010000,timestamp=2018-12-27T08:19:44.964+0000)\n>\n> Or because people haven’t reported you.\n\nOh that's logical; since season 3 I've not been reported.

Set aside everything else and imagine you are doing _something_ but it turns out that something is causing another person pain. You can A. Stop doing _something_ and do something different to stop causing this person pain. Keep in mind that changing has no material effect or negative impact on you. Or option B. Is to continue doing _something_ regardless of the pain you may be causing someone else. \n\nPS saying that you have gay friends or black friends is pretty much a red flag to anyone in the history of time that you don't.
