So lets say the brambleback has -40 armor, and you have an ability that reduces the target&#039;s armor by 40%. -40 x .4 is -16\r\n -40 - (-16) is -24\r\nAm I misunderstanding something, or do these abilities actually increase the durability of the camp?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-04T01:12:06.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you completely messed up your math.\n\n-40 + -16 = -56. You always use addition when adding numbers (duh), if the number being added is positive, the total goes up, if it is negative, it does what you would expect (goes down)..\n\nEffects that reduce armor/mr by a percent likely do nothing under 0 MR, or, they are reversed and use division instead of multiplicatio(?)\n\nIncidentally, the calculation for damage is different under 0 MR/armor, the wiki has details on the armor page. Reducing armor below 0 has less effect on damage than an equal increase above 0 does (but it is still significant, as Lolethality showed)","replies":[{"poster":"ImaSpacePotato","date":"2017-04-05T03:50:51.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it says reduced by X amount, so fin it is reduced by 40%, 40% of that armor is removed. However, that second but does seem really interesting. Thanks for the info.","replies":[]}]}]}
