One of Kassadin's most defining personality traits is that he thinks his family is dead. He's currently on a reckless \"nothing left to lose\" rampage against the void and doesn't seem to care about sharing his knowledge about the void hearts with others. \nIf Kassadin were to learn Kaisa is alive, it would lead to a drastic change in character, which is probably why the voice lines are set up to show they haven't met.","replies":[{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2018-11-16T18:02:07.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Kass is not her dad.

Can you give the source for that?\n\nFor Kai'Sa, her lore states that her friends and family, **who were trapped in the caverns**, died. There is no mention of her family that wasn't present on that day, aka her father. The exact quote is\n> Kaisa regained consciousness to find herself trapped underground. She was filled with crippling fear, but there was still hope; she could hear the faint cries of other survivors. They called out to each other feebly, repeating their names one by one like a mantra. Sadly, by the third day, hers was the only voice left. Her friends and family were all gone. She was alone in the darkness.\n\n\"Gone\" doesn't necessarily mean dead, just that they are not currently present.\n\nAdditionally, Kai'Sa has voice lines towards Kassadin that leave little room for doubt:\n> Huh, memories of my father come at the strangest moments.\nReunions can be so bittersweet.\nCould it.. be true?\nIt smells like home here.\nFather?\n\nBut I get where you're coming from.

First, Riot literally did research on the psychology of victims of traumatic events to get a better grasp of what kind of people they are, at least the ones that survive. One of things they noted that are most important to such victims are their memories of happier times as a way of having hope for happier times in the future. Kai Sa is obsessed with her memories and she constantly reminds you and herself of what's important, as if this were a compulsion for her. It's pretty clear here that her own mental stability is hardened to the point that horrors aren't even a dent to her. The way is see it, she's simply numb to it all and the only thing she bothers to focus on is her memories and her mission to stop the void. Next, is her suit. It's acceptable at worst, and fitting at best. I don't understand why people complain so much about this when jinx literally has a bikini and boot shorts. Kayn and Braum are literally shirtless models. No one complains about the sexual nature of characters unless it has to do with females that even remotely have curves. She's wearing a skin-tight void monster. Why is it skin tight? Because it literally replaces her skin and is hard as steel. Swords bounce off it without so much as a scratch. There is much more evidence that this void creature takes a physical toll rather than a mental one. It feeds on other void creatures, so its cannibalistic, and shows no inclination that it would feed on someone's sanity. It is also very possible that this voice creature has regenerative properties which would explain Kai Sa's lack of scars. Above that, is the complaint that she isn't void enough. The flaps on her legs open and under them is what this creature did to her thighs. They are literally purple void flesh with no human qualities about them. For all we know, the only human part of Kai Sa left is her face and neck. Even then, when she wears her mask, she becomes a cold-hearted predator. You can hear the changes in her voice and tone when she wears it. One final note, it is not confirmed that Kassadin is her father. There are a few lines that suggest that it may be the case and my bet is that Kass is her father, but we don't know and it hasn't been confirmed. She only refers to Kassadin when he's a game with her and as far as both of them know, their families are all dead. There is nothing left for them to linger on.\n\nPS.
