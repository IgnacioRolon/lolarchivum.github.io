I live in Texas. I started playing today and randomly started experiencing in game lag to where I can't last hit the minions or it shows that the gold is delayed. I did a repair on my client too and tried a custom game. My ms is 41-43 but still experiencing the floating around champions and minions. Anyone know how to possibly fix this?
