What's really weird is that it tends to be inconsistent, and it always seems to happen when my internet outside of the game is fine (I've performed speed tests and my ping/download speed are at normal levels). My ISP here is Comcast Xfinity, and previously I had CenturyLink. \n\nWhen I'm just in the client, it seems like everything is either a few seconds late or not connecting at all. For example, I'll click on the summoner profile and it takes a few seconds to load....but then sometimes it's fine.\n\nWhen I initiate custom games, it takes several seconds longer than usual to add bots and to select my champion, and even when I load into them, there will be a recurring glitch where I'm stuck at the fountain and invisible for a number of seconds before my champion model appears (this usually lasts long enough for the bots on my time to reach the middle of their lanes). Then in game, everything will be fine, my ping will be at its average level, and suddenly my champion animations go out of whack. My champion will not appear to move or operate properly although game functions appear to be ongoing (minions keep taking damage from my now invisible auto attacks and abilities, etc.). And when minions die during these brief passages, they appear to still be standing with their health bars having disappeared, only to fall a few seconds later and give gold. When the lag goes away after a short interval, I will have often moved a short distance away and most likely died to Fizz bot ._. And the recall animation is also messed up with it failing to even register on-screen and a significant bit of time elapsing before I reach the base after disappearing from my recall spot.\n\nThis is already pretty long, so in the words of Billy Mays \"BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!\"\n\nWhen I join a lobby to play a normal game, I also run into a lot of issues. For instance, when I invite a friend to a group queue, it will say they have joined the room, but their banner(if it's called that....it looks like a banner....the wavy thing with their icon and position selections on it) will not be visible in the lobby for a short amount of time. Then, when I try to select my positions, they take several seconds (20, 30) to even register with only the loading circle appearing in both. When my positions are selected and I enter the queue is when the fun really begins. The AFK check works fine, seemingly, as I haven't been knocked out of a queue for not clicking it in time, but champ select is another story. I am often several seconds behind the flow of champ select when it is my turn to pick or ban, with it saying I have 28 seconds to pick when in reality I have 3. Sometimes, the client does not even show that I am supposed to be picking, with the only indicator being my friends groaning on skype when we are kicked from champ select with a 5 minute wait.\n\nOnce in normal games, many of the same issues occur as in custom games, with champion models freezing, opponents not becoming visible, etc. \n\nThe nature of these issues leads me to believe that it is either some random lag issue with my internet or with the client itself, however, my internet outside of the game seems normal (web pages load in the regular amount of time, I can watch videos just fine with standard buffering problems, etc.) Are these issues known, and if so can anything be done about them? I basically can't play league at my new house currently, so a fix would be highly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T20:25:03.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like there are intermittent issues with your connection to the server, likely in the form of packet loss.
