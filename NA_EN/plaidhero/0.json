Fun to play, granted we pretty much just messed around. Picked 3 mages and sent our ADC top with one of them and another mage bot with a support. Part way through, the other team accused us of cheating and unfair play because we sent 2 top. Seriously? Is this how League players think? That every single game needs to be the cookie cutter mage mid, top laner, jungler, and adc with a dedicated support bot? That's so boring. Yes it's how it's always been done, but that's why it's boring. My issue is that Riot is inadvertently supporting this meta. They create champions who fit into a specific meta role, and more often than not, they do not and cannot excel outside of that predetermined role. In my opinion, this strategy of design seriously hinders the game. Not only does it not allow for interesting new playstyles with different champions, but it discourages it. We aren't rewarded for trying different styles of play, simply left with a frustrating game. I don't want to use Dota as an example, but I will. Most champions in Dota can be picked and put into any role. Bloodseeker. He can jungle, solo, go mid, maybe be in a duo lane. The point is, wherever he goes, unless he's competing to farm, he doesn't fall off due to it. He isn't punished for trying something new, only put a little behind if that. I really don't like this idea of Riot making a champion, and then telling us EXACTLY where they belong. I don't want to be told how to play a game. I want to play it my way. \r\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong. Some champions and heroes are made to be stronger in different areas. I'm not asking to erase that. I still want heroes like Soraka with a dedicated heal and kit centered around battlefield disruption. My point is, I don't want my only option for champions be what they were created for. Hell, they shouldn't even be created for a specific role. They should be created because a kit is fun and interesting. League has reached a point where it's champion design and number doesn't have to be so concrete and cookie cutter anymore. Yes, new champions do have some pretty cool abilities. But if I wanted to take a Vel'Koz duo, I'm sure I'd be yelled at. Despite him possessing a ton of slows and knockups, because Riot said he's a mid mage, that's how people think he should be played and will never ever view him any other way. And chances are he won't work any other way. I don't like that.","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2014-11-11T03:01:52.256+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"let Mundo go where he pleases","replies":[{"poster":"Sara Leah","date":"2014-11-11T03:18:03.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"mundo already goes where he pleases","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2014-11-11T03:20:34.035+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"people might complain about it though. i have no idea how effective adc mundo is.","replies":[{"poster":"BuyMeSkinsPls","date":"2014-11-11T03:34:35.545+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"> people might complain about it though. i have no idea how effective adc mundo is.\n\nAbout as effective as AD Soraka","replies":[{"poster":"Ulfgar Torunn","date":"2014-11-11T14:18:00.339+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"And then you realize that Mundo has a 100-200 AD steroid, a movement speed boost, damage mitigation, and a quasi-permaslow.\n\nNot to mention the best crit animation in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulric Greatsword","date":"2014-11-12T01:56:57.745+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think new Sion has the best crit animation, actually.

The only problems with this is it makes the enemy jungler usually gank middle lane more, making the need for mobility in the middle lane increase and it also means your team will need to be coordinated in order for each carry to get the needed amount of gold to succeed. But lately after the big carry buffs, two carries is an extremely devastating combos, especially since you will also have two supports to dispense sustain, crowd control, and overall control of a teamfight.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDerrickHenry","date":"2014-11-12T00:48:39.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know how experience works?

Levels are powerful, yes, but a 2v1 is still a 2v1. Also, with the supports lately and how ADCs work, you can simply ward and escape easily with a ADC like Tristana, a tank like Braum, or Thresh lantern. You are looking at this on paper when I doubt you have ever made an actual team composition out of it. You say the jungler will go to the enemy jungle and farm on their blues and reds and various monsters, but that can all be countered by simply warding and your duo lanes can pick them up at the start of the game each for a huge early game advantage. Or Middle Lane can take it. Suddenly, bottom/top lane walks into lane with a Level 1 Red Buff, Middle Lane walks into lane with blue buff. Suddenly the lanes have a huge advantage and, with the Season 5 changes to Red Buff, you can push down towers much quicker early game due to the bonus true damage.\n\nEarly Game\nLanes walk out. Middle lane and the lane closest go to blue and the other lane goes to red, depending on what team you are. Bottom/Top Lane can effectively harass or kill the enemy with Red Buff as well as increasing their pushing and farming power slightly. Middle Lane gets a huge benefit of being able to spam spells with ease and allowing them to bully their enemy out of lane. Top Lane is going 2v1 so they don't need a buff to help since they already have the advantage, only being behind by usually 1-2 levels from then on once they both reach Level 3. When the buffs respawn, the closest lane can get Red and Middle Lane can get Blue again to gain back the advantage again AND deny them from the enemy jungler. The enemy jungler can go ahead and farm in the enemy jungle but they will find themselves gaining little benefits and using much more of their time farming than ganking when they could gain equal gold by simply farming from their own jungle by going between the constantly respawning monsters.\n\nGood Top ADCs: {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:110}} \nGood Top Supports: {{champion:201}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:25}} \nTop Lane becomes home to the more aggressive supports that limit their opponents crowd control and/or mobility while having decent mobility themselves. The ADCs become the equally mobile and aggressive early game carries that can be found in current Bottom Lane such as Caitlyn, Ezreal, and Graves. Quinn and Urgot also have a home since they gain a support. Quinn becomes a much more aggressive ADC Fighter that can match the enemy Top Lane from a range and Urgot becomes a super harass champion that never really has to put himself in danger of a gank.\n\nGood Middle Lanes: {{champion:34}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:115}} \nSuddenly these Mages become 100% more aggressive from the blue buff, enough to keep them safe to build items to continue their advantage.

They want easy wins. That's why so many people are happy to take a free win due to feeders/afks on the opposing side. They LOVE it. It's free elo and that's what the majority want. They want to be the \"top\" player without any effort.\n\nThe easiest way they see of doing this is following the meta strictly.\n\nIt's funny because I'm in Silver rank (I jumped right into ranked after level 30, so yeah... I kind of had it coming) but it's funny to see people at this level arguing about people going outside the meta. Like I say I'm going Quinn mid and people lose their minds. I've had people dodge, say \"gg we lost\", call me an idiot/noob/troll/whatever. Pretty much heard it all.

Riot likes breaking the meta just as much as the pros do (Look at Jayce breaking into worlds.)  \n\nYes, the meta exists and many people are too stuck in the mud to do anything else.  You're going to run into those people because they only want to win instead of just fool around and have fun.  Don't let that get to you.  Learn the meta and have fun with it, but don't forget that ADCrit Nasus is still fun as heck to pop people with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OrangePulp","date":"2014-11-11T03:20:14.767+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would say that most people don't think that going outside the meta is cheating; don't let a few random people color your view of the whole player base. To be honest, when I see something outside the norm, I'm usually pretty thankful, because it tends to be an easier match. The main reason the meta exists is that it's generally the most optimum way to play the game.\n\nAs for champion role placement and how it compares to DotA 2, I think League is simply a more structured game than DotA. I can't say one is objectively better than the other, although I much prefer League myself. I find it interesting to compare it to something like basketball: You can put five centers on the court if you really want to, but that's not going to win you games. Sometimes teams will run with small lineups (four guards and a PF for a lot of offense) or big lineups (a twin towers setup with two centers in), but most of the time you have a fairly typical team makeup. You can see the same thing in league: you might run an adc mid, or go for a really offensive kill lane bot, but either way you're still building around the core concept. And I think there are advantages to that; by having a designated meta which includes a jungler, they can focus on what will make that fun and interesting, and do cool things like the upcoming jungle changes.","replies":[{"poster":"PlaidHero","date":"2014-11-11T03:28:07.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just want variety and to not be punished for trying something outside of the norm.

Just wanted to say, you can jungle dazzle or possibly support blood. Dazzle's heal also is a nuke depending on how many units there are. A way to abuse this is going into the jungle with a few couriers following you, and using the heal to nuke the jungle creeps. This even works on the magic immune mud golems because his spells deal physical damage. \n\nAnd since they changed BS with the AoE delayed silence, he can now play as a ganker, carry, nuker, or possibly support. (Ganker with Urn, Eul's to stop TP, etc, Carry with Basher, AS items, and BKB, Nuker with the reworked Q which makes the target take and deal more damage meaning you can use your Q on an enemy use Dagon on them (magical burst item), and burst them down, or support with ganking once he hits 6 with his AoE silence, and ulti (which I heard is one argument a LoL dev used as hidden knowledge or anti-fun or something like that).","replies":[{"poster":"MEMEME670","date":"2014-11-12T20:09:41.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jungle dazzle by...wasting 300 gold on 2 couriers, and then if the enemy ever invades they can easily kill one or both couriers, giving them a solid amount of gold and ruining your potential to jungle...

You have to know what the skill does before you play against him in order to do well, because it doesn't communicate effectively (or atleast, didn't in the original DotA) what it's doing to you, so new players run away (which is the logical thing to do when ganked) and die but don't know why, and then are stuck doing this until they look up BS and memorize his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"windwolf777","date":"2014-11-12T21:38:37.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Jungle dazzle by...wasting 300 gold on 2 couriers, and then if the enemy ever invades they can easily kill one or both couriers, giving them a solid amount of gold and ruining your potential to jungle...

You never brought up the skill of enemy players or rage of ally players. I merely said, Dazzle can jungle. (And I think Dazzle Jungle gets more than 2 because the heal increases based on the number of units being affected)(As of now max of 4 ((himself and 3 other targets) at level 1)\n\nBloodseeker changed. Q is now a steroid that makes the afflicted hero (allied or enemy) take and deal increased damage, get on kill heal (of anything), and if a hero give 25% of their HP to the killer). Also, he has a delayed AoE silence. So if he gets a Eul's (2.5 sec tornado) to keep them in the AoE, he can silence, and use the Q to give sustain as a support. \n\nYes, I do know about the burden of knowledge argument. Which I find kinda stupid and insulting to LoL players. (Are the devs saying that they're too stupid to read and learn about a hero? ((off topic question aside (((I don't mean I'm calling LoL players stupid because I am one too now but sorry.)). However, if you look at the debuff on you once it's cast, it says \"Deals a percentage of the distance you move as damage.\" Meaning right there look at the debuff \"Oh, I move, I take damage. I probably shouldn't move\" Plus  But don't you think that learning what EVERY champ & item & mastery & rune & page & debuff, etc, etc does is a burden of knowledge? Not to mention learning the effective rune and mastery pages, items, etc is a burden of knowledge? And dota 2 also has a wiki where you can learn. Just the same as LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"MEMEME670","date":"2014-11-14T01:25:05.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I mean, if you don't take in the skill of enemy players or the rage of ally players then the point is moot, because that means in League basically anyone can jungle (every ranged char can micro well enough with the correct runes // masteries and smite, and I mean, when given a leash, what melee char can't either?). \n\nThe OP is talking about realistic character/role diversity, and that is the context of this discussion. Don't forget that.\n\nI knew that when I posted but I forgot q heal was on everything. He could maybe be fine, but I don't like the idea of my carries sustain being on only when they're extremely weak to basically any damage from the enemy, especially because all he can do is try to w it, which without euls or some other form of cc is always going to miss, and is half his mana pool early game.\n\nYou're misrepresenting (or misunderstanding) the BoK point. The point is that, for a large subset of new players who are exposed to bloodseeker, this is what will happen. (NOTE: This is in DotA 1, as the argument was made when DotA 2 didn't exist yet, and DotA 2 has overcome this specific instance of it.)\n\nHe comes and ganks them post-six, they run and die for apparently no reason (the dude hasn't even touched them.) and they have no way of knowing what happened. Your debuffs are gone once you die, there's no death recap, etc.\n\nAnd this will happen basically as long as BS continues to gank their lane, because when they don't know why they died they can't stop it. And when they're being ganked they have no time to check their debuff bar (I'm not sure original Rupture even had a descriptive debuff anyway) to find out. \n\nThat's not to say some players won't figure it out quickly, or wiki him beforehand, it's just saying that it will for some players make the game way less interesting because of the way it works. And that's not very good to have in a game. \n\nRunes, masteries, even most hero abilities are nothing like this.
