So I&#039;ve had this thing about spell critical strikes in mind for a while now, so I&#039;ve tried to implement it onto an item, that could possibly make the game a little more interesting, at least for mages or generally AP champions. So without further ado, here is the item:\r\n**\r\nHextech Electrolens**\r\n+ 80 Ability Power\r\n+ 10% Cooldown Reduction\r\n+ 300 Mana\r\n_UNIQUE Passive: Hextech Sight_ - Your abilities have a _(100% of your Cooldown Reduction)_% chance to deal bonus _(50% of bonus AP)_ Magic damage to enemy champions upon hitting them. \r\n_UNIQUE Passive: Enchanted Vision_ - Increases the cast range of your abilities by 15%.\r\n\r\n_**Recipe:**_\r\n\r\n{{item:3802}}   +  {{item:3108}} \r\n\r\n_Lost Chapter (1300 Gold)_ + _Fiendish Codex (900 Gold) _+ _Combine Cost (800 Gold) _= **3000 Gold**\r\n\r\n_**Cost Analysis:**_\r\n\r\n80 Ability Power = _1740 Gold_\r\n10% Cooldown Reduction = _267 Gold_\r\n300 Mana = _420 Gold_\r\n\r\n_The Gold Efficiency of raw stats is **80,9%.**_\r\n\r\nAt 500 bonus Ability Power and 45% Cooldown Reduction, the average amount of bonus damage dealt by _Hextech Sight _ is _(500/2 x 45%) = **112,5 Magic damage per ability hit.**_ I believe that the low cost efficiency of raw stats is balanced by the amount of damage this item can provide in late game, averaging at 112,5 damage per enemy hit by a single ability (this can however happen multiple times per ability cast, so the damage can ramp up substantially). \r\n\r\n_**Clarification**_\r\nTo clarify, the critical strike can happen multiple times with a single ability, for example {{champion:103}} &#039;s Q can pass through multiple enemies and it can critically strike all of them for the bonus damage. The critical strike&#039;s damage can be reduced by Magic Resist, as it is Magic damage.\r\n\r\n_Enchanted Vision_ increases the cast range of your abilities, naturally increasing range of skillshots or targeted abilities by 15%. This does **not **increase radius of abilities such as {{champion:45}} &#039;s E. If e. g. {{champion:99}} buys  this item, the range of her R is increased from 3,340 to 3841, but the ability&#039;s width is not increased. \r\n\r\n_**Conclusion**_\r\nHextech Electrolens are designed to be a late game item, pretty much like {{item:3089}} , however with more emphasis on utility and RNG instead of raw ability power bonus. My thoughts are that rushing this item is pretty bad because of its low cost efficiency, but the more ability power and cooldown reduction you build, the more powerful it becomes. Of course, single target abilities are far less efficient than abilities that can deal damage to multiple targets.\r\n\r\n_**Please do let me know what can be improved and if you&#039;d like to see this item in game by writing down a comment below!**_","replies":[{"poster":"HotarÂµ","date":"2018-11-15T18:23:57.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the concept is pretty neat (especially magic critting which I've always wanted to be a thing) but this item would be a must-purchase on every mage in the game.\n\n Personally, I would change it to something like:\n\n>**Hextech Electrolens**\n+75 Ability Power\n+5% Cooldown Reduction\n+250 Mana\n______________\nUNIQUE Passive: Hextech Sight - Your abilities have a (0-65%) chance to deal bonus (30% of bonus AP) Magic damage to enemy champions upon hitting them. This chance increases the further away you are from enemy champions and level.\n\n>UNIQUE Passive: Mind Visions - Critically striking an enemy champion restores 7% of your missing mana. This effect can only occur once every 15 seconds.\n______________\n>Recipe: \n{{item:3802}}  (1300 Gold) + {{item:3108}}  (900 Gold) + Combine Cost (800 Gold) = 3000 Gold \n\n >OR:\n{{item:3802}} (1300 Gold) + {{item:3145}} (1050 Gold) + Combine Cost (650 Gold) = 3000 Gold\n\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention why I said stuff like this. The reduced stats are to make it a more niche pick (not a must purchase on everyone) and to cater a bit more towards mana hungry champions. Pretty similar to Runic Echoes, in a way. I couldn't really think of a better way to work in the magic-critting but I'd love to hear your revamped take on the item!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-11-16T11:06:26.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove the bonus cast range passive and we're good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myren Quiddle","date":"2018-11-16T09:56:10.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't all Hextech (final) items have actives?","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-15T18:14:48.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would allow champions like Karthus and other champions poke at a really safe range.\ncast time reduction **TOGGLE** is better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hochelaga","date":"2018-11-15T18:04:45.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why would you call this item ''hextech'' when there's no hextech revolver in the recipe?\n\nThe fact that this item gives everything a mana mage would want and on top of that give a 15% increased cast range, it would make this item MANDATORY in every build possible. Thus, very bad as it would not worsen the current situation where mages are bound to buy specific items.\n\nConcept is not bad, but problem is making this item almost mandatory for every mages.","replies":[]}]}
