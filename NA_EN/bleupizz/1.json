Riot Games went too far this time with this prestige milking money at first we thought this gonna be just for the KDA than they went even more and now apparently looks like we will get this damned prestige skin in every time.\r\nNow how did this garbage prestige effect bad on the game well let&#039;s start with missions no longer reward the same since they put the prestige you only get 5 or 10 tokens per mission and the Orb price went from 50 Tokens to 300 and Master Chest goes from 35 to 150 ????!!! And many things changed in the hextech shop and became overpriced all this just to force the players to buy your damned ticked that cost nearly as much as legendary skin.\r\nAnd what&#039;s the prestige is&#039;t even worth it ? it&#039;s so stupid no one cares about if you have it or not all what Riot do is change the color from the normal to golden color it&#039;s literally chroma but Riot fooling you all making you think that they got you something original when it&#039;s the same chrome that you will find in the normal shop.\r\nEvent no longer feels the same it&#039;s going down hill because of this stupid prestige idea. This NEEDS TO STOP.","replies":[]}
