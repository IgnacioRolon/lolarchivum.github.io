Some sets I&#039;ve tried out, Vincent&#039;s Aery Draven, Kleptomancy Draven and Fleet footwork Draven. Currently pros are mostly using Klepto and fleet footwork on Draven. If you check the Draven reddit, it seems a&#039;lot of players like myself are losing a&#039;lot of games with Draven. It seems the most problematic issue is getting started early game, so starting {{item:3302}} can make up for that, but when you get mid game your counters are already snowballing. I know there are a&#039;lot of Draven haters, but this champ is a really good champion that I have enjoyed playing since i started last year. I can&#039;t seem to enjoy playing him now as it feels like a chore to compete with the current meta, would really like to know other peoples opinion on this. {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"undesirable team","date":"2018-01-10T22:03:50.307+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"brand gets compensated for loss of deathfire yet draven gets nothing for loss of fervor?

Problem is that Grasp just doesn't feel anywhere near as powerful since every other keystone just got more powerful. Makes him kind of hit or miss in lane whereas before he was a pretty solid safe pick. Also alot of top laners are too strong right now (GP, Nasus).\n{{champion:6}} is split between wanting PtA for his W and Comet for the poke. Old runes allowed him to stack fervor to make his W and passive pretty damn potent. He lost alot of damage when switching to PtA and it feels like just getting the proc off and ditching is better than going full-on when trading unlike before. He feels more hit and run rather than how he used to be which was get in and stay in. This is why Comet is being used instead and I've started using it as well. Also can't help but feel the AS from PtA is wasted on him since he only trades with single shots or his W which doesn't scale with AS.\n{{champion:72}} Feels okay with the runes. Problem is he has always been a late game jungler and with so much damage packed into the early game, he just feels really out of place (which rito has recognized but he still feels meh).\n{{champion:421}} tbh i don't even know how to play this champion right now. Haven't had a game with her in preseason or 8.1 yet where I felt like I was actually strong at any point. Still great at getting early snowballs going just due to how she functions, but she doesn't feel any different which means she feels like she didn't get the buff that many others did from runes.\n\nNow I actually like the new runes and like the direction they took. They just still need to continue tuning it alot more cuz there are still so many outliers on both the underpowered and overpowered side and a whole lot of champions that are doing okay but just feel bad to play as with new runes (pretty much all the above, may just take getting used to though).","replies":[{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2018-01-12T02:37:24.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:72}} feels much better with summoner spellbook to me.

The rune page is trash after selecting keystone.\n \nAery is good early for harassing, but it pushes your wave for taking minion aggro for autoing enemy. Mid-Late aery is trash, and the rune page is trash except for Scorch.\n\nPTA only does about 700 whole bonus damage in a whole game. While Electrocute would do like 2.5k damage. Darkharvest is basically RNG, you either do 500 damage within a whole game, or 8k damage. Aery does about 2k as well. PTA runepage is good tho, and really works well with Jayce, but it has attack speed instead of damage as the passive thing, so its garbage.\n\nGrasp is meh, it keeps you alive but you wont do much damage. It provides a lot of health and heals, which lets you survive long. I play with Resolve when im going Crit jayce to make it to late game with an OP Build. But its hard af to make it to late game when people get 20 kills in 10 minutes.\n\nLast but not least is Klepto, which is what i use currently. But I dislike it ALOT, its 100% RNG based, but it gives gold, biscuits, 350 gold boots for free, 5% cd, +20% potion/elixir and the most damage/health you can get as a passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2018-01-11T15:50:46.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, Jayce is not healthy because ranged top laners are toxic to play against.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2018-01-11T06:30:26.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe is running comet because she doesn't do enough damage to carry anymore.
