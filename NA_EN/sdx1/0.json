The only report/warning i have ever received was from last season and that was for being toxic... the only thing i have ever done in this game was that could be considered bad was get into a game with a smurf.. can i be banned for playing with someone who is a division higher then what im suppose to be in?  \n\nlook and match history can you can see for yourself there is no way i could be cheating..

This system is used also to detect bank frauds.\n\nFor example, let' s say our OP here plays mostly X and Y role and he is meh at Z, and the system detects that sometimes while it plays Z role he acts differently. That alone is not enough, obviously people act differently according to champion, but if the game detecs some odd behavious that pairs up with that, like swapping smite and flash or being from very chatty to almost silent or playing in weird hours then something can emerge.\n\nEDIT: some corrections because today i cannot into english maremma maiala","replies":[{"poster":"Dilthethrill","date":"2016-06-21T19:33:22.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If thats the case then they should just flag it and have someone actually check it out instead of these autobans that they keep throwing out.

Of the many claims i found here, maybe only once it was a false positive. maybe. still not sure about that one.\n\nplus, they manually check if necessary - it' s just that many cases are obvious. you are underestimating the calculating power of a computer, and are overestimating how a human can' t get caught doing that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-06-21T18:28:03.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh damn, smote.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cosmere","date":"2016-06-21T20:09:06.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me yesterday...\nSilver 4 player with pretty nooby match history suspected of cheating...\nI submit a ticket and ask for some proof and they have none.
