Because I haven't patched my client yet to 6.19, I am a little worried that I will experience this too, but as a Window 8 user. Will this crash affect me too, but as a Window 8 user? I really don't want to experience another Leaverbuster and penalty before patching my game up and going into a game without any knowledge of this kind of situation.\r\n\r\nWill the crash affect me? Or is it just for Windows 10?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T21:19:16.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not aware of any Windows 10 specific issues with the client or patch that are affecting champ select. You can always test your stability in a custom match with no other players to ensure everything is good. This will help you avoid penalties against your account if you frequently disconnect. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
