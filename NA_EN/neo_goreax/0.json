I play unorthodox champs in supposedly unfitting roles at times, and I make people unhappy with it. However, if some people see that as a threat to their score and gameplay experience, why are they punished with dropped rank score. If they don&#039;t want to see a champ in a role, why do they have to suffer both a time penalty and a points penalty? I was on a team recently and someone picked quite the unorthodox champ for the role they selected. I didn&#039;t wanna see it, and neither did 2 other people on the team. So I dodged queue because I wanted a more favorable team. I didn&#039;t leave midgame and force MY ENTIRE TEAM to waste their time and lose twice the points I lost from dodging. So what the hell? This probably sounds extremely selfish, but I felt like I did my team a favor. I initially felt like a hero; now I feel just as heroic, only infinitely less appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2016-09-19T22:26:36.161+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to draw a line somewhere, really. If you weren't punished for dodging queue, there would be a lot more dodging going on and less games actually being played out. It's really just that simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its LiuKang","date":"2016-09-19T22:06:20.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Total hypocrite, I play unorthodox but everyone else should bear with me even if they don't like it, but if someone does that to me I should be rewarded instead of penalized for dodging, or at least that's what I got out of your post.","replies":[{"poster":"FoolsPlay","date":"2016-09-19T22:15:07.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-09-19T23:26:03.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I consider myself an unorthodox player, but I'm at bronze2 and so are you.\n\nAt that level, knowledge about the game trumps your perfect pick anyday.\n\nAlso keep in mind, ADC is a role and not a position.

Losing points and getting out of a series I can't. Also, i don't look for \"OP.gg\" I just don't like when someone does something like Ashe jungle or Voli mid or singed ADC. Again, I'd rather wait 30m - 3h for dodging rather than have points taken off and a series ended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-19T22:23:25.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There needs to be some sort of LP penalty for dodging, otherwise games would take a much longer time to start than they do now. There was a time back in like Season 1/2 where there was only a time penalty for queue dodging, and back then it took a very long time for games to start because people were dodging for every little thing that they didn't like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-19T22:15:42.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or just accept the fact you dodged a game because of a premature, probably wrong judgement.\n\nAs someone who plays a lot of off-meta picks, i get very tired of salty children dodging because they are afraid of anything that is not in the top ten on op.gg.","replies":[]}]}
