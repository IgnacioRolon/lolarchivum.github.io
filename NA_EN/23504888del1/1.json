I doubt its hard to add 2-step verification.

I just got access to my, nearly 5 year old, account. Someone had been playing on my account, spending money and adding people; while playing ranked as if they had not a care in the world. Still no authentication options, just means Riots new owner doesn't care about players at all. If we have to constantly request tickets for account access. It would be all solved with a link to Google Mobile Authenticator. This is a joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr0bama95","date":"2017-04-02T01:30:13.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So currently riot is not dedicating resources into developing a two step security procedure? i didn't hear any news recently about this. I think improving account security should be a priority, over the useless stuff  like the april fools jokes and taking away graves' cigar. It's 2017, integrating a two step verification should not be a very complicated thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-20T16:58:50.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":17,"body":"There currently isn't a two-step verification for League, but we do have an [account protection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) guide that offers some steps for extra safety practices in and outside of league.
