They impose a fill role only to get people well the majority of the people getting supp and they hate it well most of the community hates it because your the team slave who gets to be a ward and shield bot if you choose to build that was but i wanted to play as a champ who can fill the role and i build a certain way which is straight tank and I get enjoyment out of it. I compare J4 to leo more or less they fill the same roles and or play style minus J4 gives attack speed and will still enage regardless, leo has no shiled and if she misses her e well there goes the engage. But of course no matter how good i did it will always be the if only we had a real supp......its not liek i was ks or doing things in such a way that would cause us to lose....i wasnt feeding or anything but people reproted me for &quot;trolling&quot; as a person who could careless if they got supp. But sadly these last few matches as taric people again reported me for not ulting......im like A. there is a cast time and B. before you say activate before we go in ......i informed my team why would i ult before we engage them ......they will see me start to ult and run away..taric has no engage which is why he is weak so i play him as a shield heal bot liek raka. Who cares if i went j4 supp......none of you wanted to do it so....ohh remember how riot stated that they would change the way they do things in this situation i received 0 warning of anysort juts hey your permabanned now..... so much for being a loyal member since season 2 glad riot can careless about their playerbase","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-04-05T17:19:47.661+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"You were not pema-banned for playing J4 support.

I basically get my 4 abilities, and then i get redemption, locket, talisman, mikael's and the sightstone upgrade lets me use them with less cooldowns. Plus the cdr boots and insight from the resolve tree make my exhaust on a lower cooldown. It's literally possible for support to be the most involved role in the game.
