What i mean by that is do not act like you as a player have never been toxic what so ever nor have been afk nor have gotten smashed which is the same as intent feeding or just sucking because whats the difference there really is none due to the fact that both players still died nonstop and if 4 other players can win they will it happens all the time. whats that your top laner died 14 times in lane and you still won the game or whats that your jungler is walking under turret and chasing and you still won the game. So with that 99.9% of the community is toxic or has been toxic or something that can be construed as being toxic saying gg can be toxic so yah there is that why no one wants to lose or likes to lose so saying nothing is better. Also do not act like you have never afkd from a match because pretty much every one has. So with that so what if some one is toxic chances are you&#039;ll never play with them again so why does it matter if you report them? So with that give people the benefit of the doubt and do not reprot people becuase in the end YOUR every bit as guilty as the player you just reproted that to me is plain wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2017-06-08T19:48:24.732+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's like saying no one should ever report crimes to the police because everyone has sped or jaywalked.

Losing is just part of the game. Its about BEHAVIOR. If u go to football stadium to play some football with friends and you are goalkeeper and opponent team is really good and keeps scoring, your teammates wont kick u out. Yet if u take ball and start scoring at your own goal, your teammates will never play with you again. In both cases you are losing. Yet only in second one are you being bad person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EºMOºTION","date":"2017-06-09T18:47:14.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You act like the only reason you play league is to win and not to have fun.
