For the latter, you mean marksmen, the ADC/APC role is evolving.","replies":[{"poster":"webstar1108","date":"2018-06-12T16:32:00.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea man!

Leona's stun to setup your W and combo is free if you can pull it off.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-06-12T18:28:26.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:111}} might be a viable replacement for leo if they have high mobility lane.
