He is still pick or ban, which means he has been horribly designed regardless of whether I like him or not.  He, simply existing, greatly narrows the (pro) game bc most of the roster can not compete with all he possesses.","replies":[{"poster":"Yautja wannabe","date":"2019-06-14T05:25:24.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm down.

And it's not just Aatrox who's plaguing the top lane. Let's not forget about Riven and Tahm Kench, who are equally, if not more cancerous (TK especially. I mean, Riven can at least be hard countered by a ranged or super tanky champion, but TK has no clear counter play). Either way, I'm fed up with Riot's balancing team. As usual they're sleeping on the job and not using their fucking brains.","replies":[]}]}
