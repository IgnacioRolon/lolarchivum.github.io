Aka, since the latest patch, I haven't been able to connect with chat services at ALL. I can still search for games and invite friends on my friend's list via the search feature in the invite tab, but it's very annoying not being able to see any friends online or communicate before/after games.\r\n\r\n Is anyone else experiencing this bug? If so, how did you solve it? (I have windows 7 if that helps at all).

Let's first make sure that your port forwarding has Port 5223 open, and let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"mega monkey180","date":"2017-08-23T03:20:07.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Broporo!\n\nI have looked at my port forwarding and I can confirm that port 5223 is open.

Maybe one of the ports was it and the port forward rule hadn't taken effect yet.","replies":[]}]}]}
