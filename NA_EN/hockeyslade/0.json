League of Legends is a fighting game.\n2. People have squishy champions poking, poking, and poking till their in trouble and then they simply flash even through a stinking wall to get away. It's a rotten trick and it's pathetic. \n3. I don't use flash because I don't believe it should be in the game. For those worried about an Annie ult, here's an idea, don't get so close to her.\n4. It's wrecking the game and helps squishy champions stay in the fight till their low on health because they know they can simply flash away even through a stone wall when in reality they had no business being in the fight to begin with if the mechanics of that said champion were applied correctly. \n5. Those types of fights which should of been won by the stronger more skilled champion are typically lost to a late gank from a different champion using separate spells knowing full well the champion their targeting used his or her spells on the champion that flashed away. So therefore has no fair defense. \n6. Like a fella wrote, people abuse its intent for other purposes, like ulting someone, going through a wall, stealing baron/dragon, or turret diving and turret escaping. \nLike I said, it's a panzy ability and should be taken out of the game in my opinion. I'm no pro, only been playing about a year so my thoughts don't mean that much but this would be a super fun game if flash was taken out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-11-07T18:03:19.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see why you're bronze 5, you don't take flash in ANY games.  You're shooting yourself in the foot by doing that because anyone with flash has an advantage over you.  Instead of asking Riot to remove flash why not just use it instead?","replies":[{"poster":"Zaurok","date":"2016-11-12T10:15:42.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flash is too strong even after all the nerf it received. The biggest problem it has IMO is the toxic nature of flash+combo. There is no counterplay to it 90% of the time as you don't have time to flash out if it's a target spell or if it has any form of CC preventing to flash.\n\nThere's a simple solution to the problem. Fix flash by adding a small pacify when used(0.25-0.5 seconds of movement only) so that the receiving end can react to it and counterplay if possible. I would also cancel the ability to cast flash during an ability (ex: shen dash, gragas dash) to remove the combo+flash as well (if flash+combo goes away, so should combo+flash).\nThere you go, flash, albeit still being strong (it wouldn't stop most people from taking it) would not be allowing the toxic no counterplay combos that it is currently allowing. The champs that currently abuse the flash combos can be adjusted if needed.\n\nTLDR: Add a 0.25 pacify effect when using flash (only allowing movement during the duration). Prevent flash from being cast during abilities (ex:gragas body slam).\n\nEDIT: The instant movement should come at a cost. Right now, there is none which is why flash is the #1 summoner by a long shot.","replies":[]}]}]}
