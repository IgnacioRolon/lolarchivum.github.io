Akali has already been gutted and is the worst assassin in the game atm. Leblanc was so bad after her silence removal that they had to buff her multiple times so she was playable again. Katarina is just a pubstomper and Riot has nerfed her multiple times recently anyway.  The only good champs on that list at this moment are Leblanc, Zed, and Nidalee, and even then, they're only situationally good.
