His Sustain is actually incredible if you actually use his Fury properly and hit a champion like it's intended to do.\n\n2. His Gap closer is small and is done two times not only to be unique, but also because he's already got a near 2s stun and huge burst potential. Only one with that kind of big burst and CC without having to use an ultimate is Xin.\n\n3. Not only are tanks not meant to have huge ratios to prevent them from build pure AD and winning at life, but Ren's ratios are rather big especially considering he's manaless.\n Quick Comparison between his Ratios and Zed's since Zed is seen as a 'Healthy' assassin.\nQ- Ren's AoE Q has a .8 base ratio and 1.2 ratio with just 50 fury and a 180 base at max with 270 base with 50 fury. Zed's Q has a 1.0 ratio, adding a .5 ratio if you land two shuriken by using his W's Ghost, meaning he maxes at a 1.5 ratio and his base is 235, plus 117.5 if you land the 2nd shuriken, maxing at 352.5 base damage. \nW- Zed gains 25% of his bonus AD... Ren's W does 90 base plus 1.5 of his TOTAL AD, which means the base damage is a lot more than just 90. When empowered, it goes up to 135 plus 2.25 of his TOTAL AD. At 18, Ren has 111 base AD and at level 1 he has 58, so base-wise, his W has a 157-245.5 between level 1 and 18 with a maxed W.\nE. Ren's E has a bae of 150 and a .9 ratio that can hit twice, giving a potential of 300 plus 1.8 of his bonus AD. This goes up to 150 plus .9 for the first hit and 225 plus 1.35 ratio for a total of 375 and 2.25 ratio potential damage. Zed's E can only hit once even if his Shadow also lands an E. The second E would only slow, so his max damage with his E is 180 base plus .8. \nR- Zed's R does 100% of his total AD plus 20% of all damage he deals to the target. Ren's R gives him 800 health and he does 120 damage per sec to nearby enemies for 15 seconds. \nOverall, Ren has less 'potential' damage, but his solid trade damage by E'ing through minions, W'ing at max fury, Q'ing, AA'ing, then E'ing through his opponent and back to minions has a much higher damage output on about the same CD's since Zed is gated by energy and his Q's damage drops dramatically if it has to poke through minions. All-in wise, of course Zed will do more damage. That's his purpose.\n\n4. His Ulti, as mentioned prior, gives 800 free health. It also gives the resources as you mentioned... And it does constant damage. His resources boost his damage by 50% and it gives him 15 per sec, meaning he can unleash two full fury'd up abilities in about 7 seconds after he pops his R if he stands there and AFK's the entire time. With him diving around with that ult and having fury built up to begin with though, he's unleashing maxed fury Q's and W's and E's near non-stop unless the enemies ignore your carries and focus you, which is your job!\n\n5. All tanks fall off hard with very few exceptions. These exceptions are tanks that have % of health abilities or Nasus. And yes, % of health abilities includes Shyvana's E. \n\n6. His Q heals him for quite a lot throughout the entire game, his E is a gap closer and is kind of required, and his R is a huge health steroid.... so... yeeaah... Plus his W is useless without his passive and all.\n\n7. Fury scaling gives 50% boosted damage and it's incredibly easy to obtain when you actually play aggressively like you should be as a giant crocodile. \n\nOverall, you're bad and QQ'ing. :3 I think I'll nickname you Hackie! Only Dunkmasters will catch that reference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jalkan","date":"2015-03-08T22:11:02.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, Renekton's one of the best lane bullies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-03-08T22:03:11.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has some really cool dialogue lines?","replies":[]}]}
