This is not a punishment and more like help keeping people from getting tilted. (I think people should choose whether or not to enable smart mute, in case they want to speak with everyone no mater how toxic they were last game). The mute would only last one game, depending if you are toxic or not in the next game. I also think it could be a separate thing, that if you get a lot of people saying that you're a 'good' teammate it could boost your honor score. this could keep people from being toxic as well as it could be a good reward system. What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-15T07:06:37.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the exact purpose of the Honor system and the IFS system. A \"good\" rating is equivalent to Honoring someone. A \"bad\" rating is equivalent to reporting someone. A \"neutral\" rating is equivalent to doing neither. Your proposed system is entirely redundant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"R0ses R Red","date":"2019-11-15T06:59:13.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool idea, but the spiteful players within this playerbase would abuse it. THOUGH, even with that abuse accounted for, smart mute would still be effective. Either it's abused and you practically have fullmute automatically enabled, or it's used correctly and only your toxic teammates are muted. Either way, toxicity is silenced. 10/10 idea.","replies":[]}]}
