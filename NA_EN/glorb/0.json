enough information for me to get a clear picture, so I recommend running a route to 104.160.131.1 with [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).  From what I am gathering, though, it looks like your ping is fine.  So you could be correct here that you may be sufferring packet loss while in game.  Resetting your router could certainly help, and I also suggesting going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for additoinal steps too.  Let me know if it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Glorb","date":"2017-02-18T05:24:54.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks the connection guide helped, I did the ipconfig renew and flush etc and the problem seemed to have gone away thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
