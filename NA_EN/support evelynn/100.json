This causes organized teamfighting to happen much earlier in the game.\r\n\r\nThe problem with early team fighting is that the earlier you teamfight the less time you have to make picks in side lanes, during rotations or what have you. That tied with the fact that assassins are no longer stronger when on even ground with the top tier ADCs, meaning even someone like Rengar or Zed can easily lose to a mid game ADC due to their much earlier damage spikes.\r\n\r\nThe real concern is that assassins are supposed to counter the ADC meta, but with how fast it is that just isn&#039;t possible.","replies":[]}
