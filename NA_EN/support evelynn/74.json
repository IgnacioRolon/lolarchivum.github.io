At the time it was a rather non issue but over the years pain in my neck would get worse and worse. Due to a series of bad headaches I went to the doctors a few years ago to get an MRI done and they found that I had a degenerative disc disorder in my neck.\r\n\r\nNow fast forward to now and it has progressively gotten worse, to the point where I can&#039;t even go out due to the pain and horrible other side effects like tingling in my extremities and difficulty breathing. I get massive migraines on a near constant basis that makes it very difficult to do anything, even play games for more than an hour.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll be going to get another MRI soon to see what&#039;s up with my neck, I really hope neck surgery isn&#039;t needed, I&#039;m pretty scared tbh.","replies":[]}
