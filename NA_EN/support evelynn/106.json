Far more reliable gold, more reliable power spikes and a better mid game since he doesn't have to rely on shoddy post 6 only ganking. Wit's End as a first offensive item is also 10x better than the jungle item due to significantly higher overall DPS. In fact Warwick in the jungle is essentially forced to go 2 offensive weapons early in order to really do what top lane Warwick can do with just sorc shoes and Wit's End much earlier.\n\nMy 2 cents, though I guess the jungle item could use a reduction in stacking rate for assists since Warwick farms those ez pz.","replies":[]}
