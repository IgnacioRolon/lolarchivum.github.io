To my surprise my teams were fairly good and I played good maybe really good in some occasions. Anyway I won 8 out of 10 games and I was sure I made it to Bronze I (at least you fight for silver promotion).Aaaaand there it is once again.....BRONZE FUCKING 5....ty riot now I&#039;ve lost interest in playing ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"10SaeKki","date":"2016-12-20T03:59:16.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"LOLOLOLOL\nYou belong where you belong.\nYou stay in bronze cuz u play like bronze.\nsearch me on op.gg\nIf you are way better than ur division. u will get high win\nAnd tbh, bronze is fun place to play in.\nNo matter what u do, u always win.:))\n","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-20T04:05:52.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You appear to have never played anything past your placement games, in which it seems you got carried.\n\nCarry on..","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2016-12-20T04:08:19.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Rekt","replies":[]},{"poster":"10SaeKki","date":"2016-12-20T04:09:45.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"man saltyness on silver is real.\nisnt the silver full of people that has leesin's eye/braindead????\n\nlololololololol nothing to say=got carried=92%winrate on bronze smurf???\n\nbraindead alert!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-12-20T04:03:15.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just so you know, sharing an account is a banable offense.
