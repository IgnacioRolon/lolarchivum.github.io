Ryze is probably the tankiest mage in the game and can 1v1 nearly all champs. His laning is very oppressive because minions can&#039;t protect you due to his flux and targeted stun. Other than being curious why his winrate is so low can someone advice me on how to lane against him effectively?\n\nHe is too tanky, and just needs to build mana to do damage. Plus shields and speed boost. I wana cry :(","replies":[]}
