If lets say I get a bad adc then i can carry the adc instead :D So it&#039;s a win win situation for me!\n\nNo one can beat lux&#039;s utility but she lacks the burst that other supp here have maybe on par with malzahar but malz has great CC. I have played some matches as velkoz and he is simply great for poking and even bursting without even having insane mana issues like lux has early game. I am thinking maybe brand is the way to go as he can carry hard! Or am i wrong? \n\nWhich supp/mage  you think is the easiest to carry with ? Also give reasons if possible, it would be appreciated.

None of them are actually \"Support\" characters, which also includes Zyra, if you want to be technical.\n\nThe easiest true Support to carry with is any melee Tanker with hard engage like Alistar, since most teams don't end up with a tank at all.\nThe best carry out of those you listed is Brand.\nThe best \"support\" out of what you listed is Malzahar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"k w√¨x","date":"2017-02-01T22:48:24.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I'm a high gold / low plat support main and have been playing the game for quite awhile. Support mages are viable so long as you have the ability to cover your adc and stop your enemy from engaging on them. CC is really important for this spot, but raw burst can work too. \n\nIf your relying on damage/mage style comps - I highly recommend looking at your opponents MR score. Poke who will suffer the most damage. These comps have trouble against healing/shielding and strong initiate setups. \n\nAlways buy a warding item, no matter your champion and know the matchups to have a chance. \n\n**If your looking to 'carry' in the support role, the EASIEST and BEST way to do that is by empowering and protecting your ADC. Always try that first. If you think your ADC is awful, then yea, play safe and turn into a secondary mage. Remember that you will deal less damage and be weaker than mid/top lane until late game. sneak farm where you can get it and roam into mid-lane for ganks, like a jungler.**\n\n I'll go through your choices with you: \n\n{{champion:63}} \nBrand is pretty solid in the support role right now - he deals a very large sum of damage through the mid game without needing many items to back him up. Brand's stun is hard to trigger on demand, he suffers against long-range poke and strong initiate. You protect your ADC by making them scared to approach you or your adc, fear of damage is what wins with brand. He's even scarier post-6. \n\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} \nAll 4 of these can be played in the support role and generally perform the same function - poke the bajeezus out of the enemy ADC and make it really hard for them to farm. Win the lane on poke and make it hard for them the enemy bot lane to initiate/farm. Ganks can really hurt these guys. This is why they don't see much play past plat/diamond (Except Ziggs, because he needs a nerf!) \n\n{{champion:1}} Been a support staple since the beginning. You player basically like brand, except you can rely on her stun to stop enemies from engaging. No one approaches Annie when she has her stun. This is controlling the lane through fear. \n\n{{champion:90}} It's in meta right now, and thats because his shield and poke are pretty great - You want to play him like an offensive-themed Sona. Float around, throw crap out into the lane to damage enemies, and abuse your ult for kills/saves.\n\n{{champion:134}} She does have some solid CC and respectable poke, but you have to mess with the ADCS farm to do it - Also, she needs items to become terrifying. Brand and Annie can work through the midgame on budget items - Not her. I think this is why you dont see her in the support role.","replies":[{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2017-02-02T06:24:51.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really liked your message and i appreciate you spend your precious time to write all this down.

I know these are burst mages instead of supports but i want to play them as supports. As i have already tried velkoz and it works fine and also why they are kinda meta now if you ask me. I just want to have a change plus i won't play them in ranked until i know they will work or atleast i get good at them. \n\nAlso sightstone is a must item for a support eventhough everyone should ward but i will get sightstone regardless of that. I have supported my adc's enough with soraka, i want to be able to supp my adc as well for a change or atleast get more than 1 kill a game :D\n\nAlso you may not believe but sometimes passive supports do not work against other burst mage supports at all. The adc will get rekt and you just won't be able to sheild/heal him enough. Maybe if i went tank support with CC that might work out but i hate using tanks for some reason.

People really don't know how to deal with her range.  Countered By:  Alistar, Miss Fortune, Sion, Nasus, Morgana. (Note: There is a nerf patch on PBE that, if it goes through, will send her into the dumpster.)\n\nMalzahar is the flavor of the month, but his usefulness is obvious.  He would be my choice given the current situation.  Countered By:  Lulu, Zyra, Miss Fortune, Zilean\n\nBrand is used as Support mainly for his oft-difficult to use stun.  Once you master zoning and using his stun, he becomes strong in the role.  Brand is a killer in later team fights, as his ultimate is brutal.
