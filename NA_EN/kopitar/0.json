Tested this by not playing for a week with no crashes and the first night I played again it crashed mid game. Ive already got an account punishment for it even though I came back and we won the game. I play other games like Rainbow Six Siege and H1Z1 with no problems whatsoever. I am on windows 10, anyone else having this problem or is it just me?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T22:59:36.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes often happen as a result of poor system driver interactions or hardware issues.
