For example, your ad says you have 150 while the opponent has 140-160 but for some reason they take 1/3 of your hp with a single skill while you take 1/10 and you're playing Draven of all people vs a Tristana and the last game you played a similar matchup with the same stats and yet you were chunking the bitch down. No way that shit's not rigged, but they give you a nice little overlay to \"prove\" that it's the correct stats. LOL what a load of shit. This game was fine until shortly after season 3 but even in season 3 it was bullshit. Why do you think they hide ELO? They did that to test out how okay with it people were and tbh most people I know hated it but just put up with it. A majority of people liked it though and that's all that mattered. They also did it to test out how hiding true stats would effect other things such as purchases etc. If you don't think this game has been rigged since end of season 3 or even before then idk what to tell you. It's pretty obviously rigged, all you have to do is look at your teams stats vs the enemy team stats by the 10 minute mark.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-12T04:33:12.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give a logical explanation for why riot would intentionally skew matchmaking, and a mathematical/statistical explanation of how it is even possible (if you loose, someone else has to win).\nRiot makes the outcomes of all match histories public, and numerous websites and tools scan, record and analyze the data.

Just more saltyblame.\n\nIt looks like you have not stopped and thought about why it is impossible in LoL, or are simply unable to handle that sort of logic.. most people cannot, for some reason.\n\nWhat about the simpler explanation, that you have a roughly 50% chance of winning any game? The chances of a win/loss streak continuing past a certain point are very low.\n\nYour chance of winning or loosing one game is 50%, give or take a little based on skill.\nYour chance of winning or loosing two games in a row is half that.\nThree, half that again.\nWin/loss streaks are easily represented with binary numbers, as well.\n8 binary bits (win/loss) can hold 256 possible values, of which only one is 8 straight wins: 1 out of 256 or 0.390625% chance in any sequence of 8 games.\n7 out of 8 has 8 out of 256 possible combinations, or a 1/32 (3.125%) chance of happening in any 8 games.\n\nNaturally, your ELO/MRR and what champion you are playing has a huge impact on these, i once (and have never seen another over 8 since) got a 14-win streak in normal games playing a champion i was highly skilled with, but i also had a 75% winrate with that champion, which massively increases the chance of longer streaks). \n\nThese are not about league, but statistical math is the same everywhere.
