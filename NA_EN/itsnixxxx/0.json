Then while I'm closing the game in task manager and try to reconnect, my champ is just idle in the place he was... (this can happen during a team fight or laning and is basically a free kill for the other team). Then others time, when my fps goes down from 220 to 120, (but it feels like 30 fps), and soon after it will go down even farther to the point where my game is very laggy, to the point where abilities and ults lag my game to the point of freezing it for a few seconds. I have a Alienware Aurora with good stats and i had way better fps a few weeks ago, (this isn't a ping issue), and I'm not sure why this is happening in my league games. If anyone can help me or give some tips i will appreciate it, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T17:09:18.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like either your drivers or game files might be struggling to render your game, and causing this freeze.
