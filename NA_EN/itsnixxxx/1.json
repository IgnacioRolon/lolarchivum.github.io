On this other act, i noticed that the original prices for most of the skins there were higher than usual, (1950rp for blood moon yas, 2230rp for jax). Now, my question is that are these skin prices are capped this way just because I am a lower level, or is it something else? Its hard to explain this on my part, as I am confused too...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T01:16:14.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because that account doesn't own those champions yet, so the price is including the price of the champion as well!
