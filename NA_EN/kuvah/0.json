A $10 Riot Point card! Why i never used it was beyond me but i was excited, Dark star Kha'zix here i come! I find a penny and i go to scratch off the grey stuff that covers the code and to my surprise the code gets scratched off with they grey stuff that covers it. My guess is that the california heat was to much and probably melted it together. Somewhere there is an Imgur link to my sad adventure. I was wondering if at all i could still get the Rp even though the card is messed up. If not i completely understand ill just hate you forever :D also i took those pictures via Snapchat","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T03:37:56.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We should still be able to help out as long as the code still hasn't been used.
