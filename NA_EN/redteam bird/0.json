They lock out all other queues during that time so that they can get enough people playing ranked to test season rewards stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T01:44:26.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you play ranked games on the PBE servers, it won't affect your regular ranked placements.

My account was raised to level 30 upon creation a week ago but anytime I try to use the boards it tells me \"You are not authorized... Must be level 1.\" Is there a fix for this?","replies":[]}]}]}
