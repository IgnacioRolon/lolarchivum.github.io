League is a 5 on 5 game and when you have a player that is not able to play his champion correctly and basically hands you a loss. I had an idea where you would at least get to the 3rd mastery level or even the second so you have a basic understanding of the champion you are playing.\r\n\r\nJust looking for some thoughts on this.","replies":[]}
