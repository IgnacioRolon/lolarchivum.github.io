They want {{champion:34}} to have a hard time cs-ing levels 1-5 as a way to give opponents a window of opportunity to zone her before she hits 6 and inevitably takes control of the lane. {{champion:429}}'s AA animation was much shorter on release, they increased it drastically so you actually have a chance to hit her before she starts hopping.

His autos are incredibly clunky and slow, I miss so many last hits with this champion that it is not even funny. To make the matters worse, he doesn't even have any waveclear or reliable last hitting ability.\n\n{{champion:8}} also has clunky autos, but at least his Q allows him to last hit reliably, and he has waveclear.","replies":[{"poster":"Stiv1234","date":"2016-04-17T09:53:21.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its hilarious how different these things can be.
