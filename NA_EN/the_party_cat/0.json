There were no posts up yet about it so I uninstalled my game (I really should've waited 5 minutes...). Ever since I've tried everything to reinstall the game.\r\n\r\nI downloaded a new file from the website and reinstalled, no luck. I uninstalled and deleted any trace of the game from my system, no luck again. I changed my DNS, uninstalled/deleted everything again and tried to no avail. I kept trying and had varying levels of success... I eventually got to the point were it would start patching and I would get an error that I didn't have enough room on my PC, but I had 1TB of space. At this point I gave up, reset my computer to factory default and redownloaded. Again, no luck.\r\n\r\nEvery time the install stops at varying points, every time it slows my computer to a stand still (and I'm not using a toaster to play). My download speed starts around 10-8 mbps and slowly drops below 1. Now after restoring my computer to factory default the file won't even launch (Patcher Kernel has stopped working error) or freezes during client update.\r\n\r\nMy internet works perfectly on all other devices and even on my main PC as long as league is not running. I'm going too reach out to support but was wondering if anyone here had any ideas so that I could at least play tonight. Has anyone had/solved this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-15T04:42:57.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since restoring to factory default, your pc most likely doesn't have the correct permissions in place so that League is allowed to run and read/write to the files it needs to.
