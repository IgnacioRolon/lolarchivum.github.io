I went tom the support website to being talked to. Then they told me to go on forums and linked me to the discussion for bugs and stuff, and i guess that wasn't the correct location.\r\nI'm just copy pasting it from my last post. I only want to talk to a riot person.\r\nYeah hi I would like to talk to a developer about some detection, since the support team won't let me get in contact with a developer. I'm not asking about detection i'm here to help thanks : )","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T23:37:01.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will be pretty hard to reach a developer here on Help & Support, as this board is where we address technical issues and questions about the game.\n\nI'd be happy to answer any specific questions you have about the game, but if it's specifically about development, I may not know the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"tlghYsjOAW","date":"2016-09-21T21:59:59.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.  I'm not really asking, because I already know you guys can't talk about the detection system, but I made my own detection system and wanted to maybe share it with you guys. I've had no luck in contacting anyone that could pass on the information in some private matter, because I don't want my good friends from L# to hate me and demote me from my developer rank(Made web client nothing involved with the tool itself).","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T15:44:59.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Miscellaneous](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) may be the best boards for you to reach out on.
