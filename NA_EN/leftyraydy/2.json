Everyone else in the game is plat 2 or higher and the enemy team has a diamond 5. How is it that he is playing with mostly people that are almost a league higher that he is. Anyway I was curious to see so I went to this dudes page and then saw this.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/r8Ws6Nq]\n\nThis person has never been higher than plat 5 so why would he ever be in a game with people plat 2 and above? I mean lets not even get into the fact that this person might even be boosted looking at his ranked history\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/5gQqP2p]\n\nNever higher that gold 4 until all of a sudden Oct 23rd and then shoots to plat 5 by november 7th then barely plays ranked..... interesting Thanks riot for the GREAT MATCH MAKING. As even if this person was legit there is no reason to have 1 plat 5 and the rest Plat 2&#039;s, 1&#039;s, and Diamon 5&#039;s.

This is weird","replies":[]}]}]}
