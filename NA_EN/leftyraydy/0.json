The mana and health regeneration rates in the Spawn area occur at \"a percentage of the champion's maximum health and mana every second (Summoner's Rift 2.1% per 0.25 seconds\".  This is multiplied by the characters own regeneration rates.  So it is actually both together.

It's about four seconds for some of the slower mana regenerating champs when it used to be closer to about 2 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-09-18T21:24:02.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, because mages had their mana regen reduced and their maximum mana increased.
