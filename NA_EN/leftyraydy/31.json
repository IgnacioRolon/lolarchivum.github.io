Of course there is oversight on the champs listed although with Morgonna would not be unkillable Vlad might be, but that is also a reason vlad might need some interesting changes to fix this, but I do not believe all champs should suffer because of vlad. Another thing they could do is make it Melee Champs only which would fix most except Morde.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-09-13T15:32:23.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. They removed spell vamp specifically because it created unhealthy gameplay because of the healing from mages with burst and the sheer sustain it allowed for tanky mages.

Why is it ok for Graves to have Deaths Dance and get healing from all physical damage, but say Diana and Rumble cannot from AP. This makes no sense instead of just down voting my post why not start a conversation about it. AP Itemization is terrible and there is not enough Diversity for the different kinds of AP champs Especially AP assassins. There is like 2 items that seem like AP Assassin items vs the amount of items for AD champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-09-13T17:32:15.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Donâ€™t forget Ravenous Hunter zzzzz","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JeaneGreene","date":"2018-09-12T23:33:50.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spooky","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-12T23:50:13.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do you mean?","replies":[{"poster":"JeaneGreene","date":"2018-09-13T00:44:26.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This plus Gunblade on Vlad would make his healing completely insane","replies":[]}]}]}]}
