I mean I am not saying gut champions, but instead of nerfing base move speed, base ad, or anything else change their kits to be better by rewarding risk to reward, giving clear weaknesses, or more interactive and strategic gameplay. These nerfs are just pointless.","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-10-18T11:50:34.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lowering a champions base movement speed is actually bigger than it looks.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-18T18:20:03.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But a champion with a good amount of mobility in their kits its not going to be devastating. still what I am talking about is making meaningful changes to these champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-18T18:25:00.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually is, as it forces them to use their mobility more to stay in range, or makes it easier to stay out of their mobility range.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Poop Johnson","date":"2018-10-18T01:08:38.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Placebo nerfs are actually really effective at lowering a champion's pick rate and they probably don't wanna mix things up too hard with worlds happening.\n\nA while back they were going to nerf Vlad (I think?) but they reverted it but still put it into the patch notes and both his playrates and winrates dropped quite a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-10-18T01:25:17.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Placebos are one hell of a drug.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-18T18:21:47.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true, but changes to a champions should't kill their pick and ban rates they should make the champions feel better with risk and reward, clear weaknesses, and so on. also patches wont effect worlds now no matter what they patch worlds is already on the patch it is going to be played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2018-10-18T05:35:05.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah they just totally forgot to implement the Vlad nerf, it was supposed to be shipped. They did the same thing with Riven, altho with buffs. She was bad and people thought she was clunky as well, so Riot gave her some buffs and QoL changes. They put it in the patch notes, but forgot to implement it in the game. So literally nothing changed about her, yet people said she felt much better to play and that she was a good champion now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-18T18:23:47.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Base stat nerfs are one of the harshest nerfs you can give to a champion.\n\nYou can meme about the 3 ad or 5ms all you want, but the fact is theyre absolutely massive nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-18T18:37:19.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok but overall its still irrelevant to my main point. why not change the champions so that they can be healthier and not lowering base stats. I think lowering base stats is a terrible idea. For graves instead of 3 AD why not give him more weakness such as lowering his armor gained from his E or removing it completely and then he could be granted CD every time he dashes towards an enemy champion and longer CD when dashing away from enemies. Rewarding taking healthy risks, and then not allowing him to be a kite monster at the same time if he is dashing away?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"9NINE","date":"2018-10-18T13:45:40.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's the 8.11 or 8.12 aftermath where they are scared shitless to do anything about anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2018-10-18T05:54:37.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preseason is around the corner and will shake up the state of balance in a major way, due to the (re-)implementation of adjustable stat bonuses to go with your rune paths.\n\nThis will inevitably have a major effect on all champion's balance, as a lot of them may prefer certain keystones and/or minor runes, but do not synergize nearly as well with the current path bonuses.","replies":[]}]}
