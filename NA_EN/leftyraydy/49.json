You tried too hard to cover your &quot;harassment&quot; issues against women in the work place which now will backfire on you even harder. You seem to forget Men are a majority of your consumer base and calling them man babies was ill advised at best, downright idiotic at worst. I will not get into Ideologies or anything else like that, but I am interested to see how this situation will be handled by riot as they squirm to figure out what to do. Will I be quitting league no, but I will not make any RP purchases for sure until I see how this company will handle this situation. Good luck.","replies":[]}
