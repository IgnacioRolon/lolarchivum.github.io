What I do have a problem with is the sound of their abilities/AA&#039;s. I have ADD and these sounds just are so hard to ignore and play the game with for me as it is very distracting, Also I love good sound quality so I have my computer hooked up to good speaking or I have my turtle beach head sets on and I like to play it loud (also listen to music). For example Aatrox&#039;s abilities are just excessive and to me can be tuned down a little bit. It sounds like a hard bass drop in a dubstep song. Urgot and pyke are obviously the ultimates and while possibly a good idea at first its just a bit much to deal with (first time I was killed by an urgot ult (I almost shit my pants It was so surprising). I give every champion a cool after effect on killing an enemy or don&#039;t do it at all in my opinion, or you could allow after death effects from these champs (I would like this). Finally Xerath and its not his base skin its the Guardian of the sands skin. I hate hearing that auto attack over and over it makes me cringe and is really distracting.\r\n\r\nI am sorry if anyone likes these sounds or skins I just wish there was an option to either remove the sounds like that for me or at least for now remove the after ult effects from pyke/Urgot.","replies":[]}
