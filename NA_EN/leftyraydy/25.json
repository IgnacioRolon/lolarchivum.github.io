Done. If the gap is smaller than the champ, don't let it path there. If there is an obstacle in the way (i.e. a turret), don't dance around (alternating between directions), choose a direction and stick to it. I had it that i had to get past one minion and my champ just kept on dancing in front of the minion instead of just running around the freaking thing.\n\nI don't mind minion block, but just give a little more tolerance so that it's a little easier to get through, especially allied minions. I enjoy melee assassins, but i struggle my ass off to farm efficiently because my path is suddenly cut off even though i am returning to a spot i literally just came from (no minion movement), or the existing gap is suddenly smaller than my champ even though there should be just enough room for it to run through.\n\nIf it is really necessary to navigate centimeter by centimeter, tell me and i will adjust the way i play, but it feels to me as if navigating around minions is getting worse patch by patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naenia","date":"2018-09-26T07:09:11.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed","replies":[]}]}
