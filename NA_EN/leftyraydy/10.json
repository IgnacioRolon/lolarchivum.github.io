Could we not invert the view on Red side or have the option to invert our view of the game? I just dont think there really any reason for this to still be a thing in our options we should be able to switch the view to our preference. It would literally effect no one else but you if you choose it to be? I mean it may switch top/bot but overall you would be able to choose your viewing angle so I do not see this as an issue. you could also mark it on your map like &quot;true bot and True Top&quot; so it would make it a little easier. Any Rioters on this, and is this something everyone else would be interested in? I am not a fan of playing red side viewing angle so I would love this and I dont think it would be hard to make something like this if it only shows on your screen this way.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-11-06T21:06:39.924+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there's a few reasons against it.\n\n1.

Inverted, i mean. like both teams are just playing on an inverted map and the concept honestly confused me at first. I feel like maybe its not as intuitive as you may think it is. I don't think Riot wants to make Spacial intelligence a barrier to entry in the game. Cuz if it confused me then I feel like so many players would just be like uhh what? LOL\n\nALSO, the way i think of it is that if there is a north and south on a map. Then just because my perspective switches, doesn't mean that north and south changed. Like If we were thinking North america, South America. It wouldn't be that depending on what perspective you have, you are now the south America. It's kind of like Heliocentric vs Geocentric. went off on a tangent, interesting tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2018-11-06T20:22:43.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it just won't work with a live game.
