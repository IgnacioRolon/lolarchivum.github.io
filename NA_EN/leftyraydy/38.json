I took a break from league for a while and just started playing last month and I was not aware that Quinn now had that Debuff let me just say how frustrating that is. I mean Graves, Quinn, and Nocturne (plus Kench and Rek Sai even if it is on herself) Have this ability. I am really not a fan I mean nocturne ult fine its his ultimate and whatever but not being able to see is the worst for this game and then they put this ability on champs that can completely 100-0 you in 3 seconds or less. Blind is also a terrible mechanic, but at least you can still dodge skill shots and walk away. Graves just pick a slow or near sighted, because it is really infuriating to deal with both. Sorry if I am complaining, but I just wanted to state that Near sighted sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Knife Bird Woman","date":"2018-07-29T17:44:29.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely. NS is an unbelievably frustrating mechanic to play against but sadly I don't think it matters too much. Riot doesn't have a tendency to change something because it's incredibly unfun to fight because all that matters if you're having fun playing the champ who has it, right? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemurMonster","date":"2018-07-29T07:39:07.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I lost a number of games because of how cheap Graves is with it. I really wish they nerf the slow. is that crap really needed for a burst adc? Guy will just all in you & spamming everything on you. What is the point of his reloading when he just uses ability's like that to go around it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-07-27T17:58:19.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:104}} is the most frustrating because how overloaded it is.
