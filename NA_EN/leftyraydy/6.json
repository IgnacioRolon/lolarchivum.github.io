Same Items very few situational items being purchased except maybe Hexdrinker/Maw and Mercurials. At this point I am starting to wonder why have items in this game if it is really going to be the same every time. every time I bring up itemization and the fact it isn&#039;t diverse enough the board always shuns me saying it would be harder to balance and I get it yes it would be, but at the same time why have items in the game if champs will build the same set of items every game. You might as well add the Items&#039; passive&#039;s and stats to the champions and have them gain it as they level up. \n\nWhat sparked this is I saw the post on &quot;So when is AP trynd getting addressed?&quot; and here is a quote from another player replying to someone asking why did they buff his E in the first place that made me really think about this.\n\n&gt; [{quoted}](name=YumaS2Astral,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MVyBtntN,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-08-03T13:40:53.571+0000)\n&gt;\n&gt; It was meant to help AD Tryndamere, since he can&#x27;t reliably build CDR anymore. Previously, Tryndamere would build Essence Reaver alongside a 30% crit chance item. That alone would give him 30% CDR (combine that with Transcendence or another 10% CDR item, and you would cap 40% CDR).\n&gt; \n&gt; Since the crit item changes, this is no longer possible, as Essence Reaver no longer gives crit chance. This has messed up a lot of champions, but Tryndamere was probably the one that was the most affected.\n&gt; \n&gt; Riot then reduced his E cooldown to help him compensate for lacking CDR in his AD builds (unless he builds weird things like The Black Cleaver or Death&#x27;s Dance). Turns out this made AP Tryndamere broken, since CDR itemization for AP champions has plenty of choices, whereas there aren&#x27;t many viable CDR choices for crit champions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing that made AP Tryndamere broken is Conqueror. Now he doesn&#x27;t have issues with itemizing for penetration because part of his damage is converted to true damage.\n\nThey keep doing this where they take items passives and damage into consideration to the champions that use them and buff and nerf accordingly. Items should be Isolated from champions because this is where it is causing issues. there needs to be more item diversity so if Trydamere wants to build Crit and CD he can. Mage items are the worst as every mage, AP Assassin, or other ap users build the same way basically. there is no uniqueness to champions because everyone is building the same damn items every game. \n\nI will probably get downvoted but its ok I still love these boards.\n\nEdit 1: I also wanted to state that while champions are getting compensation buffs because of items there are champions where the items do not fit well where are their compensation buffs. Where are the good AP assassin items? thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Flashes","date":"2018-08-04T03:44:40.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the point of itemization is that it's not necessarily a required blueprint, but rather a suggested build for a specific given team and enemy comp.\n\nFor example, if I'm going Vayne, I might want to build BotRK rather than Statikk Shiv against a tanky enemy composition, or if my team has a lot of assassins.\n\nItemization is simply what works best in a typical vanilla game at that point in time. However, the micro meta of individual champions in different lanes actually changes fairly often.\n\nI think that Riot thought that AP items were meant to provide a slew of options to AP spellslingers, who don't actually have any AD scalings. \n\nAP Ashe doesn't work as well as ADC Crit Ashe 99.99% of the time. She only has R AP scalings, so it's not worth building onto her.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-06T16:22:15.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok but this is one of the rare cases where people have \"options\" to build. I am saying there should be more options to choose. why is their only 1 tank shredding item like BOTRK (not counting Last whisper since this is basically Required). their should be other options with different takes and strategies. the items are SO linear at this point they might as well be included in the champions kits.","replies":[]}]}]}
