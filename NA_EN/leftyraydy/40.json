Plus I will always be the guy that tells a feeding lane we can pull it together, because I know being flamed for constant mistakes only seems to make you make even more mistakes and cause the other players to also make dumb mistakes. Look I think everyone should have a chance at redemption and even though the community and riot thinks its ok to just take harassment and not respond which is kind of dumb in my opinion, because even I can only take so much before I am so frustrated and I do not mean at other peoples mistakes I am talking about McSalty one of your team mates. Instead of perma ban why don&#039;t we just put these toxic people into games only with each other. From what I am thinking this can do a few things. \r\n\r\n1.) The players really start to realize that this toxic behavior is unacceptable and strive to be better\r\n2.) quit the game because they cannot stand the toxicity\r\n3.) perma rage for the rest of their lives as they stick in ELO Toxicity hell which I believe is an even better punishment as they will stay where they belong dealing with all the flamers.\r\n\r\nNow this is not including Death Threats, racial/gender comments that are out of line, and things of this nature as these people deserve it. \r\n\r\nI forget what game has done this I think Street fighter paired the rage quitters together which is funny, and another game put cheaters into the same games consistently as well. I think this is something that is a positive for everyone in the community as we group together toxic people so that non-toxic players can play together as well as possible toxic people redeeming themselves and becoming non-toxic. We should give it a shot at least since Riot is already un-banning perma banned accounts.\r\n\r\nWhats your take?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-08-02T19:35:42.743+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, in regards to your suggestion, here's Riot's stance on that idea from [Ask Riot: Banished to Prisoner's Island](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/01/ask-riot-banished-to-prisoners-island/):\n\n> **Q: Why doesn't Riot queue negative players with other negative players? What's wrong with the \"prisoner's island\" concept?**\n>\n> A: First, let’s define “prisoner’s island” designs for the folks who aren’t familiar. A prisoner’s island approach says that any players who cross the line into unsportsmanlike conduct should be separated from the broader playerbase and only matchmade together. At face value, it’s an emotionally satisfying fix that basically deports assholes to an island and theoretically makes everyone else’s games better as a result — but it runs counter to our value of reform.\n>\n> Prisoner’s island design doesn’t work for League for two major reasons:\n>\n> Reason One: **We believe in a real shot at reform for unsportsmanlike players**\n>\n> We know that most negativity in game comes from a misstep, not a commitment to ruining games for people. That fact is the core reason why a shot at reform is central to many of our designs. So as long as reform is a core value for us (spoiler: it will always be a core value for us), we can’t stick 10 (even occasionally) unsportsmanlike players into what would be even more unsportsmanlike games and expect them to learn and turn things around.\n>\n> Instead, we owe these players frank feedback about unsportsmanlike conduct, and a chance at gaining some self-awareness and growing as players and part of the community. This is actually something today’s Instant Feedback system isn’t great at. With info from your reports, we shoot penalized players a reform card explaining why other players think they should be penalized, but not an idea of how to change and grow. That gap is important for us to fill.\n>\n> We get that this can read as a bit naive. That’s why we keep the banhammer handy for players who just aren’t interested in being relatively sportsmanlike and playing the dang game. Still, because the prisoner’s island system gives up on these players by default, we can’t subscribe to it as a solution for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n>\n> Reason Two: **Prisoner’s island is a truly awful experience for the “prisoners” in more ways than one**\n>\n> If we ship unsportsmanlike players to their own queue, they’d face a swath of issues that basically make League miserable by default. The queue would face higher rates of negativity in game, sure — but the diminished pool of players would also result in terrible queue times and lopsided matchmaking. It’d be emotionally satisfying to say they deserve it, but it’s squarely against our values of putting player experience first.\n>\n> Beyond that, building and operating a service for a prisoner’s island would suck Rioters and resources from efforts we truly believe in, like improving Instant Feedback, intentional feeding detection, and reworking legacy systems like Honor.\n\n---\n\nAs for a few other things...\n\n> Look I think everyone should have a chance at redemption...\n\nSo does Riot. Which is why if you flame and break the rules, typically, you go through a 10-game chat restriction, 25-game chat restriction, and 14-day ban before Riot figures you're not gonna actually reform.\n\n> ...even though the community and riot thinks its ok to just take harassment and not respond...\n\nNo, we don't. _You think that we think that_, but you're wrong.\n\nWe don't think it's okay to just take harassment - that's why we advise people to _use the mute and report features_. Muting shuts out harassment almost entirely, and reporting makes sure that the people harassing you get their just desserts.\n\nAnd we tell people not to respond to toxicity/harassment/flame _because that's genuinely the best course of action._ You don't want to give a flamer or a toxic asswipe attention, because that just feeds the fire, and makes them flame you _more_, _and_ it can put you at risk of breaking the rules too, since you're essentially getting into a flamewar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-08-02T18:48:18.729+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone has a chance at redemption. They have to travel through several chat bans and then a 14 day ban before they're permanently banned, so to play it off like there's somehow not enough opportunity for them to reverse course is just naïve. If the chat bans and 14 day suspension wasn't enough of a wake up call, they really don't have any excuses left. They don't need their own queue if the punishments already in place don't wake them up. Being shoved into a queue with others just as volatile as themselves would be pointless.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-02T18:55:57.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See you think that would be something, but just like our correctional system here in the US its wrong.

In most cases, this doesn't work, and it horribly backfires because it gives them more connections and makes them more violent towards one another.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Manslayer","date":"2018-08-02T19:22:35.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you're telling me is we should group together all these \"toxic\" people that are deemed \"toxic\" from an automated system, then have them play games together just so they quit eventually because they're miserable?

Riot openly acknowledges the idea that toxic players spread toxicity, so it's foolish to think the best idea would be to just let them match with everyone else. A way to mitigate the thing about it ruining matchmaking health and queue times or whatever is to give players the option to match with all players or just players above a certain Honor Level. This isn't that farfetched an idea because games like Phantasy Star Online 2 have an Expert Matchmaking option that allows players to match only with other players that meet a certain requirement. Instead of making it a requirement that players can't match with toxic players, it's both healthy and helpful to give players the choice of low queue times and the risk of unsportsmanlike players vs medium queue times and no \"unsportsmanlike players.\"\n\nLast one's in quotes because even honor 5 players can be toxic lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-08-02T19:03:55.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue I have is that you're grouping Toxicity in a generic bubble that doesn't elaborate on what the specific form of toxicity is.
