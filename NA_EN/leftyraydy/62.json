I know being an Ekko Main myself probably doesn&#039;t help, but I do love that champ. From what I see though the biggest problem in this game now is being an immobile champion that isn&#039;t Annie or Malzahar. Since I main mid and ekko gets picked or banned my back up is Lux and while I have played great games with lux (won and lost) the problem is simply the mobility. With the game snowballing as it does now champs (especially mid) need to be able to move through the jungle to assist other lanes to get that first tower. As lux I have 0 confidence going through the jungle I am literally too scared too either do that or even push the mid lane too hard because it is so easy to get caught out even with wards. When I play Ekko I am not afraid if I get jumped on by 1-5 people I know I can escape or make a play or assassinate someone. I want to play other champs mid and ADC but whats the point most ADCs are Immobile and get blown up so easily and again run into the same issue you cannot rotate lanes safely in this game even with wards. Since the games are so much quicker and more &quot;snowbally&quot; champions need to be able to move in the meta and that is what is both killing ADC&#039;s and Immobile Mages because they cannot rotate around the map Safely anymore they just cannot. \r\n\r\nI have an Idea for a small fix which is to buff towers for each nearby enemy champion which it would increase armor, damage, and attack speed for each nearby enemy champion (and for fun able to target 2 champions at once if there are 4 or more enemy champions around). This would slow the rotations while not affecting the laning phase so much. And if it becomes a problem end game during team fights, just make it so it only counts how many enemy champions vs allied champions around. I think this would really help or at least buffing towers to do something. I remember seasons ago I use to be afraid of towers, and now once I am level 6 they just don&#039;t do enough damage whether I am a tank, an assassin, a marksmen, or ap mage. There is no more fear factor there and people should be scared to go into enemy territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know if you guys agree or think I am an idiot I know you would probably let me know Either way.","replies":[{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2018-07-07T00:44:20.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Towers need to:\n\n1. Have resistances that don't fall off **at the very start of the game** (*Cough* Bot Lane *Cough*)\n\n2. Be able to regen up to full in base unlike the highest third threshold they decided was a good idea.\n\n3. Be an actual threat (Like laser towers >_>)\n\n---\n\nI'd also push for towers have two ranges:\n\n1. Normal range for minions.\n\n2. A slightly more extended range for champions that only activates under the same conditions they do now to help curb harassment under tower.\n\n---\n\nBonus idea would be for a new support item that targets enemy minions and makes them act like a Zz'rot Voidling upon reaching the tower except instead of damage, it heals the tower (Obviously not too much).

To me it seems like you are repeating the \"buff towers plz\" request, but your argument for it is pretty random and disconnected from this request. \n\nWhy I think that? What you say is, lux has a problem roaming to mid or bot. because the jungler can be a kahzix or a rengar or a xin and the enemy mid lane is an ekko and if she meets these champions somewhere in the jungle without having her range on them, she just dies with no options. Whereas for these champions they can jump away or just nuke whomever they meet. \n\nAnd since the entirety of the situation you are describing happens in river and jungle, how is this have any link to towers? in your example lux is not getting pressured or dove, she is getting ganked while she is trying to roam.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-06T16:37:26.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Snowballing is bad especially with first tower bonus -> immobile mages have trouble rotating and helping other lanes to help get this bonus -> so champs that cannot duel in the jungle or are slow cannot really help or even push towers because they are easily caught out. If towers were buffed in that way it prevents snowballing and giving immobile mages a chance since they can stay in lane and not have to worry about their enemy laner going to another lane and taking down that first tower. I am saying speed is a huge factor in the game due to the snowbally nature of it, so Immobile mages suffer. How is that not related?","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-07-06T17:37:21.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the problem you are laying our before us is the lux is not able to move to a side lane to help her team, whereas fizz is able to. \n\nThe solution you are proposing is not alleviating that. What you are saying is that maybe the fizz is less able to take the first tower if the dive is successful. or that he has to gank, rather than dive, because the tower is more potent. \n\nbut lux is still not going to be able to follow him, which is the problem you are proposing. perhaps the value of a passive mid lane building up a carry is going to be greater, but you are not addressing the specific issue you have bought up.","replies":[{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2018-07-07T00:36:06.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The root question is:\n\n\"Why did Riot make it necessary to roam bot, which is inherently more viable for mobile champions?\"\n\nObviously the answers to that are:\n\n1. Towers are generally being made of paper.\n\n2. Bot Lane Towers being weaker resistance-wise from the start.\n\n3. Towers giving first blood, making the weakest tower a priority.\n\nBut:\n\n\"Why did they make it like this?\"\n\nand\n\n\"Why don't they make it so its more rewarding to actually lane against your lane opponent?\"\n\nIf laning against your opponent was more rewarding, then the early game would be able to focus on Target>Mobility>Range>Target or Kill>Sustain>Poke>Kill triangles again.\n\nBecause whats the point of being better than the enemy laner, if they can just snowball another lane early into the game to beat your team in raw stats/items?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-06T18:36:35.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is never going to be able to follow fizz, but the reason why its Viable for him to roam bot is because of the snowball meta and he can not only get kills, but first tower. if we remove the abilty to delete towers so easily it might change the need to roam, because if towers were stronger than people cannot tower dive so easy, take the tower so easy, and so on.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lets have shrex","date":"2018-07-06T16:18:23.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%, but let me add this to your point in a small tl;dr\n\nMistakes are too easily forgiven by a simple button, everyone having a spammable dash / blink / movement speed buff with a low cd.
