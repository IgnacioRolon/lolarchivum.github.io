I don&#039;t understand this as I am sure everyone has been on that side where people are reacting so harshly to every mistake you make big or small, and it just makes you play more poorly and kills your drive to win.

It's very much the status quo of how humans treat 'others'.  Without seeing that person, our basal instincts is to put that individual in the 'other' camp.
