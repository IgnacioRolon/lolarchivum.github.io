I would start off with a few simple things that I think Riot should take and consider on using this method.\r\n\r\n1 - Before creating new/reworked champions especially with Unique mechanics (Zoe and Reworked Akali most recently) it is time to fix what is already here and not add more BALANCE PROBLEMS. Take a look at the champions in line for a Full Rework, then a moderate rework, and then mini rework and lets get this done first. There is already so much Diversity in League with so many champions, and how do you expect new players to play the game with SO MANY CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!!!!! lets take a step back and fix what you have I can promise you that a lot of people would be ok without a new champion for a while especially if you are re-working champions that need it.\r\n\r\n2 - Itemization - I believe this is the biggest reason why there is imbalance in league. There is not enough Item Diversity for league at all. Instead of looking at Groups like Mages, Assassins, Markmen, and so on it is time to look at champions in smaller groups and group them differently. This is what defines the meta most because Marksman like corki and Kogmaw do not use the same items as Jhin, Lucian, and so on. So lets break down these groups into smaller groups and see what items that they can use, that are situational, and have multiple builds to Diversify LOL in such a good way. I feel I am always building the same thing every game especially since Itemization is so bad. So many champions in different classes are using the same builds because this is all we have and its the best we can do.\r\n\r\n3 - Skills - Like itemization their is an optimized path usually for getting skills in League as en Ekko Main Always Max R, Q, E, W in that order their is basically 0 reason for me to do otherwise and most champs are like this. Their needs to be benefits of maxing other abilities first other than a Lower CD or some higher numbers. \r\n\r\n4 - Consider your main Audience - I do not know how Riot thought Hey lets give this insane Mechanic specific to this champion in her rework (Akali) or champions that feel completely ridiculous to play against (Vlad, Zoe, and so on) and think hey some players might like this, but most of your core audience and player base will not. you will push away your core consumers and new consumers will have no idea what is going on when adding stuff like this. Its insane to think that some ideas got past the concept stage and into the game as a final product. \r\n\r\nTalk to me let me know your thoughts whether you agree or disagree I would love to hear.","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2018-07-31T20:48:06.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) no, this is backward logic. you kill games by not adding more content because the game stales out. Also do not generalize without some sort of evidence to support that very same argument. Champions that have existing balence problems are more often then not due to the current meta and not their own kits. there are only a small handful of champions with **_truely_** problematic kits\n\nEX: Yasuo and fizz are fine, their kit are known to cause frustration. but they both have clearly defined counterplay, strengths , and weaknesses.\n      Ryze, Azir, kayle ( imo, some people may argue with kayle )have problematic Kits because either once mastered they are completely dominate to the \n      point of invalidating any other method of play ( look at what fake does with ryze/azir ) or when something abusible comes out they are completely \n      dominate and become pick or ban status across most levels of play but most notably higher elo ( kayle/azir/nidalee did this ).\n\nWhen champions are reworked it's done from a need to update a champion to give them a place in the game because their current kit is either stale/bland/ _**inherently broken**_ ( think pre-rework poppy) OR they champion has a weak identity and doesn't fit thematically.\n\n2) They tried doing that, the less items you have the easier the game is to balance because you have less variables to account for. similar to your complaint about champions being made to fast. this is just asking for a balance nightmare. if you make to many niche item for the sake of build or strategy diversity, you'll end up with one dominating them all regardless. Then it will be just a matter of which ones get nerfed first. you cannot add more things and expect them all to be fair and balanced. simplifying build routes and letting diversity come from the champions themselves and not what they build has proven to be easier to balance.\n\n3) There already is?\n\n{{champion:157}}  Q max v E max, and also E start vs Q start\n\n{{champion:56}} Q first but then it s a toss up between E max and W max dependent on playstyle\n\nNot every champion has them, but they exist,  optimization of maxing comes from the playstyle NOT from the abilities themselves. Items can change what you max first, summoners can change what you max first. not everyone needs to be syndra. hell even vainglory, a moba with only 3 abilities lets you \"overdrive\" a skill for more effects. but not every skill has overdrive effects because adding things for the sake of diversity is just bad decision making.\n\n4) People will complain regardless of how good a decision is. what is considered \" an insane mechanic \" is completely subjective. Yasuo/zed/cassi mains are use to high mechanical/apm requirements, so something like this is right up their ally. but to annie or veigar mains who's gameplay revolves around positioning and strategical use of abilities, yes it would be overwhelming to them it's the polar opposite of their style and (practically) directly a counter to it. Riot has stated ( im trying to google it right now because i remember this when people where bitching about fiora's new kit), they purposefully add in mechanics and abilities that are inherently unbalanced. why? because riot prioritizes fun over balance, no matter how hard they try or how much data/player feedback they gather, League of legends will always be in a state of imbalance. So rather then trying to change an absolute they focus on making the game as enjoyable as possible for the majority of players and making it enjoyable from a  spectator perspective as this game is also a major E-sport.\n\nYou'll see a lot of forum posts complaining about the state of the game, leauge is dying, so on and so forth. but remember, This for and all the other combined are only a fraction of the player base. we just happen to be the most vocal. so when you say \" most people\" either has some numbers to back it up, or consider that this might just be a bias opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-31T21:20:02.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 - I mean stop adding brand new champions in the game. Reworked Champions should be priority especially the Full reworks, and then they become new content do they not? Such as Warwick, Poppy, and so on. I mean they have some resemblance of their previous selves, but are completely different play wise and mechanics wise. \n\n2 - You state adding new content is what keeps a game fresh then say don't add items? You make your first point and then go back against your first point which I find kind of funny. Its just as hard to balance because of the shear number of champions as Items. I am saying during Pre-season 9 to do this and find out what works and what doesn't by adding some new items and build paths.\n\n3 - Do yasuo's still max E I thought that was a thing of the past when the ability scaled much higher? the problem is more champions should have these choices as it feels a little stale. The point of the matter is simply it feels static with a lot of champions.\n\n4 - and this I understand adding crazy mechanics can be great but Yasuo for example has been a subject of hate for so long. People hated versing them and having them on their team. Yasuo got stupid mechanics such as ulting under tower will get take you out of tower range, like what is that??????? Lets go into some other \"dumb\" things added to the game Yasuo Wind Wall has the ability to block ultimates - Why?, Grounded Mechanic, Near sited on anything that is not Nocturnes ult, Zoe Bubble that even if it misses sits on the ground and can be stepped on as a trap (what other hard CC has that capability???)  and it can also travel through long walls again I ask why, Rengar ult is just stupid they could give him a different one I think that might help balance him, Zed with Electrocute and the fact that his Q's count as 2 unique hits. And what more proof do you need that what you see on the Board Scarra's video is just so telling on how frustrating it is to play league like this. \n\nLeague is slowly going to die the E-Sport viewership is down because the games are just not what they use to be. Now the game feels like oh that champion is just busted right now and I didn't lose because of skill I lost because that 0/6 champion has finished 2 items and now is demolishing everyone.  \n\nAnd trust me I am not shaming you here, but I just don't think you have enough game knowledge or mechanics down to know what the game needs. But as skill goes up people use these god awful mechanics to their full potential and it is devastating.","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2018-07-31T23:05:16.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) no it does, saying reworking champions is new content is the same as saying asset flips are new games.  there is more to content then just having new gameplay. further more, the rework department is a whole nother department from he new champion department. meaning both are being worked on at the same time. personally speaking, if i enjoy something i want more of it. in what would would i want less of something if they can do both.\n\n2) I didn't say don't add more, i said \" They tried doing that\" and then followed it up with a fact. i find it funny how you read a sentience and at the same time completely didn't read it. I personally pointed out the issue with creating items **specifically to support niches** not **to increase build diversity**\n\n3) E maxing isn't entirely dead, you get less damage from it, but the point of E maxing is for the lower CD on the dash giving you more mobility. What i was pointing out is that having those options don't benefit the game significantly enough to justify the imbalance it will cause.\n\n4) oh boy lets start with\n\n> Yasuo got stupid mechanics such as ulting under tower will get take you out of tower range, like what is that???????\n\nlet me give you a list of things more absurd\n\n {{champion:1}} instant cast AoE nuke with a stun attached with 0 penitently for missing or messing up other then the cooldown due to cast range\n\n{{champion:69}}  insta cast ulti that is impossible to dodge and must be predicted and still combos into her kit to cripple you regardless of if she wiffs and can be animation canceled to hid the direction she is faced ( see faker )\n\n{{champion:105}} yasuo's ult tried to place him outside of turret range but if it places him to far he cannot follow up, fizz straight up negates tower shots\n\n{{champion:86}} gets stronger as you get tankier and dont even get me started on the villan mechanic ( if it wasnt for the fact he is so binary and easy to kite he would be a instaban )\n\n{{champion:85}} because an AoE stun ulti is fair?\n\nthis tired argument of yasuo's ulti being unfair is tired as his hate threads.\n\n> Lets go into some other \"dumb\" things added to the game Yasuo Wind Wall has the ability to block ultimates - Why?\n\nfiora can do it\n\nbruam can do it\n\nirela can do it to an extend\n\nkayle can do it to an extend\n\nfizz can do it\n\npeople act like dodging/countering/blocking abilties is new. Again yasuo pays for this ability. \n\n> Near sited on anything that is not Nocturnes ult\n\n{{champion:104}} short range bruiser who's only gap closer doubles as a reload mechanic, without it you would just kite him out even harder then he can already be. ( although in his hay day he didnt even need it )\n\n{{champion:133}} you got me on this one, but ive always said Quinn is a mess of an adc\n\n> Zoe Bubble that even if it misses sits on the ground and can be stepped on as a trap (what other hard CC has that capability???)\n\n0 mobility mage, they all have something stupid imo. she pays for it in survivbility . also its a whole new type of CC this is exactly what leauge should be doing. making new unique champions with their own play style. everyone hates on T because his champions becomes balance nightmares sooner or later. but he makes some of the most fun champions ( other then zyra but imo fuck mages ).\n\n>, Rengar ult is just stupid they could give him a different one I think that might help balance\n\nits almost like riot has tried to change him 3 times over to find what works on him and feel fair so he isnt a 1 shotty kitten of death that makes ADC play black screen sim\n\n> Zed with Electrocute and the fact that his Q's count as 2 unique hits\n\nlux and her passive would like to have a word with you\n\n> Scarra's video is just so telling on how frustrating it is to play league like this.\n\nso if i show the video of imaqtpie telling everyone that yasuo windwall isnt that bad and that yasuo himself isnt that bad, everyone wills stop complaining about windwall?\n\n\n>  I just don't think you have enough game knowledge or mechanics down to know what the game needs\n\n\" although you've back up your post with facts and logic, i have nothing to argue against it and must point out rank as a indicator of my knowledge rather then using a counter argument. \" \n\nyou need a reality check, i hit gold when i played at my peak. which is statistically better then a majority of the player base. regardless of what higher elo's think that can be proven. we could measure ranks all day, if i ran and got my friend who floats around in d5 to valid everything i said do i suddenly know more about the game? ofc not\n\n> But as skill goes up people use these god awful mechanics to their full potential and it is devastating.\n\nyeah already mentioned that, but thanks for agreeing m80","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-01T16:13:57.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all the champions you listed except for maybe Annie are just terrible champs as well. I do not want to go down list by list of terrible champion mechanics. At least with Annie she has to literally flash for her combo, or you could walk into her range. Kennen when strong feels very unfair as well, but in this meta with other champions being as strong as they are he isnt in the right place. \n\nLets go on the blocking ultimates. Fiora is another champ that has one of the unique and frustrating mechanics and lets not even go into the fact that her ability can block Ignite which is even more BS. Braum at least has to eat it himself when he does block and he is not a carry and cant do Yasuo/Fiora/Fizz Damage, it but there is so many reasons why some of these mechanics do not make sense for the game. Yasuo is one of the worst offenders and you can tell based on how many times Yasuo has been in the Big Games that his whole kit is just overloaded. Can you play against him yeah but his only weakness is the person playing him.\n\nOk False Zoe is not an immobile mage. Lets talk about the fact she has higher base movement speed than most champs she also easily gets free SUMMONERS like flash, ghost, and ignite which she then gets free movement speed from. That is not immobile ok she has speed in her kit and with her long range abilities its not like she gets caught out often if the player uses her correctly.\n\nThis is what I was saying about your lower ELO I am not shaming you, because I did not realize the deeper issues of certain mechanics and champions myself until using gimmicks among other things in higher ELO. While concepts can be cool there are things higher skilled players can use and take advantage of then Lower ELO players. if you do not think this is true then i don't know what to tell you. I never used your \"elo\" level to completely invalidate your argument I only stated that you do not know how things will be abused or can imagine how things will be abused at your level of play.\n\nhere are some things I skipped\n\nLux and her passive? how often is lux using electrocute??????? not really at all as I play her and most times I see her played its either Comet or Aery. Lets not even go into the fact for lux to use her passive she has to put herself in danger lol. I mean and that is 3 unique hits also Her ability be it QER, an auto, and her passive hit.\n\nRengar I think we are in agreement on. They never try to give him a different ultiamte though so that is something that they could consider.\n\nGraves does not need near sighted in his ability. Near sighted is one of the worst no counterplay things that there are. They could make the champs inside blind but near sighted is just really not a good mechanic. Nocturne Ult is the only one that I feel this is ok on.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-07-31T19:41:49.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When discuss balance never feel biased tpward certain personal things.
