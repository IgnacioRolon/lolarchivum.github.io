I mean Jinx, Ekko, Gnar, and Vi are probably my top 10 favorite champions and Jhin is also pretty good. I mean he also created Rengar but I can let that slide for these others. Is he designing more champions or what I would really like to know.\n\n\nEDIT 1: Ok I see he created Kai Sa, but it wasnt credited to him on his wiki page so SORRY. still Ekko - Kai Sa was a very large gap.","replies":[]}
