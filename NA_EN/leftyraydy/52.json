I was already hovering my champion and the ADC bans my champ {{champion:245}}. The guy pretends he did not see and said he meant to ban draven. The jungler asks again if he can have mid now that my champ was banned so I was skeptical. I do a quick look up and see that they are premade. Is there a way to prevent this kind of abuse and should this be a reportable and temporarily banned offense (I would say yes). I ended up playing Ziggs and we won the game by a landslide but I still do not like this kind of behavior, and why would anyone think it is ok to force someone out of a role?","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2019-02-06T00:02:53.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll say the same as the others:\n\nIt's a *reeeaaaallly* dick move, but it's not punishable to ban your teammates champ.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2019-02-06T00:07:20.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RallerenP,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vLlRj4al,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-02-06T00:02:53.347+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ll say the same as the others:\n> \n> It&#x27;s a *reeeaaaallly* dick move, but it&#x27;s not punishable to ban your teammates champ.\n\ncan we agree on a either chat ban or a low priority queue like 1-5 games for behavior like this or something. I think it should be something I am not saying this is permanent ban worthy but it should be discouraged heavily. I dont have this issue often but I have heard of many people taking advantage of these things especially in lower divisions.","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2019-02-06T00:14:03.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely. \n\nIf we can reasonably verify someones intent when banning a teammates champion, then they should be punished. I don't know how such a system would even work (it would require a ton of planning), but I'm all for punishing trolls.\n\nIn your specific case, I'd agree that a punishment should be in place.
