It seems to me that Ekko&#039;s hitbox is not what it seems during his E, not the blink part of the ability but the initial dash. Does his hitbox move with him or is there some delay where his hitbox doesnt line up with his animation. It would change the way I dodge some abilites, but I would also have to get use to it. Also it there a way we could make it a little easier to use his Q after his E sometimes, this Time I am talking about the blink. sometimes when an enemies have a blink, flash, or are however moved and take Ekko with them (sometimes it&#039;s Great and sometimes you end up under a turret you didn&#039;t want to be or surrounded by the enemy) and then you press Q, but because you were predicting landing right where they were you end up throwing the Q in the wrong direction due to this sudden change of position.","replies":[]}
