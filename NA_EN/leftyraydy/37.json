Not only is there better ways to gank red side top lane and blue side bot lane, but the worst of it all is mid lane. Everygame its a constant fight to have 1 Control ward around and since most Mid laners can push a wave check the brush and see these pink wards its so stupid. every game I am wasting my green wards and pink wards constantly getting ganked. I mean there are so many ways to gank mid lane and not enough wards in the game to help with this. Even top and bot lane have the scuttle objective that can be used it is not effective for mid lane unless the jungler is stupidly coming straight down the river. All lanes should have equal ganking opportunities on both sides and mid lane needs to be altered because there is no where we can safely play at all or confidently go all in. I am tired of the level 2 ganks (while i am level 1) from junglers like Xin, graves, camille, and panth in the mid lane who can walk behind me and I can only place 1 damn ward. \r\n\r\nWhat I recommend is changing the map to make top and bottom equal in terms of being ganked on both sides and fixing mid lane so that there is not 6 direct routes to gank because it is absolutely frustrating. Otherwise put a plant around that gives vision for mid lane that can be contested or find other ways to reward players with Vision so we can do things. there are way too many ways to remove vision and because the only thing you can buy is a control ward there is no way to get vision back once its destroyed (other than CD for the stupid trinket).","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-11-07T19:58:15.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The change goes hand in hand with the turret change.
