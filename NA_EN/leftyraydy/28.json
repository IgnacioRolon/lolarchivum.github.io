I meant to pick Ranked, but when I saw it was Aram I closed the client to find out a 15 MINUTE block from being able to Queue up. Are you really serious right now riot......... 15 minutes for 1 dodge of ARAM. you guys must be sick in the head. it takes like 5 seconds to find a ARAM game so I am pretty sure that I did not hurt my fellow players too much by dodging that. its not like ranked when you go through all the bans and picks, then dodge. This needs to be fixed cause this is some BS","replies":[{"poster":"Aussie Tuggar","date":"2019-10-24T10:06:25.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly what a joke, maybe riot need to fix the buggyness of their client before implentmenting such a stupidly high counter. i was lobbied up with my friend and it when i \"accepted\" the game it didnt bring him into it with me. so i dodged thinking yeah okay 5-6 min wait.... but no. instead i get a 16MIN dodge counter. i have had this happen before when the client bugged out and the screen was blacked out when i loaded into the champ select preventing me to re roll of even see whom i was given. roit if youre going to do stupid things like this please fix your client instead of punishing players for you buggy client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"halfeatenkitty","date":"2019-08-14T02:39:37.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why I don't recommend this game to people.
