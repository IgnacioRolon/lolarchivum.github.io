She seems pretty good, but utilizing her passive in solo queue will be difficult. Right now while we get use to her passive it is quite funny to use, but eventually we will get the hang of it. the only thing that may have to be tuned down is her total ult damage and that I am not even sure about. Overall this is my first impression of her, but I think she is not just some straightforward mage and I feel can very versatile which is something I appreciate about a champ. one Directional champions get boring after a while but she can actually be fun to use while figuring out what works best on her. I also want to state she may be a huge Fizz Counter as I played Neeko vs Fizz highish Elo (Plat 1 me and diamond 4 Fizz). even once 6 if Fizz all ins you you can ult as well which really makes it hard for him to do anything. As for him walking in an out of minions you can use your E to snare him through minions. \r\n\r\nFinal Verdict!\r\nI like this champ *smashes glass* Another - Great job on this one Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Mr J","date":"2018-12-07T17:44:43.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think she's very special imo. The only thing that's fresh about her kit is her passive. Everything else is whatever because her abilities just seem similar to many other champs unless that's what they were going for since she is a chameleon.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-12-07T18:41:56.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, and utilizing her passive is going to definitely be tricky in Soloque especially. I do however like her kit and and feel this was a good champion to release considering the last champs released recently as well as the reworked champs released. (Irelia, Akali, Zoe, Pyke). Sometimes unique kits end up just frustrating the players.","replies":[]}]}]}
