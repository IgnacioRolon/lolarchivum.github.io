I use to be Plat before my hiatus, and I placed Gold 5 in my placements. Would really like a team to play seriously and/or have fun with. Preferably gold/Plat teams but willing to play on a silver team as well as long as the players are friendly. My Champion pool is not as big as it used to be, but that is one of the reason I want to play on a team and expand that knowledge. I can even play other roles if needed just looking for some League friends as mine are all gone since I stopped playing.\n\nRight now my Best champion is and Basically my one trick {{champion:245}} and I am Very good with him\nBackups are and in order of best to worst for Mid \n{{champion:99}} - 4/1 with her in ranked I am pretty good with Skill Shots, but since she is immobile its tough to use her\n{{champion:25}} - I can always play Morg as she is always relevant with her CC and lane sustain\n{{champion:63}} - Kind of same situation as lux being immobile but he has Huge Team fight potential\n{{champion:4}} - I can play him Decently in lane need to work on his ult positioning though\n{{champion:34}} - I use to main Anivia but in this meta she really doesn&#039;t stand a chance as she cannot move anywhere quickly\n{{champion:105}} - I need more play time with him but I can learn \n\nKeep in mind I still want to learn more champions and will play off meta picks as well if the team desires. Lets be honest I am not going to LCS so lets try to win and have fun with it.\n\nBeen looking for a team to play with and cannot find one. I am in PST Time (viva Las Vegas) and work Mon - Friday 8 AM - 5/6 PM and I am off on weekends. I am 28 so no teams under the drinking age. \n\nAnyways hope you add me IGN: LeftyRaydy I am on mobile so if you add me we can set something up either for a tryout or just go balls deep into it. Either way I look forward to it.","replies":[]}
