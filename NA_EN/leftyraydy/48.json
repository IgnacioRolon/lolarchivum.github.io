There is no other ability in the game that allows someone to get that much free damage. this is top 10 one of the worst ability put in league.  also she should not be able to kill you with the damage sent from the test of spirit that is ridiculous how is there counter play to this champ at all if you are melee. especially after level 6 when she can just ult if you decide to engage. also counter play is not walking away that is free damage and then slowed and deal with stupid sound effects and tentacles. I just lost to a lane with her and it just feels completely unfair which I feel like the champs abilities do not allow any kind of counter play.","replies":[{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2018-07-05T05:30:47.940+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I might be biased (don’t look at my champ masteries) but I must say Illaoi falls off so hard late game. She has the small w as a gap closer, she has no hard cc, and grievous wounds hurts her kit in every way. And hard cc kills her. Also a little tip, her e  spawns and slams once,  If you don’t have to run (meaning she can’t get to you) don’t kill the tentacle that just slammed. Stay near it and it won’t do anything or spawn another. This works really well in the laning phase because you just have to dodge the one. This is how I beat her every time. Without a slow item and if she missing her e she has no way to stick to you. I actually wished her w slowed but I guess that would be too much.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-05T15:34:10.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be ok if games went to late game now a days.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ho1d This Q","date":"2018-07-08T05:31:08.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can absolutely agree with this. Her E does way to much damage and not to mention its hit box is hella broken landing on u when it clearly shouldn't. and also the fact that by the time her E runs out on ya its off cooldown so she just hits u again with it","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-05T15:25:04.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys I understand dodge the E its when she gets it it becomes trouble. any small lead and you cannot trade with her then you wait to farm under tower and she hits you with E or you have to let to minions die to the tower. The point of the matter is it is way too much damage for an ability that puts her in complete control. There is no other ability in the game that is like this and it needs to be tweaked on % of damage that is hands out if you think that it is ok to lose 50-75% of your health to one ability that is quite safe Idk what to tell you. Its not balanced and \"dodging it\" is not balanced Either. Why not give skill shots all this crazy damage and then we can say oh you just dodge it?","replies":[{"poster":"MalrothDragonia","date":"2018-07-05T15:46:48.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"besides having one of the slowest missile speeds in the game, her E also is blocked by minions, has its duration significantly reduced if you auto her at least once, and as someone already said, a spawned tentacle will only spawn once, slam, and then sit there. She has so much counterplay built into how her kit functions, that if these are your complaints you do need to work on your reaction times and watching your opponent for telegraphing moves.\n\nBaiting out her ult is a thing you really want to do, even doing a surprise engage, then flashing out gives your jungler an opening to gank her and have a good chance. Or if you're a ranged/more mobile melee character you literally just walk out of her ult and she can't do anything.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GrãñðmãstêrShãçø","date":"2018-07-05T10:33:14.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lintu Puck","date":"2018-07-05T06:36:27.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like you just need to get better at dodging the tentacles.\nMove, bait out the abilities, don't get your soul ripped out, remain calm, etc. etc.","replies":[{"poster":"GrãñðmãstêrShãçø","date":"2018-07-05T10:30:49.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats saying to just disconnect","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-07-11T23:28:15.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the most unfun champion in the entire game to lane against.
