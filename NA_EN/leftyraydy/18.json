I am actually sure it was an accident, but the point of the matter is I should have been in my promos if not the loss of this game. I know this doesn&#039;t happen often, but it still happens and it is completely  tilting to lose a 4 v 5 because the loss of a team mate. Now I am sure if this person came back within 5-10 minutes we could have won and we hoped he did, but alas he did not. Our only option is to report him which is unfair to him because I am actually sure this was not done on purpose. I have always said and will continue to say that if a team has an AFK for more than 70-75% of the game than that team should not lose LP in a ranked game. This is not a perfect idea but it is a start. lets save some unfair frustration for our fellow summoners here and find a simple solution for AFK in ranked. This game has been around for long enough where this should have a solution already.\n\nEdit 1: Please tell me how this can be abused. I am proposing that on the team with the AFK who has to be AFK for 75% of the game will not lose LP except for the AFK person who will receive a 100% - 250% increase in LP lost for example if you were supposed to lose 20 LP you would now lose 40-70 LP now if you have less that that you would get an automatic demotion if you are in leagues 1-4, if you have less and you are in league 5 it will count as more losses toward getting demoted to the next level (Diamond - Plat, plat - gold, and so on). Now for all of you saying Duos will abuse this ohhhh no they will not. If you are in a duo and one of you AFK's for 75% of the game then you both share the increased LP loss. Now if your duoing and someone who is not in the duo afks you can receive the same benefits from the no LP loss.\n\nI see no way in abusing this system, but it could be fine tuned better that is for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"nyakasgoods","date":"2018-10-02T21:13:58.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This system is for sure asked for in good faith and quite frequently, but having a loss prevention option open to a losing team strongly incentivizes said team to try and take that option instead of trying to pull back the game and win normally.

What you are suggestion is just the next step of because you duo/in a party with a toxic person, means you should be ban as well despite you not being toxic!\n\nI don't understand your argument at all, because Riot is already punishing people for this.  Right now a whole team loses LP when someone goes AFK later in the game.  If it is changed to only that person and people the are partied with lose the LP then it is actually less people that are being unfairly punished.\n\nI do not even think you need to increase the LP loss.  If the whole party still had the LP loss like they already do currently then you couldn't boost people this way.  Also then, people who had something unfortunate with their ISP or other technical issue are not unfairly punished.\n\nAny flaming is reportable, so flaming someone into leaving already has built in consequences.  Not to mention people who are douchy enough to flame people are probably likely to lose anyway just from their crappy attitude (and they probably are going to flame anyway regardless of any change).\n\nLast of all any rank creep that would happen would actually balance out fine as some people would not unfairly lose games, and those that won would still in future games have to prove they belong there.  Lets say someone gets insanely lucky and gets 10 afk games in a row they win illegitimately, and they get ranked too high, they will just lose and drop back down to where they should be.  It happens all the time when people get carried up and then can't handle the heat.\n\nI actually think this could work fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-10-04T02:00:03.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they aren't, at least not in the sense I'm thinking of.

Does not matter if you are partied or not.  You are losing the LP due to the loss.  So if they made it so that nobody loses LP under AFK instance, unless you are partied with the afk, then at least some people are not being punished.  You cannot remove the party LP loss, otherwise it can be abused.  So it does not solve it for everyone, but it would actually be less punitive than what it is currently doing right now.  And honestly, I have rarely ever had a premade member drop.  It is mostly on solo q.\n\nSo those 'innocent' people you are talking about are already losing the LP. So this solvent does not add any punishments that are not already in place.  It just helps some solo q people out who are more likely to have afks anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Unker139","date":"2018-10-02T20:06:58.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeftyRaydy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ve38KlPG,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-10-02T16:04:13.011+0000)\n>\n> This would be hard to abuse. to be gone for 75% of a game is quite the feet.

So how do you go about that. dropping a whole league for 1 possible mistake is too much as you can sit at 0 LP in a league for a while before being demoted. So how do you make it fair for both teams I do not believe the creep you are talking about is enough to warrant anything else although what you fail to account for is if the 4 v 5 team wins the DC will still lose more LP another way to off set this. Also if the person comes back and is in the game for more than 75% of it then this will be null and void. This also makes it fair for even the DC person as if something happens say accidently disconnect to get back into the game. But for this to also work you would have to get rid of early surrender or maybe offer early surrender at reduced LP cost that is shifted to the DC'd person. \n\nThe point of the matter is this is as fair I can think of while being a good system that should not be able to abused. Maybe the team with the DC since they cannot lose LP (except for the DC'd person) they can only win reduced LP as well thus making it even better.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JoeAnarchy","date":"2018-10-02T23:05:36.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"duo with someone. one of you on a smurf/alt account.\neverygame you're losing hard and know you can't comeback, the one on the alt/smurf just DCs and you're team just stalls until you know you won't lose LP. \nnever lose LP again.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-02T23:10:11.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Read my post again, because you are completely wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-03T15:30:36.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Then just berate the worst player on your team until they rage quit, increasing toxicity levels in league drastically.

A game that I am handicapped should not be held against me or anyone for that matter. How would this make the game unplayable you are really over exaggerating. If the problem happens so little that means that this proposed system would be enacted so little. So tell me how can you say benefits a \"minor issue\" and makes it unplayable at the same time. it is absolutely hilarious how contradictory that is.

Now for all of you saying Duos will abuse this ohhhh no they will not. If you are in a duo and one of you AFK's for 75% of the game then you both share the increased LP loss.

Now I am sure if this person came back within 5-10 minutes we could have won and we hoped he did, but alas he did not. Our only option is to report him which is unfair to him because I am actually sure this was not done on purpose. I have always said and will continue to say that if a team has an AFK for more than 70-75% of the game than that team should not lose LP in a ranked game. This is not a perfect idea but it is a start. lets save some unfair frustration for our fellow summoners here and find a simple solution for AFK in ranked. This game has been around for long enough where this should have a solution already.\n\nRIOT slaps people on the wrist for frequent AFK's instead of outright banning the account. If they do ban any accounts for that then it takes an act of GOD. Until RIOT leadership understands that the frequent AFK, DC, or leavers are the most toxic thing in team online gaming and take a much harsher stance on them then it will always be this way.\n\nAll you have to do to know this is true is ask yourself one question...\n\nWould you rather have a player who is present and is toxic in chat that you can remove by a simple mute button or would you rather play 4v5 or worse and know that you will probably lose this game and waste your time because all that person is going to get is a 20 minute wait as a maximum punishment most of the time?","replies":[]}]}
