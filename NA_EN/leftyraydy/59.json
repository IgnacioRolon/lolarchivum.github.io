I placed gold 5 and I am now Plat 5 in my promos for plat 4. I have noticed though even though I am gaining Massive LP 22 for a win and 14 for a loss that I am being paired with low gold and high silver consistently. Because of flamers I hear the top laner Nasus say this is why youll be stuck in silver and I am like dude I am plat 5 why am I playing with silvers, and I am. I asked most of the players if they are smurfs and most of the time they are so I am guessing that these are smurf accounts I am being paired with. I mean I am ranked with 129 wins and 112 losses (53.62% WR) so I am not really understanding why I am being matched with the people I am. \r\n\r\nMy last Ranked game my team was 3 Gold 4&#039;s and 1 gold 3 and then me plat 5\r\nThe enemy team was 1 Gold 4, 2 Gold 3&#039;s and 2 gold 2&#039;s. \r\n\r\nWhy am I the only plat player here? Can someone explain to me this match making? I feel like I should be playing with other play players as wella s High gold, but its just me. I have posted the last match below for ranked. But its a little disappointing for me as the whole time I am climbing I am playing against players who are almost a whole league below me. So any insight will help thanks.\r\n\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2832243193/231057367?tab=overview","replies":[]}
