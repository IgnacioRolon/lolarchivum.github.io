Why does it slow down after hitting a champion. Can it always act as when you do not hit a champion? This is why lanes against Ahri, Lux , and others are so frustrating because they can CC you then easily walk to the side with no repercussions. Talon W goes out and in so quickly and it has a wider range, so why cant Ekko&#039;s I just do not understand? I think it would make him so much healthier. Or another idea is to be able to call it back with a second cast (I know that probably wont fly though)","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-08-02T22:54:03.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably so that Ekko cannot reliably poke a champion and clear a wave simultaneously.

I am willing to take some range of the ability off to get it to be reliable and consistent.

If I baited out their CC then I can go right in but usually in my ELO they are a bit smarter than that. 2nd for me to have a good trade or do damage I must execute my combo/passive which is hard when I can't proc my passive, do you see where this is going. Sometimes if I time it perfectly I can completely avoid their CC because of Ekko's Instant blink, but that is more or less due to luck because timing that is ridiculous. the point to what I am saying is if I E hit them my only counter is to flash to the other side of them, but that is only worth it if I know I can kill them. \n\nHow can I do damage when I can only hit the enemy laner with the weak part of my Q because to hit an enemy with the return part of it is basically impossible early game. it really isn't fair in a lot of match ups (ranged) and comes down to waiting for the right time AKA i have to wait for an enemy to make a mistake or my jungle to come. \n\nThis is more or less an issue that isnt game breaking, but more of a quality of life. If Ahri can get a buff on her E to land her full combo so easy why cant Ekko get a buff on his Q just to make it more reliable. \n\nWhy can talon, Zed, other melee assassins have much more reliable poke then my champ Ekko. you see what I am saying take my reply from below as well.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=LeftyRaydy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oEYu0s3k,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-02T23:10:53.395+0000)\n>\n> Ok lets talk about this then.\n> \n> Talon&#x27;s has a much wider hit box and the distance is always the same whether he hits 1 or 5 champions. \n> Ahri&#x27;s Q maybe same Hitbox as Ekkos, but same thing goes the same distance and returns the same no matter how many champions hit. \n> The only ability that is similar is Gnar, but he can easily stack his passive since he is ranged and his CD is Massively reduced for catching it.\n> \n> So many other champs do not have to worry about waveclear as Ahris and talons ability both do the same damage to all champs.\n> Ekko is the only one that out of these that literally has the worst of these abilities.\n> \n> Ekkos Q does more damage on return but again its hard to get the return damage as his stun is also very hard to set up.

I play the champ A LOT. let me tell you its not at long range its an issue its the close range. because the ability basically dead stops if it hits a champion. I would take range reduction on this ability if it acted consistently, because it is so easy to dodge. Ahri Zed and other have a way to land all their abilities and utilze their combo's effectly as most assassins should have a way to execute their full combo with some consistency otherwise what is the point. Ahri has her E, talon's ability goes out and come back the same every time, zed just has to aim correctly, akali can now jump to her target with her E, but Ekko's Q is not reliable at close or long range due to the way it behaves.\n\nEven with this Ekko is one of the slower melee champions (340 MS) so champions can just walk away and you cannot finish your combo. You know who else has 340 MS Zoe. I am unable to trade damage effectively because of Ekko's Q, meanwhile all other assassins can land their combo's reliably or the enemy has to flash out of it. ekkos you have be lucky or bait out CC first which is pretty stupid and since he cant get his move speed from his passive as well it leaves you in a terrible position. Maybe the slow on his Q needs to be increased but either way it does not work well enough unless you can proc your passive and run in front of or behind your enemy then you can hit them again. \n\nHow many times people get away from only 2 hits of my passive is ridiculous. meanwhile if it was Talon or Ahri it would have never happened. so please let me the guy who plays Ekko for over 1000 games and know him pretty much in and out tell you how ridiculous this is, because it feels like talon is a better version of Ekko right now as their abilities and roles are quite similar except he has better items to choose from, more free movement, and more. The only thing Ekko has on him is a stun and landing Ekko's stun is not easy at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-08-02T22:50:21.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It slows down to give you reasonable time to react to the second hit.\n\nAhri's Q also slows down at the end, as it prepares to return.
