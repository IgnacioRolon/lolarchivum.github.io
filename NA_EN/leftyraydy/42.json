Now I believe that towers are fine for 1 on 1 scenarios, but where the issues come in is multiple party tower dives. What if a tower buffs themselves for every nearby enemy champion, or if you are outnumbered instead of just enemy champions. +armor, +damage, +attack speed, maybe even with 3 or more enemy champions or outnumbered by 3 or more they could attack 2 targets. This way would not change too much as much as laning phase but would also make towers late game much better instead of being as useful as a marshmellow launcher that was made of wet paper. I think end game these towers should matter a little bit more I am not afraid of them and I am an AP Ekko Mid main.","replies":[]}
