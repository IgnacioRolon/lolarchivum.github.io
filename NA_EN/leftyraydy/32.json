I mean he is spinning him lamp or whatever so when does he have time to slap someone with it? Although in reality it may help balance him late game if using his E slows his attack speed during the duration. This is mostly a joke, but as I think more about it, it makes me think it would actually be pretty good and not a terrible nerf for him.","replies":[{"poster":"TruelyTrueTrueth","date":"2018-06-26T20:35:27.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While spinning his lamp it is slapping people","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-06-27T16:34:31.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but he is auto attacking I mean come on it still doesnt make sense","replies":[]}]}]}
