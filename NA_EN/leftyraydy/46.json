There is not counter play to her Twilight shroud as you either have to sit there and take her damage or walk away and that is the frustrating part. Either way it is a big problem at least in my opinion and I thought abilities were supposed to have counterplay or weaknesses, but honestly there is never a bad time to use this ability and if it is off cooldown she can use it in any situation. to attack, run away, or poke you down. Either the CD for this ability needs to be increased or the duration needs to be tuned down. Another thing is the amount of time she is visible after an attack, she should probably be visible longer if she is willing to make a move in this shroud. I think these are all fair ways of making this ability much more balanced as I am not trying to gut the character, but there is not another champion that gets away with this kind of stealth and attack with the sustain she has. Walking away or sitting there and taking damage is not viable counter play and I think everyone can agree with that. What are your thoughts on the situation.\r\n\r\nMore Details:\r\n\r\nThe game I am talking about was my second to last game I played recently as Ekko (Ekko Main), and I got the first kill in lane due to jungle and akali trying to dive me. Although our jungle had a pretty Terrible game, I was ahead in farm and kills at the beginning and stlll unable to 1 v 1 Akali. Now the biggest problem with 1 v 1 on Akali and the Shroud is if you get her low and she uses it she can use her sustain to get herself up to a decent amount of health to come back at you which she should not get so much use of with her Twilight shroud.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think I would really like Opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"pseudo dionysius","date":"2018-06-19T21:04:39.800+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's qued for a rework soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PowerSlave993","date":"2018-06-20T00:34:11.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That feel when she marks you > get Q proc BUT YOU STILL CAN'T ATTACK HER CAUSE SHE GETS INTO SHROUD SO QUICKLY!!!\n\nAlthough riot is reworking her but i doubt it will be something good.

Heh, and this comes from someone that mained akali for 2 seasons.\n\nBut usually to make up for this reveal time, Akali players will go in and out of W (walking outside its range and then getting back in), because when you do that, the invisibility triggers right away, so, you don't have to wait for the \"timmer\" to run out before you get back into invis.\n\nStill the usual combo is: Q + wait until Q is up again + walk backward a bit + W forward + aa + q + aa + going back in your W\n\nPS, you shouldn't say: \"after she gets hextech gunblade + after level 6\", there's no way Akali can get gunblade in the first 8-9 minutes unless her enemy is REALLY awful at this game. So, you'll always be lv 6+ when you complete gunblade.\nBut she does get a power spike at 6 and at {{item:3145}} \nHowever, she also starts to fall of after she finishes gunblade + zhonias + boots. If Akali is on equal gold or only 1-2 kills ahead at 3 items, she now falls behind in terms of what she brings to her team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"D O Cane","date":"2018-06-28T22:17:26.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she's revealed for 0.65 seconds to be precise.

If you can dodge Ezreal Q, Malzahar Q, Thresh Q etc.. you are quick enough to hit Akali back.\n\n> The game I am talking about was my second to last game I played recently as Ekko\n\nThat match-up tends to be a stalemate. You best chance is to wear her down with Q spam, shroud or not, take favourable trades with your W and once you hit 6 line up your R on her face, shroud or not, and one shot her, but it can be a bit tricky and then both players can also buy Zhonya Hourglass etc making the duel even more tricky.\n\nGenerally, any champion with good AOE or CC spells will win against Akali, and other champions with good burst can hold just fine if you are quick with your fingers. Ekko doesn't have that much AOE or CC but he isn't defenceless, it's a skill match-up, although again, chances are you won't be able to kill each other.\n\nPlaying against Akali is kind of straight forward, you throw your AOE spells into her shroud, and if your spells are on cooldown, you stay away from her shroud. And if you have CC spells, you save it for when she R you.\n\nAkali isn't getting nerfed because she is simply not very good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-06-19T23:41:48.475+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Odd to see everyone agreeing so far. they should at least nerf her Twilight shroud for now and it doesnt even have to be a heavy nerf just make it more manageable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2018-06-21T13:39:15.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait, you can't AoE her pool and damage her?
