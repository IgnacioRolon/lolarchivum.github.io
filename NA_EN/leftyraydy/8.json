I don&#039;t understand what is going on really with this assassin update. It seems they are giving AD assassins a huge buff with items and champion changes. What about AP assassins, where are the new items for them? as if ad champs needed more advantages i feel like hexdrinker will still be purchased on ad assassins with the new spellshield item this might get out of hand quickly. The thing is Ekko already has trouble in mid lane right now. Constantly being punished by ranged champions and until 6 there really is no way to engage safely against a ranged opponent. as soon as you use your E you have the enemy jungler coming at you and then you have nothing to get away with. What my biggest issue with this is champions such as lux, ahri, and syndra can easily just cc you (lux and ahri) or push you away (syndra). Ekko mid right now as it is really is just waiting for the enemy to make a mistake before you can even try to damage them. Ekko unlike other melee mid champs has trouble farming. Zed can easily use q to farm, fizz&#039;s passive helps him navigate and take less damage, akali can use her q  to farm and shroud to help, talon might be close to ekko&#039;s farming issue as Ekko if you have to rely on your Q to farm its terrible you end up killing one minion for damage a bunch more and pushing your lane which puts you in trouble, because of the jungler and ekko&#039;s E is not the greatest escape lets be honest. Final thing that bothers me is ekko&#039;s base move speed why 340 akali has 350 can someone explain this to me? can we get new ap penn items please Riot for AP assassins. tell me what you think I dont know.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-10-21T00:00:56.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do so many people complaining about the balance changes, which are very GOOD and take away a lot of the needless power extremely furstrating and flat overpowered aspects of some assassins kits, seem incapable of making their walls of rant actually readable? \n\n\nEkko has trouble farming? \n\nQ. AA. AA. AA. your wave is now cleared. \nThe ekko change was VERY NEEDED and many people have been asking for it for a very long time at this point.

Map awareness OP. Also you bought zero pink wards in the games where you fed hard, could be a coincidence but i doubt it. Maybe if you dont overextend without vision,... you wont die? Who knows though ekkos kit is so outdated with little room to outplay and definitely needs a buff so you can 1 v 5 scrubs with your {{item:3041}} when you feed after throwing a lead","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zacktootall","date":"2016-10-21T00:00:27.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"and as a vi main i downvote you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paladin 0f Life","date":"2016-10-21T00:09:45.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not just poke and trade with Q, ward a bit then wait for kill or roam when wave is pushed? When someone uses an ability to farm while you are under tower just engage and kill them. Most mages cant burst ekko with full lvl 3-5 kit. He has good burst, sustain damage and a shield. If you catch a midlaner near your turret just engage with your full kit while they have cooldowns and you have decent auto damage from W and a slow and stun that will make them either flash or die. So they will make mistake and when they do just kill them or push wave in and roam for kills.","replies":[]}]}
