Idk about you guys but I dont mind so much that he wasnt taking a lot of damage from me, but my problem is that he was able to do so much damage to me with just a spirit visage. I just dont think a Tank with 0 damage Items I mean he had boots, dorans sheild, and a spirit visage yet was able to do so much more damage to me than I was to him. I usually take Ekko Mid lane anyway, but got autofilled top so this isnt a long term issue I just feel a little salty about it I guess.","replies":[]}
