I don&#039;t really think this is a fair mechanic. My Q gets blocked way after the wind wall was activated. instead of me killing and outplaying him, he kills me...... Riot if you are around can you let me know how this is supposed to go?\n\nEdit: So I am saying after I use my E and blink to Yasuo my Q is blocked after I already passed the shield.

So after I E'd to Yasuo I then Q'd which is why I am saying this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GhostOfTsushima","date":"2018-11-27T04:18:33.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah u suck GG","replies":[]}]}
