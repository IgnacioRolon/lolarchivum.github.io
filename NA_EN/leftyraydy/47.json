I will say 2 games in ranked yesterday (high plat) I went against Ryze and his team did win both of these games. Now I did poorly in 1 game 3/6/3, but our bot lane was also 1/8 and 1/6 so that did not really help, but the other I did pretty decent going 7/4/6 but he still was just so tilting to play against. I do not see ryze often, but he is just so oppressive against melee mid champions or at least my main guy {{champion:245}}. Things are fine from the start of the lane, but only until he goes back once and then he is completely unstoppable and I just have to stay back and try to farm, and I say try because I can only farm or push with Q and end up missing a lot due to not because able to last hit unless I want to suffer the wrath of empowered Q from my minions being hit. I cant going in on him because of his point and click snare, and with phase rush he&#039;s running around way to fast to even think about landing my W on him. and its hard to predict if he will move 1 way or the other as its so easy for him to come at you using his abilities or kite you using his abilities. \r\n\r\nI get he may not be that big of a problem with other champions I just dont see the need for him to have a snare ability anymore at least not a point and click snare. I am sitting here playing against this champ thinking to myself all I hear on the boards is how &quot;gutted&quot; this champion was and here he is shitting on me and his damage is absolutely insane with only mana (which I think we need to get rid of mana = + damage champions as a whole not talking about seraph or muramana I am talking about Ryze and Kassadin). Building mana for damage is just a ridiculous concept but that is besides the point.\r\n\r\nWhat is ryze&#039;s defined weakness I am not seeing it, or seeing this &quot;gutted&quot; champion with an abysmal win rate the board likes to talk about.","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2018-10-15T22:01:00.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I am sitting here playing against this champ thinking to myself all I hear on the boards is how \"gutted\" this champion was and here he is shitting on me \n\nI know it's hard to admit, but maybe it's not the champion, it's the player. Perhaps he's simply better than you. I mean, I've heard a lot of complaints about Ekko too, but when you win, it's because you did well, not just because of your champion pick right? So the same should apply to the Ryze player.\n\nAnyway, I recommend hardshoving your lane, and using the opportunity to roam. Ryze's mana costs are actually really high, and you can spam q's 24/7 while he scrambles to match your clear. He'll run oom and can't do much.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-15T22:48:22.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said early game is not the problem I can lane with him till like his 2nd back and then he is just untouchable. He can always just snare me and if I get to close to CS he can hit me with all the minions. its troubling. This is one of those cases where he kind of counters Ekko as really anyone with point and click abilities counters Ekko as you cant dodge with E or side step.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-15T17:14:45.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze is essentially the ADC of mages. His damage focuses on DPS over straight burst (although he has more burst and less dps than most traditional ADCs). He also retains a lot of a mages utility.\n\nFor this, he sacrifices range. His spells all dont really have a ton of range to them. His early game can also be pretty weak depending on matchup, as he lacks mana to waveclear and dps.\n\nIf youre playing ekko into him, he is goong to have the advantage later, as he gets damage from resist items (mana > damage) and ekko has to close in to do his combo, meaning you get inside his threat range for him.\n\nBest bet is likely to shove and roam. Ryze isnt all that great at taking towers (mana > damage is good for him, but ap is what gets checked into towers).","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-15T17:58:11.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with this is if he free farms he gets redicoulsy strong very quickly. If you see my games I did roam and get kills, but letting him farm just lets him get to his strong part of the game with no issues. I feel he needs a more defined weakness other than just early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-15T18:27:43.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then youll need to swap lanes. I dont think ekko can punish ryze very well, assuming both are skilled. Maybe in the early game, but by level 8 or so i think he will be too tanky and have enough resources where he likely wont ever be in threat of death.\n\nMaybe depending on jungler and jungler skill you can set up ganks, but thats bringing another champion into the mix entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-15T19:21:38.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I agree, but then I would need solo que people to work with me haha.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
