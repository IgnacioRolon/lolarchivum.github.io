Say someone on your team is DC&#039;d, having spike ping issues, or any other type of issue that would have an effect to someone&#039;s performance in game. Allow a vote for a pause for both teams. instead of /ff you could do /pg (pausegame) and it would start a vote. Now each team gets 1 pause per game and the vote has to be either most or unanimous whatever would work better. once the vote is successful it will announce to everyone the game is pausing in 15-30 seconds with a countdown (this way it will not interupt any team fights, Obective, and so on). Once the game is paused it goes through all 5 minutes so that everyone will know when they game begins again. The game will announce 30 seconds before it starts up again and do another countdown. \r\n\r\nNow I know there is a lot of down sides to this, but this might help with small issues. it is enough time to restart your internet and/or restart your computer (if you have a solid state drive at least). although I do not know what strain pausing games will have on the server on riots side. what are your thoughts.","replies":[]}
