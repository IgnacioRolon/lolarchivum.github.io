I mean this would make champs that had to be nerfed for very coordinated top notch teams to be played in solo que as they should. I mean it is a bit confusing why Pro&#039;s play at the same standards as solo que. This would solve a lot of issues including the recent Lee Sin &quot;pro play buffs&quot; among other things.","replies":[{"poster":"Unker139","date":"2018-08-08T17:23:18.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally like the idea that I'm playing the same game as the pros even if I can't play at that level.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-08T18:02:01.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean you will still be playing the same game as the pros, but I am talking about making some champions more viable for solo que, because Shen has to be kept down as well as some others for Pro play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-08-08T15:38:52.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because it would effectively be making different games.\n\nchanging the rules of the game for different levels of play would be super awkward.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-08T17:07:24.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why the Solo/Flex queue would remain the same.
