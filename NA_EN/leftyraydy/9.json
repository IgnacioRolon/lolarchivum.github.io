Usually they come around to what the community is saying, but either A Go way too far on something, or B doesn&#039;t do enough. I feel like there is no happy medium with them and here are some examples.\r\n\r\nReworked Aatrox released\r\n-Boards PLEASE Buff LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE\r\n-Riot Buffs\r\n-Aatrox - now I will show you my true power\r\n-Riot Dear god what have we done\r\n\r\n-Boards Nerf Zoe\r\n-Riot Barely nerfs\r\n-Boards PLZZZ NERF ZOE\r\n-nerfs more\r\n-Boards still have bad taste of zoe\r\n-Riot Buffs zoe\r\n\r\nThen there are the examples that Riot just doesn&#039;t give A F*** about what the boards say\r\n\r\n-Boards Akali Shroud is the only thing bad about her please do something\r\n-Riot .....\r\n-Boards: Please she is balanced except for the shroud\r\n-Riot Akali No longer has 4 last-hit assistance.\r\n\r\n-Boards Stormrazor was a bad addition to the game\r\n-Riot......\r\n-Boards PLZ do something\r\n-Riot *Nerfs wukong*\r\n-Boards......\r\n\r\nI will give credit to Riot on some very positive changes I believe as of recent\r\n-Getting rid of Added minion stats based on teams average level\r\n-finally turret changes\r\n-stat shards (however small still a step in the right direction)\r\n\r\nThings Riot just won&#039;t deal with or respond too\r\n-Crazy minion block/pathing around minion problems\r\n-Skill shot matching Visuals (big shout out to Talon W, Morgana bind, and Blitz pull)\r\n-addressing champion core issues to why they are either banned even if they are not overpowered (Zoe, Yasuo, Zed, Ahri, Akali and so on)\r\n\r\nAnyway my overall point of riot really digging down into the core problems that the players have with the game they either Do too much to something, do too little to something, or completely ignore the problem. What Riot doesn&#039;t understand is the frustrating level of playing against some of these champions and really need to look into frustrating mechanics to play against and REALLY REALLY think about it before releasing a champion with these frustrating mechanics or implementing new mechanics into the game that only the player playing that champion is going to LOVE and think is &quot;perfectly balanced&quot;. I mean whether these champions are overpowered, overtuned, balanced (in terms of WR), or even underpowered no one wants to play against frustrating mechanics and you should not want your playerbase frustrated to play against these champions. Riot with 142 champions (about to be 143) you should not have a champion with more than 30-40% ban rate and why would you ever want this for your champions that you worked so hard on and so &quot;proud&quot; of. I think if you want your playerbase to be content try and see what it is that we are frustrated with.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2018-11-20T18:29:21.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about matchmaking disparity?\nWhat about 0 talks about changes or status of behavior management?\n\nThey not only didn't listen to us about balance overall, but they have been silent as the night about how little IFS has done to promote positivity or catch trolling/throwing games.\n\nYou may or may not get banned for typing, but you can ruin hundreds of games throwing and may never get punished","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-20T19:45:12.845+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But this is what I am referring to.

Or..she was, and now we'll have to see how preseason lands on her to see if she's still fine.
