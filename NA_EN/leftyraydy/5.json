Since this meta is so Snowbally and the fact that games almost have 0 frontline/tanks it makes it even worse.  in previous season if you got ahead and destroyed your lane you still had to be careful at the team fighting stage because you could get locked down by a tank/front-line and be killed. Now because my last few games have been (Akali top, Graves Jungle, and mage supports) its actually just so incredible how bad a team like this does from behind. now I play Ekko mid or Kayn jungle and with there being no other front line champions I get pooped on so quickly and the only engage on the team is me at this point. If this was 1 or 2 games then fine I would live with it, but this is consistent as tanky champs get pushed out the games are even more snowbally then ever. \r\n\r\nYou could take a silver 5 player and put him in a plat/diamond game and if they get ahead that is it there is almost no stopping a champ now once ahead as they will bring pain to all lanes and team fights. even if the champion is squishy because they are ahead and the lack of a tanky front line they will kill 2-3 champs before they are dead. you cannot compete for the eye of Herald, dragon, or anything because of how far ahead they are too. I mean once the game gets rolling they get a few kills take first tower and its basically GG at 10 minutes not even 15. I have had plenty of games this season where either my team or the enemy team will have almost every tower taking while the opposing team will have 0-1 towers destroyed. The gold difference gets too ridiculous too quickly and makes any skill irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWhen I am ahead I do not even have to try anymore (since I play Ekko) all I have to do is E to a champion and even if I miss my Q or W I can easily kill a champ with 2 Autos, my E and Ignite (with Electrocute proc). I find myself making mistakes but because I am so far ahead so quickly it doesnt matter I take the kill with plenty of health to spare. This is not OK at all. It is so easy to Stomp once ahead because your mistakes barely matter, but if you are behind any mistake you make is multiplied by 10 no matter how small it is.\r\n\r\nNow note I am in mid plat so this is just my experience as tanky champions are just not even worth to pick right now due to how garbage they are. I want games to be more skill expressive. Now obviously skill does mattter in League right now, but only in the very early game (before 10 minutes) and the very late game (post 40 minutes) as everyone is almost full build.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-08-09T16:12:21.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">You could take a silver 5 player and put him in a plat/diamond game and if they get ahead that is it there is almost no stopping [the Silver V]\n\nThis just isn't true, though, not even close. Unless the s5 has more kills than minutes in the game, any mid-diamond - Or, fuck, even any mid-plat - would stomp him, unless the *sole* thing holding him back was either being absolutely terrible in early-game, and he actually has phenomenal skills in teamfights and shit, or just him not playing ranked.\n\nThere are still a lot of champions that take skill, they're just not as popular right now. It's fallen over to a lot of point and click assassins and fighters, with AFK-farming and poking mages dominating bot.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-09T16:59:23.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am telling you I have seen the videos where they place Bronze and silver players in High elo games on youtube \"do they deserve it\".

It was the same issue. Junglers snowballed just as hard, I know that for a fact because I played a ton of Devourer Shyvana at that time. The game was plagued with Yi's, Kayle's and Shyvana's building that item then capping objectives so fast that the enemy team couldn't possibly deal with the massive gold difference. I counter jungled so hard that season that I saw enemy jgs 3+ levels behind me at some points.\n\nSeason 5 was fun but don't look at it with rose tinted glasses. It had problems too my dood.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"murderess","date":"2018-08-09T19:23:54.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> You could take a silver 5 player and put him in a plat/diamond game and if they get ahead that is it there is almost no stopping a champ now once ahead as they will bring pain to all lanes and team fights.\n\nAh, you're joking, right? They'd immediately go and overextend and give their opponents a huge shutdown. Then they'd suddenly be behind because in the meantime they got 0 farm, path inefficient as F and would probably just continue to chain int.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trixsta","date":"2018-08-09T17:19:51.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Midgame closing out games not making mistakes starving opponents takes skill and macro hence game time decreases the higher u go.
