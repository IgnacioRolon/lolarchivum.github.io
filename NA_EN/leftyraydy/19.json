I got to plat 3 almost to my promo's and decided to play around in other roles after a few autofill games. Played Jhin, Kayn, and Gnar for a few games (terribly if I may say), and dropped to plat 5 basically with a whole lot of losses in a row. Not only do the team mates I get paired with every game are very hit or miss when I win I get 14-16 lp and when I lose its minus 20-24 LP. How am I supposed to win these games I am performing well even when I am losing, but other lanes are feeding so hard. I do not flame, but I cant win these games on my own unless I absolutely destroy my lane. I use to have a 54% WR and now I am at 50%. I am getting so frustrated because it seems every time I climb close to 100 LP Plat 5 I get a crushing set of losses. If I go even with my lane I lose because the other lanes are performing so poorly. What can I do to get my MMR back to where it is supposed to be If I cant win a game!","replies":[]}
