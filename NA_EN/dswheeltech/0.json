I've tried several times to unistall and reinstall. I've been researching this for the past couple of days and any help would be appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T03:22:23.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to know what's going on without knowing the type of errors you're getting, but we could start with double checking your permissions. Make sure your OS is allowing League to launch and use the files it needs by following the steps listed here in this [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions).","replies":[{"poster":"dswheeltech","date":"2018-01-23T00:08:01.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking interest in my problem, the error message is \n\"An unkown DirectX error has occurred and League of Legends cannot start.
