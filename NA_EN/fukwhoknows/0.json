Additionally, the champion and skin both need to be unlocked to unleash their first strike loading screen.  Darius does not currently have a project skin, and cannot use a first strike border.\n\nLooking into this for you, I see that you've successfully unlocked Project Ekko's First Strike icon by fusing 7 cores with your First Strike Ekko Blueprint.  Your account, however, still needs to unlock Ekko and his project skin.  \n\nWe also have made a detailed [Project Disruption ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210155266-PROJECT-DISRUPTION-FAQ)guide with more information.
