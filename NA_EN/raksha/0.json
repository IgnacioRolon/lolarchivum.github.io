Thanks for the heads up on that!  We've had events in the past like bonus IP weekends that boosted IP earned based on the size of the premade.  I'm not sure if that being there is intended but I appreciate it shows as 0% since there's no event going on right now.  When you get a chance, I suggest posting about this on the[ bug report boards ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)just in case.  Thanks again!\n\nEdit:  I stand corrected!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
