I was wrong in my previous thought of having a leave buster the second time it seems, but i did get -3 LP for it.  I was talking in chat, had yet to choose my champion, i had just banned kat i believe and then the popup appeared. the time before , the same thing happened, i was about to click on my page that time to check my mastery sets but then it crashed and that time was a normal game, so i got a leave buster. That's all i can recall.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T23:31:20.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this detailed information!
