However, if Yasuo decides to use a windwall on a already landed bomb, it disappears as well because it is still a classified as a projectile. Keep in mind that after the bomb has landed, it is, by definition, no longer a projectile; a good part of Zilean's gameplay is to block a path with bombs so as to keep from retreating, help out your own retreating, or kiting; Yasuo has 3 seconds to react; Zilean's bombs are so big, it is difficult not to hit it with a windwall and  Zillean only has two damage moves; which have a decent sized cooldown so yasuo can windwall basically almost everytime I throw a bomb and it hits an area  (Q for poke or QWQ for heavy poke/ kill should you press the buttons rapidly enough as to get the stun). \n\ntl;dr{{champion:157}}'s W stops {{champion:26}}'s Q after they were put on the ground, making them no longer a projectile by definition but classified as one.\n\nI propose the idea that Riot makes the bomb, when it is on the ground, be classified as a pet for coding purposes that explodes like {{champion:35}}'s clone, has 0 damage for  attacking, is untargetable, and is not controllable like {{champion:83}}'s ghouls, {{champion:143}} 's plants, and {{champion:90}}'s old voidlings and, when it is not on the ground, be classified as a projectile that can be blocked.","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2016-05-16T21:00:38.914+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":1,"body":"This would be a bug, but I can't get it to happen on my test rig.

I'm not familiar with League's own engine, or whether what I'm about to suggest is possible (or recommended), but an alternative could be for Wind Wall to calculate how much of the wave it's blocking, and release secondary projectiles to either side of the remaining size, which would allow Tidal Wave to have its number of projectiles unaffected, and would add at most one more projectile into play (there could be another secondary projectile, but the main wave would be destroyed either way). The same could also potentially be done for other wide projectiles, such as Arcane Barrage or even Whirling Death.","replies":[{"poster":"Sypher The Poro","date":"2016-05-17T02:29:21.015+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, think of it this way:\n\n1) You can turn each projectile (That is bigger than Windwall anyway) into multiple for this new mechanic. This way you can update them one by one.\n\n2) You add a shit ton of extra code to Windwall, having to add all that spawning code for each ability that works with this mechanic. This way you do it all at once.\n\n2 is a horrible idea in my opinion, since you are adding code for several champions to a different champion. It is a much better idea to keep each champion's code to itself, so you don't have to switch back and forth between the 2 everytime you need to change one little thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kosm1K","date":"2016-05-17T04:09:12.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your idea in theory, but with some background in coding, it would be ridiculously difficult to code without having several bugs in it.
