Otherwise, it would be irreverent.\r\n* Instead of a giant gemstone hammer, he should be armed with a steeldriver's sledge.\r\n* He should be shirtless.\r\n* He should retain his mane of hair but probably in the form of braids or dreadlocks.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-07-23T00:07:40.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great idea and I am 100% in favour of more beefcake (to balance out the enormous amounts of cheesecake).
