Here's my question then:\r\n\r\nWho would you prefer to have on your team?\r\n\r\n* A cheerful, courteous player who is 25% worse than the team average.\r\n* A grouchy, rude player who is 25% better than the team average.\r\n\r\nIf you choose the cheerful player, how much worse than the team average would that player have to be before you'd switch to grouchy but 25% better?\r\n\r\nIf you choose the grouchy player, by how much would that player's skill need to decrease before you'd switch to cheerful but 25% worse?","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-05-06T00:33:10.822+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like being cheerful/communicative/supportive provides a multiplier to the effectiveness of a team. I recall many more comebacks from rough starts where someone offered words of encouragement as opposed to rage. Thus, I would unscientifically argue that the cheerful but inept player will increase the effectiveness of the other 4 players, and potentially make up for their lesser skill.\n\nThat being said, if I'm correct, then the cheerful player will matchmake \"above their skill\", since they will contribute to wins simply via their attitude.","replies":[{"poster":"Garlyle Wilds","date":"2014-05-07T15:29:37.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of the best game experiences I've had were games I lost.\n\nBut I had so much fun with the actual people involved that it stopped mattering.\n\nThose are the games I play League for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight Devout","date":"2014-05-06T16:18:33.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.\n\nIt already happened twice this season that I died to wight while typing a response to a teammate who was flaming me or someone else for a mistake.\n\nTime lost, gold lost, exp lost, and just to respond to harass.\n\nIn SoloQ, harassing players IN YOUR TEAM is just like going afk : if you aren't going to type anything constructive, just don't type at all.\n\nOn the other hand, being friendly never harms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vortex IV","date":"2014-05-06T03:54:21.287+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's one hell of a dream you have.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Water of Eden","date":"2014-05-04T05:13:37.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that grouchiness or skill is something that is subject to numbers.

Also, I was tired when I posted that.

Generally cheery players communicate better. If someone's willing to listen to me, and heeds my advice, that can go a long way towards making them a better player (in that game at least), but communication skills aren't something accounted for in this comparison.","replies":[]}]}
