We've seen a pretty consistent pattern where putting small information the player doesn't immediately need to know into tooltips reduces people's ability to learn a champion because it draws attention away from the key points.

I realize now that this has caused some really awkward moments that I attributed to something else like not hitting Q again fast enough, trying to cast two abilities at the same time, or other bad play on my part. Turns out there is a piece of arcane knowledge about this ability that is not otherwise documented. Its really hard to get better at a champ when important information like recast delay isn't clearly communicated.\n\nFrankly, the tooltip for the ability screams \"double tap me for an instant stun effect just like Anivia's Q\" which isn't true. Adding \"after a brief delay the ability can be reactivated\" to the tooltip seems to be a small cost in exchange for clearly communicating the intent of the ability. Many abilities that can be reactivated allow the player to 'double tap' the ability for an instant effect. \n\nI've already mentioned Anivia in regard to 'double tapping' but Varus, Xerath, Lux, and Gragas all have 'double tap' abilities. The last two have even had special announcements in patch notes when the 'double tap' was implemented on their respective abilities. In contrast you have the (previously mentioned) Zed ult that specifically states its delay before recasting. I bring up all these champions to illustrate that A-Sol's Q deviates from the norm as far as delays are concerned. Even Lux and Ezreal ult's clearly state that there is a delay before the effect even though the delay on both abilities is more than obvious after a single observation of them in-game.\n\nPlease don't tread down this path of non-clarity again. Players pleaded with Riot when Diana was released to put a passive counter in the form of a buff on her. These pleas were swiftly rebuked by the lead on Diana because they were certain that watching Diana swing her weapon was clarity enough in the heat of battle. Just as you now (appear) to argue that A-Sol's current Q tooltip is clarity enough in the heat of battle. IIRC it was over a year before the players were heard on Diana's passive buff counter. \n\nPlease listen now and clarify the intent of A-Sol's Q in the tooltip. A single sentence to clarify the recast delay wouldn't add much to a medium size tooltip like Starsurge's. There is still plenty of room before you reach half the size of something extreme like Illaoi's E tooltip.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Voids Call","date":"2016-03-30T05:26:42.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree and understand why some aspects of some abilities would be unneeded and actually impede in the learning of the champion. \n\nAt first i wasn't actually sure if this was a bug, intended, or me just not noticing a stun/silence somehow (which would be really hard considering i'd lose my passive).
