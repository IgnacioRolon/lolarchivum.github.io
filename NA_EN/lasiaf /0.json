So I usually play with 120-150 ms with constant lagspike to 200-300 .. but yesterday was awesome because I had the best ping that I ever had .. 90-100 with no lagspikes I don't know why or how ! .. but today it came back same to 120-150 with lagspikes .. I was wondering if there is a specific reason for this ?? I would love to be still able to play with 90 ms ! Thank you .. and I would appreciate your help","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T00:07:31.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may not actually have anything to do with your own network, but more likely associated with the way your connection is being routed if that ping fluctuates so often. Let's first check for any packet loss by using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to scan some of the network logs from those games with lagspikes.
