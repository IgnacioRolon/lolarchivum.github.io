I'm actually trying to post the text below as a new discussion but I keep getting the error 500 when I try to post.\n\nThere's actually 2 bugs. They are related, I guess.\n\n1. The first one is in your collection. Your runes list will appear as normal, but if you hover your mouse over the 4th row of the runes it will display whatever is on the 6th row. \n\n1. This is one is the scary one. When on champ select. The rune list will display 3 times the 6th row of your runes. Starting on 4th row and ending on the 6th row. Those 3 rows will display whatever is on the 6th row.\n\nProof:\n[Click here to see the screen shots](http://imgur.com/a/1iYtq)\n\nNotes: \n\n* I discovered this bug while editing my runes. Before editing my runes everything was fine. \n\n* I've tried restarting the client and my PC. It does not work.\n\n* Full repair does not work neither.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T01:24:18.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dug around in your rune pages, and it looks like that second page was somehow tied to the first one, which is why it wouldn't let you make any changes. I made a couple adjustments, and you should be able to set up that second page now.
