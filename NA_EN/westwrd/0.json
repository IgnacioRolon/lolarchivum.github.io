I regularly have about a 60 ping that remains consistent, but since the update it is all over the place and jumps between 60 and 800 every min.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T01:33:40.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's test a few things to see if we can get that ping smoothed out around 60 again. One good step I like to try first is switching your DNS server settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 to get a clearer signal to Googles servers first. After that, test it out in a custom game to see if it helps or not.\n\nIf that's not helping, we might need to dig a little deeper to see what's wrong. There could possibly be some issues with packet loss, and a traceroute could help pinpoint that. You can get that done by using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and running a trace to 104.160.131.1, then post those results here for me.","replies":[{"poster":"BHS Ledfrog","date":"2018-02-01T03:25:08.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having having the same issue. 40 ping normally. Yesterday it was 110, today its steady at 135. I ran \"tracert 104.160.131.1\" and the response time jumped from ~28ms to 135ms at ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.22].

If there are indeed spikes around riotdirect it could signify a problem, but we'd need the full trace to confirm.

I'll be sure to check in on that, and with a ticket the techs will be able to take a look as well ^_^.\n\nGlad to hear that ping is back down, might have been some weird hiccup in routing or something? Hopefully it doesn't start spiking again anytime soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Dad Voice","date":"2018-02-03T20:47:11.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issues and here are my logs with that tool you told him to download.
