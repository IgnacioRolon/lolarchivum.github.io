I&#039;m also not plat. not even gonna say I&#039;m gold. I&#039;m unranked and playing my placements. OK I&#039;m not doing good but before i even die once i get flamed. I&#039;ve reported them all. every flamer I&#039;ve encountered but i haven&#039;t seen one notice from riot games letting me know anything happened. but i digress. my point is why for the last 5 games in a row have i been flamed and why does the community think this is acceptable? many of you will say, well we aren&#039;t like that, or that&#039;s a small minority. but if it is then why does it seem to be a reoccurring issue? more importantly why do people think that its OK to be rude to your own teammate? I&#039;m well aware that this issue has been present since 2009, but I don&#039;t think the way Riot is tackling this issue is effective in the slightest. \r\n\r\ntl;dr play any champ and gets flamed, every game whether I&#039;m doing good or not. on the verge of quitting due to toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"ΛrπζrιΠ","date":"2018-11-03T13:40:55.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid there is no community, just angry people competing for a backpack.
