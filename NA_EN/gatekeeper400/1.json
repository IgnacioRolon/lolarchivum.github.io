So, I had to improvise. This is what I would want his armor to look like. Drop the helmet and replace it with the Darkin faceguard, and add a crimson color to the spauldrons. With a few edits here and there, the set should work out fine.\nhttp://m.imgur.com/D5T2xBc\n\nAs for the shield, I wanted it to look something around this. Forgive me guys. Stuff like this was difficult to find, so I am working with what I got.\nhttp://m.imgur.com/8YVicLU\n\n**Lore**\nDragkor Kahn, one of the five legendary Darkin warriors, was a quite unusual being. From what the stories had foretold about Aatrox and how he worked in complete synergy with his blade of torment, alongside other secretive tales in regards to how dark and mysterious the aliens operated in the fields of war, Dragkor was never taken as seriously. He was the only Darkin who didn't wield a blade or anything related to it. Because he only bore an ancient shield with him, he was considered a protector and only that. Storytellers believed that without the shield, Dragkor was nothing more than a lost fairytale, a joke to tell mere commoners.\n\nHowever, there was more to Dragkor than what the stories mocked. \n\nIt was on a fateful day during a battle that meant no more than utter destruction. To those Aatrox pushed foward, they believed that it was a confidence booster, a morale jumper. As the Darkin blade led his pawns deeper and deeper into the pits of insanity with his blinding encouragement, he let his strength get the best of him. It wasn't recorded in the lores that were scribed, but an unknown entity caught him off guard and separated Aatrox from his trusted weapon. From the impact of the blow, Aatrox's opponent wasn't human, nor a Voidborn. Before Aatrox had time to call forth his weapon back to his side once more, the entity charged at him with unbelievable speeds and pinned him to the ground. Warriors who tried to help Aatrox were killed off instantly, and soon Aatrox's minions were no more. As Aatrox looked into the haunting eyes of his soon-to-be killer, he could do nothing but watch in disbelief as the entity brought his fist down upon him. \n\nThen it happened. In a blink of an eye, a massive shield knocked the enemy aside as if it were nothing. The entity crashed into the ground and chunks of earth exploded in response. Aatrox took no spare time to find out what caused the parry, reunited himself with his blade, and cut the entity down to dust in mere seconds while it was dazed from the attack. He turned with his mind set on murder and revenge for such embarrassment, hoping to find another target to slice through. Instead, he found a being similar to him staring him down with the same intentions. It was a fellow Darkin, one he knew well. \n\n\"Dragkor…\" Aatrox murmured, releasing some of the grip on his sword. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"I could ask you the same thing, Aatrox,\" Dragkor said with a powerful voice, walking towards him and leaving crater-sized footprints in his wake. \"Tell me, what have these people done to you?\"\n\n\"Why should it matter? Humans are nothing more than fools blinded by their impossible dream of strength and superiority. Such ignorance must accept the outcomes of their fiendish desires,\" Aatrox grunted, kicking aside a fallen soldier that was torn to shreds. \"I really hope that after years of hiding in the shadows, you haven't grown soft over these pests.\"\n\n\"Watch yourself, Aatrox,\" Dragkor growled, standing over Aatrox and blocking out all light that reached him. Aatrox looked at his face as the average man would look at the sun. Except there was no sun. Only darkness. \"You may be a Darkin, but be warned from this day. If you ever call me out of my name I'll kill you where you stand. You and your damned blade will both be vessels to my power!\"\n\nAatrox tightened his muscles to conceal the slight intimidation he felt from Dragkor's words. \"Why have you come back?\"\n\nDragkor balled his hand up into a fist and stared at it, which made Aatrox tighten his muscles even more in fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. \"There's power out here now, untapped strengths that yearn to be awakened. The world isn't what it used to be anymore, Aatrox. Everything follows a dark sinister path now. People murder, sacrifice, and steal to gain all of the knowledge and power we do. There's stronger magic, stronger creatures, a stronger chance of me finally being defeated for the first time out of my thousand-year lifetime. I can't let this pass by and do nothing. I must fight!\"\n\nAatrox grinned. \"It's always been that way with you, hasn't it? Even after five hundred years of concealment, you still wish to hunt for the strongest. You haven't changed since the day you were born. Very well then.\"\n\nDragkor looked at him. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"If what you say is true to your heart, then I will abide you on this quest of yours. It is no doubt a fact that there a great powers that lie out there in this world and many others. Who knows? Perhaps you may encounter a foe with powers that topple yours by a million years. In this universe, the possibilities are endless.\"\n\nDragkor chuckled and shouted as he drove his fist into the ground, causing the earth below him to give in to his might. Aatrox fluttered his wings and floated, only to see a massive hole in the ground. It looked as if a meteorite had tore through the earth and suddenly disappeared after traveling hundreds of feet deep. \"That'll be the day, won't it Aatrox?\"\n\n*Hiding your true strength from me would be the greatest mistake of your life.*\n- Dragkor, the Darkin Shield\n\n************************\n\n**Statistics Levels 1 - 18**\nHealth: 583 - 2096\nHealth Regeneration: 7.5 ( + .87 per level) {.87 x 18 + 7.5}\nResource: Blood Well [Health to contribute to Blood Well]\nAttack Damage: 48 (+2.3 per level) { 2.3 x 18 + 48}\nAttack Speed: 0.625 [+0% - 47.6%]\nRange: 125 [Melee]\nArmor: 26.9 - 86.4\nMagic Resistance: 30 - 55\nMovement Speed: 345\n\n**Passive (Innate) - Blood Well [Cooldown: 0]:** Whenever Dragkor uses an ability that costs health, he stores 100% of the health into his Blood Well, up to a maximum of 75 / I20 / 165 / 210 / 255 / 300 / 345 / 390 / 435 / 480 / 525 / 570 / 615 / 660 / 705 / 750 / 795 / 840 (Dragkor's magic resist + Dragkor's armor × Dragkor's level) health. If Dragkor has not dealt nor received damage in the last 5 seconds, his Blood Well will deplete at a rate of 2% per second. Dragkor's armor and magic resist is increased by 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 for every 5% of health in his Blood Well. Upon reaching a full Blood Well, Dragkor is blessed with a shield that absorbs up to 150 / 200 / 250 / 300 / 350 / 400 / 450 / 500 / 550 / 600 / 650 / 700 / 750 / 800 / 850 / 900 / 950 / 1000 damage. The shield stays active until it is destroyed, in which case Dragkor gains rapid health regeneration for 3 seconds. \n\n**Q - Destructive Swing [Cost: 10% of maximum health] [Cooldown: 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4]:** Dragkor throws his shield in an arc, dealing damage and slowing all enemies caught in its path. Damage and slow effects vary prior to their distance from Dragkor. Those nearest to him who are hit by Destructive Swing are dealt 50 / 90 / 130 / 170  / 210 magic damage and slowed by 10% for 2 seconds. Those furthest away from him who are hit by Destructive Swing are dealt 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 / 300 magic damage and slowed by 30% for 2 seconds.\n\n**W - Blood Alliance [Cost: 10% of maximum health] [Cooldown: 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 / 11]:** Dragkor throws his shield at an ally, linking his life to theirs for 5 seconds. During the time, if an enemy attacks the protected champion, 75% / 80% / 85% / 90% / 95% of the damage is dealt to Dragkor instead, and a small percentage of the damage recieved is fueled into his Blood Well. However, the protected ally is still affected by crowd control effects. Blood Alliance cannot be casted on Dragkor himself, and Blood Alliance can be interrupted by recasting it. Dragkor cannot use any of his abilities without his shield.\n\n**E - Transfusion (Passive):** Dragkor gains bonus health equal to a moderate percentage of his maximum armor.\n**Active [Cost: 20% of maximum health] [Cooldown: 30 / 28 / 26 / 24 / 22]:** Dragkor drives his shield into the ground and kneels, immobilizing himself and creating a small blood zone that heals allies inside of it and increases their movement speed by 15% for 2 seconds outside of the zone. Transfusion channels as long as Dragkor has blood in his Blood Well, which depletes by 5% per second. Transfusion does not heal Dragkor or give him the movement speed boost, and can be interrupted by recasting it. \n\n**R - Dark Wall [Cost: 0% of maximum health] [Cooldown: 160 / 140 / 120]:** Dragkor summons a wall of dark matter. If an enemy attack collides with Dark Wall, 80% / 90% / 100% of the damage is returned to the attacker as magic damage. Dark Wall stays active for 5 seconds before collapsing and slowing all enemies near it by 99% for 1 second. As a secondary effect, Dragkor's Blood Well is instantly filled. \n**Additional Effect(s):** Enemy champions that walk through Dark Wall are marked for death, and all damage dealt to them is increased by 30% for 5 seconds. Ally champions that walk through Dark Wall are marked for life, and all healing effects recieved by them are amplified by 30% for 5 seconds.\n\n**********************\n\n**Champion Selection**\n\"It's impossible to pierce through an impenetrable wall. Do not falter though, for no one will judge you for trying. I surely won't.\"\n\n**Cursor Interactions**\n\"Die, wretch!\"\n\"Try all they like, bringing me down will be suicide.\"\n\"Life and death are both optional and ultimatums. Their decisions will dictate their outcomes.\"\n\"Come at me with everything! Hold nothing back!\"\n\"For the Darkin!\"\n\"Nothing will surpass me!\"\n\"Pride is a fool's moral.\"\n\"Blood is the greatest of rewards. Contribution is even greater.\"\n\n**Joke**\n\"You Summoners are so quick to rage in all-chat about how overpowered an enemy is, but your champion's health and defense percentages are lower than your sense of logic. But that's none of my business.\"\n\n**Taunt**\n\"Stand before me and get crushed like the worm you are!\"\n\n**Dance**\nDragkor tosses his shield in the air and juggles it by striking it with his fists repeatedly.\n\n**Recall Animation**\nDragkor slams his shield on the ground. The shield then explodes, creating a portal that Dragkor walks into. Upon reaching the homepad, the portal reopens and Dragkor walks out of it. The portal collapses and returns into a shield, which Dragkor then snatches out of the ground.\n\n**Death Animation**\nDragkor falls on the ground, losing control of his shield. The shield then topples over and lands on him, crushing his body and creating a pool of blood that can be seen oozing out from the edges of the shield.\n\n**********************\n\nDragkor is a Tank / Support champion that relies on his health to push him through tough battles throughout the game. He uses his abilities to help out nearby allies, while at the same time fueling his own power as well. \n\nThere are a variety of ways Dragkor can be played, but I want to use my way as an example. Start of with Destructive Swing to help poke around brushes in case of the occasional \"season 3 hide in the enemy brush before minions spawn so we can do the amazing Plastic V gank that nobody expects\" situation. This is also good for minor lane harassment and securing those last second kills that your ADC couldn't. Nothing is better than hearing your ADC rage about not getting a kill he wasn't able to secure in the first place. Max Destructive Swing as soon as possible.\n\nSave Blood Alliance for when your ADC is extremely low on health, though this should be logical if you read its ability thoroughly. This is good for helping keep your ADC alive during ganks and other unfortunate situations. But be careful. You must watch your own health as well. Only cast this ability if you're confident in your survival. The one thing that is not needed is for the enemy ADC to earn a double kill for your own lack of awareness. Max Blood Alliance secondly.\n\nTransfusion grants Dragkor the passive of bonus health equal to a percentage of his maximum armor. Try building up into a Thornmail as one of your first primary items. Transfusion is an ability that should either be used as a before-teamfight recovery or an after-teamfight recovery. Rarely should it ever be used during a teamfight unless you max Tranfusion first. Remember that you do not gain any of the heal effects, nor the movement speed boost, and you are immobilized. Use this ability wisely. Max Transfusion thirdly.\n\nDark Wall is a good ability for blocking long range ults, such as Ezreal's or Ashe's ultimates. Position your wall wisely and your fights should turn in your favor. If not for battle, then use Dark Wall as a recovery method for other ally champions. When your allies walk through Dark Wall, immediately cast Transfusion. This way, they recieve the greatest healing benefits. Max Dark Wall as soon as possible. \n\nBlood Alliance and Destructive Swing makes Dragkor synergize with nearly all champions, but for champions such as Volibear, Thresh, and Singed…not so much. \n\nDo not hesitate to tower dive when necessary. Blood Well, alongside the tankiness of Dragkor and Transfusion's passive, will help Dragkor tank tons of tower damage. Besides, if an ADC desides to follow up late gank and misses out on the free kill, Dragkor can come back to life and secure it, being forced to listen to the ADC's bullshit yet once again. \n\nPlaying against Dragkor, know that his abilities make him fragile towards burst damage champions and champions with crowd control abilities. Seperate him from his ally and bring him down as fast as you can. Stay as close to him as possible to help space out the maximum damage output of Destructive Swing. If he casts Blood Alliance on an ally, only use your crowd control effects on the protected ally. This way, you can deal the most amount of damage possible to the protected ally, while at the same time, inflict some serious pain on Dragkor himself. \n\nRemember, seperation is key. As tanky and intimidating Dragkor can be, he only works best when he is around other champions. Use that to your advantage, but be careful. Baits and kites can be easily performed by him. Buy wards to prevent that from happening.\n\nAs of preferred builds, I leave you all on that one. There are plenty of combinations for Dragkor. Make up your own. You'll never truly learn a champion if you don't fool around with one yourself.\n\n**Skin(s)**\n\nDivine Crusader Dragkor\nhttp://m.imgur.com/Z35ZDzK","replies":[{"poster":"Windstricker","date":"2015-05-05T17:21:15.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good champion a little on the op side but other than that I want to see in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreamsGoneMad","date":"2014-11-28T19:41:22.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall, I like this guy.

Very unique design and like everyone else has said could use a bit of tweaking in numbers, but things like that will progess as I had some things to tweak and mere abilities to change altogther.

But there are differences. \n\nI wanted Dragkor to be a Darkin Tank / Support (Just stating for clarification), however I became inspired by Braum at the time to make a champion that only uses shield mechanics.\n\nBoth of their Q-s are alike in relation to crowd control effects (slow), but Dragkor's crowd control effects and damage range in strength depending on the distance of the target. So it's like Braum, Diana, and Nidalee's Q's all combined into one in a sense. \n\nBraum's W allows him to leap in front of an ally unit. Dragkor's W throws his shield at an ally, which protects that ally from a percentage of damage. Instead of the protected ally taking damage, Dragkor does instead, and a percentage of *that* damage is stored into his Blood Well.\n\nBraum's E allows him to completely block the first attack then reduce the damage of other attacks for a short period of time. Dragkor's E immobilizes him, while at the same time, provides a healing zone for allies that remains active as long as Dragkor has blood in his Blood Well, which is quickly depleted over channeling. This also gives allies a boost of movement speed once they leave the healing zone.\n\nBraum's R allows him to deal magic damage and knock up enemies in a path. Dragkor's R allows him to create a wall of pure energy that blocks 100% of all damage targeted toward it. Attackers then recieve a percentage of that damage thrown back at them converted into magic damage. Allies who walk through the wall gain amplified self-healing properties, and enemies who walk through it suffer increased damage from all sources by a percentage. \n\nThe only things that show some correlation between the two are Braum's E and Dragkor's R, plus their Q's. But besides that, nothing much really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2014-11-28T04:12:03.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna edit this comment as soon as I finish reading his kit, but...\nHis passive is hilariously broken (from a numbers standpoint)\n\nEdit : Sounds like a weird, weaker version of Braum.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FusionSuit","date":"2014-11-28T03:34:57.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can imagine the tanky wombo combos with Braum","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2014-11-28T03:27:04.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot better than what I was doing Sith my Darkin Bolt champion.

I would stay within the range of 160/140/120 as a cool down duration. As for the scaling of the attack damage, I'd say something like 48 (+2.3 per level) { 2.3 x 18 + 48}. Most of his kit is magic damage or health based so there's not that much of a need for high AD scaling. And the health regen could be buffed, lower the base health regen to 7.5 with ( + .87 per level) {.87 x 18 + 7.5} that way that he doesn't fall off later in the game.
