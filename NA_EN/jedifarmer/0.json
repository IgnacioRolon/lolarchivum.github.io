Or you have the option you currently selected and became toxic, and got hit with a chat restriction. No one is forcing you to be toxic. and what do you think being toxic is going to do anyway? do you really think being toxic is going to help people win games? All you are doing is making it less likely for your team mates to want to win and your opening yourself up for a punishment. Or do you really lack the self-control to be able to control what buttons you press on your keyboard?\n\nFor me personally, rather or not your actually offending people is besides the point. The point is you should be playing the game with good sportsmanship no matter what situation you have to deal with, and if you don't care about sportsmanship then don't play an eSport that haves a player base and controlling entity that wants the people who play the game to have good sportsmanship.","replies":[{"poster":"Jedifarmer","date":"2018-07-27T18:34:09.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm sorry you're blind to the point i was making.

I never hear about those cases which are just as likely to happen as the cases that cause you to lose LP. and by the Law of large numbers it should even its self out.\n\nSo while it might be true that nothing will change and INTers will never go away because 1 it takes time for riot to be sure, and 2 the sheer amount of players in your ELO. You yourself need to change and become a better player. ultimately you are in the ELO you are in because of your own performance.
