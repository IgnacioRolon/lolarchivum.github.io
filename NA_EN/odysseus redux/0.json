I've been disconnecting from my game for about 30 secs to a minute every few minutes for the past few days, and I'm not sure why. I don't think it's my internet connection  because it does it both at my parent's house and at my apartment. I've tried using the Hextech Repair Tool but whenever I try to tell it to force re-patch it errors out and I have to close it. Reinstalling via the tool doesn't help either. I can submit logs if you know which ones to submit! I'm at a loss for what to do and I want to cry out of frustration, please send help!","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-01T21:31:22.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might still be a connection issue, but it's less to do with a network problem and more to do with routing.
