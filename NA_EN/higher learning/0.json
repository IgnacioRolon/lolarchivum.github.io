This way you need to use both your thumb and the inside of your palm to click both mouse buttons.\nThen I transferred this into playing games like halo where you can switch the inversion.\n\nThe third-party programs not working has nothing to do with League updates. They do not work with my version of Windows 10 period.\n\nI can hold the mouse right-side-up and have no problem doing this at work -- but to truly be precise & accurate (for league) I desperately need the option to invert both X&Y.\n\nAs I have stated above, this really should not be a hard addition to implement -- and I know there are others out there who could also benefit from this (albeit a minority).","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-04-17T01:20:54.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pics or it didn't happen.
