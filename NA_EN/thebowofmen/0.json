Yeah, I can see it as a rotating game mode.

All the modes I play for fun actually. That isn't a valid reason to have it cycle though. Many players, myself included, enjoy Dominion, and would like to play it when **we** would like to play it, not a few times a year. It's a popular mode that players play everyday. Why take that away from us? That'll lead to an uproar Dominion mains are highly likely to quit, resulting in a decreased playerbase which I;m sure Riot doesn't want.\n\nBy your logic, they should cycle ARAM, since it has no ranked queue as well. I'm pretty sure this will lead to an even louder uproar is ARAM is a bit more popular than Dominion.  \n\nP.S.

In that case, it should stay until they deliver on that promise (and then it'll stay anyway).\n\nAs for ARAM, I would love for it to be cycling... maps. Why waste the Bilgewater map that took so much work and detail? Why does Freijord (however you spell it) get all the love?\n\nI'm not sure, though. Is five available game modes (ARAM, SR, TT, Dominion, and whatever Rotation) too much, or can we handle it?","replies":[{"poster":"K端rama","date":"2015-10-06T01:54:54.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They promised us Dominion Ranked since 2011 when Dominion was released, they haven't fulfilled their promise. It isn't to say they wouldn't though but it'll be hella late.\n\nI don't think the majority would want to cycle ARAM. If I'm correct it's tied for the 2nd most popular map / mode with Twisted Treeline.\n\nFive game modes is very possible, we've done it in the past. The current 4 maps (Summoner's Rift (Classic), Twisted Treeline (Classic), Crystal Scar (Dominion) & Howling Abyss (ARAM)) are permanent and they have added \"Featured Game Modes\" (temporary crazy but fun modes) alongside the 4 permanent maps and we handled it well. They've done this over 10 times.\n\nThe Featured Game modes often recycle one of the 4 permanent maps though, resulting in the same map but a different temporary mode.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2015-10-01T23:02:11.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talith PA,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=50Gq5v7e,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-10-01T22:21:41.242+0000)\n>\n> GIVE.
