After 5 minutes of trying to reconnect and updating my graphic cards drivers, I got the \"end of game\" menu and lost my game. (The game is labelled \"LEAVER (REMAKE)\" in the match history.)\n\nI guess it comes from the new patch (7.10), because it was my first game on this patch, and I never got this problem before.\n\nI've got two graphic cards : Intel(R) HD Graphics 530 (integrated with my processor) and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M.\nMy CPU is Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ, 2.6GHz. 64bits, 16GB RAM.\n\nI hope this will help you fix the bug, and please let us know if you do so.\nI'll charge you nothing for this piece of information, but getting back the 19 IP I lost would be cool :)\n\nBye !\n\nPS : Renaming or deleting the Game.cfg file as said in https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/quucoRoO-an-unknown-directx-error-has-occured doesn't solve the problem.\n\nEdit : Since I can't play LoL, I tried installing Heroes of the Storm, and it tells me a message close to the one I got with LoL. The problem must surely come from an update in my graphic card driver... to be continued.\n\nEdit : Solved by downgrading my graphic card driver and re-upgrade it. (At the end, the driver is the same as at the beginning...)","replies":[]}]}]}
