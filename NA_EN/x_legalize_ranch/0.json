So after every kill a siren, similar to a tornado siren, would go off for a little bit. At first I just brushed it off as my sound system acting up but then the gizmos shopkeeper said, &quot;That was just the wind...right?&quot; Which is something he&#039;s never said before...\r\nThen I remembered what the Iceborn ghost said, &quot;When you hear the alarm, it means the watchers have returned.&quot;\r\nI googled this after the game and saw nothing on it so I decided to make this post. Most likely rito has been deleting all the posts inquiring about it because they are working with the watchers and want ignorance among the summoners. Quickly then, tell me, have the watchers returned?","replies":[{"poster":"The Y2J Problem","date":"2015-11-17T06:43:18.671+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one shopkeeper does say \"That howling noise, is just the wind... isn't it?\" - Perhaps you heard a fragment of him saying that?\n\nPlus, I think there's something wrong with Corki's package. That came out wrong. So did that.\n\nBut for real though, I think Corki's siren sound effect is just going nuts due to a bug","replies":[{"poster":"Betoldia Prime","date":"2015-11-17T09:29:13.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be completely true... unless corkis package appears when hes not in game.... its happened 3 times already, and its anoying, the first time it happeneed, there was a corki, so i shrugged it off. But the next 2 times, there was no corki in sight... so unless the bug is so strong it transends games, it must be something new is comiiing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Battalion","date":"2015-11-17T08:42:13.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second this, I heard it near continuously on Summoner's Rift with a game with Corki on my team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yrzen","date":"2015-11-17T08:53:54.309+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2301}}\nThe watchers see everything.\n{{item:2301}} \nThere is no escape.\n{{item:2301}}\nhttps://youtu.be/gG1U5yrRQeQ","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-11-17T09:35:20.625+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2303}} {{item:2301}} {{item:2302}}\n3 new sight items\nIlluminati confirmed\nWatchers = Illuminati\n{{item:2045}} {{item:3078}} {{item:2049}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-17T09:21:53.788+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this your game as Master Yi in ARAM?
