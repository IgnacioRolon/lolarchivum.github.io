I'm sure you are aware of the four punishment tiers:\n\n1. 10 game chat restriction\n2. 25 game chat restriction\n3. 14 day temporary suspension\n4. permanent suspension\n\nWhen a person is reported, the report flags the game for review by the Instant Feedback System, which then reviews the logs to see if anything in them substantiates the report.  If it doesn't, the report is marked as a \"false report\" and is pretty much tossed out.  If it does, then it is added to the player's account.  At the lowest tier, it can take quite a few reports before a player is deemed eligible for a punishment.  \n\nBut what you may not be aware of is that when you are at the third tier, it can take very little to earn a permanent suspension.  By that point, Riot has already given the player multiple warnings (usually) and they are not necessarily as lenient any longer.  Something else you may not know, is that at any punishment point, the system does not ask \"Do these logs deserve a chat restriction?\" or \"Do these logs deserve a temporary suspension?\" or even \"Do these logs deserve a permanent suspension?\"  The system instead asks \"Do these logs deserve a punishment?\"  If the answer is yes, and the player's account has had enough reports to earn a punishment, they are given the next punishment tier.  Whatever the next tier might be.  It doesn't matter how bad the logs are.  Even if what is in the logs is something so minor that most people would read it and think \"hmmm... chat restriction,\" if that player has already had two chat restrictions and a recent temporary suspension, and still continues to be toxic without showing any signs of reforming, then they will be permanently suspended for it.  The main exception to this is in the case of hate speech/death threats, which can escalate an account immediately to a permanent suspension, where the system will review those logs and judge whether they are worthy of an immediate ban.  \n\nAll that being said, in your title, you say this is what got you banned.  But you did not say what punishments you had prior to your ban, or which ban you received.  That would give a bit more context to the situation.  If you had been previously given a recent temporary suspension, then I hate to say it, but I would not be surprised that these logs got you permabanned.  If you were previously given a 25 game chat restriction, it would not surprise me if these logs earned you a temporary suspension.  There is a considerable amount of negativity in them; both in terms of harassing your teammates and simply generalized giving up.  \n\nAnd while it was recently posted that Riot does not equate calling for reports to hate speech, [clarification by Riot Tantram](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/1NGnychF-plz-contact-me-riot?comment=0001000000000000000000000000) confirmed that calling for reports can still be a form of harassment.  Specifically, \"...calling someone a feeder for having a poor game, telling people to report them for int'ing, etc .. is all going to be considered negative.\"  \n\n> TheGoodKidChac: just ff\n> TheGoodKidChac: report brand\n> TheGoodKidChac: move on\n> TheGoodKidChac: we lost\n> TheGoodKidChac: just mute him\n> TheGoodKidChac: ff\n> TheGoodKidChac: report\n> TheGoodKidChac: move on\n> TheGoodKidChac: its fine\n> TheGoodKidChac: stop wasting time\n> TheGoodKidChac: brands top now lmao\n> TheGoodKidChac: gotta love int\n> TheGoodKidChac: report brand. gg.\n\nThis sort of passage is probably a very good example of the difference between asking for players to report player X once, and crossing the line into harassing player X by calling for reports.  You didn't just ask for reports against Brand once.  You did it 3 times within a short span and called him an intentional feeder.  This sort of thing is something you might want to avoid in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGoodKidChac","date":"2017-04-02T00:02:11.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"Im tilted at how awful Riot's system is and how awesome \"player behavior\" is going.","replies":[]}]}
