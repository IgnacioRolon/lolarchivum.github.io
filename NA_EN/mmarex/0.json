While i just finished my 14 day suspesion and remained as calm as possible , since i didnt get reported from my last 7+ games the one game now i gave my lane to another player who really asked for it , he and his \"premade\" support ask for the swap and while i agree with a warning that iam not good on jungling they go with it and end up flaming eachother (and me in the end) . I also wrote some key words that the bot gets and bans people such as r%%%%% , us%%%%% , dogshit but never ever used that against a player of this match (will be shown down bellow). With the enemy team aggreeing with me since they met them 2 before about their behavior and act in the match (and i also got ones \"twitch\" that he posted for further proof . \n(Chat Bellow)\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nMMaReX: nop\nMMaReX: hm\nMMaReX: leeets see\nMMaReX: hold up\nMMaReX: ah\nMMaReX: fuck it why tf not\nMMaReX: xD\nIn-Game\nMMaReX: lets get a good leash\nMMaReX: as less damage as possible\nMMaReX: oh you got to be kidding me\nMMaReX: its ok kayle i dont mind you for me death\nMMaReX: well i played absolutely dogshit this time\nMMaReX: yikes\nMMaReX: wait\nMMaReX: you still lvl 5?\nMMaReX: dunno\nMMaReX: i am useless\nMMaReX: well i am not giving up lane again\nMMaReX: wasting my time\nMMaReX: are you mentally ill xD?\nMMaReX: i gave mid to zed who beged for it\nMMaReX: same as taric who asked for it\nMMaReX: ok this adc is trolling\nMMaReX: you beged for mid zed\nMMaReX: dont talk\nMMaReX: you 2 beged for a swap lane\nMMaReX: lol\nMMaReX: lovely zed\nMMaReX: beg more\nMMaReX: wait\nMMaReX: i gave you mid\nMMaReX: and you flame me\nMMaReX: while i said i am not good a jungle?\nMMaReX: you spamm fo no reason\nMMaReX: and you still yet to carry ?\nMMaReX: while you are talking?\nMMaReX: l2p?\nMMaReX: are you mentally ill?\nMMaReX: love how i swap lane cuz zed and taric begged for it\nMMaReX: said i am trash jung but k\nMMaReX: and they flame me\nMMaReX: damn the logic\nMMaReX: idc rek\nMMaReX: i swaped for that guy to have fun\nMMaReX: i swaped for that guy to have fun\nMMaReX: and he only talks\nMMaReX: eh\nMMaReX: been dealing with thatl ong time\nMMaReX: keep spamming me\nMMaReX: gg ez\nMMaReX: report ashe and taric\nMMaReX: rest were fine\nMMaReX: cant expect from zed to carry since the champ is trash\nMMaReX: /all\nMMaReX: lol you cant\nMMaReX: especially against that fed\nMMaReX: zed you cant carry mate your champ is way too weak . dont bother fighting tbh\nMMaReX: you need 4-5 items to be able to deal good damage to them\nMMaReX: lol gj neeko\nMMaReX: oof\nMMaReX: well note to shelf\nMMaReX: never give lane to someone else\nMMaReX: cuz ill feed like a r%%%%% for no reason\n%%%%%dont ask much but at least a second chance on this one , i tried to be as calm and friendly as possible through the last matches but for this one i couldnt held my temper and once my account is found again for unsportsmanlike behavior i wouldnt mind being banned because at least i deserved that , but for this time i dont bellieve so . I would be very glad if i would get any help with this one because this is the first account that i actually started on investing some money at least and losing money for no reason really hurts and especially when not living in a wealthy country .. \nBest regards and hope for the best !\n\n\nEdit ( The part about the money is not for empathy but its actuall truth , losing money in this unfair way really hurts and even makes me uncomfortable to invest on a new skin or a champ :/ )","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-21T06:46:06.675+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Second chance?

Thats exactly what i tried to do after the 14 day because i was excited to play back on this specific account and to get it terminated for something as \"stupid\" i would say as this is really annoying and especially when i bot (as i feel) actually handles the punishements . Its one to punish a person when for long term and many games in a row has been rude and offencive towards others (reason i got 14 day ban) and another to ban someone who kindly enough gives his lane to someone else and ends up being flamed and frawned upon while you try your best to help on a role you are not good at \"just to make someone else happy\" . This is the reason i dont bellieve this was a fair ban such as the old ones . and it really hurts as i said losing money to something like this . see me on constant spamming and typing offencive words or being rude to players or in any way shape or form flame them or grief them then yea terminate the account as soon as the match has ended but the current situation feels really bad at least.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-03-21T08:46:02.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ability to play the game doesn't give you the right to be a jerk.","replies":[{"poster":"MMaReX","date":"2019-03-21T10:54:52.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that is correct but explain to me is it \"fair\" when you allow someone else to take your place so he can be \"usefull\" or in better words have fun and be more productive for the team to start insulting you for no reason and at the same time trying to be as respectfull as possible to people who blantaly dont care for waht you do or not do and only care about your mistakes . If it was for me to flame the 2 dudes fro mstart to end id be mad for the ban but at the same time accept that i screwd it up hard and need to learn from that .

I was chat restricted for (kind of) the same situation as you. People were flaming me, i tell them what they are doing wrong (calling them inters while they were actually inting and still blaming me for shit). \nSadly, even if you are as polite as possible, you can't say ANYTHING mildly negative in the chat or riot will ban you. Even if it's a fact that's happening in the game (i.e. Someone's literally inting - you aren't allowed to call them inters) Even if you're telling your teammates what they could've done better (i.e. by saying:\" stop inting and just play\" - riot can mark it as \"negative\"...)\n\nSad kindergarten rules indeed.** I learned that you just HAVE to ignore them.
