His ult does not need to keep going. It should last 7 seconds, or whatever, not last forever until the whole other team is aced.\n\nSo until you do that, he's gonna remain  cancer, and the CD nerf doesn't hit him much, he still has a low CD on his ult, so essentially it's going to be up anyways for him although it was a cute try, but a lazy one.\n\n\nAt this point, I'll settle for any nerfs, so at least we got something, now can we get a meaningful Zed gut and destroy that monster like Q damage he has?\n\n\nAlso tune Nasus's slow to a less extent that you can still get away cause  when he abuses iceborn and spirit visage, it then becomes a perma slow cause he will point and click again on you to keep you slowed and the slow itself is like a  90% slow which is way too much for a perma slow.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2016-04-19T22:28:07.364+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your proposed change would indeed gut the champion.

Yes it's the items, just like with Yi, Ekko, EZ, and anyone else, but you can always tune his slow since this is his main items which give him enough CDR to keep you perma slowed.\n\nI also later suggested Zilean's ult needs a longer CD. It's too short for what it actually is.\n\nAnyhow as for Yi, he's always going to be a problem. Devourer getting removed is not going to phase him. He will now basically have a new enchantment which is a twin sibling of Blade Of The Ruined Kind (BORK) which has always been one of his main items, especially if he was laning, it's pretty much the first or second item he gets, and now he's going to have it as an jungle enchantment. That's extremely going to be annoying, also when Kindred abuses it, but going back to Yi, the only positive change from the nerfs which is awesome is they took the 10 second duration and made it a 7 second duration (if he doesn't get a kill or an assist that is). The reason this is so good is now he can't just ult in a bush and come flying through the river like superman and still have his ult up. He's now going to have to pop his ult when he is more near you where he can be seen. If he now pops it in the river,  the ult can pretty much wear off by a second after he reaches you which is pretty good.\n\nOther than that, he's still going to be strong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlwaysByMySide","date":"2016-04-19T22:29:23.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Best EV3R NA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cbgs9QE9,comment-id=00000003,timestamp=2016-04-19T22:23:08.049+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, the nerfs are good, and all, but you need to really hit him and just take away the duration for the kills and assists he gets when he has his ult up.
