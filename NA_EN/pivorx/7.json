The difference is, now you can do it with more friends and this is simply more effective.\nb) Oh you are one of those guys... lets see... oh i know... \nIt wasn't called \"eloboosting\" it was called \"legal eloboosting\". That's totally different get your facts straight... is what I would say if I would be an ingnorant asshole. But let me say it this way instead: I'm pretty sure you and everyone else here, knows the meaning. What's the point in distacting whith useless word correction even if you were rigth?\n\nIn my opinion this whole problem would be obsolete in a few weeks if we had two different mmr. If you play with friends you get matched with your \"teamranked\"-mmr(2-5 player) and if you play solo you get matched with your \"solo\"-mmr, simple as that.  Roit don't even need to reset mmr or something because it would balance over time. \n\nIf you get mixed with premades it counts for \"team\"-mmr. The only thing is there need to be a guaranteed % of solo only games. Another positive side effect is you actually know what kind of game you are playing. Personally it is very important to me to know if there are premades or not.\n\nIn addition there could be and overall \"skill\"-mmr calculated from both team and normal ranked depending on games played in each category.
