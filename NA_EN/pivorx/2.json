He is getting nerfed so that he now has even _less answers to melee champions_ (and, by the way, his kit's set up so he's supposed to be bullying, **if you forgot**) and less ways of ensuring his Decrepify damage hits for it's full duration, which is actually a lot of his early-game damage. Oh, and we're not even getting into his **Mana Costs...** \n\nIf you want to look at an ability to nerf, Torment still has **Damage Amplification** even though you made drastic changes to anyone with a DFG, but Swain has one of those built into a basic ability that's also a damage over time effect that has ludicrous synergy with Deathfire Touch.\n\nI love Swain as a character. I have roleplayed him for a year and a half now. I love him, but his inability to offer anything someone else can't do better ultimately frustrates me, coupled with the fact he has not gotten a skin almost as long as {{champion:85}} and **at least Kennen has a lot of skins to choose from.** Historically his last buff, not universal buffs like when you nerfed armor or the recent mana increases, **buffs focused on him to do anything positive,** was back in October, **2013.** He has since been ignored a great deal, between Rioters dancing around Dragonmaster Swain and saying he's always in an 'Okay' position. Only recently were we told he's going to be targeted for some changes, and those are being thrown on the back burner right now and **we have no date or even general idea when they are coming.**\n\nAt least tell us the Rework is coming after Taric, because Gods Know his kit may have been interesting back in '09, but it doesn't hold a candle to any mage today.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abahlam","date":"2015-11-24T14:39:30.050+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a main Swain, so i may be not impartial. \n\nFirst Swain isn't strong at all against long range push/poke/farm ap champ (azir, lux, Viktor ...who were overly present last season) but yeah these guys just got kinda nerfed so Swain is coming back recently on the rift, thanks to ROA buff too. \nYou are cutting one of his strength and you listed his others (sustained damage, drain mage-\"tank\", with CC), but this guy has serious drawback too :\n- He has no spell/tool to help him last it like a lot of champs now have (DOT aren't the best for that). Moreover he has one of the lowest ad and one of the weirdest AA animation.\n- He has no pushing power at all, unless u empty your mana pool on one single creep wave (at least early). Thus his ability to roam is bad. It also mean a weaker wave clear later to defend against siege.\n- He has no mobility. DOTs can be good but it's countered by heal/shield/regen etc.. contrary to burst (but his DOTs damages aren't stronger to compensate) \n- This guy need to buy too much stats. If you want to use Swain full potential (his sustain and damages from R at a low range) you need :\n{{summoner:32}} Tankiness (your kit don't give you any) so HP to avoid being burst (otherwise sustain is useless) and Armor/MR to enhance sustain efficiency. This make Swain BAD if behind cause he won't be able to use his play style.\n{{summoner:32}} Mana pool and/or regen (passive not enough once you have ult)\n{{summoner:32}} Damages, cuz yeah your an ap carry\nSo HP/Armor/Mr/Mana/AP/Mpen while for instance, current Graves just need damages while fighting at same range as Swain. His E giving him up to 120 Arm/Mr for an adc, and bloodlust mastery giving him sustain.\n\nI don't wanna say that this nerf is not justified or that Swain is overly weak now but he has several drawbacks for a midlaner. He has a lot of strengths and lot of people don't know how to deal with him or underestimate the stacked DOTs damages (RIP E+ignite nerf though) but this is compensated by all these things I listed above. I DO HOPE this nerf won't come without any compensation because his W snare is his only way to engage with his lack of mobility (especially against long range ap who already can outpush him without much counter play), and enemies are still able to hit him while he engages that way. Moreover Deathfire touch might be nerfed too.\n\nHope these arguments will be taken into account.

It is too much to consider; He is doing his job reasonably well, thriving in an environment of massive overpowered ADC.

Yes/No\n\n\nRemember that Yasuo, Lee, Thresh, Alistar and Riven were very popular in worlds and have consistently outperformed their peers (Ex: Urgot, Skarner, Galio, Sona, Warwick, etc.).

You think Rammus is underpowered outside of his niche. That is literally what Rammus is. He is such a Niche, an Anti-Auto Attacker champ, that he provides little else of use other than a single target cc, and if you want that, you're better off picking Sion, Naut, or other Cc tanks. \n\nWhat you're asking, is to buff every non-niche part of him, to move him from his Niche. To make him viable against non-auto attackers teams, would require a full blown rework. All of Rammus is to F**k over auto attackers. That's his niche. To make him Viable outside his NIche, would make his Auto Attacker Niche, even MORE powerful.\n\nThe solution to things isn't just to \"buff\" underplayed champs.
