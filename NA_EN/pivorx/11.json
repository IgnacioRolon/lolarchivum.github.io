Examples like Lee, reksai, nidalee, elise, rengar come to mind. Out of the junglers listed by OP, only kindred scales positively with elo (that I know off the top of my head). \n\nThis means that it would likely be irresponsible to buff (as the only action) certain champions into competitive (Eg. Amumu, Sej),  because for them to be at a power level that succeeds in competitive, their normal play power will be over 9000. Imagine if Amumu goes from 56% winrate at Silver to 48% in Challenger and we say a champion  needs 52% (some arbitrary number) in challenger to be playable, then amumu is probably at high 50's% in normal play by the time he's viable in competitive. \n\nContrast this to Lee who is 44% in silver, but 52% in challenger. Lee is now playable in competitive without breaking normal play. \n\nThese numbers are not accurate, (but their relationships are roughly correct) and not the only factor that determines competitive viability, but it is definitely an important factor (another important factor is early-mid game priority and reliability).  \n\nAs such, accessible power and competitive viability are usually (but not always) at odds with one another. So the question becomes: which do we value more? Competitive diversity or accessible champions? Or are they equal? Can we accomplish both at once?  If you're Lee sin, the answer is probably yes. If you're garen, the answer is probably no. \n\nMalphite and xin Zhao are amongst the most popular champions in the game. Would they still be popular if they weren't as accessible? Or would we ruin an easy and fun champion for a lot of players and still not see them in competitive? Do we want 133 ryze, reksai and azir's with notoriously low winrates (and low accessible power for the majority of players)? Champions like Ryze add diversity to the competitive game, but are also functionally useless for a lot of players. \n\nDesign is a compromise and these are tough questions with no clear answer. But the obvious one is that we shouldn't just buff these champions with the explicit goal of getting them into competitive, because it is not guaranteed of working and it would likely backfire. (Eg. Sejuani threads from a year ago - \"why is she the tankiest champion while doing the most damage and having the most cc?\")\n\nIf we want these guys in competitive, they probably require kit level changes to  get there without breaking the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2016-12-22T17:08:40.604+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":7,"body":"Okay but are you ever going to address the issue that Lee Sin does nothing but destroy diversity in the jungle?\nWhen he is strong, the Jungle roster just becomes smaller, as people are forced to pick champions that can keep up with his insane gank, roam and clear potential. \n\nNot too mention being able to burst down squishies using just 2 abilities due to his insane base stats. \nThis was less clear in the past, as we had plenty of other carry jungler we could choose from that could keep up with Lee Sin's insanely overloaded kit (That's a fact, not an opinion), but now that Kindred, Elise, Nidalee, Rengar, Kha'zix, Rek'sai and somewhat even Graves have all been nerfed and changed  to a substantial degree, Lee Sin is now back to dominating the jungle, and weeding out a lot of other previously viable picks.\n\nProbably safe to know you won't answer this due to the legitimacy of it and your current track record over the past few posts of ignoring questions and answering other questions, with a question.\n\nRiot really needs to look into hiring more people who can interact with the community intelligently and directly.

Like you said, if everyone is weak in normal and strong in competitive, then no one is an outlier, but the game mastery curve is holistically steeper. \n\nSo yes, we could have all champions with an azir like profile and the game would work just fine, but given how the game is right now, that world is a long way away,but it works. (Eg. I can play street fighter as a beginner, access 5% of Chun li's power and still have fun. A pro will access 100% and it will be balanced at both mine and pros level, because everyone at my level is also accessing 5% power). \n\nIt would require a lot of injection of hard to access power to get GAREN, voli, xin, etc. In competitive. (street fighter model - increase skill ceiling of individual champs). \n\nAlternatively, in the Dota model, skill ceiling is quite low for most individual Champs, but the game itself is insanely hard. In this model, being good at Dota is less about being good at skeleton King (he is literally sions old q and three passive at 58% winrate) and sven and more about being good at the base game. (there are of course some outliers like meepo and wisp at 37% winrate). \n\nThe other strategy we've been employing is making Champion power more accessible (Eg. Removing resets from nidalee,making azir e more forgiving to chain on a q). (Dota model - reduce skill ceiling of individual Champs, high ceiling of base game). \n\nAll of these adjustments are if we want more diversity in competitive play without breaking normal play and I think in an ideal world, they aren't mutually exclusive but in our current environment, they are. We can take steps towards either model though and they are both equally valid and sustainable.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-12-22T23:38:34.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> We can take steps towards either model though and they are both equally valid and sustainable.\n\nDo you really think both models are equally sustainable? In the case where there is a steep  mastery curve for every champion then systematic changes to the game can warp the accessibility of that mastery curve, causing re-balancing work for many champions. The reverse is not true though, with changes on one champion not requiring systematic game changes (usually). This can be seen with the addition of keystones as an example of systematic game changes where on release all champions got some easier access to power but trynd and yasuo got the power more easily than other champions thanks to the first iteration of warlords. \n\nI'm not meaning that one way or the other is the right way to go, just curious about your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2016-12-23T00:07:16.580+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"The models I was talking about were 1.

Your whole design process has changed from 4 abilities and a nice thematic to 4 abilities + 4 secondary abilities + what the hell is happening thematic. You're over designing and loading kits in the present that are hurting your past developments.
