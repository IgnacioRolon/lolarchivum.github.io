Two main problems are that attack sound is not loud and &quot;accurate enough&quot; so its difficult to tell when the attack actually hits so you can cancel its animation. Second issue is that double strike animation looks more like a single attack so it makes hard to track double strike stacks without actually looking at buff bar. \r\n\r\nPlease reconsider making those changes until skin is &quot;fresh&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-11T19:30:07.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey PiVoRx,\n\nThere is actually a bug with Double Strike where the second hit isn't making a sound. This should be fixed next patch. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2015-09-11T20:14:31.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But double strike looks like a single attack anyway, is this intended? \nAnd how about basic attack sounds?
