Tahm is by far not the worst support(I reserve that for Katerina/Kassidin supports)\n2. In the hands of a competent player he WILL save you, even after all hope is lost.

Most of them, especially in lower ranks, are prone to being total ass-clowns. Reporting them for assisting the opposing team and intentional feeding is still a thing too (as well as language and attitude or whatever they list it under.). You may have been the one dieing, but he was the one causing the deaths in the first place. \n\nSometimes, it's worth it to just dodge a game. That one I would have just let the timer run out, made a sandwich, and came back when the restriction was up.","replies":[]}]}
