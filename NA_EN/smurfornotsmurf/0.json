You even referred to your state of mind (\"I got tiked off\").\n\nI'm skeptical of your convenient claim that someone else was on your account when you got banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SmurfOrNotSmurf","date":"2019-10-11T21:26:14.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I was not account sharing dude my league was left on and i left and he started playing on it i know its wrong even if it wasnt me im just asking for some remorce","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-10-11T21:28:50.122+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SmurfOrNotSmurf,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=57YktMqm,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-10-11T21:26:14.513+0000)\n>\n> I was not account sharing dude my league was left on and i left and he started playing on it i know its wrong even if it wasnt me im just asking for some remorce\n\nYour account safety is your responsibility\nYou left it open and your brother played on it\nThat can still be considered account sharing\nOnly you are allowed to play on your account\n\nUnlucky you\nBut you most likely won't be unbanned","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-11T21:30:32.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SmurfOrNotSmurf,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=57YktMqm,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-10-11T21:26:14.513+0000)\n>\n> I was not account sharing dude my league was left on and i left and he started playing on it i know its wrong even if it wasnt me im just asking for some remorce\n\nRiot has no way of knowing whether you did it on purpose.

They do take into account your behavioral history on other accounts, evidence suggests. So since youre continuing to break the rules after previous permabans, they're gonna continue to permaban you until you stop breaking their rules. Thats at least the impression I get after reading several previous threads similar to yours. \n\nOh, someone else was using your account. You may get escalated to a permaban for sharing accounts. I know you didnt intentionally \"share\" it, but thats just the term they use when someone else uses your account. You are responsible for that, unfortunately.
