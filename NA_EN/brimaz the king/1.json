Someone inform me on what I&#039;m missing please.

Prior to 5.15 however that check was occurring at pretty long ranges, resulting in situations where players were deliberately targeting something else, with the intent of leaving the barrel up, but were still seeing their shots redirected.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-08-13T06:40:01.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that's why I can hit barrels among minions. Cool stuff. I hope the decreased detection radius is still easy to use; that sort of thing is pretty critical to keeping GP pleasant to use.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-13T06:52:55.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're pretty sure it should still work when you actually want it. Do let us know though if that's not the case, possible we've overshot of course.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Brimaz The King","date":"2015-08-12T21:18:16.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does it mean the Keg radius got smaller for q to hit?","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-08-12T20:19:23.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure, but it's possible they were referring to the radius around the barrel you could click to target it?  Or maybe the radius to target the barrel if it was overlapping with other hitboxes (like enemy champions or minions).","replies":[]}]}
