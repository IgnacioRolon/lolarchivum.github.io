I started this one match today where I was planning to play my OTP champ Karma in the Top lane. (Autofill is a bitch)\nEverything was fine, that is until the enemy team BANNED Karma.\nOkay, I don't even know  how can people enjoy their days by ruining other people's live.\n\nI was here all ready to play the game, and the enemy team had audacity to ban my all time OTP, and now I cannot play the game at all.\nI really don't understand how can people even ban other people's champion in 2k19 and think it is okay at all.\nI was really hurt by this and felt like crying at the moment but then I realized I'm an independent strong woman who needs no man, so I cried for only 2mins max.\n\nThis unsportsmanlike and discriminative behavior needs to STOP!\nRIOT need to take immediate action to stop people from banning champions during banning phase.\nI recon that only suitable punishment for such an act is Permanent Ban (and maybe a lawsuit depending on how attractive the female victim is).\n\nI've already reported all 5 opponents after the match ended (because I didn't knew which one among them banned my beloved Karma).\nI've also submitted a ticket to RIOT support to ensure that my report don't go unnoticed and these filthy sexists gets what they deserve.\n\nP.S. I'm also accepting invitation to Worlds as a professional team player. If anybody is interested, feel free to message me.\n(And please follow me on twitch:- \"xCutieBabyGirl\")\n\nThank you.\n\n(This thread is satire)","replies":[{"poster":"FireThornzZ","date":"2019-02-23T10:29:47.927+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":">and maybe a lawsuit depending on how attractive the female victim is\n\nI died.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2019-02-23T12:50:10.064+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before I saw that this post was in M&amp;G:\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/7cn3.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrismalDawn","date":"2019-02-23T09:15:16.348+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":">(This thread is satire)\n\nAlmost had me lmao but I realized 4th paragraph in\n\nAlso...how come no one is talking about this\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2pC52I-vwE","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-02-23T11:29:19.697+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PrismalDawn,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=E3YpP7U7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-23T09:15:16.348+0000)\n>\n> Almost had me lmao but I realized 4th paragraph in\n> \n> Also...how come no one is talking about this\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2pC52I-vwE\n\nWas... was one of the names on VS TRIGGERED in all caps?\n\nWhy did she pick that, if not to provoke people?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sobx","date":"2019-02-23T17:28:15.454+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PrismalDawn,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=E3YpP7U7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-23T09:15:16.348+0000)\n>\n> Almost had me lmao but I realized 4th paragraph in\n> \n> Also...how come no one is talking about this\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2pC52I-vwE\n\nI think that was the team that got punished for 'intentionally stretching out the game' and there's not much to talk about here because it's a valid reason as opposed to that \"you didn't ban champions we wanted you to\" bullshit.\nThat said, I watched the beginning of the game and just imagine getting stomped by jayce top (with graves in the jungle, but he didn't have to help from what it seemed   so w/e) and as a response... mao rushed merc treads {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nI think Vaevictis should be punished for BMing/meming themselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2019-02-24T08:17:40.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My automatic reaction is to feel bad for the girls, but then I remember they're probably getting paid decently well just to be there.
