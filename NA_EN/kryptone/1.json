(For the fact that most people assume everybody is toxic af).\nAnd mostly the communication is important to know where enemy jungler is so that you can know when to and when not to go all in against your enemy laner.\nNow, while I do accept the fact that we can always type in chat like &quot;Lee top&quot;, &quot;Jungler at bot&quot; etc etc and use &quot;Danger&quot; ping, let&#039;s just accept the fact that it&#039;s way too dangerous to type something like that in the chat while laning.\n\nAlso as of now, people can only use &quot;Danger&quot; ping when spotting an enemy jungler by a ward etc.\nBut problem is, in SoloQ most people ignore the &quot;Danger&quot; ping unless it is used near them, since everybody have this habit of spamming Danger asking your ally to fall back when in a bad position.\nSo, unless the Danger ping is not used sight of the person, he will not care to look if that ping shows where enemy jungler is, or if that ping ask an ally to fall back.\n---\nSo How about we could add these two pings.\nSpecially the &quot;Jungler Spotted&quot; ping will help A LOT in SoloQ since whenever it is used, due to its unique sound, everybody will take a look at the minimap when used.\nThis way whole team can properly exchange the information about enemy jungler&#039;s location without taking risks like typing it in chat everytime.\n---\nMeanwhile, the &quot;Warded&quot; ping will also make it easier for Junglers to know if it is safe to gank or not.\nBecause, normally we get late to type in chat that the bush is warded and by the time we make it, the jungler is already in vision to enemy&#039;s ward.\nThus giving away his location to entire team.\nThis could be prevented if people could just ping warded in a fraction of second and therefore keep the ally jungler out of enemy&#039;s vision.\n---\nI hope we could have this feature implemented since I believe this will help a lot in having better communication and making better plays as a team.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SLWCom2.png","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-01-17T14:50:34.734+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think something like \"Enemy in Area\" would be better than to specify the Jungler. \n\nIf the mid laner or support is roaming and you were to ping \"Jungler spotted\", but the jungler is visible on the other side of the map, the message may not be received well. \n\nI definitely agree with the \"Warded\" ping though.","replies":[{"poster":"Kryptone","date":"2017-01-17T15:00:47.946+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mentioned a Ping specifically for jungler because people can already use Missing + Warning ping to tell exactly which enemy laner is approaching towards you.\nOn the other hand, a ping which is exclusively used for Jungler will make all people look at minimap and can avoid confusion a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"LordSirChipmunk","date":"2017-01-17T23:43:59.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you go to the shadow realm and experience blind pick, having a jungler is like a 90% chance, so just replace it with \"dude spotted\" for the other 10% of the time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2017-01-17T22:54:17.758+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The enemy in area ping sounds really good actually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2017-01-17T17:14:08.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ping 'enemy missing' or 'warning' where I suspect them to be to convey that that an enemy is nearby.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Le Tongue","date":"2017-01-17T15:39:39.517+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"Warded\" ping is something I'd use a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-01-17T17:47:19.910+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"We'd also need WTF ping so that Missing ping is not being abused.

Why add more niggles when you can simply ping alert for danger, and ping assist for clearly come assist me.\n\nOn the topic of wards, this  is however something I want to add that is forever forgotten and neglected.  Warding is everyone's responsibility, and taking advantage of vision is everyone's responsibility not just the support players.  \n\nAlways place red control wards on the Buffs, it should be mids responsibility to buy and place a red on blue, as that is what she is most interested in, ADC can buy and place on RED, Jungle will place one deep so he has vision.  Top controls top river with wards.  People almost always forget to use trinkets and if you do use trinks that is great but do not be  too cheap to buy a red and place it in small river bush deep near enemy jungles buffs for the team advantage.  \n\nPlace deep wards when able to help your team, not just selfish wards that only serve you and then pay them no mind and get ganked for not having awareness.  If you have a ward down and still get ganked, then your just not paying attention.  Bot, Support controls Dragon, Jungle and Top control Herald and Baron.\n\nWarding is not just supports role, but for all those bad supports a reminder if you want to win games, YOU DO NEED VISION - BUY Sighstone and continue to sweep and buy and place a red if your sweeper is down and you suspect a ward in the area so that you control vision of the map.\n\nI have played support for nearly 4 years among other roles but mainly I like to support and I am pretty good at it and can shut down most ganks while I monitor the map and fight enemy laners, and alert my team of MIA and danger in any other lane all while I am supporting my adc or roaming to help another lane or clear enemy wards.  This is how supports are meant to carry, and to the adc's with high egos and soft hearts.... if your support gets a kill that was getting away anyhow but was secured by support, don't cry and bitch and pull fit.  \n\nBe happy for the assists that you would have not even gotten a kill and now you can farm while enemy adc is dead.  Reflect and realize most supports have mechanics to adc, mid or jg, or top and most have way better awareness that trump 50% of the players out there, they peel for you, they bring the enemy adc and enemy supports health low enough for you to kill,  and if they are good they monitor the map to keep everyone ahead, so just relax and enjoy the free gold and put on big boy pants.\n\nAnd of course last but not least we must always remember...\n\nIf you get ganked blame support for no ward, if your losing lane blame jungle for not ganking even though he would probably die because you feed.","replies":[{"poster":"CinnaBon Kittenz","date":"2017-01-18T17:10:54.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I def agree with this, and now with my Relic Shield Procing I even catch CS for them that they miss.
