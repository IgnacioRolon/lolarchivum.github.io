I shot call get decent cs most games, I win lane and if I don&#039;t win lane I almost always come back into the game some how. Is it just extremely hard to carry from adc role? I know I can carry myself out from any other role except support as I have done it before in preeason and this season but I can&#039;t seem to manage it as an adc.","replies":[]}
