But to spice things up rito decided to fix the surrender vote window - so you cannot even move it off screen now, and then there's one of these guys that surrenders every few minutes and they always do in the middle of a fight when I need to focus actually, and there is one of these guys that never votes so you get to see that garbage till the voting expires (and if it's not annoying enough it will start blinking in the end even when you have already voted and there are no buttons... logical, of course).\r\n\r\nCan you finally add an option to permanently disable that crap please so that players never see it again and can focus on the game instead?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-04T23:16:00.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When two people leave due to being 3-29 in 15 minutes but you still can't get a surrender vote through, that's super annoying, too.","replies":[{"poster":"HangingCat","date":"2019-06-05T00:10:53.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not talking about the voting system.... just the UI, the annoying window","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"adceazyas123","date":"2019-06-05T00:30:21.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no idea, maybe the developers are interns.","replies":[]}]}
