I checked my account this morning and there is a win missing from my series. I'm not sure if it's due to the rank maintenance that occurred but instead of 2 wins I only have one, and there is just a blank spot between the X and the green check mark. Not sure if it's just a bug and the win didn't go through","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-18T20:31:31.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that this sounded extremely weird, I went ahead and took a look into your account.  From our records, it looks like you loss your first game, but then won your next 2.  This means you should have a current 2-1 record in your series.  If you win one additional game, you should get your promotion into Gold!!! :D\n\nAt the end of the day, this simply looks like a client visual error rather than your win actually going missing.  Give me a heads up if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
