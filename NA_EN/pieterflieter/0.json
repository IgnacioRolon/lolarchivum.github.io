Personnaly I think it would be better if it starts with one week then two weeks then 1 month and then for the whole season or something. I don't think perma bans are a good punishement to anyone unless they hack or use scripts. If you only do things wrong in chat (like flaming) you should get chat bans and not a ban where you can't play on your account. If someone wants to add something or just say I'm wrong, feel free to write it in the comments but stay nice though.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
