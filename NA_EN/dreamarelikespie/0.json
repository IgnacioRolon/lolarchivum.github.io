Now I want to get back into the game and I see that my name is a string of alphanumerics, which I don't believe was the same name when I had first created my account. My login name is still the same and that's all well and good, but I don't want to be known in-game as \"IS19fe6b8c39b55ab721ed2\". Is it possible to change this? Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: Just found out I get to choose a new name in the launcher. Thanks anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-10T18:54:51.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad all is well now!  Your name might change like this after inactivity or if it gets taken.  Usually it comes with a free name change, which seems to be the case here!","replies":[]}]}
