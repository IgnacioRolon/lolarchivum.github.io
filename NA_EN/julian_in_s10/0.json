I would right click and get a white box that says \"back, forward and reload\" with back and forward being grayed out.  I have never had this issue before and have always played the game in borderless mode. I am a little bummed out that I can't find a solution myself so I decided may someone here would know what to do. In the link I have screen shotted a cropped image of the issue that I am getting. \r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T17:05:45.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the right-click menu from Google Chrome, from the looks of it. I recommend ensuring that your web browser is minimized or closed out entirely while playing to see if this resolves the issue.\n\nLet me know what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"julian in s10","date":"2016-09-15T21:21:12.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so basically on that day that I posted this it resolved itself. However, today the problem has resurfaced. I think it gets triggered by me tabbing in and out on borderless. But like I had said before it never happened before that time. I guess theres a first for everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T17:22:39.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you let me know if this happens if you close chrome out entirely? Additionally, have you previously taken steps to disable/uninstall Internet Explorer on your system? If so, that could be causing problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Molten Ice","date":"2016-09-22T16:57:17.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happening to me too, don't think it is my local chrome instance as it's not even running (just the game and Firefox). On the bottom right of BOTH the borderless as well as the PVP.net Client if I right click I get that context option.\n\nThis only started happening after patch 6.19","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T15:50:42.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like others have reported this is caused by the *Origin* client.
