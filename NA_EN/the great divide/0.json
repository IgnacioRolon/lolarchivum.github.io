Cool beans. So the other team has an actual duo going Nami and Quinn bot. They are extremely aggressive and start beating us up bot lane. At the end of the game, my ADC went ham on me saying we lost cause I didn&#039;t know how bot lane worked (I poked instead of going ham with Vayne to &quot;match the aggressiveness of our enemies.&quot; Vayne said that I should be aggressive, because Nami was being aggressive. But I&#039;m Sona, and am mainly a poke support, so should I have been more aggressive and ran in with Vayne? (I&#039;ll admit I poked Nami a few times, instead of Quinn, but only cause Nami was closer when I used q). Also, doesn&#039;t Nami beat Sona in terms of lane pressure?","replies":[{"poster":"djjomon","date":"2015-05-05T03:31:58.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne really can't match a Quinn's early game aggression. I mean, when her blind is on on CD you could attempt trade a bit, but Vayne's job isn't really to fight pre 6. Even at 6, when she gets her huge power spike, she's still somewhat weak. I think you did fine, just didn't synergize with your carry. Had you gone aggressive, who knows what would've happened. But I'll assume you played it properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J3R3MYism","date":"2015-05-05T03:28:22.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friend! So im sure that you did fine and the vayne was jsut salty about not doing too hot, BUT here are my thoughts.\nWith Sona you should be looking to abuse your enemy laners with your q procs. Vayne is a terrible laner and she really shouldnt be looking to fight and play agressivly unless you have your jungler there. Another thing that you should keep in mind is that Quin is a pretty good laner and she is a good dualist, and with nami in lane she is going to be that much stronger in trades and she will sustain after them.\nDont worry about when people are raging at you if you know that you are not in the wrong.\nI hope that i helped","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-05-05T03:07:55.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only a poke lane until 6, and yes you should be aggressive with your poke. Sona's Q+AA proc hurts. Do it as much as possible, especially against a low range ADC like Quinn.

Vayne should not play agressive at all in the laning phase. In an ideal world Vayne stayed back and maintain cs while you poked. I would say Sona is a pretty \"agressive\" support since she has long range with really good poke and also a heal. So you should be agressive but not to the point where you are taking damage back in return. Nami only beats Sona in lane pressure only if she lands her kit especially her q. So in the end it sounds like Vayne was at fault for being trash adc who was too agressive in lane XD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miku Lv99","date":"2015-05-05T09:28:04.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't like going ham with Sona.
