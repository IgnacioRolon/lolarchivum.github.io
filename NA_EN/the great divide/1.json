We know there are thieves so we keep our phones close to us. We know there are murderers so we don't go to places with high crime rate at night. In the same way,, we know there are assholes online so instead of waiting to be offended, we can grow thick skin and reduce the chances of that happening. Telling people \"stay the way you are, eat a ton of harassment (which might have a negative impact on your mental health) and wait for the online authorities to do their jobs (which isn't effective)\" is basically bad advice at this point. \n\n>Peer pressure is a powerful force, my friend.

If real life criminals don't stop even when the consequences are as serious as loss of life, then don't expect online assholes to change. Exactly! If you can't deal with it, mute them.

If you tell them theres a schizophrenic on a homicide run they will keep their itchy fingers on the trigger even at their most so the blame still sits on the perpetrator.\n\n> Where *Is* it forbidden?\n\nEverywhere. Threats against a person and the person behind the screen are in most modern 1st world countries forbidden. I did read the laws thats why i know it.

Oh man, if you think I am a snowflake and deserve belittlement in attitude and addressure for that SIMPLY because I can argue more mature than you then, my dude, you have a problem with your ego. A Dictator-level problem. The world doesn't spin around you and your moral is certainly nowhere near a high enough point to even deserve being a point of argument.\n\nAs I repeadedly proved, you are the perfect example of the kind of people who were addressed in this post AND by my first and original comment. You know the more you get angry the more you just dismiss your own arguments without me even lifting a finger. I will say it again, nicely. Calm down and argue like a mature person. At least pretend you have some dignity to lose.\n\nPS: if I am the snowflake, why are you angry and offended and not me? Definition of a snowflake is someone who reacts very emotionally sensitive to any speech of others. Right now you are being emotionally sensitive over what i said, so by the global definition, you are the snowflake and not me. If this doesn't give you reason to calm down then you're a truly lost cause.","replies":[{"poster":"Norglics","date":"2018-08-30T10:29:09.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-08-30T10:34:11.515+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"the all too typical flip the argument play. You can put on your tough guy act but unless you delete your comments it is visibly evident that you are the one being angry with nothing to offer but denial and labeled shaming. That's a fact. And the only way you can prove me wrong is by deleting your comments as to \"erase evidence\".\n\nAs i repeadedly said, you are the one who got hurt. Your choice of words and the quick switch from aggressive to wannabe-basic tough guy made it only all the more evidence.\n\nand do correct me but you are the one who kept calling it bullshit and kept asking \"how\" despite me having vividly explained it.\n\nThe IP thing, once again, serves as perfect example. I told you how someone might get their IP to cause a threat, by Doxing. you completely skipped it and asked me why yet again. \n\nThe very notion that you think you have proven an argument just by saying \"nope you are wrong\" deserves mockery, but for the sake of not getting a mod's attention i won't do you the gift of making myself vurnerable to moderation.\n\nAnd incase you do follow my advise and delete your comment to not publify your lack of argumentation to anything, do the same with your egotism. You don't win an argument with stubbornness. you win it with facts, and fact is that your comments demonstrate you clearly being butthurt over being told that the victim is not at fault for being weak but you, the perpetrator, are for being abusive.\n\nAny other belittling comment you want to throw at me which further raises your own violation of the \"respect everyone\" rule that I might use to report and get a mod down your neck? no? good.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
