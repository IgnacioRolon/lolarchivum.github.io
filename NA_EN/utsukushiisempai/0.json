At first I had thought about giving her armor and fire for hair, which would be cool, but doesn&#039;t fit the flair of Cassiopeia. (skantily dressed) :3\nI put a lot of attention into staying true to the champion and hitting all important landmarks.\nThe bangs, the headgear and the objects hanging from her waist.\n\nPlease upvote and comment if you&#039;d like to support the idea.\" \n\nCredit to Shockowaffel for the skin Idea and splash art!
