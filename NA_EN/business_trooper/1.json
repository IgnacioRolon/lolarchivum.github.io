Fed enemy MF with harvest. We got a yi that is coming back into the game me on morg building to support him instead of our xayah that doesn't know how her champion works. Anyway we pick mf most of our team dies but yi and I clean up the fight and take baron. We both die after getting it but our team has it. They then immediately go into a 3v5 at ocean drake at 30 minutes and lose our barons after we told them to save barons. Talking about \"braindead yi and morg you are dead and we aren't. Make the smart plays please\"\r\n\r\nI almost hit something.","replies":[]}
