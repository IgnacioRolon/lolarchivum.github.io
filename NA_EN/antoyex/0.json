Even though I believe that this kind of problem can occur and it might actually take this long to fix it I believe riot giving only a discount after such a loooong time is not enough for the community. Especially when this happens just in the usual holiday times is a big issue. This thing has been so long a brand new season has started and I believe this hurt Riots prestige.\r\n\r\n I think riot should give at least 1 free transfer and then discounted prices for transfers. That way they can fix their image that has been looking like they were turning into what happened to Ea games. A company that is only caring about selling their product and not caring about their customers. \r\n\r\nI know that riot had lost some kind of money because of this issue. But when running a company that has an image in front of the public eye the most important thing to do is keeping that image clean. This is just what I am thinking but it is clear that customers care about the image of the company a lot. You can simply look at what happened to H&amp;m in Us and all the other big brands when they failed to keep a good image. \r\n\r\nI am sorry for the long post knowing most of the people hate to read long ones in this generation. Have a nice day! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T02:15:01.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you really make some good points here! The main thing to keep in mind with the state of these transfers is that they aren't simply \"turned off\" but rather broken. Sometimes it's hard to narrow down and pinpoint exactly what's wrong, and I'm guessing they probably didn't realize anything was wrong until they tried turning it back on and something messed up. \n\nLast I heard, they should be back up late Jan/early Feb and I do believe there's some kind of discount that will be applied.","replies":[{"poster":"Antoyex","date":"2018-01-20T14:09:15.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know and its kinda sad. I am pretty sure maintanance team is working hard on this! \n\nI feel like discount probably wont help to many players as a lot of people who move out of states will have diffuculty to pay in that region again. Like simply in Turkey dollar is about 3&1/2 times more worth than Turkish lira. Which caused me who have moved here right after the shut down happened to be almost impossible to pay for a server transfer. Even in Turkish region I believe rp prices are much lower than what it is. That would cause a lot of trouble for Turkish players who was travelling during the summer in Usa and moved back to Turkey afterwards. \n\nMy suggestion to this issue would be a free ip based transfer to the country ip is based from. Also a discount for like a week or even a month for those who want to transfer to somewhere else than where they are. This would be mostly for players who train themselves in Korean servers to play in a competitive level. \n\nI know as a basic player who has never been in impact with community this idea may seem to Riot as nothing but just begging. But I have helped many business companies to grow up simply giving them a nice image with some ideas before. And as a player I want nothing but LoL to improve itself in a player based community. \n\nI have seen many of your replies to the players and I would like to thank you for being a nice support Broporo. One of the most decent supports I have seen excluding umm.. Maybe old WoW player support/admins :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hide on 0bama","date":"2018-01-19T10:54:25.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its been 3 months since that late jan early feb update how about you actually give us aproximate date and what kind of a discount will they be purchasable for BE or a really really discounted price of rp ? everyone is asking about the transfers and all of you rioters are just giving us the same exact update weve been getting for  3 months now","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T05:48:33.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really do wish we had more info, but sadly there just hasn't been any info to give.
