looks to me like your patcher is unable to read and write files.  This could be due to your OS settings or permissions, which is preventing the patcher from accessing necessary folders.  I recommend going over our [permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide as a first step to troubleshoot this.
