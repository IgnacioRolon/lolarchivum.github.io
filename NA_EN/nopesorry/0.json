But the players who master him are so superior, to every1 other player and champ in the game? At first i thought he was bugged, but there were no fix in todays update?\r\n\r\ni am quite curious to find out if yasuo is getting some kinda change/fix/nerf, call it what you want.. he&#039;s in almost every game i play and all games seems ruined, because he can just completely rape his Opponent?\r\n\r\nI know ill get flamed for making this thread since, the thing every player seems superior at in this game is flame. thank god for mute &lt;3 anyways hope you wont mute this post i am honestly interested to know. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2016-09-08T20:21:26.240+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"He isn't op, you're bad.

For one he is completely reliant on knock-ups for his ultimate be that with himself or with his q charge. Even when he was played in the LCS by Meteos and Huni in the C9 vs IMT game the support for both of the games was Braum and the junglers for each of the game was Rek'sai and Gragas all of which has a knock up in their kit. \nThe next thing is correct champion to bully his biggest weakness, His early game. Until Yasuo gets items he doesnt do that much dmg so early game champions that can really bully him such as {{champion:150}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:10}} can bully him and prevent his item spike from coming into effect. \nYasuo gets a lot of flack from being a \"no brain\" champion which is completely false. Every champ requires skill and a certain amount of time played to get to that point where they can be that nuisance  that makes everybody feel like they are a no brain champ. Best advice I can give to fight yasuo is pick an early game strong champion that can keep him from getting the items he needs to get his power spike ({{champion:85}} is a good pick because when he ults then you ult and it will stun him pretty soon then he can't move thus can't do dmg. \nJust some thoughts, hope that it helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horidas","date":"2016-09-08T20:20:30.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is very much in the list of 'excessively strong' pit right now, along with Zed and crew.

He is iarguably overpowered currently, and has had a rather annoying bug for a month or so. Not to mention the grasp of the undying bug with sweeping blade, that was fixed a while back.\n\nYasuo just got a **massive nerf and bugfix. **His ult got changed to only give armor penetration on critical hits, which greatly weakens the extremely disliked and overpowered \"Tank Yasuo\" build. \n\nBasically he would build all defensive/hybrid items and still do way too much damage between trinity force spellblade, 50% bonus armor ignore from last breath, and high base damage, while permaslowing people with frozen mallet. \nNormal assassin-carry Yasuo builds are not really overpowered, require way more skill to be effective, and are a lot riskier to play. As he usually has 100% crit chance from his passive when building normally, the nerfs only effect his tank build.\n\nFrozen Mallet also got changed to give less damage and more health, making it less annoying on high-damage champions that are abusing it {{champion:150}} {{champion:157}} \n\nThe bug where he got a free autoattack when using last breath was also fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-09-08T21:01:05.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is the champ with no weaknesses.
