I've never really had any lag problems unless I was using my shitty desktop. But recently for some reason I'll be in a game and I can't even do anything. I lag from the beginning to the end of the game, can't see what's going on. My ping is fine, when I'm not lagging it's around 40 something. And it stays at 40, even when I'm lagging. Problem is I am having severe frame drops. I'll go from like 50 FPS down to 2 in one second, or even less. It gets to the point where all I can do is run in circles, or just stand there. I can't do anything. And I know it's not just my computer because for the last week or so me and my friend have been having the same problem. Is anyone else experiencing this? It is something that's wrong with the server or the game? It's not my computer because some games I'll be perfectly fine, and then the rest I'm just standing around like an idiot getting yelled at by my teams.\r\nEdit: I tried to log in and it took like five minutes. After I got in, I tried to play a custom and it didn't load, said game was still in progress. So I tried to load back in, didn't work. I closed League in task manager, tried to log in again. I tried to connect to the game again. This time it let me in, but right as I got into game it told me that I had been inactive for so long that it instantly disconnected me. So, I tried AGAIN. This time, I got into game, and for about two minutes it was going fine. Then it got so bad that I just had to leave the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T04:17:40.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be specific issues with your system drivers or hardware that are causing these issues.
