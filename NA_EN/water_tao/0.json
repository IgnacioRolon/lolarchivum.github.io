I remember back like 2 years ago, when I started playing, I would leave games because i was new to it and I came from playing Call of Duty. I thought leaving games was just a normal thing and that matchmaking found a new payer to replace you(lool was i wrong), and then I got an email telling me all these reasons to why its bad...

That's an unhealthy attitude towards a hobby or video game. Hobbies should work around your life, not the other way around. But people here have this sick mentality that the only game that matters is the one they win and that if someone leaves it is somehow ruining their experience because they have a lower chance to win.\n\nIt's ridiculous. Absurd, and it shows just how poor people's priorities are nowadays.\n\nJust enjoy the game. And no, before you comment, I have literally TWO leaves on my record in my history(which is several years long), one that was a result of a long-standing but incredibly sporadic computer issue that took me like 6 months to figure out was being caused by like 3 champions(yes, it was that esoteric an issue... pain in the ass to track down and fix 'cause it was so rare) who had weird sound effects that were interacting poorly with my sound card... and one that was a result of my wife falling down the stairs.\n\nI read your post. I read it in detail. And I understood it. The whole 'make sure you have time to play thing' is the unhealthy mindset. It is promoting the belief that LoL should be of equal importance to other parts of your life. No matter HOW you try to spin it, the concept that LoL should have an equal weight to other aspects by being treated as a MUST FINISH if you start activity... is an unhealthy level of addiction.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oumi","date":"2014-12-16T09:15:48.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had this happen to me too. I got disconnected during champ select and couldn't log back in.
