The second half ( Additionally, heals and shields increase your target's armor and magic resistance by 15% for 3 seconds >when used on an ally< other than yourself, so the only think you would be missing out on this perk if chosen for a champion like {{champion:8}} is the bonus damage resistance that can be only applied to allies. Also this perk stacks with Runic armor {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}  hope this helps yall.","replies":[{"poster":"drtyhairy","date":"2015-11-23T06:35:21.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-21T11:10:27.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then it more-so comes down to how Vlad's E works with it. It's a multiplicative thing, which is insane when you think about it, so it can either turn that 10% into 13-14% (It's even multiplicative with itself ffs. Rito makes everything but it additive... sorta weird) or it could stay at 10%, which wouldn't be a whole lot. Given how his E works with -everything- else like with Visage and it at max stacks, you're close to a bonus of 63% rather than 56%. Though multiplicative also means GW turns it to crap since that means the 36% would be applied after GW, though I dunno really... \n\nYou'd think Riot would've changed his E to additive by now so we can actually do proper math with him, plus be able to scale him properly since 32% is actually 36% since it stacks multiplicatively with itself.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Glowdust","date":"2015-11-14T14:39:51.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is that for just a sheer sustain build?","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-11-20T22:04:01.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ideally, you'd probably want Runic Armor (for healing) and Deathfire Touch (for poke/DPS) on Vladimir, so you would be going [18/0/12](http://efferentinc.com/wp-content/lol6calc/index.html#KxKxK2vYCvCly).

You probably want to have both type of masteries available and change according of whoa re you going to phase on lane or what item are you planing to get first.\n\nI personally liek runing 18 in cunning since I feel most of the ferocity tree is wasted on vlad... the 2% vampire get out sustained by windspeaker blessing, additionally you also have magic pen on precision (assuming you don't want the 5%cdr) which even thou is not as strong as piercing thougths the results shoudl be minimal. Also you are forced to take deathfire touch as your keystone since the other 2 are  aa based, deathfire touch damage is nice to have but is not really helpful since you don;t have DoT and you are going to do sustain damage anyway so it won't stack as nicely. the only downsides is that you have to take dangerous game and secret stach  which is not helful at all since you only get half of the benefits","replies":[{"poster":"Korillo","date":"2015-11-21T13:45:42.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RogueWill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AyastsxP,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-11-21T10:20:38.334+0000)\n>\n> It really depends how you play your vlad... 18 point in ferocity and 12 points on resolve will result on more damage but 18 point in cunning and 12 points in resolve will result on more sustain overall.
