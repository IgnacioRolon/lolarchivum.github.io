Even though it happened while patching, it may have been caused by something else because the updated client is still running while prepping for updates.  \n\nTo start off, I suggest grabbing our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and using it to auto-configure your firewall settings to make sure that your connection is allowing access to the patching servers.  Should the issue persists, hop on the legacy client and let me know if you run into any other specific error messages.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know what you find out.","replies":[{"poster":"BARDAND0","date":"2017-03-22T16:13:56.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!

What happens if you try reinstalling the HRT, and making sure to have it save to a directory that you have permissions/access to?  Unless you are an admin, your pc settings could be preventing the HRT and even game files from being read.  Go ahad and reinstall the HRT, but go over our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide as well just in case something with your PC or some other software is causing these blocks.
