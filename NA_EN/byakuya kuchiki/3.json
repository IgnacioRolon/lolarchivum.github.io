If he gets peeled, NP, he can stick to targets with 3 slows (blue smite, randuins, BoRK) and a resetting gapcloser.\n\nYou said later that he isn't as good as Warwick. But that's because of your build, not because of Yi. With randuins, Yi is *stickier* than WW because WW has no gapcloser outside his ult. Once he burns his ult and the target isn't dead (due to peel or just tankiness) he gets kited like crazy. Warwick is inferior to Yi in all aspects except he has the ult. He farms way slower, doesn't do anywhere near as much damage and all of his tankiness is from items, just like Yi. If Yi builds tank, he does way more damage than WW and is just as tanky, and most importantly, he can actually buy those items through farming, without having to take kills from every lane.\n\nI am a 300+ game over 2 seasons Yi main in plat 3.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-06-07T23:58:17.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glass Yi doesn't die so easily.

Both tend to stop Yi's ganks short and make most of the time he was on them pointless. Master Yi can use Youmuu's active and his ultimate for plenty of stickiness later on, anyways.\n\nYou only buy BF Sword once for IE or maybe Merc. Scim. Not a problem considering how easy it is to farm and/or get kills with him. Getting something like Black Cleaver, Frozen Mallet, Maw, or Merc. Scim. is done quite often. Very few items he buys have no real payout before completion.\n\n\"Cleanup\" means: after the engage. It's the same strategy used by every fighter-assassin with an extreme vulnerability to CC.\nEngaging with Yi is a very bad idea, but worth it if you can kill even one target and get the snowball happening. With Yi's damage, he shreds through any target he wishes and with Skirmisher's he can even assassinate tanks.\n\nI've already considered your points. This is why I'm making counter-points of my own. Looking from your ranked games, you have apparently given up on using Skirmisher's entirely since before the 5.1 patch. Please do tell me if you've actually tried to use it outside of ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-06-08T05:14:40.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have alot to say about using Master Yi. It is a good discussion to have with you, seeing as Yi is one of the most hated \"noob champs\" in the game yet he has a deceptively high skillcap both mechanically and strategically.  I'm currently in the process of writing a guide that shows my philosophy on using Yi, which is very different than most guides out there. \n\nFor your points: I don't use skirmishers on any non-tank. If you do the math, on anyone with better than 1.0 attack speed it is better to use chilling smite to land 1-2 extra autos. On fighters I exclusively use chilling smite. I only roll skirmishers when I play a tank that needs damage but can't build any actual damage items. I almost never use rangers or poachers.\n\nYou must realize that Yi is not actually all that impressive when 6 slotted because in a late game teamfight, anything can happen to a relatively squishy (no instant defensive steroid) melee. You could instantly delete the enemy carry off an engage. Or you could get engaged on and instantly deleted. You really don't know, as long as the game was even until then. Thus, I build for mid-game snowballing and skirmishing, and just either directly win the game before it goes late, or amass a HUGE objective/gold advantage so that it is almost impossible to lose.

Thank you for this info then. Could you actually help me out then? What would be your progression in some general circumstances? Like, bad game vs (ad/ap), average game vs (ad/ap), and ahead vs (ad/ap)? Just curious at what you like and how to incorporate that into my playstyle as you seem very knowledgeable about Yi :).

That's why using it to kill faster before they get away is more reliable than having to chase them.\n\nYou never use anything but chilling smite, and that's why I doubt your opinion on using anything but.\nChallenging provides an instant defensive steroid on one target, reducing their damage to you by 20%, this is very important when picking out the enemy carry because they alone cannot fight back and will die fast enough that the kill is almost guaranteed. Yi has all the stickiness he ever needs - his ultimate, BotRK, Ghostblade, you can even count Randuin's Omen. It's redundant to rely on chilling smite when he already has such powerful chase tools available to him.\n\nPlaying smart is how you avoid such defeats. Glass cannon Yi is viable because you can avoid death long enough to kill targets, and then move on to the next. He can carry games and assassinate, so there is no issue of a certain enemy member getting fed.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-06-09T04:53:50.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are you getting this \"full build\" stuff from?
