Other match ups like\n\n{{champion:122}}  vs {{champion:80}} + {{summoner:14}}  than yeah your lane phase is doomed, and unless the pantheon is the worlds biggest fucking idiot. You really have no hope of winning that lane, even if your jungler helps you out, it will be extremely hard to win. The best you can do is get the cs he allows you, roam when you can and make a strategy for when laning phase is over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-07-02T23:37:11.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are lanes you're expected to lose that if you don't feed, you out scale and win. \nFor example fiora vs pantheon.

That's the point of league. If you play smart and get help, then yes, every lane is possible to win. In a 1v1 scenario? No. You just just keep playing to your strengths while covering up your weaknesses bit by bit. If you want, you can face your weaknesses head on and play normals till you feel more comfortable.\n\nAll in all, league is a very diverse game and things can go any which way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-02T23:36:11.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i mean there are champions that just aren't meant to win lane because they scale into godly late game carries... but i mean u can win lane tho.\n\njust a few examples. {{champion:75}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:67}} \n\nYou win lane if you go even... you went even if you lose xD games over if you won lane.","replies":[]}]}
