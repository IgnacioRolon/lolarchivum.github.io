This results in me being stuck with the timer on 0 and nothing else happening. Champ select music is still playing and I can still click on sums/masteries/champions just fine, but otherwise it's just frozen. After waiting a few minutes I end up closing the client only to have that result in a dodge on my end. This happened to me twice today, once earlier this morning with the result being -3 lp and a 5 minute wait period. It just happened to me again now and I ended up losing 10 lp and now have to wait 30 minutes. Really frustrating, so any help on how to prevent this would be helpful. \r\n\r\nI've already tried repairing the client and like I said, it isn't an issue with my internet connection because I have no problems in game or with any other part of the client, just champion select. It was a minor inconvenience having to lose 3 lp and wait 5 minutes here and there but now I end up losing 10 and have to wait 30? Ugh.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T16:50:45.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a network issue that's causing you to lose sync with your group, and kicking you out.  First and foremost, I suggest removing any third party programs, as apps like play.tv are currently causing some players to crash during champion select.  You can then test this out in a custom game to prevent any further queue penalties.  If that doesn't resolve the issue, go through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connection and stay in game.
