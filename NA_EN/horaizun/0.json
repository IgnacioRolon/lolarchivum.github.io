I want to ask RIOT and players what is the point of a permantly ban on accounts? Is that really necessary? Is that really cool against players that spent hours and money on your game?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't bother having my account banned for 1 year and after 1 year I come back to it. When I say 1 year it could even be 2 or 3 depending on the situation and the permanet ban being one that literally crosses the line, which wasn't for example my case in any of my bans, I tilt and I accuse them for troll and int and reports, on the other hand people who spread hate, death wish, cancer wish should be for sure banned for longer periods. However we can not forget riot games is permantly humiliated by popular streamers such as Yassuo, Tyler1, Nightblu3, Trick2g and others, who openly spread bad words outloud, which stands for a crime known as **defamation** and guess what? Riot still gives them accounts with all the content, not that they can't buy it, but not only they defamate riot 24/7 in stream outloud in front of 10k+ viewers, as they are offered champions, skins and invitations to play in their tournaments! However a player like me, who gives nothing but a few pounds a month or even less, I don't have a chance to have skins/champions or any other content and also not being forgiven.\r\n\r\nAlso let's not forget, Doublelift is a toxic player and riot still influences his attitude as the trashtalker while I was banned with a chat log that clearly is nothing compared to what Doublelift trashtalks yet he is promoted by riot while we are community are banned for spreading the same words.\r\nNow Riot could use the argument that they are aware of Doublelift's behaviour and it is just sarcasm but we can also say that, can't I be sarcastic in league chat? Yes I can.\r\n\r\nRiot is a rigged company and threaths players as slaves who give them money and bans them as soon as they can so they get new accounts to spend more money because in the end, we are all addicted to gaming and league is a game whom very people are addicted to so they can abuse that strategy as tobacco companies or alcohol companies do, it's bad for your health/mental but they do it no matter what.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I know this will not change a thing because as a matter fact, riot games never cared about their clients (players) because I have asked many times for a cellphone number of the main offices and emails so I can directly contact the managment and those things were always denied, riot employees that interact with us are just paid slaves to ban us without looking twice at logs or caring about the effort and money spent on accounts.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nHORAIZUN.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-10-04T14:46:19.831+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"> We as players come online after a real life world day, some of us get out of work, others school, others face real life struggles as unemployment, others deal with relationships/friendships hardships, stress from work/school and even sometimes both or all of the above.\n\nNobody in League, Life, or anywhere is required to put up with anyone else's frustration, anger, or shit.\n\n> What is the real point of the perma ban?\n\nTo remove players who disrupt things for the rest of us who don't.\n\n> Riot is a rigged company and threaths players as slaves who give them money and bans them as soon as they can\n\nYou keep going with those conspiracy theories, dude.

But apart from the couple of question I have which it could answer (did that person use ZT terms, was that person below level 30), there's still three things that I am confident it won't be able to prove:\nA) That the 14-day banned player didn't have any prior punishments\nB) That the brother **did** have prior bans\nC) That they share the same IP\n\nSo at the end of the day it's going to still be just your word.\n\n> And it's a bit weird how their made up 0.006% has not moved for about 5 seasons now even though the new players are making new accounts faster and faster and toxic number of players are positively correlational to the number of people joining the game.\n\nYes, the **number** of toxic players and the **number** of people joining the game correlate.\nBut as long as the two numbers are proportional the percentage (i.e. the proportion) won't change.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-10-04T15:08:14.672+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only thing I have to say that hasn’t been said is that you aren’t helping the problem, you’re part of it.\n\nYou spamming ff and harassing others loses games just as much as trolls do.

Go play assassins creed or something, go play offline, the online gaming is competitive and you have to deal with stress and bad words, would be fun to see football players banned every bad word they say, would be fun to see every CS:GO player be banned for every chat or scream in offensive terms because it happens all the time, it's a game and people get emotional about it, its perfectly normal to be in a competitive game and when your team doesn't try you get frustrated and spread bad words, whats wrong about that? \n\nAnd quoting this:\n\"Nobody in League, Life, or anywhere is required to put up with anyone else's frustration, anger, or shit.\"\n\nAre you freakin kidding me right?

The fact that you can buy accounts which people do all the time only makes it a minor annoyance given how cheap you could buy one for. Again i dont agree with this and i bring this up because riot needs to do something about that. Perma banning is pointless to a point. Way to easy to get back into the game even if they can't play ranked.New player experience is at an all time low i can't even get friends to come play this that are new for more then a couple games and old friends i can't bring back as they hate the community and how everyone flames if you are not up to their standards. Its a vicious cycle.

Just because 100% isnt the answer doesnt mean a vast majority of people who do get banned and even streamers practice in this. Botting is also bannable offense yet when you see bot accounts all the time in low lvl normal games makes you wonder is riot actively doing anything other then banning toxic language because of their automated system. They do not take active roles to police this game in its entirety. Permanent banning does not keep people away due to other methods of creating/buy/boting accounts. They need a better way to keep people out. The only reason and yes this is my opinion why they dont IP ban is really 2 reasons, sue to multiple people playing league on the same IP and even if a person does end up hasing another account if they arnt toxic on that account they hope that person spends money.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-10-05T09:57:25.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The math is simple.

As for trolls not getting punished, that's false. Tyler1 was infamous for trolling and inting on multiple accounts so much that he got ID banned. Yes he as a player got unbanned, but only after a year of showing improved behavior, and his banned accounts are still banned today.

Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned.

That aside back when the Tribunal was around there were tons more tiers to go through before getting permabanned. Combine that with how slow it was to process and even form cases Riot decided to lower the amount of tiers it takes to reach permaban status to get rid of the truly toxic players faster rather than give them more chances to ruin more games. More chances =/= reform if the person in question has no interest in reforming.\n\nAs for why the OP got downvoted heavily if you read their post it's easy to see why: \n\n* Ranting and raving about being held accountable for their actions and that they didn't get a free pass because others were worse.\n* Insulting players and Riot.\n* Using false/misinformation and taking it as fact.\n\nIn the end it's just one long rant with no proposed reasonable solutions to their problems, and both it and their further posts in this thread (which is over a month old btw) show that they only wanted Yesman answers rather than an actual civil discussion.
