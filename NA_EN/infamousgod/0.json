Everything is fine now, but thank you for trying! I just have a question as a newbie: is it possible for smite to work on enemy champs? Because my fav LOL YouTuber uses twisted fate a lot and somehow has this blue lightning every few times he attacks and enemy champ.

I'm not very good at playing Assassins, so I may not be very much help, as a support main. I'd say you'd be better off reading through the guides that lots of awesome community members put together each and every patch on many community build sites. There are tons of them out there, some being quick references, while others go into theory crafting and the reasons behind one item over another. I'm sure you can find the right build for your playstyle if you hit up Google! ^.^\n\nPlease get back at me if you need help with anything else!","replies":[{"poster":"InfamousGod","date":"2017-01-09T04:13:06.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thanks for the help!
