You can even play Soraka or Shen and help out when on the other side of the map (yes, Shen does work as a Support).","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-02-19T12:53:50.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't like the idea of being on the other side of the map just because half of my team is doing a play there\nsomeone needs to protect the part of my team that's on the side of the map without a fight\n\nif 3 of my guys are diving top or mid, I don't want to waste ult for just an assist otherwise rito won't give S rank and recognize good play >.>\nwho cares you protect your turret, you get first turret blood, or even worse GIVE IT TO YOUR ADC >.< nooooooooooo, you must be penalized for that","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-19T13:19:28.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry about making bad decisions to get an S, that is not how you get an S.
