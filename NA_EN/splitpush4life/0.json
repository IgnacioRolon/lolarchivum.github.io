Time to go through your [match history](https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/2233181853699008) to check how believable your claim is.\n\nIf you scroll down, once again, look at all those TT games with ghost/heal. On your last TT game, 9/28/19 you suddenly decided you were done with playing for a while. Then there's a large gap of playtime despite the marathon you've been running, until 10/10/19. \n\nAt that point you toss ghost/heal out with the bathwater along with any pretense that you didn't know how to play and jump directly into Ranked, channeling your sudden skill as a Victor main.\n\nAfter looking at that sort of pattern yet again I'm skeptical to believe your claim.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-10T01:38:37.811+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skeptical is.. putting it too nicely.\n\nWhat I'm skeptical of is why there's so many **obviously** botted accounts coming to complain this banwave - normally we see more of the less obvious than this time.
