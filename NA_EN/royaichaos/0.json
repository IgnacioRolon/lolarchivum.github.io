Don't seem to notice that the cigar wasn't in the previous splash or the in game model\r\n2. Are overreacting and think that one non-important cigar is equal to the gun that Graves carries (which was featured in his previous splash, in game model, and pretty much everything else Graves-related)\r\n3. Just don't get why it's being removed (It's not for ESRB, it's not for NA at all, it's for FOREIGN nations which have rules forbidding such content)\r\n4. Are acting selfishly and asking for hundreds of people to be unable to access the game over a stupid few pixels on a drawing\r\n\r\nI've decided to try to come to a compromise. Why not just have the splash without the cigar in the countries who have problems with it, and keep it everywhere else? During Worlds and such, you can use the splash without the cigar as it's barely shown anyways. People will honestly barely notice the difference...\r\n\r\nAnd you can even remove it from his {{champion:104}} It honestly kind of looks like an extended nose when it's small like this.","replies":[{"poster":"ShÃ­ny","date":"2014-11-09T14:46:13.186+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not completely just about graves though, this line of thought will lead to the removal of actual in-game content.\nGragas Esq. has a cigarette and gentleman cho'gath has a smoking pipe.\nThis also leads to how blood and alcohol lead to restrictions on games, will vlad or gragas be changed next? \nThe worries many people have regarding graves' cigar removal is we don't know how much riot is willing to change to make sure their game is available in all countries.","replies":[{"poster":"RoyaiChaos","date":"2014-11-09T17:35:20.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason they're changing it is because it's unimportant hence, not worth the players they're losing.

I think it would be for the best, but as has been mentioned, it does interfere with the ease of use in just being able to use the same packs of art for each server (Aside from China which has its own).  I like the cigar, but I'm not going to stop liking the new art or the character without it.\n\nIn response to the whole \"slippery slope\" argument people are making like \"OH WATCH OUT ALL THE VIOLENCE IS NEXT\", consider the size of this change.  It's removing a cigar from a character who never had one previously.  And if it gets them hundreds or thousands more players, that's a good decision.  If anything, the player base is more worrying, considering how downright xenophobic some of the comments got.","replies":[]},{"poster":"catraven","date":"2014-11-09T07:31:47.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"no1 seems to care that the wraiths and other dark, creepy creatures are absent from the new SR....","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2014-11-09T13:23:31.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What other dark creepy creatures?\nThe lizardman and golems were not creepy at all and the wolfs are back and look more menancing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-11-09T16:12:09.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I've decided to try to come to a compromise. **Why not just have the splash without the cigar in the countries who have problems with it, and keep it everywhere else?** During Worlds and such, you can use the splash without the cigar as it's barely shown anyways. People will honestly barely notice the difference...\n\nI think RiotSilver addressed this (emphasis is mine):\n\n>I can also speak a bit as to why we wouldn't create multiple splashes in response to this kind of issue. One of our goals moving forward with splash art, compared to how things have been done in the past, is to create content for all regions. **In the past we've created modified or entirely different splashes based on the needs or appeal of certain regions, but this is something we've been working to change moving forward. Where possible, we want to stay away from sharding the game unnecessarily for different regions.** It may seem like a small thing in this case, but we believe that being consistent with this artistic approach best allows for a common community and common stories for players to experience and share with each other.","replies":[{"poster":"RoyaiChaos","date":"2014-11-09T17:34:09.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But this is just a very minor edit, not creating an entirely new splash and will be barely noticeable between regions.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-11-09T19:33:44.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not a workable compromise.\n\nRiot is not only trying to keep access their game available to as many players as possible, they're also trying to unify the assets across all regions as much as possible.\n\nSince some countries and censorship boards will not allow gamers to play certain games that depict tobacco smoke, that means thousands of players will be unable to play League because a few American players want Graves to chomp on a cigar his picture.\n\nTherefore, the cigar goes.
