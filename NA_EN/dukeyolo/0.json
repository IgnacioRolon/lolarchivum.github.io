It's been a lot of fun playing around and learning the game with you guys, I have some many awesome memories of playing on teams screwing around with friends, doing troll builds and all of the cool modes like nexus blitz. It wasn't easy deleting it, but I just don't have any fun any more. I'm pretty fed up with the game and the state of balance among other things. \r\n\r\nRiot has pretty clearly demonstrated their incompetence at this point with the champ design on new champs and reworks. It's a pretty big bummer because for 10 years this was my favorite game that I could always come to, but I just can't keep playing games where I do really well, but lose because the other team had a {{champion:82}}. It just isn't fun. \r\n\r\nI've also been fed up with how some of these big companies like Blizzard have handled the situations with Hong Kong and China, and it felt like Riot barely avoided having to show their true colors on that front while hiding their loyalties to not upset fans. It's time to face the fact that Riot is a bad company and the game I loved so dearly for so long just isn't the same for me any more and doesn't hold the same spark and excitement. \r\n\r\nI know I'll probably just get downvoted to hell, and I don't even know why I wanted to post this. It's been a ride and I hope you guys keep having fun on the rift, but my time is done.","replies":[]}
