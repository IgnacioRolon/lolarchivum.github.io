I won't elaborate too much, as it's been discussed to death on these boards, but I'll just say that the decisions Riot have been making over the past year have made the game both boring and frustrating for me. So I've decided to look toward other games.\r\n\r\nI was wondering, are there any MOBAs out there that are like League but which are overseen by a team that knows what they're doing? In particular, I'm looking for a game that has actual variety and creativity of playstyles, and most of all, good balance. I've heard of Dota2 but believe it might be too complicated for me. I prefer a game with simple basics that allow complex strategies, like chess, rather than complex basics that require years to learn.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?","replies":[]}
