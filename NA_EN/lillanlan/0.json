If you're under a Leaverbuster low-priority queue, you'll see a number that shows how many times you have left before you've worked your way through them all. If you are marked as a \"Leaver\" or as \"AFK\" again while trying to work your way through these timers, you'll reset or lengthen their time even more. You can find our FAQ on this system [here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-08-22T13:04:03.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order for the low priority queue to be removed you have to wait the timer out, join a game, and finish it (Winning or losing doesn't matter as long as you just play the game through to the end)\nSometimes it's not just one queue you get low priority for, but several. It will let you know how many you have left after finishing a game I believe. If it makes it any easier, I believe games against the bots (Player VS AI) also counts in helping clear the low priority queue.\n\nHope this helps!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
