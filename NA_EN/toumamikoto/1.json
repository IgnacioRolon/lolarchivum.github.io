I can't even go to my task manager to shut the game down and the worst part is, the game works fine for like the first 5 minutes of the match and then starts freezing up. I've run the corrupt repair program from the login screen, reinstalled league, checked my drivers, cleared my RAM, and turned off my firewall to test, and it still consistently keeps happening. It's really becoming a pain and I don't know what else to do. If someone can help me I'd really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bubsies","date":"2018-11-29T11:53:52.926+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having this issue as well. For at least a month off and on. I can restart my computer because I have two monitors but even task manager cannot close it. I ended the processes but it doesn't leave until I restart. It does not happen every game but can happen multiple games in a row. It only does it once per game if it does happen. I'm not sure if can even create a dump file.

I talk to them for an ENTIRE week and they tell me it's gotta be something wrong with my computer. I know that's false cause I just got the thing and it's 100 custom made.
