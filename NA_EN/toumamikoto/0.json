It seems like it's defaulting to locked camera, which isn't the normal case.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-01-24T22:10:02.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the response!

This has been an issue for me since I started playing league in season 5.the only way to fix it is to reset all settings then go back to spawn then change the hotkey for unlocking camera to spacebar.  Even doing this which takes about 2 mins does not always work. It sucks not being able to play champions like zac and xerath. This is a really bad bug for people that like to use locked cameras.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TAScientist","date":"2016-04-12T01:34:29.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a band-aid solution, but you can also press spacebar to center the screen on your champ (although it'll only stay this way as long as you hold the key).","replies":[{"poster":"ToumaMikoto","date":"2016-04-15T23:10:54.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TAScientist,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=f5A7N3Jq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-04-12T01:34:29.487+0000)\n>\n> This is a band-aid solution, but you can also press spacebar to center the screen on your champ (although it&#x27;ll only stay this way as long as you hold the key).\n\nI do admit that after doing this a few times it does help but makes it really hard to do much, seeing as my hands are at an awkward position.
