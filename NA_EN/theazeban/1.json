I was in the last game of my series to Gold 2 and was devastated. Just wondering what is considered a loss prevented match, or if this can be changed to a loss prevented? My entire team was bummed, me especially. The game ended in 12 minutes. 12. \r\n\r\nWhat are the requirements to receive a loss prevented game?\r\n\r\nCan we get a Loss Prevented for this game? Or is this one of those things were if another player trolls, the entire team goes down with him and we all get \"punished\" for his actions? \r\n\r\nI understand winning and losing as a team, but when someone ejects themselves from the game like that in a ranked game it is really irritating. \r\n\r\nAnyways, just knew that the boards would be a good place to start as Player Feedback is mostly handled here. \r\n\r\nWould greatly appreciate a Riot response.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T02:42:55.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[**Loss Prevention**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753014) is a button we can hit that will essentially erase any penalties/losses in MMR/LP/etc for games that were affected by server-wide or major system crashes.

I hate using the word punished, as it feels pretty intense for a game, but it really sucks that this happened, for everyone involved. I love this game to the core, but some of the people I get on my team, and sometimes the enemy team, do not share the same love for the game and the people who play it that I (generally speaking) have.   \n\nAlso, thank you for the super fast response. IT IS SO VERY MUCH  APPRECIATED!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T03:05:50.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best thing to do to get our attention for those situations is to report them in the post-game lobby.
