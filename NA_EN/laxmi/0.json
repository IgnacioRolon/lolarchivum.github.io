I was in my qualifiers, and that /remake counted as a loss for us. It also took lp away from my friend. i thought a remake would only affect the person that was afk. it just doesnt seem right for it to count as a loss in my qualifiers. Does this happen often, or was it an error?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T18:16:12.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The post screen for /remake might show as a loss, but it actually doesn't count and it's just a visual issue.  Looking into this for you, I can confirm you did not lose your series because of remake.  It looks like you had 2 losses and a queue dodge, which ended the series.  It's important to stay in champion select and finish it out, otherwise a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) will count as a loss.  Hope that helps clear things up, and good luck!","replies":[]}]}
