It wasn't a big deal with the old client because it would just drop me out of queue and it would generally just be an annoyance to my friends. But with the new client every time the client disconnects itself it restarts itself? There's a circular league icon with a loading bar thing circling around it. And then from there I have to manually restart the client otherwise I can't get into a game. I'm wondering if anyone has ever had a problem like this and found a fix? I don't have connection issues while I'm in game, it's just with the client and has never disconnected in champion select. I can still use chat features while I'm disconnecting. I used to live in a dormitory and I didn't have this problem but when I moved to a different place I started having problems. Fairly annoying, anyone have any potential fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T03:14:17.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection specifically to the Maestro service and some of the PvP.net services could be poor.
