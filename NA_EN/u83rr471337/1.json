And don't tell me that they're up, because that's a straight up lie. If they were up, then I should be able to play, but no, I got disconnected from PvP.net just as I was about to enter my first draft pick match. Why, Riot Games. You ruined my first Draft Pick experience now. Thanks a lot. Your stupid servers always seem to attack me whenever I'm just about to have the most fun ever and they're just fine on my worst days ever. Please, Riot Games. This may be the third time I'm complaining about this, but this has happened to me more times than I would like to announce.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T18:46:01.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see that there were any server issues.  When you accept a match, the server groups everyone together into the same zone.  If your network is having issues, then you may lose sync and get left behind.  I suggest going through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this and resolve whatever is causing your connection to hiccup.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
