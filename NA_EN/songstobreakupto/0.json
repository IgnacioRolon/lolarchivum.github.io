The old ingame shop was smooth, worked nicely, and you could easily preview champs/runes/skins and browse freely before purchasing.\r\n\r\nThe new shop is incredibly slow, clunky, and constantly has bugs where it times out. I don’t understand why this was changed? Can you please change it back.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T18:51:30.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The store recently went through a [visual update](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/jwhApRPE-store-visual-update-incoming) to improve navigation and include some of the new features like hextech crafting.  I'd like to help out with the issue you're having, but need some more information.  Are you receiving any errors and can you explain the bugs that you're experiencing?  Any information will help towards troubleshooting your issue.  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"SongsToBreakUpTo","date":"2016-07-25T19:01:59.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand why you would need to add hextech crafting features, but the navigation is not an “improvement”. It’s actually much much worse than it used to be. As I said, store is extremely clunky, slow, and times out. That’s my issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
