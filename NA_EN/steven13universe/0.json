Champ select is always a black screen and I cant select anything. I have received two ranked losses and lost 13 Lp. This has happened both times since I updated to the new client. I cant even play the game!

It sucks that you've lost LP as a result, and I'd like to help!  We can't adjust game stats, but I do recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get that fixed.  The updated client is also in testing, so you are able to use the legacy client too.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Rajin Kajin ","date":"2017-02-23T23:59:50.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question, but it's unrelated to this.... I received an S- for a champion that I have just purchased, Katarina. I didn't receive a chest for it. In the Champions screen (of the old client), Katarina doesn't have the gold border that champions get when you've received a chest for them, and when you hover over her her chest icon isn't filled in, but it says \"Season highest grade: S-\". I am 100% positive that I had already bought her when I got the S-. Has a change been made? \n\nAlso, I posted this in \"Report A Bug\", and Riot took it down due to \"It being better suited for Gameplay\". I'd like to know why, as it is very clearly a mistake in the game, and has absolutely nothing to do with gameplay mechanisms. Riot didn't even answer the question, they just told me to post it elsewhere, which is aggravating. If it was automated, I understand, but, regardless, I don't want to play the game if I believe that there is a problem with the Chest system. Any explanation or attention would be totally appreciated. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-24T00:15:29.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you unlocked 2017-02-22 on a late evening, but don't see any S games since then.

It looks like that even though you have her unlocked now, your account is actually out of mastery chest drops now.  You can check how many mastery chests you are eligible for through your profile, similarly to how many rerolls you might have in ARAM.   Per the [hextech crafting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide), one will refresh each week, so hang on until then in order to grab another chest.  \n\n> You have four chest slots in your profile; once you’ve earned four chests, you won’t be able to earn more until a chest slot unlocks. Chest slots unlock seven days from when you first locked the slot, but only one slot unlocks at a time.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Rajin Kajin ","date":"2017-02-24T20:00:03.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you.
