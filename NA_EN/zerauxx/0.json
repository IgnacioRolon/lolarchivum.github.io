However over the past 3 days I've had to uninstall and reinstall LOL 6 times and its not fun because it takes 3 hours and i didn't play all day on Saturday. \r\n\r\nThe Problem: \r\nWhen i click my LOL launcher it bounces on the dock ONCE and sits down no Dot comes underneath it to show the application is opening/responding  and when i go into activity monitor it says : League Of Legends (not responding) i force quit it and keep trying yet nothing happens. I have seen the old solution (something about Userkernel) but we are on the new client and stuff is different so the files in - Show package contents - are unique to what they were like 2 years ago. I really need a fix because i cant enjoy league and it feels like a burden.\r\n\r\nThankyou in Advance {{champion:64}} , {{champion:238}}  Main xD","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-17T02:36:34.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh that issue sounds like a case of your OS not having the right admin priveledges in place for League to be able to run properly. Permissions work a bit differently on Mac's but follow [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#mq9) and you should be able to get back in.","replies":[]}]}
