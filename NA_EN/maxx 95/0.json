Each time after the 5 matches are over it goes back to normal and it happened again making me wait 10min. Will the build up on the wait time go away after a while or will it get bigger and bigger. I mean I understand its not fair for AFK players because they are very annoying but it doesnt seem fair for the lagged out players. Can we do anything about this? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2015-02-08T20:14:07.080+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you continue to leave matches frequently your punishment will become more severe.

You and those you play with know how distressing it is to be down a player for even a moment, and the system places accounts into the low priority queue until it can show consistent play time without interruptions.  The system exists to prove that you are able to play without further issues, and can continue to reset or increase until resolved.  Remember that this penalty isn't a result of just one occurrence, but frequent interruptions over a short period of time.  My advice would be to [troubleshoot ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)whatever is going on, and use Custom Games as a safe haven until you are confident in playing without further interruption.\n\n[Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)","replies":[]}]}
