I don't mind having these conversations, as it's great to hear first impressions and constructive feedback, whether it be positive or negative. We're always looking for ways to improve upcoming content. \n\nAs Jakra mentioned below, Slayer Pantheon is 975 RP. \n\nWhen looking at pricing a skin, we take things on a case by case basis. We don't have a checklist for what needs to go into a 975 RP, for example. We ideate on a thematic and execute on it. During development we have several conversations on what particles, sounds, animations etc. are needed to fulfill x thematic. \n\nFor some thematics, we completely change the weapon, which may warrant new sounds and particles. for other skins such as Arclight Vayne, the weapon doesn't change, so we won't need new sounds, but giving it new particles really ups the Arclight thematic. \n\nLet's take Zombie Nunu as an example. He has different VO for this particular skin, but he's not a legendary. Historically, legendary skins have VO. So why is he priced at 1350 RP? We felt that the new VO wasn't a completely new VO script (something like PROJECT: Yi has), which is why we didn't deem it legendary status. \n\nHope this clears a few things up!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-10-14T03:23:33.368+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest problem for me is that these skins really do seem like they could have come out at any time in the year.

And I'm not that interested.\n\nHope they'll somehow make it exciting even if the skins presented in the PBE are incredibly dull.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2015-10-14T01:05:17.759+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last year's Harrowing skins was amazing: Underworld Wukong, Ravenborn LeBlanc and Reaper Soraka. This year is pretty lackluster with one that's obviously Harrowing-like, Zombie Nunu, but the others doesn't fit. They look like something that came out of Mad Max/Borderlands. Nothing remotely  look Harrowing other than Jinx's recall. \n\nEven Demon Vi and Voodoo Brand skins look more like it belong to the Harrowing event than \"Slayers\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"NegaDKR","date":"2015-10-13T22:11:28.161+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'm sorry, but how are these skins any less \"Halloween-y\" than say Mundo Mundo, or Kitty Cat Katarina? I love the animations and the old 80's horror movie vibe they bring.","replies":[{"poster":"delonix","date":"2015-10-14T00:53:34.268+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Slayer Panth and Slayer Jinx look more like Mad Max or general post-apocalyptic survivor skins than anything to do with Halloween. Mundo Mundo and Kitty Cat Katarina both play on the real world Halloween costume industry, while more recent skins have tended towards Shadow Isles/Harrowing instead of Halloween type stuff. Just because surviving the zombie apocalypse might be scary, doesn't mean it's related to Halloween.\n\nZombie Nunu is quite nice, and does match with old \"mad scientist\" horror, as well as theming with Zombie Brand. Which \"old 80's horror movie\" has stuff like Slayer Panth and Slayer Jinx?","replies":[]}]}]}
