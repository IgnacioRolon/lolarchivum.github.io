I know its not my internet because of that I have 0 lag in game. However, whenever I quene up and accept my match, it either joins the room very very slowly, or lags itself out about 5 secs after, making me have trouble switching sums and runes/masteries, and I have to relogin to my client in order for game to start (not in some occasions), after the starting timer hits 0. Its been acceptable in the way that I was able to play, but I just got a dodge timer from the match, that I did not quit. Does anyone know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-27T01:42:20.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your pc may be having a little difficulty running all the background animations in the new client. Try turning on low-spec mode in the client options, and let me know if that gives you a smoother time getting into matches and changing masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"jaméss","date":"2017-06-27T03:34:22.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"low spec mode was already on.

With that being said it wouldn't be a bad idea to go ahead and check for updates, but also reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to look over your network logs to see if there's anything in there that seems off.","replies":[{"poster":"jaméss","date":"2017-09-12T23:40:10.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah apparently I think its how ATT does their data throttle. They let some data go thru at 246 kbs for like a second and doesnt let anything go through for a second, therefore letting me like cast spells but incoming data is like delayed/clogged making me float around, not able to click anything and so on\nThanks for helping me though :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
