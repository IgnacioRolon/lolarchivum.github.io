While the idea of a more armored Soraka is interesting, imagine how silly it would look with her auto animations where she would elegantly flick her 'hammer' in the air to throw out a little banana, it doesn't really live up to the theme of the skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-02-27T17:08:27.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always did love that Idea.
