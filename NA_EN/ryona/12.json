So it's totally justified if I just AFK out, right? I had some troll pick Soraka today and about two levels into the laning phase I had enough, told him to fuck off, and went for a smoke. I was gonna lose anyway so it's not like it matters, right? As an ADC player, I almost hate Janna as much but not just quite enough since she at least does something.\r\n\r\nWhy do people pick these shitty passive supports other than to hide their mechanical ineptitude?
