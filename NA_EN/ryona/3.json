Not to mention if it were to really be a skill shot, it'd be fair to make it so it'd be allowed to heal multiple people, not just one. Otherwise she'd be useless. Which, I'd wager, would have the adverse effect intended by making it a skill shot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2017-02-19T20:50:54.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to compensate we will make her heal stronger and better, right?","replies":[{"poster":"ryona","date":"2017-02-19T20:52:11.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LadyRenly,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p1c1KMry,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-19T20:50:54.694+0000)\n>\n> to compensate we will make her heal stronger and better, right?\n\nBy all means, if it were a skill shot that doesn't pass through the first unit (i.e a minion can block it).","replies":[{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2017-02-19T22:23:49.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually doesn't fix _any_ of the problems that occur around Soraka.\n\nSoraka's teamfighting is actually very fair because she's squishy, needs to stay close to her allies, and immobile.  Any sort of flanking assassin or diver can blow her up in an instant, which cripples her team because Soraka provides literally nothing but heals (okay, not quite, but her power is pretty much entirely used through her allies, she isn't a threat by herself).  The _actual_ issue of Soraka is her laning phase, and Riot did a very good job of nerfing that with the heal cooldown changes making it harder to nullify poke and all-ins early game.  By making her heal a skillshot but strengthening it, you actually strengthen her laning phase (the most aggravating part for her opponents to play against) and weaken her teamfight phase (where she's a lot more vulnerable).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
