Only thing is you have to do it at level 1 or 2. If you can't, then you have to play safe and just outscale. If you die and fall behind, you can't do anything. A decent Tryndamere player can easily beat a Teemo if the Teemo player isn't good with Teemo (which a lot of people do because they think it's a hard counter).","replies":[{"poster":"PermabannedGaren","date":"2017-03-04T09:03:57.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=My IGN Sucks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3ls3jFsi,comment-id=0002000000000001,timestamp=2017-03-04T04:45:16.334+0000)\n>\n> Well according to the two top Tryndamere players on NA (BoxerPete and Foggedftw1 and 2), you can beat a Teemo.

Good Teemo players typically aren't dumb enough to get cheesed at level 1 or 2.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2017-03-04T04:16:52.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait are you inferring you would be Diamond if you got out of silver XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-03-04T03:14:30.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nerf yi plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lolman978","date":"2018-01-09T00:45:28.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't like how no matter how bad a Trynd does in lane, all he needs is a few items and now he's a threat since he can just ult, spin in, and dish out good damage before dying.
