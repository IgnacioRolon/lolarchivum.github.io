I am aware of what champions are deemed acceptable to them and what aren&#039;t: The acceptable ones are the champions with allegedly high skill caps, flashy plays, and general flexibility. What I believe is unacceptable to them are simplistic champions or ones with playstyles that are border far too off the norm (i.e {{champion:74}} )\n\nSo to this day, I am still bewildered by their obvious and admitted negligence of Azir and Kalista. Both champions **perfectly** fit Riot Games agenda with the hype and cash they generated with E-Sports, their general dominance, and absurd flexibility to do anything and everything for their respective roles at their peak.\n\nThey&#039;ve both since been gutted and abandoned for the time being. Why I care about this is because it agitates me to assume what I think of Riot and their balancing philosophy might not be true, which I adamantly refuse to believe.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-06-08T19:11:58.971+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's their absurd flexibility that is why they were put in the trash. \n\nThey basically lacked a weakness when in the hands of the best players","replies":[{"poster":"ryona","date":"2017-06-08T19:14:28.142+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8cWE6xmP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-08T19:11:58.971+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s their absurd flexibility that is why they were put in the trash. \n> \n> They basically lacked a weakness when in the hands of the best players\n\nThat makes absolutely no fucking sense when Lee Sin is allowed as he is and hasn't incurred Riot's wrath, ever.

He's very popular, and I think there are VERY frustrating things about his kit (that's important and I don't want to minimize that), but he's not OP. \n\nAzir and Kalista didn't just FEEL unfair, they WERE unfair. When played perfectly, there was almost nothing you could do to counter them. The counterplay was \"wait for the person playing them to mess up, then make sure you can take advantage of that.\"\n\nI started seeing Kalista just last patch again because of how strong Bork was. My experience was very similar to the horror I used to experience with her; as soon as she gets ahead, you are just screwed for the rest of the game. \n\nI don't agree that Lee Sin has that problem, and in my opinion, the stats support that. Is he annoying? Yes. Are there ways to improve his kit that would be healthy for the game? Absolutely. Is he OP? Nope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-06-08T19:16:11.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk about Lee. Maybe he's just easier to balance with Riot.

I actually think she's in a good spot right now but most people don't know how to play her. And when you think about it Challenger players can play most champions at their strongest, and Azir is still good but you have to be good at him. I've seen some Azirs that clearly main him but others who just play him every so often. Even though I do think Azir needs a bit of a buff.Same with Kalista. The reason they're changing Heimer is because he was really oppressive to a lot of top laners and could just sit there and shove. I mean if you've watched E-sports when Kalista and Azir were picked a lot it's because they were really strong in the hands of people who knew how to use them to their fullest.","replies":[]}]}
