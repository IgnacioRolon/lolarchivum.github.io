It also means even if you're challenger, you have no career options in League of Legends with how professional play operates.\r\n\r\nTo my eyes, a Silver player with the capability of filling in for every champion is more credible than any Diamond or higher OTP. Better flexibility and game knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd on a lesser note, when OTPs don't get what they want, they throw a tantrum instead of suckering up and playing someone else.

Sorry but OTPs do not care about being pros and if they actually cared they would actually put time and effort to learn other champions. When you are able to play a certain champion against any matchup, even unfavorable ones and still come out ahead? that deserves quite a bit of respect. \n\nA Silver player that is a jack of all trades is not better than a Challenger that is a OTP not even close. First the challenger player knows the mechanics of the game and how to take advantage of any lead he manages to get. He knows what map awareness is, he knows when to trade, when to all in, when to fall back and play defensively. This are things that do not magically disappear just because you are a OTP. The Silver player is going to lack in multiple of those areas and be susceptible to a whole lot of things that the OTP challenger player wouldn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-11T13:25:18.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're not giving enough credit to thd people who manage to play their champ in any/every lane jax otp getting autofilled as support sucks to play against, it takes way more dedication then you've ever known to get to that level","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLittlestLulu","date":"2017-02-11T10:01:31.927+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"OP is a singed OTP and is trolling.\n\nThere I saved you all a post.","replies":[{"poster":"ryona","date":"2017-02-11T10:04:32.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheLittlestLulu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VY4OssQL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-11T10:01:31.927+0000)\n>\n> OP is a singed OTP and is trolling.\n> \n> There I saved you all a post.\n\ni don't think i praised myself.

Anyone who dedicates time and energy to mastering a champion, even if only a single one, deserves a great modicum of respect - with a caveat, of course. They don't need to be completely hailed with praise for what they can do with one Champion, but they do deserve a little bit of respect. Even moreso if they try to teach others how to use that Champion.\n\nThe way I see it, One-Tricks do at least deserve recognition in the knowledge that they could teach what they know - particularly to the Jack-of-Trades that we mentioned have \"more a place\" than them. So even if they don't have any footing for professional play, they still have a place in the whole play ecosystem, as it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-02-11T10:29:16.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/33d2514e266b741481ed75c2e6972bbe.png see, I can play every role and Im a support god\n\n\nkek","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lexyy","date":"2017-02-11T10:09:02.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno if you're trolling or not but I actually agree with this. \n\nIf someone is diamond and they can only play 1 role (or champion) it only means they are diamond in that role, but gold or lower in others.
