Lux would be a good example of a champion that Aery should be okay on(though I personally think she'd do better with arcane comet because you can actually hit with a 100% success rate with Q so long as you actually land the Q, but otherwise the meteor wouldn't fire so 100% success rate). Morgana, Lulu, Sona, etc. It seems to be a more support based rune if you ask me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Koneki","date":"2017-11-20T00:38:26.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"increase missile speed on comet + additional damage instead ?","replies":[]}]}
