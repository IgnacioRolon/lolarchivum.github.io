Garen has faster waveclear mid game and self speed buff to push side lanes and roam better. In teamfights, obviously Darius has an easier time running head first and getting multi-person Q's while using two types of CC. You can't play Garen like Darius.

See flat damage reduction and armor shred. Since Darius does not do these things, he, by definition, _does not_  provide all of the things Garen does.
