It is simply based on the logic those inhuman crybaby tramps that destroyed this game and now have the ashes of it completely twisted around them should be the one carrying logically. They have no excuse to perform poorly with their role being showered with all the power now.\n\nSo if you&#039;re losing, just mentally think &quot;ah this fucking retard ADC oh well&quot; but don&#039;t type it, just channel those thoughts into your mind and not type. It feels much better.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-04-13T15:52:18.574+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name checks out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-04-13T15:45:01.440+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wanted to think about your post \n\nbut then i saw that you onetrick the most cancerous toplaner of all time \n\nNop sorry","replies":[]},{"poster":"WÃ®nter Fox","date":"2018-04-13T15:45:36.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ADCs ruined LoL,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pc8hgtT0,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-04-13T15:33:56.407+0000)\n>\n> I've taken a week off of this game to consider how to deal with my escalating bad attitude in-game on the heels of being fucked in the ass by ~~bad~~ miss fortune, playing on my alternate account.\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"greekvandaL","date":"2018-04-13T15:37:33.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what i have been doing since season 3.

To cope with your mounting anger though you need to constantly think of how better you are than the ADC player.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2018-04-13T15:36:17.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-13T15:50:04.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"amen brotha\n{{sticker:sg-poppy}} ","replies":[]}]}
