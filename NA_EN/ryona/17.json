I don't have current access to the email of this account. I never been chat restricted or suspended in game. \n\nI'm hoping it's a mistake because I've never told anyone to go die in chat, and never been racist. Yes I've been toxic but never got restricted for it, so a warning would have been really nice for me to correct myself as a player and all.\n\nHopefully a riot member replies back to the ticket. I had one reply today that they getting swamped and trying to forward all the tickets to moderation team or whatever.\n\nAnyhow, hope I get my account back, this one here. I would take a restriction if anything because I've never had one before in game. \n\nI didn't get hacked, replay.gg shows my last game played which was me playing of course. Never told anyone my account info and stuff either. So hopefully we get some answers, gotta be patient.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grifxdonut","date":"2016-05-24T20:43:39.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did this and got a reply from riot, so they will probably reply to you in a day or so. but dont expect to get a reply or a ticket reviewed for a while, i still havent gotten one yet","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fedora Bot","date":"2016-05-24T05:22:10.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELLO!
