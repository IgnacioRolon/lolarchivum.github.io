So if you use TP right after Recall, you will TP in with the health % you had at the time you last used Recall. To balance this laning disadvantage, Telelport's cool-down would be lowered and it can be used on any part of the map that you have vision of. This would mean it no longer needs a ward, minion, or tower to be used on; opening up new gank paths, better team fight positioning, and more frequent and appealing plays over all thereby helping his teammates carry even harder. This would also mean that a high-risk aggressive laning play-styles can try to gain an advantage in-lane and translate that into the mid and late-game; this creates a viable way for both play-styles to have an opportunity to succeed.\n\nOh and keep up the good work riot team!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ranmaru","date":"2018-02-16T19:43:06.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why nerf it, only reason top laners exist in this meta geez","replies":[]}]}
