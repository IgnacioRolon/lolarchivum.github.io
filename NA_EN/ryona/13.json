Hell, his own evidence actually detract from his point when you actually take a moment to think about it at the end of the video. \n\nHere's my explanation is that the sheer sustain through the dark seal combo gives Singed the early laning power to continually push waves against tanks which prevents them from generating any lane pressure since tanks don't waveclear very quickly. They are constantly being shoved in, proxied, and any kind of trade they make against singed would simply be shrugged off as it's hard to initiate onto singed and keep him locked down even if the jungler shows up. You can generalize to say that Singed wouldn't just work on tanks but any champion without proper waveclear and high mana costs.  Furthermore the bonus healing is extremely cost efficient meaning that Singed can heal an absurd amount with corrupting potion making early tower dives and skirmishes even more feasible. I might agree he isn't OP, but no, he doesn't need a buff. Hell, he's probably the kind of champion who shouldn't even be viable at a competitive level but who knows.

He could literally tank inner towers forever (I went for 10 minutes straight without falling below 3/4 hp).

Realistically his passive should make mana focused tank items really useful, (Frozen Heart, Righteous glory, etc) and yet, due to his lack of CC I feel you can't afford to neglect damage on him. While at the same time, His passive doesn't really make him tanky enough building mainly mana/AP items.
