If it is a bug or something it's fine but it still pisses me off to get notifications when I log on. And I thought you couldn't get inactivity notifs in pre-season? Or maybe I'm just crazy x)\r\nAnyway, thanks for looking into this since I can't send a ticket for some reasons it's always logging me off.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nShae Vizla","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T22:45:29.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmph, that's weird.

I think it is refering to my ranked 3s which I only played 1 promo game of. I am guessing the system wants me to end this promotion before the season starts? \nAnyway, problem solved I think :P\n\nThank you for the fast response,\nShae Vizla","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T02:30:03.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is really strange actually, especially if you hadn't finished your placements or promos. I'd go ahead and play a match in that queue just to make the notification stop, but even still, decay is NOT meant to happen during preseason.\n\nOverall, I'd chalk this warning up to some weird bug tbh!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
