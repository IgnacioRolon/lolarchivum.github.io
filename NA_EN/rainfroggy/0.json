I had some connection issues at the start of the game and afterwards when i tried to use the spear on my support and jungle it wouldn&#039;t work. It would go on cooldown if i tried to use it, and i ended up selling it and continuing the game. Howeve at around 20 mins in the oathsworn icon finally appeared but I dont think that the oathsworn tether animation to my support was showing. Please look into this issue because I have never experienced this before and it made playing Kalista quite difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-09T21:29:06.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nWas this a one time deal, or does this happen every game for you? I think the issue may lie with the connection issue at the start of the game. I can poke around to see if disconnects may be causing this - I'm fairly certain that may be the root cause here.
