When his sand soldiers are auto attacking he moves in a random direction on his own and the sand soldiers stop auto attacking. Riot please fix. I love my bird and need him in tip top fighting condition.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-14T17:18:06.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of the issue and are working on it! ^-^ \n\nAzir has been re-enabled after fixing a few critical issues. We're aware of a lingering bug where Azir can start automatically moving after issuing soldier attack commands. However, because movement is canceled by other inputs and Azir is a high-input champion, we feel it didn't warrant leaving Azir disabled. It'll be fixed next patch!","replies":[{"poster":"DinkinFlïcka","date":"2016-03-17T04:23:04.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AWESOME!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Musubï","date":"2016-03-12T10:28:01.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep O.o it totally sucks now !! and is W-E Q combo doesnt work he doesnt dash to soldier neither the soldier dashes in the right direction it havens nothing and your skills are on cool down wtf !!!!!!!","replies":[]}]}
