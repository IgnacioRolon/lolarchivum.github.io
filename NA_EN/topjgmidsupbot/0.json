For those who didn&#039;t know, only 4 of the 5 bots would spawn on the enemy team.\r\n\r\nI understand why Bots aren&#039;t given a priority over the other parts of the game, but still there are people who _actually enjoy_ playing Co-op vs AI, for whatever reason/s. So thank you again for fixing that particular bug.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are still a decent amount of minor bugs affecting Co-op vs AI, and while I have no expectation these will all be fixed _(because I understand there are more important priorities)_ I am genuinely curious about what plans Riot may have in the future regarding Co-op vs AI. I could write a wall worth of my opinions about how I think a small investment into Co-op vs AI could be beneficial to the League community (particularly new players), but that&#039;s probably best saved for another time.\r\n\r\nSo the main reason for this post, what prompted me to write this in the first place was because I had noticed for about 2 or 3 days this past week, Intermediate Bots were spawning on the bottom side of the map - and then randomly stopped. For those who don&#039;t know, in the past there was a small probability in Intermediate Co-op vs AI your team would start on the top side of the map (much like a normal game would) but for some time now, that hasn&#039;t been the case and your team would always start bottom. I&#039;ve played about 25 Intermediate games since we randomly started spawning on the top side, so I&#039;m confident we are back to always spawning bottom.\r\n\r\n**So, wat do Riot&iquest;**","replies":[]}
