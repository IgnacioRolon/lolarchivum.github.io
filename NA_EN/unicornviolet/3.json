When they realized that people in Florida have to play on servers in California apparently it was mind boggling to them.  After looking up how small Europe actually is, I'm kind of shocked that an area smaller than California gets its own personal server.  Like is Riot really hurting that bad for money?\r\n\r\nMy theory is that since California is the home of e-sports Riot is probably afraid of giving East Coast players a competitive chance because they don't want to risk losing their foothold in the industry.","replies":[]}
