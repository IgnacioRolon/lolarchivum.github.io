No matter the intent. it more often to be taken out of content, but when there is a zero-tolerance word or phrase that is stated a numerous of times, by the community and Riot, people shouldn't say it at all. Regardless of the intent. I like the automatic ban system. It catches more toxic players rather than the \"innocent\" players who use the zero-tolerance. The rare players that claimed that they're innocent rarely post here, more often we see the actual toxic players post that the system is crap due to they're no longer \"invincible\" on the internet says those phrases quite often. But let's say if the automatic system does get removed or tweaked. I honestly believe, and Riot as well, think the system wouldn't catch as many ill intents players.
