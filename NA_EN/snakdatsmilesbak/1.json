Will there be an option in the new system that will give an unconditional move speed boost like the old runes did? I know you&#039;re adjusting base stats but sometimes I used move speed runes to help with off-meta strats. Personally I&#039;d be fine with just a small % boost or maybe even towards enemy champs or away. Guys would you like to see the return of bonus move speed from runes or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-25T15:53:40.427+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"There will be such an option, yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-07-25T16:01:04.825+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uPnioTxT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-25T15:53:40.427+0000)\n>\n> There will be such an option, yes.\n\nIs it true you once ate a dinosaur?\n\nAlso, is Morello pleased to have you as his successor or is Morello horrified at your lack of Irelia nerfs (?)","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-07-25T16:27:56.521+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dominick Draconian Devaronian Demolition Demoted Diamond Daredevil Dangerous Derelict Dumbledore Destine at it again with the important questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-07-25T17:50:05.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TyrekGoldenspear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uPnioTxT,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-07-25T16:27:56.521+0000)\n>\n> Dominick Draconian Devaronian Demolition Demoted Diamond Daredevil Dangerous Derelict Dumbledore Destine\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Zz5S90su0 ?","replies":[{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2017-07-25T23:23:44.104+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"man trigun was good","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-07-25T23:27:21.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BoilTheOil,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uPnioTxT,comment-id=00000001000000010001,timestamp=2017-07-25T23:23:44.104+0000)\n>\n> man trigun was good\n\nI agree.
