I&#039;m talking about ranked in each of these questions.\n\n1)Do you think players who play off-meta should have to (notice I said have to as in they must) ask permission from their team to play off-meta?\n\n2)Do you think off-meta players must be compliant and not go off-meta in ranked if their teammates don&#039;t want them to?\n\n3)Do you think off-meta players must explain how their pick works so that their team can work with it?\n\n4)Do you think if off-meta players fail to do any of the above (if you voted yes to any of those questions) then they can be reported?\n\nI feel like that nunu smite support thing a while back left a lot of mystery surrounding off-meta picks in ranked and it&#039;s time to clear some of it up.\n\nTurns out the poll doesn't work the way I thought it did but you can still answer one of the questions, just pick your favorite.

I personally have been jungling Leona since Season 3 on two accounts, got to plat on two of them back then due to it, so I am fine with off meta as long as it's something that can function or the person has a clear strategy that isn't actually setting the team back. Although, something like refusing Sightstone as a support, or picking a champion that is all around hopeless in another role unless your team stomps is something I would say no to unless you're in a premade. Any of my \"off meta trolling\" (like Lux, Urgot, Zyra, etc jungle) have been with premade groups.\n\nRiot's stance is doing things different is okay, as long as you communicate with your team, and it's not something that ruins the match for your team even if you're winning a lot. Someone played Singed support and basically farmed in the enemy jungle and roamed, forcing the ADC to 1v2, he won enough to get plat but was temporarily suspended multiple times simply because forcing 1 person on the team into basically not playing felt bad for that 1 person even if they did win.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-05-31T16:20:16.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, what you say makes sense.
