Based on your information, specifically your CPU usage, there might be too many programs running in your background that's bloating your computer as well.  As a first step, I recommend going over our [FPS Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to troubleshoot this.  The instructions there should get you fixed up, but hit me up if your issue persists.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Em not gosu","date":"2016-07-23T08:51:13.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nthanks for your answer.\nI checked everything, my drivers are up to date, my in game settings are set on low (no im not playing with a chipset lol), windows is set on High Performance, i cheked registery with Ccleaner, i defragmented my hard drive and i still have the same issue.
