Dial back damage on everyone by 10-15% on all abilities/base stats and start from there.\n\n2) Towers and games are moving too quickly, there is no such thing as late game anymore, and the \"live design team\" state that this is intended because they don't want games to be too long in competitive. TO LONG FOR WHO? THE 500 PEOPLE THAT COME TO THE LCS STUDIO? WHO ARE YOU CATERING TO? You don't have 25,000 people filling a stadium every week, this is an online game that most people watch on there phones on the go, or on the computer.\n\nSolution? Bring back 40-55 minute games where outplay potential requires you to think 10-14 seconds ahead in a team fight, not 2 seconds.\n\n3) Your \"live design team\", is a joke, a literal joke. Some of them don't even play the actual game. Some of them are ranked very low and don't understand damage potentials and what not, all they see are numbers on a spread sheet and who needs to be buffed/nerfed because a computer algorithm told them to. Also, Ghostcrawler is a joke. \n\nSolution? Get new people to design your game, people who actually care about the game, not these headless chickens running around. \n\n4) Runes reforged pushed the game deeper into the hole of garbage. The entire system is unbalanceable or will take years to even start to see any balance of it. Stop watch is an abomination, who thought that it would be a good idea to give a free zhonyas active that can 100% turn the sway of a fight, or even give the ability to buy it out right? Resolve is a shit show in itself, you know why it's so overpowered in terms of sustain and durability? BECAUSE DAMAGE IS TO HIGH, who would of thought that insane sustain in lane would be needed when there's so much damage floating around?\n\nSolution? Go back to the old Runes/Masteries, it was much healthier.\n\n5) RNG never needed to be introduced into this game farther than crit, zoe/dragon RNG/scuttle bull shit/fruit plants, that was all un needed.\n\nSolution? Go back to fundamentals of season 1-3 where RNG was looked down upon and didn't need to be in the game, take it out.\n\n6) Stop giving everyone complex flashy kits, the community is tired of it, do you know why? Because we're sensitized from how much of it you've put in the game. When Zed was first released, he was absolutely insane to watch pull off a combo and jump around a team fight. Now? Almost everyone has insane crazy kits. \n\nSolution? ease up on the insanity of kits, you don't need that, it makes your player base tired of flashy plays because they happen all the time now.\n\n7) This ties in with damage being to high, but wave clear is still an issue, and it's because damage is too high across the board. Anyone with AoE abilities can clear a wave fast, comparatively speaking from earlier seasons.\n\nSolution? Same as solution for problem number 1, make lane management a thing again.\n\n8) Your little patch big patch cycles being a joke are a product of your idiotic design team. \n\nSolution? Do 1 huge patch every 1 month, or 2 months, that addresses many things.\n\nI don't know what else to list, but I don't care to put anymore thought into it, as the design team doesn't care either.\n\nAnd no this isn't my main account if you're going to call me out that I'm not Diamond, I have many accounts. \n\nAND NO, I'm not playing another game, I'm not going to be back tomorrow playing another game, I'm finished.","replies":[{"poster":"Love Anastasia","date":"2018-07-08T05:42:47.826+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":6,"body":"I agree in everything\n\nJust look for the post that people did when Ghostcrawler ~~get fired~~ left Blizzard.

The enemy champions/players are there to stop you and your minions. It was a literal tug war. Then we had a duel or more (ganks etc.) and we won, damaging the tower a bit. Rinse and repeat. I never felt like \"Game Over\" from dying over one gank or death. The real decision was made in like Minute 20 or 30, when it really showed who performed better on many levels, not only farming. And then the fights started. But everyone was, more or less, geared.

They seem to have filled your mind with tilt, salt, and memes.\n\n1) This is tilt.  Instead of playing back when behind, you get frustrated and just keep moving up.  Then you get all-in’d by multiple enemy players and die pretty fast.  So you blame the game.\n\n2) This is a meme.  Live design wants to prevent a waveclear+scaling meta where teams wait for 40 minutes to actually play League of Legends, with the game being decided by one misplay or bad teamfight.\n\n3) Another meme.  This is literally the “fire the balance team” one.  There’s not much more to say, other than it being Masters and Challenger players who spend all day on the game.  If you wanna talk rank, they know the game better.\n\n4) Yet another meme, where the player blames “Runes Reforged” for everything.  In reality, it finally gave players clear choices in matchups, and although the meta choices are pretty good, every high elo player I watch customizes theirs before each game.\n\n5) This time, it’s salt.  RNG has been part of this game since the beginning, and it’s actually been toned down in many places.  No more Dodge, for example.  But if it doesn’t go your way, then you blame the game.\n\n6) More salt. I love the flashy kits, and so do the other players who use them.  They’re way more fun to play as and against than, say, Udyr running at you and right-clicking.  This ties into Point 1, where you’re getting caught out and players are punishing you for it.\n\n7) Dead meme does not die.  Waveclear is fine, with perhaps Talon+Tiamat+Rake being an offender.  Players have been ripping through waves for years once laning ends.\n\nFinally, as another poster has mentioned, post your main account if you claim to be Diamond 2 100 LP.

The state of the game right now is worsening with every patch they give us. Damage is too high, games last 15-20 minutes, no room for counterplay if your team falls behind. This is ridiculous! We never asked for any of these! Plus they change the game waaaay too much during the season when preseason is supposed to be when huge changes occur. Now with almost every patch, huge changes are being shitted out by the awful balance and design teams. For example the scuttle crab change (WHICH NO ONE LIKED, LITERALLY NO ONE), the marksmen change (although I think it's a good thing they did this), and the reworks upon reworks. They are changing the game drastically with every patch, having it's players adapt constantly and not allowing them room to breathe. \"We care more about our LCS viewers, than our playerbase,\" said Riot essentially. Super disappointing. \n\nWe need someone to be hired to the balance team from the playerbase that actually cares. It's ridiculous how much suffering we have to go through all because of the esports scene and the neglect people from Riot have towards their own playerbase.\n\n{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sõna","date":"2018-07-08T13:02:16.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I used to play league of legends, for like a lot for a casual player for me.

You can make this the most balanced game ever, somehow, but the trolls will always be here and ruin the gaming experience. It feels like Riot takes no effort into obliterating trolls and inters and flamers. I would take an unbalanced game as it is right now with a good community over the reverse ANY TIME. \n\n2) Matchmaking. Ties in with the \"troll\" aspect stated above. Matchmaking just screws you in most games. Seriously, divisions and ranks and the MMR bullshit is so fucked up right now, that a 55% winrate Plat 2 player can be matched with a 48% Gold 4 player. Guess how that's gonna go, and what I will be able to do about it. Spoiler: G4 guy will get stomped, and I won't be able to do anything about it. It makes it so that most games, I feel like I can't contribute, regardless of how well I play, which makes it so that I don't even give me 100% anymore. Why would I tryhard when I know that it will only have impact in 10% of my games? No thanks.","replies":[]}]}
