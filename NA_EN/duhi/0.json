Do you have another monitor with a different orientation?  What happens if you open anything else or even the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nWhat's the resolution you're currently playing at?  Keep in mind that it can't exceed 1920x1080.
