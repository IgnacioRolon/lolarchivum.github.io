My client has been bugged since I started, or my account--I was told both. The client is missing the supposed rewards for leveling and my account is apparently receiving either some or not all of the rewards. This still has not been fixed since last week's conversations with support staff.\r\n\r\nI just tried to link my account with Twitch Prime for a capsule. I purchased a month of Prime only to find out after trying to claim the reward that it ended May 14th. TAKE THE FUCKING AD OFF THE STORE if it's not a valid advertisement. It really seems like nobody cares about the new players and, honestly, just seems to be a money-grab at this point. No technical help, no account help, and false advertising is pretty infuriating.\r\n\r\nAlso, I can't POST anywhere but here??","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-05-20T18:18:11.476+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Biisk,\n\nSorry to hear about the trouble you've been having with the new player rewards and the Twitch Prime stuff.\n\nThe Twitch Prime stuff showing up in the Store, but not on the Twitch Prime page is pretty concerning; I'm reaching out to my colleagues to see what might have caused the discrepancy.","replies":[{"poster":"Biisk","date":"2019-05-20T18:39:11.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding.
