It'll work for a bit and then all of a sudden it will stop working. it's very frustrating and i don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone else had this problem ever or even since the new patch?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T17:42:39.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your keys can stop responding if you have other programs overwriting your commands, especially those that are bundled with a keyboard brand.  I recommend going over our [Keyboard support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  Specifically, try resetting your config  in case your settings may have become corrupt:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\n\n I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Buddahbellii","date":"2017-01-15T03:57:57.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i still does it, it's so weird. like to get it to work again i need to make sure to left click before wanted to cast a spell and then it'll work again. i bought a new mouse and a keyboard to see if that was the problem but still nothing. i am just so confused and so annoyed and i am not sure where to go or what to do. i did what you suggested and even followed the steps riot suggests, but nothing. maybe i should take my computer to iworld or the geek squad? but that doesn't even make sure, cause other than this game everything works normally. but thanks a lot for giving a suggestion mate","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Izaterribles","date":"2017-01-14T17:45:09.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a similar issue. This appears to be a bug with hot corners and whatever change happened to the client. I.E. I had my bottom left hot corner \"show all applications\". This seemed to pull focus from the client in game and the keyboard wouldn't work. remove the corner and you are good to go.","replies":[]}]}
