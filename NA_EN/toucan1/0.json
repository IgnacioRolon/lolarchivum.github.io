After weeks of ranked anxiety I decide to try to win my last promo game, BUT NO, once again your shitty client decides to crash on me, but this time in champ select, which results in me losing my ranked series, for something that is completely out of my control. FIX YOUR FUCKING CLIENT ALREADY.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T01:37:39.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These types of issues especially crashes in champ select are often caused by an unstable connection to the servers. Because League has to sync tons of actions per second, it requires a particularly stable connection to prevent issues. Since this is often the result of network settings that conflict with League, I recommend working through our [network guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your settings are good.\n\nLet me know if this causes any change for you.","replies":[]}]}
