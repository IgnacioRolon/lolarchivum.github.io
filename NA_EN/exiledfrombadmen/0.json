I immediately transformed to spider form to go fast, but I thought I was in human form for quite a long time (1 min). Then, I realized that the spider form quotes were not being played, even laugh/joke/taunt ones. Instead of spider form quotes, human form quotes were playing. I was totally disappointed. Can you please fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T23:11:10.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey exiledFromBadmen! \n\nThanks for the report!
