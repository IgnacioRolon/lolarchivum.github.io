I think more polished, and smoother Emblems would fit better. They could still be hextech inspired with similar shapes as the current ones. Potentially having different colored magic, with each one having a respective crystal at the center?","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-09-06T20:33:26.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has there been any discussion internally regarding having a players ranked borders directly correlate with their current rank, instead of their past ranks?\n\nIe it gives more incentive to play rank knowing that as you improve your border will as well. Instead of just playing ranked in the last month to get your border and rewards and be set for the next year having a plat border while you're currently a silver.\n\nI know you're not responsible for that decision, could you direct me to whoever is working on that aspect of things ? Thanks bud","replies":[]}]}]}
