If you're on Wifi you will likely run through problems as well.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to the game server: 104.160.131.1.  Run it for about 5 minutes, replace the IP address with dashes on the first two rows only, and let me know what you find.  This will help us pinpoint if the issues here are being caused by packet loss or routing problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LEOkonami","date":"2017-12-27T16:08:01.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you had a chance to see this post? https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/PIEAhqwc-fps-drop-fix?show=new","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-23T14:53:41.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game works perfectly fine for me.
