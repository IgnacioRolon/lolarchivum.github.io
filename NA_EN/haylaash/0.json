How Mmr works while transfer ur account? I know that after trans. u need play 1 placement to get a rank, which is based on ur Mmr from the previous server. But still not sure. For example, If I have a S1 on the first server I can't get higer division on the second server after placement cuz my MMR doesn't allow? Or can I get higher rank, cuz my Mmr is pretty good (or if I will play placement with premade which have higher division than mine). No no, I'm not going to be boosted, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T23:22:43.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As our [**Account Transfer FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751924-Account-Transfer-FAQ) states:\n\n> \"You will be seeded into a Ranked League after you play 1 Ranked game on your new server. The seeding will be based on your current MMR in relation to the MMR of everyone on that server, so you could end up in a different Tier or Division compared to the League you were in on your original server.\n\n> If you ever decide to transfer back, please keep in mind that you will return to the rank you were at when you left the server, minus any LP decay that would have taken place if a significant amount of time has passed. Your standing is tracked independently on each server, so LP decay will only affect the Ranked standing of the account on the server you have NOT been playing on.\n\n> For more information on MMR decay, check out our [**Ranked Play FAQ.**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ)\"\n\nI hope this helps clear up the confusion, please let me know if you have any other questions I can answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Haylaash","date":"2017-01-10T15:58:09.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=mu1I2cxk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-09T23:22:43.686+0000)\nso you could end up in a different Tier or Division compared to the League you were in on your original server.\n\n\nI think that's all.
