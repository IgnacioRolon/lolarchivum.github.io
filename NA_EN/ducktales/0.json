Before even showing the loading screen. In order for me to get into the game then I have to wait till all other players are loaded into the game in which I can then reconnect. Has anyone else had this issue, Also before I am asking the graphics card I have is an nvidia geforce gtx 650 ti boost. Also I am sharing that graphics card with both monitors. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-01-06T21:46:44.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ducktales,\n\nThis happens generally due to out of date graphics drivers.
