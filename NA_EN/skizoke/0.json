I do not know how difficult it is for you to incorporate the rotating game mode with the Bots (Co-op vs AI) but for people such as myself who aren&#039;t a spring chicken anymore It is difficult to compete with the younger crowd.\r\n\r\nI will give a little background so you don&#039;t all think I am full of crap. I have been gaming since around 1980 and I was very good at it. When I was in my prime I was consistently among the top people who played in whatever game we were playing. This continued when I joined the Army. We didn&#039;t have (or more specifically use) the internet for gaming for about the first 8 years of my Army career. We did LAN parties as well as just playing on consoles together. I know it doesn&#039;t seem like a large pool of people to consider myself being good but within the Barracks or the Armored Unit I was in (70+ people) the majority of us played games. I understand that is no comparison to the millions of people playing together now. It is just the sample I had to compare back then.\r\n\r\nI was also among the best consistently when we went to the Tank Ranges for qualification. I even scored highest in division in 1997 on Tank Table VIII in Grafenwoehr, Germany. Well, I am no longer a spring chicken. I am in my upper 40&#039;s and my reflexes have slowed down a good bit. My best friend who I was stationed with in the Army at 3 different duty stations and a couple combat zones still play games together regularly is also in the same boat. We were both among the top in our units when we served and we both did extremely well at gaming. Now, in our regular 5 man team we have both of us oldies, his son, his nephew and a friend of theirs (all in their 20&#039;s.) and we consistently have to be carried.\r\n\r\nIt isn&#039;t that we don&#039;t understand the game but I am telling you your reflexes do slow down a decent amount. It isn&#039;t that we can&#039;t be competitive but it isn&#039;t easy when your enemy is reacting faster than you. Most of you reading this understand how important that is. We don&#039;t mind playing normal games but we usually limit it to ARAM. We were getting out laned Summoners rift so bad during last hitting that we were a detriment to our team.\r\n\r\nSo, that brings me back to my original point. Is it possible to make it so all of these rotating game modes can be enjoyed by the people who prefer co-op or just feel like playing it at that time. Forcing us to play against real people to enjoy something different isn&#039;t making me want to play it a ton. Alot of younger kids are just plain rude and don&#039;t understand not everyone is a master of this game.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"destiny fan","date":"2016-04-29T03:43:29.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully agree with this idea, altough i don't really use the bots a lot of people could benefit from this, some players just don't want to go trough the stress of a pvp game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerolera","date":"2016-04-28T21:16:29.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The main issue with that idea is that it defeats the purpose of the game.

All I am asking is can't we be included in the rotating game modes like the people who wish to play PvP. There is obviously thousands of people who enjoy Co-op vs AI so why not include it in the game mode as well?\n\nI am hoping a dev will reply to this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-04-28T21:11:39.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They should implement an adult swim policy where no whippersnappers can play from 4-5.","replies":[]}]}
