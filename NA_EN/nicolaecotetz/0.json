It may have prompted access to scan your game files, but I'm not familiar about a cmd prompt.  It's really important to make sure you have downloaded League from the proper page.  If you are still having issues, fill out a[ patcher issues form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230673527) to our client devs then use the legacy client for now:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
