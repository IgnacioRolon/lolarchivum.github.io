It looks like you were marked as afk in this game so you woudn't receive XP for the end of the match.  It's interesting, though, because you did still receive your First Win of the Day mission for it because your team won.  I'm not sure if that's intended, but I hope that clears things up.","replies":[{"poster":"siltn","date":"2017-11-19T20:42:00.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my games can start \nthe que works fine but when the games needs to start it becomes a black screen its now like this for three days i reinstalled lol twice and updated my mac waht can i do now i wont be able to get ZoÃ« when she comes out. the bugg is also on pbe","replies":[]}]}]}
