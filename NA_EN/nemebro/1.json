The VO of the champs and their interactions/comments with each other were one of the few places lore shone consistently, so to hear Riot is trying to reel it in is a little sad. \n\nNot to say they all have to be super talkative (Rek Sai sounds cool as heck and if Rammus ever gets 50 voice lines you did something wrong) but in general more is better, even if they almost never play in game you know day 1 I watch the new/upadated champ's voice lines, cause I love it and want more, not less of it.\n\nNow putting my feelings on that aside, what I feel about THIS champ in particular is that you say he doesn't care about others, and the VO does a really good job of showing him as the paranoid, distrustful, revenge killer he is. But than you have this duality of him also being a support that works with others, you have some lines it there like when he gets kill 1v1 \"I needed a crew\" or some such, and then you have some allied taunts about how their on the bottom of the list. But to me the best lines are when hes sharing the kill gold. I wish you put more emphasis on it, he made it sound like business but I imagine working with anyone in his state is a big deal.  \n\n(you can ignore this paragraph if you want cause now its just me inserting stuff between the lines) This is where my head canon comes in to fix it, I say to myself \"Pyke's hurt, and he's angry but he still wants to trust SOMEBODY.\" and just as everykill drowns him deeper, I think he finds breath with every helping hand.\n\nThanks for the champ and don't let up on the VO in future please","replies":[]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2018-05-17T01:21:13.110+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5o6q4r5w,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-05-17T01:10:38.918+0000)\n>\n> Hey!

Ornn has like 2 people he talks to, and he hates them both. It was weird for Pyke to rise above his psychosis to recognize other champs aside from \"you look like a captain\". I bet he says that to everyone. He does.

It has something to do about  real diffrences, that we realy have diffrent personalaties. And yes, quite people are also personalaties.
