So I went to look at what was going on and went to check my account information.  I find out that my account email has been changed(for some reason password wasn't).  \r\n\r\nI submit tickets after tickets only to get automated responses to resubmit the tickets over and over.  \r\n\r\nHello Summoner,\r\n\r\nThank you for filling out this information. However, there appears to be an issue with this ticket. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you to submit a new ticket through the Support website here, afterwards selecting â€œI need help recovering my account.\"\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\nRiver\r\nRiot Games Account &amp; Billing Support\r\n\r\n\r\nThis isn't the biggest deal since I can still login to my account and I figure it'll get through eventually.\r\nThen this morning I get a message saying that I've been perma banned?  So obviously I can't even look at the reasons for the ban since the account email was changed and in no way have I done anything to even warrant a ban such as being toxic, leaving games, afk or anything either so my only conclusion is that the guy who hacked my account did something?\r\n\r\nSo now I'm actually pretty upset that there is absolutely 0 ways to contact a support rep directly through phone or live chat and that this support ticket nonsense has continuously been having glitches/bugs.\r\n\r\nWould very much appreciate a response from someone from riot.  Thank You","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-02-23T23:38:39.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once they find out that an account has been compromised the procedure is to \"permanently ban\" the account until the proper owner is in full control of the account again after contacting riot support.  You're in good hands.  If you submit a recovery form ticket in the way _Targons Blade_ suggested they'll help you out^^\nTry to answer every question you can as best you can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T23:23:07.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What River was trying to have you do was to submit a support ticket using our recovery form, without being logged in, since recovery tickets cannot be submitted while being logged into the Riot Support site. It's easier to do this from a \"Private\" or \"Incognito\" tab, as it ensure you won't be logged in. Once you have a private tab open, submit a ticket using [**this form**](http://riot.com/2iGnX0K) to ensure it goes to our recovery team. A specialist will reach back out to sort your account with you, after we've confirmed you're the account owner.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues submitting your ticket.","replies":[]}]}
