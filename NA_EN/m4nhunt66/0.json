Champions and reworks almost always needs to be released overtuned so they don't feel like complete shit while everyone is learning them. Release them weak or even balanced on release and people will suck ass at them and put Riot in a very unenviable position: Intentionally overbuff the champion to incentivize people to play and learn them and then nerf later on down the line or simply let the champion fade into irrelevance. They typically tend towards the former; Yasuo, Kalista, and Tahm are the best examples of this the last 2 years. But they've also opted for the second on occasion, with Illaoi being the best example.

Perfect plays from either of them would have resulted in a different outcome, I'm assuming. \n\n\nIdk everyone cries for Sion buffs then there was the one time I spammed him top lane for a week straight and was wrecking 90% of my lane opponents ( i even fucked up a bad vayne) with his absurd base damages (I run armor pen in him somewhere, I swear it helps or its just a waste and I'm a scrub) and strong control. My only problem with him is the complete team reliance I required late game. my damage falls off (as it should) later game and I rely on my teammates to follow up on the charge, or to follow up on my Q. \n\nSo you can only imagine how a Silver Sion(Although i've never tried him in ranked, I might be going against players of various brackets in a normal, seems to happen a lot) had trouble in fights. I rarely if ever found myself thinking, \"Wow, this guy is weak.\" mostly because I had just finished wrecking my lane with little for my opponent to retaliate with. But the teamfights...its not like a buff would have even helped, it would have broke him. Sion required too much reliance from teammates who's whole mentality is \"carry carry carry fk my team\"...\n\nSo what I'm basically getting at is I can see how you think Sion's bad, but he's really not. He does his job fine, and well. He isn't lacking in the damage department (if you're worried about his late game damage, don't. His peel and CC is legendary when it lands and your carries focus on the damage while you protect them and get eaten alive.) or the tankiness department (the Mofo gets free HP)..\n\nSo I'm wondering, the players who claim Sion to be trash...Did you try him one game, fail, and then just give up? He's an amazing champion, and IMO he's completely balanced. Just a shame I main Yasuo(too fun!).. otherwise, I'd probably play a lot more top lane Sion.","replies":[]}]}
