I click \"Launch\" and nothing happens. The screen goes down and a loading icon next to my mouse cursor starts for a few seconds then stops. The sign in screen to log in won't pop up. This has been happening for a while now. Some days it will work fine and I will be brought to the next screen but majority of the time it won't bring me to the log in screen. \r\nOne thing I've noticed is that when I hit launch, even if the login screen doesn't pop up, if I try to launch League again it will say there is another process running as if its still running. Please help Rito....","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T18:39:49.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you Launch, the client needs permission to open but is being blocked.
