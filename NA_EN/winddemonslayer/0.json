The only way you can beat him is if it's your entire team, his only counter.\n\nI literally just played a game vs a Nasus who had 70 cs and 46 stacks at 15 minutes, I didn't let that piece of shit get a single fucking minion, every time I poked him down to low health, he just runs under tower and starts auto attacking and because of his bullshit fucking lifesteal, and pathetic mana costs, he can literally stay in lane forever...

He has a lot counterplay, but the problem is that Nasus buys full tank items (tank items are superior to damage items in terms of cost) because he can do it. At some point he will outsustain your damage, and this is reverse point in lanephase as he can start to make stacks for real.\n\nYou are unable to deny him from getting stacks after his 2-3 tank items, and you are unable to solo him in lategame unless you play Vayne of Kogmaw","replies":[]},{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2017-10-01T00:42:13.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol his early game is so easily abusable. The only thing you have to do is freeze the lane in front of your tower and watch him cry\n\nOh and if he maxes E to break your freeze he's losing a lot of damage mid game, giving you even more time to abuse him.\n\nYou can also slow push, get 2-3 waves crashing on his tower, then roam mid/bot. Getting other lanes ahead can fuck him hard, he doesn't have any mobility. He could have 1K stacks, if he's never in range of anyone, he's useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WindDemonSlayer","date":"2017-10-01T00:32:59.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean let's talk about the ult buff for a minute.
