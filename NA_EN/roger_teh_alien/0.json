It was so small and I couldn&#039;t even read half of what Brand said. Idk it just felt strenuous on my eyes. I really had to take my time  instead of reading really fast from excitement y&#039;know?\n\n(edit) I also have 20/20 vision so I can only imagine how hard it must be for people who wear glasses.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Astryx","date":"2018-07-26T15:56:35.878+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya!\n\nThank you for the feedback - we are looking into ways that we could improve the reading experience for desktop in particular on Universe.

Once you make it to the end of the page or view panels that are much larger it zooms out. \n\nI know Overwatch's comics do something like this too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AwesomeWarrior94","date":"2018-07-25T23:50:21.211+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is easier to read on mobile","replies":[]},{"poster":"NekoniClaws","date":"2018-07-26T10:09:16.130+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was kind of small still on my 15 inch monitor.
