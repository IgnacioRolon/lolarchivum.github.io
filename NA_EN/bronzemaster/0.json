This is worse than when jayce was one shotting people every 5sec. 35% of max hp + 190 at a max level team fight. This is literally another ulti for anyone who uses it. 35% + 190 =  1590 hp shield for 4sec on an average tank build which has 4000 max hp. That is absolutely disgusting and is broken for any champ who has any hard cc. Even on a fizz who has &quot;hard&quot; cc on his ulti then gains a 700 hp shield for when he dives in? Or a renekton that gets a 1k hp shield to dive in with his ulti and his pretty good base lifesteal? This mastery has to be fixed, I&#039;ve never seen one person think it&#039;s a healthy mastery unless they&#039;re the ones using it.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2016-11-12T20:54:00.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with op.\n\nIt shouldn't scale off champs nearby. it should just be a flat 10% max hp, regardless of how many nearby enemy champs there are.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2016-11-12T21:34:59.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JhomasTefferson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jUW4oEbi,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-12T20:54:00.343+0000)\n>\n> I agree with op.\n> \n> It shouldn&#x27;t scale off champs nearby. it should just be a flat 10% max hp, regardless of how many nearby enemy champs there are.\n\nThen they should Increase the base a little and decrease the CD of it. Personally, I feel that it's completely fine and doesn't need any changes. It has a long CD and honestly is needed for some tanks because of the amount of Damage this game has now. This mastery actually makes you feel like a tank for once again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-11-12T20:15:21.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your math is for a 5 man cc.
