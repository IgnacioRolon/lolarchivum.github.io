I have tried everything I could find on the forums, reinstalled LoL entirely, reinstalled my mouse drivers and still nothing.  The old suggestions of turning on the tailing of the mouse and everything did not produce any results.

For example, could you potentially click on something?  I wonder if you are using any third party programs like overlays, as they can cause issues like this.
