I knew it was the priority queue sign, and I waited out the time and played the game. \r\n\r\nAfter the game, I queued up MYSELF (without my friend who had it), and the red triangle was still there. Is this just an unfortunate bug? Or is this a legit thing riot has in place?\r\n\r\nI looked at someone else's post (the link above), and a riot employee said that basically, this shouldn't happen so it might be a bug. So is there any way to fix it for me or do I have to wait out the games?\r\n\r\nAny possible answers to my question are appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-29T20:40:46.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyy that was me in the post your referenced ^_^!\n\nThis should just be a visual bug.
