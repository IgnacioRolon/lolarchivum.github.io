Makes it very confusing. \r\n\r\nForgot to make screens of it, but i&#039;ll try to get some soon.\r\n\r\nBasicly how to check this bug is play as Slayer Jinx and auto attack a minion. You&#039;ll see when the AutoAttack on the minion stays a bit longer than needed.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T21:32:58.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ITamotsu! \n\nThanks for the report!
