However, for the longest time I have been annoyed about the inconsistency of his ult (Phaco). If his lore is to create a copy of himself to use as a distraction, why is it so easy to tell the difference? Phaco can trigger on hit effects from items like {{item:3087}} and {{item:3074}}, so why is it wrong for him to to carry red and blue buff. By now most players have accepted {{champion:35}}  as a jungler, so why does Phaco discourage having buffs that are mandatory to succeed in that role? Well up until this point I have accepted these facts and just tried to be wise about using Phaco while having red or blue buff and I&#039;ve managed pretty well. Now here lies the problem at hand. Junglers are  encouraged to maintain dragon control. With the new dragon buffs, {{champion:35}} has been auto-nerfed. Now if {{champion:35}}&#039;s team has a single dragon, Phaco loses it&#039;s lore. For the rest of the game {{champion:35}} will have a reddish orange glow to him and Phaco will not, as well as an icon if you target him. Do you ever plan on making {{champion:35}} a {{champion:254}}able champion again? or is he doom to be cast aside as we move into the future of league? This argument is meant to include {{champion:62}} and {{champion:7}} and mostly concerns the fact that dragon never goes away.","replies":[{"poster":"ThePlasticSpork","date":"2015-03-26T12:51:12.118+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Shaco's not getting any huge buffs until he loses his rather absurd blink/stealth on a single button. \n\nIt would't surprise me if Shaco's just up for a rework.

Shaco just doesn't have too much damage early game, he's squishy and seemingly relies entirely on his boxes for even jungling until mid - late game.\n\nShaco does become a major threat mid - late game to any squishy people when he has items built up, being able to spam stealth + E makes it really difficult to fight him especially with his ultimate.\n\nHe's obnoxious, I would know I played him a lot but usually AD Shaco can be shutdown early - mid game most of the time if played right. Shaco Mains are really scary though because they'll always end up using their passive against you and know how to gank the best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alley Way Creep","date":"2015-03-27T12:23:26.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThePlasticSpork,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yKEKgRsb,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-03-26T12:51:12.118+0000)\n>\n> Shaco's not getting any huge buffs until he loses his rather absurd blink/stealth on a single button. \n> \n> It would't surprise me if Shaco's just up for a rework.

It is hard enough that he can make a 1v1 into a 2v1, but atleast if he has buffs then you have a chance at winning. I will agree with Phaco having the dragon icon and glow to him, but for red and blue I think it is fine for him not to have it.\n\nAlso if you want Phaco to have it then I assume you wish for Leblanc and wukong's clones to have the buff icon's  when they appear?
