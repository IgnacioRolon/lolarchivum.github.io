Recently League Of Legends has been making my computer randomly crash mid game. I've tried everything I can think of to fix the issue. I've reinstalled the game, checked all drivers, disabled DVR on the XBOX app, ran the game in previous compatibility, downloaded MSI afterburner tweaked settings, downloaded DDU to make sure all old drivers were gone. I just don't know what else to do anymore. The crash is super random, sometimes I can play a game or two with no issues, and other times I may crash 8 minutes into a game or 40 minutes into a game. The crash goes to a black screen, and the music will still play for a few seconds and then stop.. At that point the only thing I can do is hit the power button. Is this an issue with windows 10? I've been running this computer for a year now and never had any issues until about 3 weeks ago. My specs are as follows...\r\n\r\nPS: This is the only game I have issues with... I play everything else (Overwatch, PUBG, Destiny 2) with ZERO issues..\r\n \r\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Home build  version 10.0.1.14393\r\nProcessor\tIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-6402P CPU @ 2.80GHz, 2801 Mhz, 4 Core(s)\r\nInstalled Physical Memory (RAM)\t8.00 GB\r\nDisplay\tNVIDIA GeForce GTX 960","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T17:19:17.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first assumption here would have been the xbox bar, but it looks like you have that covered.
