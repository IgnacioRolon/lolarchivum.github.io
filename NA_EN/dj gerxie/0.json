I have enjoyed using it for many games but, I was disapointed when I attempted to use it for League of Legends. League of Legends supports the resolution but, when I switch to it, the scaling for many objects in the game is to small. This forces me to play with a lower resolution as well as fullscreen mode. Will this game be updated with full support for 4K displays in the near future?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T17:35:57.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running 4K or resolutions exceeding 1920x1080 can cause some issues, especially with icons and huds.  Your best bet would be to reduce your resolution or swap monitors to see if that will do the trick.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Gerxie","date":"2017-01-18T04:57:24.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for responding! I did end up solving the issue by switching to a 2k HD resolution instead. I hope in the future this feature is added so i can play the game in my monitors native resolution.","replies":[]}]}]}
