I was playing in a tournament and my championselection bugged, so I couldn't see the champions that were picked and banned. So I restarted my client and it went away. But since I restarted my client because of the bug, I have had inconsident ping and FPS. My FPS is set to be 60 and is going from 20-200, my ping is normally between 29-33 and is now sometimes up to 500. It comes in periods, but it's somehow always there in the beginning of a match, and then continuing to come and go. I've reinstalled League of legends. I've restored all settings to default and I've downloaded the hextech repair tool(and tried repairing the client before downloading HRT), but nothing helps. I've previously been having problems with the hextech bug. The weird thing is, that it only happens in League of legends and not any other games, can anyone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T21:43:20.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be having a series of problems here that will need to sort individually, I think.  A lot of issues, like in champion select, can be caused by third party programs that aren't interacting well with League.  If you have any running like play.tv, remove them as your first step.  The hextech repair tool is a good utility, but it's a companion for our guides when it comes down to it.  For your FPS, you may have outdated driver or hardware issues.  I suggest using our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to help troubleshoot this.\n\nRegarding your ping, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these games to get an overview of what's happening.  The results will also provide steps specific to your issue.\n\nHopefully, all of this will get you back and running!","replies":[]}]}
