So they follow the jungler and pick up some gold and experience (usually 1-3 minions worth) before the lane hits the tower. Once it hits the tower they are usually safe to farm the wave.\n\nI say usually safe because Jungler and other top laner can come in for a dive, or any number of other things can happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2015-03-21T13:59:23.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the bot lane is weak compared to the opponents, they will try to lane swap\n\nAs for the jungle thing, if it is someone like a hecarim, he isnt gonna get anything against say a graves annie lane, so he just soaks up some xp in the jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight Viony","date":"2015-03-18T14:00:37.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They swap so one can try to get an advantage.
