This is because a VPN will forcefully reroute your connection to the server, avoiding problematic routes if you were having issues before. To investigate further, I recommend disabling your VPN, then running a set of traceroutes. You can do this by running [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net) for 5 minutes with the IP address 104.160.131.1\n\nAfter it's run for 5 minutes, export the results as Text, then attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). One of our tech specialists will be able to take a look at it and let you know where the issues are along your route. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
