Riot rework champions slower than they release new &quot;Lore&quot; content, meanwhile every new champion is beyond fun to play because he is overloaded with options, unlike Boring one trick Pony Annie. is it any wonder so many noobs Yasuo are out there?, who wants to play a boring champion?.\r\n\r\nRiot: &quot;we didn&#039;t want vision to counter stealth champions Kit&quot;\r\n\r\nmeanwhile a single upgraded Sweeper clears half the River side from Teemo shrooms. Hell it&#039;s so lazy no one even needs to attack them to remove them, they are disabled so you could just run over them like they&#039;re not even there.\r\n\r\n&quot;but you can play Teemo as an Hybrid fighter&quot;\r\nwell in that case, why not take a real fighter?\r\n\r\nRiot won&#039;t balance Teemo or Urgot for the same reason, anything under Gold is broken (no one even buys sweepers). everything above gold is useless garbage, considered as trolling.\r\n\r\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/3a/44/49/3a44496760026616721343221762f781.jpg","replies":[]}
