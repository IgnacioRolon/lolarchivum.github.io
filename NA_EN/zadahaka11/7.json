(that for some reason works only for the ps4, and not the ps3). \n\nConsoles have lower fps and they will never reach even medium pc visual graphics, for an easy to play without spending to much money, they sure work worse than a computer. i&#039;m not saying consoles are for stupid people who can&#039;t manage a computer, but.. come on.. and ofc im angry, I need to buy a freaking stupid ass console every year, just to play a new game I liked.\n\nthank god for games that come to pc after a few years, gives me hope. **one day some guy will invent a full working console mirror for everything on a pc, then we will see who&#039;s the asshole.**\n\nhttp://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/839/839988.png","replies":[]}
