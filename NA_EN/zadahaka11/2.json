I&#039;ve seen most of them, read about them, seen pictures, and spoken to people all over the world (like i&#039;m doing right now).\r\n\r\nthe more you know, the smaller the world seems, and the less mystery there is for you. most kids these days google nsfw, instead of dreaming about seeing the world as soon as they can. if they go somewhere it will be to smoke after school or whatever, because that&#039;s how teens these days.\r\n\r\nthere is hardly any mystery left, if you were born in a shit hole, your skills would be recognized by everyone, because they would not know anyone else like you. &quot;he is the best whatever in the Town!!&quot;, and people would remember you for years. it would have been a small achievement, but these days most people have goals like starting a family and having a high paying job, which a shitty goal. it&#039;s a smart one, it&#039;s just shitty overall, we have no more amazing dreams, because we found out we will never be a good video game player. because there&#039;s always a Korean kid who is better..\r\n\r\nhttps://aotw-pd.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/media_retina/s3/megan-fox.jpg?itok=QgWkzmGT","replies":[]}
