I got so pissed off I called the cops, but the assholes laughed, asked if I have anything else to report, and just hang up the phone. the fence isn&#039;t high enough because the trees are tall, and making them any higher is probably against the law.\r\n\r\nwhat am I supposed to do?, if the cops won&#039;t help all is left is beat the crap out of him, and then he calls the cops and they will probably arrest me. what good is the police if that&#039;s how it works?. isn&#039;t that actually stealing from my property?, can&#039;t I sue him or something?. Hell that might cost me more money than it&#039;s worth..","replies":[]}
