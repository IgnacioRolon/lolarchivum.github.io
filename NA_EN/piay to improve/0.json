Also, I had a really hard time finding any joy on Google. It doesn&#039;t help that only 3% of the Players in My Area use Nvidia&#039;s ISP\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/P9dYR0M.png\n\nMore Stats\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ulPW2c9.png\n\nAny help would be much Appreciated, Thanks!\n\nAfter much reseach I've found that with Nvidia Shield you can play League of Legends on a VM, and this may be where this data is coming from. But, an expert answer would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"target1","date":"2018-12-24T22:50:20.965+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, Play to Improve!\n\nI work at Riot and specifically support the Lag Report service.  We appreciate your bringing this to our attention.  \n\nWith the data we use to build the Lag Report there are tens of thousands of ISPs listed from all around the world.  Within this list are commercial ISPs, public & semi-public organizations, and private companies.  Our intention is to only make visible the ISPs which are generally available to players.   So we try to mark private companies as private and remove them from the ISP list we show to players.\n\nIn this particular case, as you discovered, Nvidia Corp is not a public ISP, rather it is the graphics card company.  The data you saw was most likely for their employees and guests playing League of Legends on their corporate network.  Which is not too surprising as they need to test and evaluate their product performance with the games people commonly play.\n\nThere certainly is the possibility some of this activity is from their Nvidia Shield service, but while the network performance improvement from their data center to our data center would be more optimal, you still have to connect to their service through your ISP.  The Lag Report would not show this as part of the full experience.  Your best experience is generally found playing League on your personal computer.\n\nI have made changes so Nvidia will no longer be presented as one of the available ISPs in your area.  It is very likely the 'Nobis Tech Group' is another private company, but with thousands of different companies to check it is hard to make a definitive determination for every entry in the list.\n\nThe majority of players in your area play on CenturyLink and Cox.  CenturyLink is an ISP which may not be providing residential service in your area, but rather providing business access to companies and schools.  The big performance difference between the two ISPs is the amount of packet loss players on Cox experience.  \n\nOn average players in Pheonix are experiencing 0.76% packet loss on Cox which can impact your LoL experience.  If switching to CenturyLink is not an option, I would suggest exploring why your latency is more than 10 ms. higher than the average connection in Pheonix as well as why Cox has so much packet loss.  We have some tips on things to look at under the \"What can I do?\" section of the Lag Report.  In general, you will have to work directly with Cox to explore this as well as look at how your ISP connection is set up in your home.  You might try playing league from neighbors homes in your area and see if everyone has the same sort of packet loss and latency profiles.\n\nI hope this helps.\ntarget1","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-12-25T12:21:11.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=target1,realm=NA,application-id=okOuNvuT,discussion-id=dte7l5Rm,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-12-24T22:50:20.965+0000)\n>\n> Hi, Play to Improve!\n> \n> I work at Riot and specifically support the Lag Report service.

All that doesn't really matter because getting access to someone higher then basic troubleshooting will be impossible really.\n\nOnly real option is exploring other ISP options and purchasing VM that changes your routing(example being pingzapper)","replies":[{"poster":"target1","date":"2019-01-11T01:12:15.269+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Malix,\n\nI completely get what you are saying.  Our goal is to empower players using data about their connection quality and that of others in their area to have confidence their connection quality is good, or if it is not, to help figure out how to improve it.\n\nArmed with data we hope players have a fighting chance to convince ISPs to listen to their concerns, but also to prompt players to investigate their home network setups too.  We know of a few ISPs who have made changes to improve player's connection quality based on data we have provided, and we know of a number of players who have switched off of poor wifi setups to either cabled ethernet or better wifi connections that have been able to improve their network connections.  \n\nCurious to know, since you work at an ISP, what we might do to get the attention of ISP's internal network teams to suboptimal conditions their subscribers' experience.  I am more than familiar with the standard troubleshooting that is done with end users.  Some of it is pretty good, and some providers are not that awesome.\n\nWe also peer with last mile ISPs globally across a range of Internet Exchanges and Points of Presence (POPs) to help reduce the amount of time a players network traffic is not under our direct care.  (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210665503-NA-Peering-Partners &amp; https://www.peeringdb.com/net/5918) \n\nConvincing an ISP's first tier support team there is an issue beyond normal troubleshooting steps can be hard.  Yet as you point out, players can in some cases vote with their feet and switch to a different (hopefully better) provider.   But sometimes this is not even an option.\n\nIs there additional information you would suggest we provide, or could we be doing something else to help players in this area?\n\nIn the particular case above, you have a player who's network performance metrics are a couple steps below the average player in his/her area.  My assessment based on the limited information provided is this is not a core network issue an internal network team would need to address, rather it appears to be a last-mile or home network issue.\n\nThe first thing this player needs to do is explore if this is the case.  The ISP should be able to test the connection to the player's router and make sure the router is functioning properly.  Even if functioning properly, if it is old, or has been hacked it might be operating suboptimally.  The same could be true of the player's computer, so that might be the source of the issue.   All of these things are real options the player can directly have checked and tested.  \n\nMy personal suggestion to players is to take your computer to someone else's house/location and see if the issues you are seeing follow you.  Compare your results with a friends.  If the results are different, try to figure out why.  If they are not, maybe try a third location using a different ISP provider.  If the common thread is the ISP in a particular location use that information to work with the ISP to investigate further.  \n\nIf that is too much trouble, have a friend bring their computer to your house and see if they have the same experience as you.  This will help confirm the issue is with your home network setup.  \n\nDivide and conquer is the rule of the day here.   Sometimes it is as simple as a bad Ethernet cable.  Some ISPs even have field crews who will come to your house and check to make sure your network is working up to spec. All of this should be done before considering switching to another provider or using various network optimization solutions.  \n\nTroubleshooting last mile connection issues, especially if they are intermittent, is not the easiest thing to work on.  \n\nThe player reports below they have started using Haste, which has shaved a few milliseconds off the latency.  I will be asking them to take a look at the last 7-day view in the Lag Report and see if they are seeing a drop in their packet loss and jitter.   Latency is an important factor in the quality of your network connection, but packet loss and jitter are the more impactful elements of a good network connection/experience.  These values are ideally zero, but even a small amount of jitter or packet loss can make a player's in-game experience less than ideal.  More commonly known as LAG!\n\nWow, that was a long post...\ntarget1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-12-24T23:08:52.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=target1,realm=NA,application-id=okOuNvuT,discussion-id=dte7l5Rm,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-12-24T22:50:20.965+0000)\n>\n\nZyra support main I see.

I'm guessing your ping would increase by at least 30ms, probably even more.","replies":[{"poster":"target1","date":"2019-01-11T01:26:28.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Myrmiron, \n\nCompletely agree with you.  Just note the added latency you mentioned would not be reflected in the Lag Report because we are measuring from the computer that the game is running on back to our servers.  So if you played on a cloud gaming platform don't trust the Lag Report's metrics, as the connection to the player's device is not reflected. \n\ntarget1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PIay To Improve","date":"2018-12-29T09:56:44.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the responses, I've started using Haste Network Optimizer.

I would be curious to see is how this impacted your packet loss and jitter values.  These two elements will impact the quality of the connection more than latency does.  Maybe you can post up a screenshot of the 7-day view of your Lag Report score now that you are using Haste.  I would be interested to see how your packet loss value has changed or not.\n\nI would also suggest you look at my post to Malix above.  The average latency value in Pheonix for Cox is 55 ms. so even at 63 ms. there is still a question of why you are not close to the average for Pheonix.  It could be you live somewhere that is just further away, but if you were able to test at a friends house who also has Cox this would be a way to figure out if it could be better.\n\ntarget1","replies":[]}]}]}
