Just not playing it altogether? One day, you uninstall. But you go to somewhere like Instagram and you see a nice, flashy skin on your explore and you reinstall league in no hesitation.

If you dont want to uninstall League, just hide the game in some dark faraway folder and find something else to do.\n\nThen begin avoiding everything related to League.

If your friends play League and they bring it up, change subject asap. \n\nThe main reason I quit League is because I lost interest, the games were getting repetitive and stale and so on. In the first few weeks it was hard but in a month or two you will forget this game even exists.\n\nI recently went back to League to just check it out. But even though I enjoyed Odyssey:Extraction a lot, normal SR games felt dull and I definetly can say that I dont enjoy League as good as before.\n\nI also started playing DoTa recently(dont call me an apostate)and I'm not one of those people who promotes HoTs at every Youtube section, but League, for some of us has begun feeling less enjoyable and this method to quit, if done right, will work on anyone all the time.\n\n\nPS:I don't play F****ite.

Especially if it's ruining what you do outside of the game, stay mentally healthy and just cold turkey stop. (Saying this as I grind towards lvl 168 lmao) but in all seriousness a game is always a distraction and while fun, should not be the most important thing in your life. If you can't dead turkey stop, then find some good friends on league and schedule your time so you are more hanging with them, maybe even irl than just playing by yourself","replies":[]},{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2018-10-10T23:12:58.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still struggling to find an online multiplayer game that is free to play, AND can be run on a computer with poor graphics\n\nLeague (and Battlerite) are the only games I have found that fit this description\n\nAny recommendations?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2018-10-10T20:16:02.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thinking about the negativity embraced by Riot deleting Aatrox makes me want to quit","replies":[]},{"poster":"xxx6Wizard9xxx","date":"2018-10-10T15:33:58.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol used to by only game.
