I main Taliyah and have some questions and comments:\n\nQuestions:\n1) What does she weave?\n2) What does she surf?\n3) Does she have a pet?\n\nComments:\nTaliyah has a distinct look, and while it has room for variety, some details should be consistent.  First, her figure should be boyish, with narrower hips, a wider waist, and a flatter chest than she has in your concept sketch.  Second, her clothing should be thick enough to protect her from the bad weather and weaving debris inherent to her life of surfing around Valoran.  Third, you missed some characteristic elements of her character: her outfit should have two layers, along with a mantle and elemental coat tails.  Last, she looks a couple years too young.\n\nAlso, the tone and style of the image are inconsistent with her character.  Striking a fun pose with a big smile in a pretty dress is not quite her style.  Her powers terrified her when she was little, and she kept them secret.  Noxus tricked her with promises of learning and told her to bury a sleeping village or drown.  She has watched and helped Yasuo kill men with his sword.  She also had to return from her training early to confront what she had thought were just scary characters from her bedtime stories.  She’s only 16 and still has no idea of where her tribe is.\n\nMaybe if she had been born ordinary, were attending a dance festival with her friends, and knew her crush were there, would we see her as in your picture.  Indeed, I somewhat wish that she could be as happy and carefree as you made her look; for despite her struggles, her lines and lore reveal her irrepressible joy, energy, and humor.  Her original outfit represents this with an Ionian robe around a Shuriman shirt and leggings.  The mantle of stone on her shoulders, likewise, symbolizes the burdens she carries, in her adventures and heart.\n\nFor inspiration if you make any changes to your drawing or any other Taliyah skins, I recommend the song _I’m Still Here_, by John Rzenik.  She says the hook of the chorus to herself when you play her, and I imagine that the reference is intentional because the song is loaded with parallels to her story.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Huel7ftd6wM","replies":[{"poster":"Capi974","date":"2018-01-25T23:34:20.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow! Now that's a feedback! Thanks for everything i'm taking notes! First of all i wanted to go completely freestyle with that \"fan art\". Since at first i was really trying to fit the Taliyah's specs/tropes and things. But it was very hard, i was struggling a lot with the character. Then I just dropped everything and did a freestyle drawing without thinking about anything, just doing my stuff and that's how i came with the 2nd picture. And then i started reading the Riot Game's post about Taliyah concept art and I realised a lot of things you said. Since I didnt really do it as it would be released as a skin, I just went totally freestyle on it. But as I said, i'm taking notes, and everything you said is very interesting, i'll try to work on the concept later on. \n\nFor the questions, there is so much possibility. She can surf on a dragon's head made of jade, a koi karp, she can throw jade rocks, jade knives/kunai or whatever. She could have a dragon flying with her, she can ride a giant dragon made of jade when she R, or she can ride a big chinese wall kind of thing. I haven't really done anything about it yet, just smashing ideas on my sketchbook.\n\nThanks for everything you're awesome! <3","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-01-26T05:14:09.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Capi974,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pnYBVUcA,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2018-01-25T23:34:20.367+0000)\n>\n> Wow!
