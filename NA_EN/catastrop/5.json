It gives the same AD as any other top tier item, 10% lifesteal, and 10% CDR. That doesnt mean i think its a great item on say graves, vayne or jinx, b\\c they dont exactly NEED mana sustain at all really. But for say Ezreal....i build it first on him every time, then go into triforce. Every time i try to build triforce on Ez first, it goes horribly, but when i build ER first im able to hold my own in laning phase. B\\c any half decent player knows the way to counter Ez in laning phase is to just stand in the minion wave, and make it impossible for him to land Q's. This is why i build ER...it allows me to auto attack my opponent for dmg if he stands in the wave, plus it adds a solid amount of dmg to his Q, whereas trifoce only makes your Q stronger and not your autos. As for Lucian (i play him like an AD Caster) i also like ER b\\c i always build CDR boots on him. So if you get ER, CDR boots, and a Yomuus youve got 35% CDR. On certain champs i think its an awesome item, others its almost pointless. As for varus...i would go with manamune on him just b\\c it'll equate to more dmg later in game","replies":[{"poster":"Ang3LCrVzY","date":"2017-09-29T22:50:49.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree with this. When I go crit on Ez, I get ER first always, and finish TriForce 2nd or 3rd.\n\nAs for other ADCs, I usually get ER for the CDR which is pretty useful, since i play a lot of them like AD casters and tend to run outta mana early game or if i don't recall for an extended period of time - especially on Luci and Var.\n\nMuramana on Varus could work in theory... I've never tried it though.\n\nRight now, I just get ER because of the CDR and mana regen, and the damage ain't bad either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Agidyne","date":"2015-08-01T12:56:39.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really.\n\nwayyy to situational to be useful.\n\ngetting a tear -> muramana is superior in every way.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-08-01T15:52:26.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tear -> Manamune is superior early, but Muramana actually makes the mana issue worse, if you wanna use it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-08-01T15:42:07.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only Ez and Lucian like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-08-01T13:00:18.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, probably. Any AD that uses a lot of mana can do good with ER. The real problem is getting there. Mana mana hungry champs get way too far behind due to mana constraints, and usually get an early tear, into Muranamana. \n\nBut if you can get it to work, it's good. You combined your primary mana item with life steal, and it has plenty of AD to boot.","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-08-01T13:03:30.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh that gives me some hope for this item.

I really like it and it's sad that it doesn't see more use.\n\nI think it might be a tough item to balance. First iteration of ER was completely slot inefficient. After they made it build out of B.F. Sword though, it became tougher to even first build it, which is what people would have wanted to remove their mana problem. (and it's quite good at fixing that.) I recalled riot experimenting with a component item called \"soul sickle,\" but they seem to think that having casters actually fix their mana problems early on with a LS item, made them oppressive, and scrapped the project. So it seem like they don't want to fix early game mana problems with it, but other mana problems latter in the game.\n\nPersonally, I think of it as a transitional item from Carry to caster. Take Ez for example. He has two primary ADC builds (not including blue build.) A poke caster oriented build with Tear into Manamune, Tri Force, and Lucidity boots. Or a more normal ADC build with Tri force, BotRK, and Berserker's greaves. Back in the old days, you would get chastised for building tear on Ez as you would delay your core damage items. However, if Ez builds ER in the middle of his Carry build, he can transition into a poke caster, even though he did not initially build towards it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-08-01T13:01:57.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, that's disappointing.
