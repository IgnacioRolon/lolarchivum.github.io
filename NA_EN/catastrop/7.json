Like mages and assassins themselves are expected to build a bit tanky to survive against each other, how can you possibly think you&#039;re somehow an exception to this this? And this is like come strange community mind set because I once saw a thread that was upvoted to hell about Anivia&#039;s &quot;unfair damage&quot; on an Ashe. I looked at her stats, she had 51 MR, at late game. Yeah, unfair my ass, there was even someone in the comments who was like &quot;Aum, there was like, an aegis there.&quot; Oh boy, that +15 MR on a base 36 MR is definitely going to save me from the fed late game mage. Seriously, it&#039;s like people expect to just build full glass and not be just that, glass. Maybe if you took the time to build appropriately and respect and enemy&#039;s damage, you wouldn&#039;t find yourself constantly dying in a virtual fire like some pleb.\n\nEDIT: Now just for clarification, while I did say resistances, I still mean defensive items in general.
