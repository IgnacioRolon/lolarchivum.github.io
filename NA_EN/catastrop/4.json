Most times I'm okay with people taking camps so long as they ask, we have to plan our routes in advance, so when we see one of the camps we plan on hitting being taken without any warning, it tends to be detrimental. If I know in advanced though, no problems at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angelofchaos16x","date":"2015-07-21T16:23:16.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If its the enemy jungle, go right ahead and have fun , and call me if you need back up. And as far as my jungle goes, 90% of the time I am fine if you take it , as long as you ask me. I am fine donating camps during the early game to help the lanes, just depending on my jungler, sometimes I would rather you take x camp instead of the other camp, for clearing issues of course.","replies":[]}]}
