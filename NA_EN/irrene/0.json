It's really important that you go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, and not some of it.  It's also important to try using a wired connection to rule out the possibility of a wifi connection problem.  \n\nTo help you out, download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically configure some of your settings like your firewall.  You can also run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to get an overview of your case, which I'm assuming will involve packet loss problems.  No worries, as the reader will also provide troubleshooting steps for you.
