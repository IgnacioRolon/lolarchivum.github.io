So I restart and if I wait a few minutes it will pop up again. here's the reason I know its not on my end, the game still works. I am still able to play no problem its just really annoying having it pop up all the time between games and restart league.\n\nyes I went through the trouble shooting, antivirus, connection, and all that but I've not had any problems until this latest league patch.","replies":[{"poster":"SgtDread","date":"2017-08-23T23:54:34.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I launched league today and it there was an update which worked fine of course like always. Then once I logged in there was a scan which ran as usual no problems. Magically it also seems to have solved the error pop up issue because I left league running to see if the message would appear and it didn't. \nsurprise a league patch fixed the client update error message issue and not something on my end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SgtDread","date":"2017-08-23T12:48:31.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been through the permissions guide, done all that.
