Some of the people only get up to 200ms, I have been getting repeated 400-700ms. This only ours with there is an LCS match going on.  I do not recall this ever happening last year during the NA LCS. Is there anything I can do to try to fix this? It is hard to play when you randomly go from 40ms to 400ms then die because of it","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T17:48:51.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LCS is independent of the game server so your specific issue is a coincidence.  It sounds like you're having network issues like packet loss, which can cause in-game delays or spikes.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these matches to get an analysis of your case.  Let me know what you find!","replies":[]}]}
