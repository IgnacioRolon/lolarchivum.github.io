Which means he only gets to use it ONCE in most all team fights/encounters.  Once Teemo's blind is gone, he is in trouble.  The Q only affects ONE other champion.  Unlike say Jax, Vlad, Fizz, etc, etc, which counter EVERYONE with some form of invulnerability/untargetable.   Teemo's Q doesn't stop someone from using abilities.  For example, Annie can melt Teemo, blind or no blind.\n\nHis E is no more oppressive than any other marksmen.  AD Marksmen get 100% AD damage without the need of specific itemizations or masteries.  Teemo only gets around 50% AP on hit, but REQUIRES specific itemization and masteries to reach that level.  His E gives him sustained damage that is actually less than the sustained damage of a typical AD marksmen (Assuming AP Teemo, which is the typical build).  His on hit E damage actually needs a small buff to get him more inline of a typical ADC (and that's not compensating for lack of crit damage)\n\nJust because Teemo counter's Auto-Attackers, doesn't mean he needs reworked.  He is likewise crushed by ability casters, bursters, gap closers, and just about any form of light cc.\n\nHis kit is fine, just needs a buff to compensate for his huge shroom nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2015-02-20T15:14:00.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cornerstone1,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=jBUJOuQ4,comment-id=00010001000200000001,timestamp=2015-01-23T15:38:39.032+0000)\n\n> \n> His kit is fine, just needs a buff to compensate for his huge shroom nerf.\n\n{{champion:17}}  does not need a buff\n\nif you think so you are playing him wrong!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GLWuffie","date":"2015-01-22T20:06:38.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corvic Maractis,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=jBUJOuQ4,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-01-22T19:59:05.771+0000)\n>\n> Speaking of Teemo, could you ask where he is on the list of Rework Priorities.

Either way, it doesn't take up a main item slot and can be available for free.
