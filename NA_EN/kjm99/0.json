Essentially, some of the data coming from your network gets lost or damaged before it gets to our servers. When that happens, sometimes the game isn't sure what's going on anymore which is when that Sona started getting damaged by nothing. \n\nLet's double check to make sure this really is packet loss before we go too much further.
