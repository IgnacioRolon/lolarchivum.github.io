Therefore if I want to report and then ignore a player I must first report them and then add them to my friends list, which they have to accept, and then I can put them on the Ignore/Block list. This seems a bit off as it makes you go through so much to deal with a player already giving your grief so it's just more that they can do. There is Mute feature if they contact you outside of game, but nothing to list them as someone who you don't want to play with again like the ignore feature on the old client was suppose to do. I'm sure there's a feature in the match making that looks for players who were reported by the players in queue and tries to not group them up. However I would still like the ability to put them on ignore so that I don't have to go through muting them in the in-game listing if I run into them again. \r\n\r\nJust wanted to point out the missing ignore feature, pretty sure that I haven't been running into people I reported but I'm also sure that it is a possibility without having some sort of block list showing I don't wish to play with this player.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T02:27:30.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The block feature actually *doesn't* prevent you from being matched with that person for games. There's currently no feature to provide this functionality in the game. You're correct about having to add someone or play a match with them before you're able to block them. You should be able to simply block someone in the post-game lobby by right-clicking on their summoner name and selecting *block*.\n\nI hope this provided some clarify. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimsonhaseo","date":"2016-11-30T02:48:11.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just checked again, new client has no way to ignore someone unless they are already on your friends list. Post Game options are ONLY Add Friend, Honor, Gift, or Report. Completely unable to right click on summoner name or profile, when you try to do so it pulls up the menu to select the icons for one of those 4 options I previously stated. So your new client is NOT allowing players to block communication from toxic players in post game stats, only able to mute them during game which does not stick through post game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T21:46:01.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha. I suppose this was a feature that is prioritized for later down the Beta's upgrade track. I'd recommend playing with the *Legacy Client* if you'd like to be able to block other players at the moment. You can easily access the old client from the login screen, as shown below:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/215576628/Launch-Legacy-Client.jpg\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crimsonhaseo","date":"2016-11-30T00:38:35.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, classic client you can, but in NEW client you can't.
