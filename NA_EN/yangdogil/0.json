I troubleshooted with \"Player Support\" for well over a month after buying the best iMac currently being made and the game still drops frames. How about we talk to someone who isn't just an email troubleshooter!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ximbalau","date":"2018-03-14T19:33:06.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!\n\nHigh Sierra\nMacBook Pro 13-inch, 2017\n2,3 GHz Intel Core i5\n16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 640 1536 MB\n\nTo have better FPS I watched this video that helped me a lot:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5eVBpXaVe4\n\nPer example: As it seems my retina display only holds up to 60FPS so no need to ask more of my graphics card.\n\n\nBut this wasn't the main subject, and the problems start when I try to use Discord.
