The most you get after doing any of these fixes is one quick connect to give false hope. But I think you'll find if you create another custom afterwards you're right back at square one. I've been scouring the Internet for 4 days (two of which I had my only days off last week and I just wanted to sit down and play some League) and these \"fixes\" are extremely rarely a permanent fix. It's more than likely an issue brought up by a recent update (if you look at posts made about this from years ago to today you'll find this commonly occurs after updates go through) and for w/e reason Riot needs to leave us in complete darkness instead of being helpful in any way shape or form.","replies":[{"poster":"JakeDeJuke","date":"2016-04-18T19:30:47.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is so weird that it works yesterday and today i can't play. \n\nBut thank u for your comment , i hope Riot will do something about this problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-19T01:12:36.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo,\n\nThere's a couple of reasons you can't connect. \n\nIt could be routing issues. Your ISP could have made changes recently to their routing tables as well as the route data is taking to leave their network. If that's the case, it would explain why you can only connect when on a different network, since I'm assuming it's a different ISP than the one you're on.\n\nLess likely, your modem and/or router could be causing this as well, especially if it's old. Have you tried bypassing your router and connecting directly into the modem to see if the router is the problem? You could also borrow a modem to test with and see if it's not your hardware at home causing it. \n\nThe easiest way to check to see if your router/modem could be a part of the problem would be to install a VPN (Virtual Personal Network). If the VPN is set up properly and you can connect to League, most likely not that hardware. If you can't, it could be your modem/router. \n\nIf you've got a laptop, really easy to drag to a friend's house and test there, see if you can or can't connect there. If you can, issue with your network at home. If not, it's an issue with your laptop or our servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Inignok","date":"2016-04-24T17:17:32.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am using the same Mac Book Pro (OS 10.11.4 15-inch, Mid 2012, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 512 MB) I have used for years to play LoL. After patch 6.8 however this \"black screen of death\" occurred after champ select finishes. Originally I thought it might have only been a 1 time thing so I tried a second game, resulting in an AFK buster penalty.\n\nThe most frustrating thing for me is that my work Mac tower, which is  older than my laptop, works fine; in fact I used it to finish my 5 game buster penalty last week. \n\nA few things to note: 1) I have tried restarting my router at home and that doesn't fix the issue. 2) I have attempted to play on other networks, including at my work where the tower works fine - none of these alt connections have worked. 3) I have reinstalled and tried to repair LoL but that too doesn't fix the problem.\n\nI have seen on the forums that I am not the only one with this issue. Of course, I understand Mac users already make up a small portion of the LoL community, and even less probably play on Laptops,  but I would appreciate any assistance that could be provided. It is extremely frustrating to not be able to play a game I have invested both time and money into.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any addition information from me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-04-19T02:33:27.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this issue randomly off and on since about two patches ago. Sometimes repeated attempts to connect will get me into the game but there will be a slowly sliding up and down giant black bar and the entire screen will constantly flicker, making the game basically unplayable.\n\nUsually restarting my computer fixes it (from either state) but that tends to result in getting into the game a little late. If it happens once on a given day it's very likely to happen again that day, but I'll often go days with no issue. I'm not 100% sure but I think it's more likely to happen if you other stuff running, particularly video (such as youtube), even if your computer has the hardware to easily handle both at once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JakeDeJuke","date":"2016-04-19T01:30:43.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank u for your reply\n\nLast time i had this problem i had no problems connecting on a friends network and when i got home i could play LoL at home again with no problems.

Everything worked fine for me yesterday, then I had to log off for like an hour - came back and this keeps happening.
