There've been a lot of people claiming that the champions you play the most have the highest chance of showing up in the store (reddit, in game, stream chat).  That's not necessarily the case, as the criteria for personalized offers are more extensive than that.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=aT1jnjFq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-16T17:26:34.475+0000)\n>\n> the Snowdown shop will feature six unique champions or skins (excluding Legendary, Ultimate, and Limited) released more than three months ago) based on your playstyle. It's based on a ton of different factors, but playstyle is the best way to describe it. I think it'll make a bit more sense once you see the shop for yourself. \n\nAs stated by Riot, the deals are based heavily on playstyle.  Likely factors include champion type, lane, and role.  They might also check data for previous skin theme purchases, or what types of champions you skin the most.  The goal for this promotion is obviously to get people to spend some RP (and thus money), but merely focusing on your main champions would be very shortsighted.  After all, pigeonholing you to your existing pool limits purchase options.  By offering you champions (and skins) similar to your existing playstyle, they are encouraging you to branch out to possibly unfamiliar champions that you statistically may enjoy.  Having more champions unlocked also creates more future sales potential for them since each champion has its own pool of alternate skins.\n\nTo those people claiming that being offered skins for champions they don't currently play is an example of coding error: It's not.  That isn't spaghetti code.  That's _marketing_.  There may have been coding errors responsible for the shop's delay, but that's a different issue.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-16T23:51:43.512+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add onto this, feedback is always welcome.

This is the first time we're doing something like this!\n\nGoing to write out all my thoughts here.\n\nFirst, I really like the idea behind the shop. Getting personalized offers feels really neat and makes me want to play and spend more.\n\nNow then. I REALLY think their needs to be some deterrents on what skins make it through into your shop. For example, I got Prototype Viktor and Jurassic Cho'Gath in my shop. The problem is I already own Creator Viktor and Gentleman Cho'Gath : I don't want to spend extra RP (and thus money) to get a downgraded skin for a champion I already have amazing skins for. Adding on to this, my shop was 3 top lane champion skins, 1 top/mid, and 1 mid lane. That fits my roles I play and enjoy well. Then there was 1 support role champion despite me being someone who has never gone support happily except a few times on aggressive supports like Leona. And the skin is for a passive support who's main playstyle is sitting behind the carry and pressing W for heals every now and then.\n\nAdding onto the above is that 2 of the skins in my shop are sidegrades: they aren't improvements on a skin I already own (like going from Outback to Scorched Earth/Pool party) but they aren't downgrades either (going from Scorched Earth/Pool Party to Outback). It's just some slightly discounted skins that don't offer anything extra to what I already have.\n\nSo overall I like the idea behind the shops, but at some point in their it messed up and offered discounts on things I would never be interested in getting anyway. Also, my friend got Dreadknight Garen in his shop which frankly seems like something that should never happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puynsi","date":"2015-12-17T21:02:50.099+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"_writting feedback to riot_\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/qtfM1EtGV3kxW/giphy.gif\n\nHahahaha, yeah we will champ.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-18T00:35:15.257+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually compiling all of this. :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magister Ragun","date":"2015-12-17T07:19:36.238+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"getting a 20% off deal feels insulting.

I got Elderwood Bard (-30%), Sabretusk Sejuani (-30%), Noxus Hunter Anivia (-40%), Steel Legion Garen (-60%), Dreadknight Garen (-70%), and Molten Rammus (-20%). While I do play a lot of Bard and Sejuani, and a fairly large amount of Anivia, none of these are skins I'm interested in.\n\nWhat's worse, among the two legacy skins on sale, Noxus Hunter Anivia is actually on sale, right now, for 50% off! And Molten Rammus will be on sale for 50% off two days after this sale ends. **If I had bought either of those, it would feel really awful to see them elsewhere on sale for more off so soon, or worse still, at the same time!**\n\nI'm really not sure why I got two Garen skins here. I almost never play top lane, and when I have, I've played Tahm Kench and Irelia far more than I've played Garen there. I play a lot of Bard and Anivia, so it's probably not thinking that I favor relatively easy champions either. Where did those recommendations come from?\n\nThe algorithms could also stand to consider my skin-buying habits. This year, I have primarily purchased 1350 RP skins. I overwhelmingly purchase skins with particle or sound changes. Three of the skins in my shop have neither. Moreover, it's weird that the system doesn't take into consideration the fact that within the last couple weeks, I opted not buy Elderwood Bard when it was on sale for the skin pricing policy change sale.\n\nI agree with Lord Dusteon that this is a good idea. But the implementation here is poor. I'm not getting skins I'm interested in, and what's worse, I'm not even getting a good deal!","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2015-12-26T01:49:51.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't Dreadknight Garen one you can get free..?

By basing it off recently played champs or champs who are played similarly that would make players at least a little bit more likely to spend their RP on the skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KTK Nos","date":"2015-12-21T23:01:10.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got vindicator vayne in my snowdown shop and purchased it already and today i was looking at the skins that will be going on sale the rest of the month and that skin is one of them, is there any way i can get RP back or is it now lost?","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-12-23T09:40:46.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you still have refounds left?","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-23T08:56:54.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe so, since the sales for the month are announced in advance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LaSassyA","date":"2015-12-18T18:15:34.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really liked the idea of getting champions on sale according to our play styles , but my one major problem was the fact that only one or two of the skins ever exceeded the amount of the normal weekly skin sales, so in theory, it is just not worth it to buy any of the skins except for ones that are 50, 60,or 70% off because you could just wait a little and get that skin that was 20% off for 50% off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shonjl","date":"2015-12-17T10:54:01.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My suggestions would be either don't make doubles or allow a reroll or 2.\n\nI got 2 doubles and while one of them I will get both, the other was garbage and I don't want either.

This is the first time we're doing something like this!\n\nJust wanna start off by saying I'm not complaining about the sales I got, I wasn't really planning on buying any of them unless by slim chance I got Cosmic Reaver Kass on it. That being said, I'm a bit skeptical about the accuracy of these playstyle based picks.\n\nThree of the six sales I got make little sense. \n\nTo give you an idea of what I'm talking about, here are my top 6 played champions: {{champion:35}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:143}}.\n\nThe skins I got were for {{champion:35}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:59}} \n\nOf those three, Shaco and J4 make a ton of sense, and Voli has a similar enough playstyle to J4 to make sense, but Tahm, Yasuo, and Ashe just straight up don't. \n\nFirst off, Yasuo: I had a brief spell of playing yasuo top lane a few months ago, short of that I haven't touched the champion since his release. The champions I play don't reflect his playstyle at all, he's a fighter with high damage and mobility. I play little to no mobility mages, kiting supports, mobile assassins, and nearly full tank J4. I'm just not seeing Yasuo as a good match for this, but of these three this is the least confusing one.\n\nOn to Tahm Kench: Immobile tank support. The only tank I play is J4, who is highly mobile. You guys keep saying how easy it is to kite Tahm Kench and that's why his damage is so high, I'm sure the last thing used to describe J4 is 'easily kited'. Completely different playstyles.\n\nAnd finally, the one that makes absolutely no sense at all, Ashe: I veeerry rarely play ADC, like at all. Sometimes when I'm forced to go bot lane as the 'marksmen' position, I'll play AP Ziggs instead because that's how much I hate ADC as a class. That being said, occasionally I'll break out Ezreal when I think Ziggs won't work in the comp. I've gotta say, Ezreal is probably the closest thing to opposite of Ashe as you can get. Ashe is immobile, has a ton of cc, and doesn't really have much poke or adequate burst from her spells. Ezreal is mobile, has no CC at all, and is completely poke and burst oriented. I just don't get it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2015-12-17T09:12:33.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of the store, it's pretty cool.

I had the money, but the system offered skins for champions that I either don't play, already have a better skin for, offered ugly skins, multiple skins for the same champion, or the magnitude of the discount did not warrant a purchase.\n\n1. This one is easy to fix. Only offer skins for champions that have been played in the last two months or so. This point is far more important than the next three, since fixing those and not this would result in good skins with good offers that I would be pained to purchase since I would know it was a waste of money buying a skin for champions I don't like or play.\n\n2. Also easy to fix, only offer skins that have a HIGHER base price than the skins I already own for that champion. For example, if I own Prestigious Leblanc (750), do not offer me Wicked Leblanc (520), but instead Ravenborn Leblanc (1350) -  a skin I would actually have any chance of purchasing.\n\n3. This issue is difficult to satisfy, since every skin appeals to at least someone. I don't know how effective this would be, but look at colour schemes and common themes between the skins that the player has already purchased (not including gifts or mystery chests). This could help find out the players preferred skin style.\n\n4. Riot should know that offering multiple skins for the same champion will result in less purchases than skins for two different champions. It's just a fact that there are people who see it as a waste to own more than one skin on a champion. Just don't do this.\n\n5. Almost every skin in the game will eventually be on sale, usually at a larger discount than those offered in the snowdown shop. This means that buying the snowdown discounted skins results in spending more money than necessary. My solution would be to only offer discounts of 50% or HIGHER. Riot can almost  raise the discounts indefinitely and still profit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taric the Gay","date":"2015-12-27T21:13:37.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only play Taric but I own Ezreal despite never playing him.

I personally got 2 different {{champion:1}} skins in the shop (Panda and Frostfire at 40% off each), and had no desire for either one, and 2 {{champion:89}} skins (Pool Party, which I bought at 70% off, and Defender, at 20% off).\n\nAnother potential improvement might be to give players 1 re-roll of their shop - but only the amount of deals that HAVEN'T been used. That way, you don't get players buying all of the first group then re-rolling for a new group. With a re-roll, it would allow players to get a chance at skins they might be interested in, while still only giving them a maximum of 6 deals.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading these posts, Katey.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yakkocmn","date":"2015-12-26T01:19:02.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of my sales was 50% off Recon Teemo, but the day I received it was the same day that Recon Teemo was 50% off for everyone in League of Legends, so it felt like I had one less real sale.
