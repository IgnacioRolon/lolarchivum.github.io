New Boot idea","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boots of Mobility\nBoots of Swiftness\n\nHaving 2 choices of boots that have a similar goal has always bothered me because I like both of them. That goal being move faster.\n\nI usually pick deciding on what is most necessary or better for the situation depending on my roll. But when I&#039;m playing to have fun I pick it for what kind of playstyle I want.\n  \n I like boots of swiftness for the flat move speed which I like to play on bruisers \nI like boots of mobility because its just more fun which I to to play on assassins or specific ADCs\nSometimes I switch it up or go with another boot that is better for the situation.\n\nBoots of swiftness had a movement speed reduction to 55 and now it doesn&#039;t feel like its a distinct/unique choice between other boots. other boots except boots mobility have 45ms which is only 10ms less than 55ms. After going in game with friends and specifically testing/timing the difference between 45ms &amp; 55ms it doesn&#039;t make a huge difference when moving in a straight line for a long distance (from base to outer tower, wish is wrote down a time from when I tested). When in a real scenario, dodging skill shots, going to other jungle camps, etc, it makes no difference. None. \n\nI don&#039;t see a point for even picking it for it&#039;s passive  (25% reduced slows) when Merc treads has 30% reduced on all types of crowd control + magic resist. \n\nWhat I&#039;m purposing is removing boots of swiftness and mobility and introducing a hybrid. Boots of speed. \n\nBoots of mobility has 25ms when in combat and 115ms when out of combat for 5.\nBoots of swiftness has 55ms flat and its passive.\n\nWith the new boot (boots of speed) it has 40ms when in combat and 100 when out of combat for 4 seconds. That&#039;s it, No other passive. The slow reduction is removed since its in the merc treads territory. Cost $950.\n\nIt has the identity of mobility boots by being the slowest and the fastest boot. It also has the influence of the swiftness boot since i took 55-15=40 and 115-15=100......if that makes sense lol. And lets say the swiftness passive reduced the 5sec out of combat to 4 lol.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2016-11-06T19:41:21.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one is for consistent movement while the other is more for roaming, they both have very distinct differences and swiftness is better when the enemy is overloaded with slows but not much, if any, actual hard cc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-04T02:04:52.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty much how it was back when the alacrity enchantment was a thing.

Back in the days of boot enchantments, mobility boots weren't the issue it was swiftness that everyone bought. Even so this boot isn't as fast since old alacrity mobility boot had 45ms/135ms, while the one im purposing is 40ms/100ms.
