It definitely sounds like there are some issues to our servers, as the error you're seeing usually means that something is wack with your local network settings. I recommend you work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure that this is not the case and that your local network settings have been properly configured for League.\n\nLet me know if this was unable to resolve your issue.","replies":[]}]}
