They are cancerous because of cc that goes off cooldown before it expires, absurd mobility, or a long range poke ability that has almost no counterplay. That is 14% of the champion pool. When there are 10 champions in the game it is almost a guarantee that one of the following will be in the game. Also, a mode shouldn't have to disable this many champions, if it is a successful, healthy mode. Seriously turn ARURF into URF and give players bans. That would make it so much better than it is now and possibly purge it of being a dumpster fire. Now I know some of you will disagree but just remember that this is a very subjective post. Thank you.","replies":[]}
