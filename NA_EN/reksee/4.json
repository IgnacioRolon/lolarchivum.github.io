My goals for this concept are to \r\n\r\n-Strike a balance between assassin and support.\r\n-Not overload concept with damage OR utility\r\n-Be a champion that would only be played as a support\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of a name for this concept I'm simply going to call it Dave, but feel free to leave ideas for names.\r\n\r\nnote that dave wields two daggers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Passive: Assassin's Pact**\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the game Dave can choose an ally to have an **Assassin's Pact** with. \r\n\r\nWhen Dave gets a kill on an enemy champion he gives 35% of his gold earnings to his ally with the **Assassins Pact**\r\n\r\nDave's attack damage is increased by 15% when he is within 1200 units of his ally with the **Assassin's Pact**\r\n\r\nWhen Dave kills an enemy champion his ally with the **Assassin's Pact** (if they are within 1200 units of him) are healed for 50-220 (levels 1-18)+(10% ally's missing health) health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q: Hack and Slash**\r\nDave slashes enemies in front of him, dealing 50/80/110/140/170+(65% bonus attack damage) to enemies hit. This will deal double damage if it hits only one enemy.\r\nrange: 300\r\ncooldown: 10\r\n\r\n**W: Plunge Attack**\r\nDave leaps into the air, after a delay of 0.5 seconds he lands at a target location, dealing 60/100/140/180/220+(80% bonus attack damage damage) to enemies in the target location.\r\nrange: 675\r\ncooldown: 17/16/15/14/13\r\ntarget area radius: 150\r\n\r\n**E: Dive to arms**\r\nDave dashes to a target ally, if the ally has the Assassin's Pact they gain 45% movement speed that decays over the next 1 second.\r\nrange: 550\r\ncooldown: 12\r\n\r\n\r\nR: Please leave your ideas, I'm not sure what a suitable ultimate for this kind of kit would be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease leave your thoughts on what little of the concept there is, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-08-26T15:02:49.225+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"My concern is letting him have that passive and not **forcing** him to be a support by gutting his base damages.

What I mean he would make good ADC with Blitz {{champion:53}} or thresh{{champion:412}} or even {{champion:555}}  imagine that assassin combo. \nDave's combo would be W to get in Q to damage E to escape in his ally direction this does not give much for the ADC, no CC no enhancement (except 1s in E)making it not really supportive.\n \nNow the biggest problem with AD support idea is that they do a lot of damage and meant to kill whereas true support meant to help their **ADC do the damage** and help **them** kill.\n\nfor example:\nPassive- After reducing enemy champion to one HP, can't deal damage to them for the next 2s\n\nBasically, this meant to give their ADC chance to kill the enemy but I can see myself, that would make Dave very hard to play if their ADC died and the enemy has 5% HP left. Truth to be told AD support is hard to make, personally, I don't think that Pyke is good support.\n\nSuggestion for R- Portion of damage he deals is converted into health transported to his Assassin's Pact ally for 6s (if Assassin's Pact ally is dead or too far, healing goes to nearest ally if there are no allies nearby Dave cant activate his R) \n\nKeep on trying I believe in you\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-08-27T10:30:12.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With numbers like this Zed would be better support.\n\nNow for a serious review:\n\nPassive is somewhat boring. There is no choice but to connect to adc, and the connection itself is nothing interesting, only E bonus is somewhat good.\nAlso, if i understood correctly, he LOSES 35% of gold gains that are transfered to his ally\n\nQ: Too weak. It has nothing but damage, and the damage is weaker than Zed's Q on almost double the cd and lower range. The double damage bonus on solo targets is fine, but again, Khazix Q is better and with 4 sec cd.\n\nW: Rakan's W has 250 radius, so for a delayed dash with no other effect but AOE damage 150 AOE is too weak.\n\nE: Looks like your idea was to make his kit perfect for short trades with WQE when enemy is isolated, in which case his E is ok\n\nMy ideas:\n\nPassive: Damage bonus removed, healing removed.\nOnce every 200 seconds he can instantly teleport to Pact ally from 5000 range by rightclicking that ally, can't be used from less than 600 range to prevent accident casts\nSomething to enable roaming if the lane is tough, as well as actually \"support\" his carry\n\nQ: Instead of doubling damage if it hits 1 enemy, now it doubles damage and stuns if it hits at least 2 champions.\nCooldown is now 5\nMakes him better in botlane and teamfights and adds some unusual counterplay\n\nW: No delay on a dash, still 0.5 sec delay on damage. AOE is 250. Damage is increased by 15% to compensate for \n\nE: Now gives +ms for any ally champion. If a target is a Pact ally, and you both are out of combat, gives Camouflage for Dave for 5 seconds\nAdded an option for a risky plays where Dave wastes his only escape tool for better initiation possibilities\n\nR: Marks the target for 60 seconds. If either Dave or his Pact ally bring it to &lt;25% hp, it dies, both Dave and Pact ally gain full gold(including bounty), the kill itself goes to the ally, and they are both healed for 50% missing health. Cooldown is 100/80/60 seconds but starts only after the mark expires or the target dies. Can only be casted on targets with >50% health\nSomewhat healthy variation of Pyke's ultimate. Gives less gold and executes at lower hp and has no aoe/reset. In exchange, it is much easier to proc, shares bounties and rewards successful execution with a healing. Enemies can see who is marked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Físt","date":"2019-08-27T08:47:21.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going off the concept he could just use the passive on the jungler and go mid/top.

During the R's duration Dave and his ally marked by Assassin's Pact have increased movement speed towards the target and deal 10/15/20% extra damage and/or penetrates 10/15/20% of the marked enemy's armor.\nDuring R's duration Dave's W has increased range towards the market target and the spell will ALWAYS LOCK on the target (will jump on the target regardless of where you wanted to jump, like old Urgot's Q would lock on a target marked by E). If the target uses a mobility spell Dave will follow him (like Akali can follow the target marked by her E).","replies":[]}]}
