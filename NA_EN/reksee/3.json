I think there's a question to be asked here however.\n\nWhat *Is* a niche champion, how do we define that? Is it a champion who you wouldn't pick blind into a team comp? Is it a champion with a identity that is really specific to certain situations? In the case of Vayne, is she niche because she kills tanks better than some ADCs? Almost every ADC can kill tanks, meanwhile Jinx and Twitch can melt entire teams while doing that. Varus and Ashe have massive team utility, and MF and Xayah can set up massive damage on the field. I highly doubt that Vayne's entire character is solely \"I kill tanks well\". \n\nMy opinion, I don't see Vayne as a niche champion, because I think her duelist side overpowers her tank shredder side, and that's what people are arguably picking her up and playing her as. A duelist, not a tank killer. Like I saw someone say in the %True Damage thread, %percent health damage is target agnostic, you'll always do the same percent health no matter the target, which is the design for Fiora.

Yeah, she's a tank shredder, but she's also a duelist in general due to the nature of her kit.\n\nI believe we're coming to the term niche from different directions.  Allow me to clarify my position.\n\nWhen I say 'niche' I don't mean 'low pick rate'.\n\nWhen I say 'niche' I mean a kit is relatively specialized.\n\nVayne specializes in being a dualist marksmen, SPECIFICALLY a dualist marksmen well adapted at destroying the enemy front-line.  She works best against low to moderately mobile opponents packing high resistance values.  She pays for this by being completely lacking in any sort of range extension or poke.\n\nBasically, she murders juggernauts and fighters and makes things hard for Tanks provided she avoids their opening CC rotation.\n\nThat's a very specialized kit.  As opposed to a generalist kit like Jinx who has gameplay that revolves around '5-man rolling murderball'.\n\nVayne has a very high pick rate because people enjoy her proactive, flashy game play.  And since her pick rate is so high, she's often chosen into team compositions where her niche kit doesn't perform as well.  This drives her win rate down.  Thus, when Vayne has a relatively high win rate, it suggests that she has been over-tuned to the point that she isn't functioning as a niche pick anymore.  She's functioning as a generalist.\n\nAnd when a niche pick, hard-counter champion is over-tuned to the point that they become a generalist pick they absolutely invalidate the champions that they counter.  Kalista did the same thing when she was a generalist pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2019-03-28T14:33:39.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are monster champs really that unappealing though?

Urgot, much more human than the monstrosity of science we had before. \n\nYou need to keep in mind this: Popularity and Pickrate are two different things. We all know the crowd who jumps onto whatever champion is the strongest, because they want to win. Look at the mains, look at the people playing the champion when they're the weakest. This is the true indicator of how much a champion appeals to them, that they'll play them while they're weak. Because they like the champion, not their strength. \n\nThat's not always the case, especially in terms of extreme gutting, but it's the easiest to see.
