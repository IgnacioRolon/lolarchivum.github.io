And this afking happens right when i'm standing in front of my PC; so i want to play, but i cant. I am treated exactly like those who leave a game just for trolling other people, this is how Riot treats us, and i think that i'm not the only one having this problem, can you implement a way of solving this please? i am really just looking at my screen, at a frozen loading screen, and after 5 minutes or so, the ending scoreboard appears, telling me that i am in a lower priority queue for 5 machade games, and really, its more annoying than playing against Teemo himself. Please do something.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-27T20:35:21.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that your intent is to play, but this screen freezing is preventing you from doing that.  We're not against you or out to get you, but the [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will treat all leaves equally regardless of intent.  This is because all leaves still cause other players a negative experience.  For now, I think it's really important to stop joining matchmade games and stick to custom for testing purposes.\n\nRegarding the issue itself, I'm curious if you're on Windows 10 and recently updated it.  There's an issue with the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which auto-enables, and has been known to cause freezing like this.  Disable that and test it in a custom game.  Let me know if it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"LoliPiner69","date":"2017-05-28T00:33:44.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you let me know when leave buster resets cause i seem to always get 20 min ones even if the last time i left a game was a while ago it seems to never reset to 5 min for me.","replies":[]}]}]}
