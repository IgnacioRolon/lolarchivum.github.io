Since once you're at the stage to not being handicapped by your own lack of skills, the champs themselves become your new handicap, which means, mechanically 1 dimensional champs in a high skill environment is the same as offering to ban one of your arms in a high class martial art tournament.\n\nNot only that, Riot doesn't seem to know how to balance between raw power and utility too, in fact a lot of times they don't seem to consider utility a part of the power budget at all and just balance everyone in terms of raw fat stats. The result is that \"hard\" champs are almost always a straight upgrade from the \"easy\" champ (assuming no blatant OP shit in bound), as long as the player is capable enough. This is a fundamental design and balance flaw in this game, I suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-04-18T14:48:48.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are plenty of Annie and Garen players at least until high-Plat and Diamond, and Singed in mid-Diamond.

That said, I genuinely advocate for champions with simpler kits as they have several advantages that are unsung by the majority.\n\n1.) They are provide flexibility. In this autofill age and in the even worse season 1-5 draft days, you needed to have a champion for each role you could play. These low skill floor champs allow for flexibility without requiring too much investment.\n\n2.) The are very consistent in their match ups. Part of the reason I dislike yasuo is his volatile performance in lane. He wins or loses big, with no in between. Annie on the flip side doesn't lose as hard and can still be of use. Plus she has far less disadvantageous match ups and can fit into more team comps.\n\n3.) they allow for one to practice certain mechanics. Things like wave control, vision management, map awareness, and roaming opportunities are vital skills that must be learned through experience and practice. However, it's hard to focus on that if the basics of your champ are flawed. Champs like azir, yasuo, and akali are hard enough thanks to their kits but if you need to master your champ's basics before you could improve on these vital skills.

Simplicity allows predictability. \n\nLet's look at {{champion:1}} :\n\nShe's really simple to play and when done right can really burst people down with her stun/tibbers. However she has two massive weaknesses. \n\n1.) No Mobility\n2.) Short Range\n\nAny decent Annie will build {{item:3117}}  instead of {{item:3020}} since they need every ounce of speed they can get. Likewise all of her non-ultimate abilities do not extend beyond her auto attack range and the mage update changed it so that  tibbers/stun will only 100-0 a champ if annie is already fed. If you can keep your distance from annie or play champs the have much larger ranges like {{champion:99}}, {{champion:101}}, {{champion:268}}, {{champion:63}}, {{champion:45}} or {{champion:25}}, it won't matter what annie does, she won't win the lanning phase.\n\nYou'd only play annie in these match-ups if your team needs an aoe engage and you can't play another champ.\n\nBottom line, Low skill floor champs have their uses and are as valid as high skill floor.

However, when i first started playing her was right after her biggest nerf, when her E stopped proccing her Q, when she went from pick or ban to a little over 40% winrate.\n\nI quickly learned that Akali's kit was easy, but she was really weak at the time and the majority of lanes countered her without adding pink wards (which revealed her) to the mix. What playing such a difficult champion to survive with in lane forced me to play smart and think about what i was going to do before doing it. Playing Akali taught me how to play the game smart, how can i win this fight without dying? If i do die, is it worth it? Learning Akali when she was at her weakest point really helped me learn game knowledge.\n\nEven now Akali isn't in the best state, but she's much better than what she was. Her biggest counters, the 75g pink ward, and lee sin E, when he could just stand in the middle of Akali's shroud, press E and revveal her, have been removed which makes her feel a lot less constricted when playing her than what it used to be.\n\nLike you, i have a love for a champion with a kit that's considered pretty easy. From what I've seen champions with harder kits are generally given more tools they can use to outplay an enemy champion. If, for example, a fiora or riven lose to Akali, it's not necessarily because of Akali's braindead kit, they just didn't use their champion to the full potential and got outplayed. Of course there are exceptions, the last thing i want is for people to think that if they play a mechanically difficult champion they can get out of any situation and can always outplay the enemy, that isnt true. Sometimes it has to do with luck, positioning, cooldowns, practice, experience, etc.","replies":[]}]}
