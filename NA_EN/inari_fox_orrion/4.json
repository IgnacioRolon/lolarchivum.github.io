I have only twice in my lifetime ever flamed someone, and both times it was thanks to said person being a... very... interesting Ted Bundie-type. Someone who intentionally fed and ruined games and gave away our positions just to ruin our day.\n\nALL my advice or disagreement will ever consist of is \"Stop. Don't. Trust me. It's a really bad idea.\" and, in the worst cases, \"Dude, what the fuck? I told you it was a bad idea.\"\n...but yet every so often, I get someone who tells me that I'm either being toxic or that they'll report me for being toxic despite it being nothing more than a disagreement in tactics.","replies":[{"poster":"BRNZ Rhawkie","date":"2017-05-14T05:37:41.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not exactly toxic, but as MuffinMcSwagWalk had said, it is showing negative attitude. You are showing negative and very strong \"disapproving\" attitude towards what they have done, and many see it as toxic, which it isn't. It should rather be referred to as negativity, but it makes the players feel insecure because you are pointing out the problems that they are causing, rather than just flaming them - still not a good thing. Rather try and just keep it in or use other words which won't make other players feel insecure.","replies":[{"poster":"Inari Fox Orrion","date":"2017-05-14T06:01:04.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I shouldn't have to hide my dislike for an idea! We need to communicate to win, and communication doesn't *just* boil down to \"Oh kiss up to them\" because, if it did, then we wouldn't have phrases like \"Bad idea\" and words like \"No.\" and \"Don't.\"\n\nI don't even really see how it's a negative attitude, either, especially not when you're trying to *win* and improve your chances of winning. There are definitely good ways and bad ways to disagree, and plenty can verge on toxic, I won't deny.\n\nEdit: This may be an awful comparison, but the W. Churches thought the same way; You can't show dissent or question anything they do. It's honestly a bit tyrannical and counterproductive.\n\nEdit2: In the example, Akali was using her KDA to slag off my team. So, I just decided to \"Hey, dude, you suck as much as me. You're 5/6/0. Shut up and quit BMing the team.\" and she actually did just that with some pushback from some other people.\n\nSometimes kindly rephrasing \"Don't be a hypocrite\" gets you somewhere, and those sometimes are worth the times it doesn't - because those people who listen likely won't be toxic again, whereas, as you said, the toxic people would continue to be toxic anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-14T08:49:42.314+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Calling it GG is at the very least an excessively negative attitude, particularly if it is pre-20.  If it's pre-20, you should try to keep everyone's spirits up and work to turn it around.  Then, if it hasn't gotten better by 20 you can call for ff and such.\n\nIf it's post-20 when you say that and your team already said no to the ff, you are being a little toxic.  You're basically saying you're going to stop trying and the rest of them should too even though they are determined to turn it around.  Unless it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that the enemy team will win, you should try to keep your team happy and focused.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2017-05-15T06:27:31.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of kids play this game...\n\nA lot of idiots people play this game...\n\nExpect some portion of players in every match to behave like stupid children.\n\nThe community has a hard time being properly policed by itself because so many reports are childish and stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Runesnag","date":"2017-05-14T15:15:20.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't include the GG as that is really interpreted as complaining about who fed him.

Those are more constructive, but it's a fizz, not much you can do about him.","replies":[]}]}
