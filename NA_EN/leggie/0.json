In Season 2 he had no real purpose as a champion, and come Season 3 the only reason he functioned was because of Elder Lizard and Iceborn Gauntlet combined with his intense healing/scaling during the late game.\r\n\r\nHecarim's kit is designed in a way that pigeonholes him into building damage items before tank items, and in this design lies the problem with him. Hecarim's Q has pretty much no purpose unless you've got damage, if you decide to build like a pure tank then it's a useless ability. This was fine before his W got nerfed, as it healed him enough to where it didn't really matter if he had tank stats, but now that his W barely feels like it does anything he's incredibly easy to kill during the phase of Lizard + Gauntlet + Boots. It's not until you have at least a Randuins/Visage that he feels like how he should, but even then he has problems.\r\n\r\nI don't really know what it would take to fix him, but he definitely has problems. He doesn't have the cc or base damage to justify building like a pure tank, but his W doesn't heal him enough to make building damage items as effective as they should be. His kit is counterproductive, and his build isn't very enjoyable. He needs so many items to function that he feels like he should be a laner, but that's obviously not functional either.\r\n\r\nRiot response would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Xtremey","date":"2014-10-29T12:36:10.358+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree.

He even scales AD with movement speed. I generally play him with 3 quints of movements speed and get mobility boots on him. He's all over the map and have 2 cc's in the form of his E and R which means he can peel for carries very good. His ulti also lets him escape and mass fear the enemy team. With Elder Lizard his camp clear time is ridiculous and his  dps from q does insane damage. After elder lizard he can simply build tanky as he doesn't need any more AD. Against AD he can go with Iceborn Gauntlet which helps him chase even more with the slow and then Randuins to the same effect. Against AP he can run spirit visage which helps his W and can pretty much outsustain any jungler. His gans post 6 are insanely good as he can take a champion out of his turret with his fear and escape with relative ease. Run ghost and you will be ok. Got fed? throw a trinity force on him and now he's really OP.\n\nBefore the nerf on his ulti (which allowed him do deal AP damage where he landed) and before the nerfs on elder lizard he was one of the greates junglers available. Hope you get my idea now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2014-10-29T14:44:40.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has been left at the way side to be sure. I think riot is afraid to buff him since when he was strong he wasn't just strong, he was also really fast and so you couldn't really stop him. Still, unless the preseason changes really help him, I could see him being fine with a few minor base stats buffs so he isn't as squishy early game.

I like him as he is. One observation I made is that you don't  need to get kills in ganks to be successful. Sometimes just slamming into them, getting off a few Qs, and leaving is enough to swing the lane. Always be moving. Speed is king with Hecarim. Not many junglers can make rotations as fast as he can.\n\nI tend to build more damage than you typically see on Hecarim. For example, I usually take Maw of Malmortius over the more popular SV or Banshee's. This keeps my damage relevant without sacrificing too much durability. That said, I also try not to face tank entire fights. One thing Heca does better than anyone is flank. After the engage, I go for the carries, take as much damage as possible, but then peace out after I drop my damage. I then use my huge speed to wrap around and reenter the fight from another angle with another round of cc. This works especially well if you don't open with your ultimate, as then you can dive in over walls.\n\nI don't know how optimal it is, but that's how I play Heca.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leggie","date":"2014-10-30T17:01:53.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leggie","date":"2014-10-30T10:28:03.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"CataclysmCrash","date":"2014-10-29T22:13:27.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has also played Hec since release and have used him to climb from silver to plat twice I don't agree that his build isn't fun or that he can't top lane.

He isn't looking to invade, he's too weak to solo drag, he just wants as much gold as fast as possible.\n\nI personally like this build curve- boots1 SOTL boots 2 Phage Giants Belt Trinity Randuins Spirit Visage (Ghost Blade/GA/BC) \nThe combination of Lizard Elder and Phage give the satisfaction of always being one step ahead of the guy running from you. \nTrinity is when you really start making an impact\nRandies and SV is when you start feeling unkillable \nGhost Blade is always fun and gives Hecarim that lethal backdoor feel\n\nWhen Hecarim feels shitty is when he falls behind, obviously. He's so fragile this often takes you right out of the game. Champs like Shyv and Vi have abilities that take them right into the enemy team and then benefit from free stats or shields to tank it out. They can afford to build full tank when they fall behind because their kits render them viable threats - Hecarim can't. \n\nHowever, I don't want to homogenize Hecarim. I actually like him on the more lethal end of Bruisers at the sacrifice of some durability.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leggie","date":"2014-10-30T01:44:15.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamatrix666","date":"2014-10-30T00:43:14.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hecarim, while not in my \"Top Viable Picks\" list, is definitely in my \"Top Most Fun Champions to Play\" list. It just feels so awesome to ult 3 or more enemy champion and see your team go in while the enemy team are feared in chaos... One of the most satisfying moments in my League of Legends experience is to win a fight because of a well placed Hecarim ult + peeling for your team.\n\nThat being said, it is true that he has his problems. Enough to make him un-viable to the eyes of many. He's a risky pick, since he rely on farming and farming and farming a lot to perform in the late game. Don't get me wrong, his late game (with the right items and the right actions and decisions) can lead a team to victory, thanks to his ult that can turn the tide of an important team fight and his late game toughness due to his W.\n\nHowever, his early game can be rough against a lot of the most mainstream junglers (Khazix, Lee Sin, Elise). Their ganking ability is a bit stronger, they are safer and don't rely on farming as much, since their kit itself own powerful tools (Burst, insane mobility, slows, etc.) Hecarim needs at least a Spirit of the Elder Lizard to start making a difference in terms of damages. Then his next item is crucial for his mid/late game performance. For instance, if he gets his Trinity Force at a respectable time, his chances of helping his team will increase A LOT. But if he didn't have time to farm enough or got counter jungled, his kit and scaling won't save him. Unlike the other junglers I mentioned before, because they can still make a huge difference in team fights/ganks without this precious items in time. \n\n**TL;DR** Hecarim is a risky pick because of his power curve and power spike relying on the acquisition of his second and third items within an acceptable time in the game, unlike many other junglers. I suggest removing the damage reduction on his Q against minions and monsters, or tweaking it to 80% damage instead of 66%. And/or increasing the healing cap of his W against monsters and minions to 80/110/140/170/200 from 60/90/120/150/180. These changes would slightly increase his farming phase of the early game, giving him a little bit more chance on his side to get this crucial second item.

Hecarim is very strong though. Try building a lot of damage and abusing your early ganks with E + ghost. His passive is actually very good after the buffs.

I then finish off with Randuins and Visage so I don't die instantly, and at full build I replace Lizard with cleaver.\n\nPlay like an Assassin in teamfights, your ult is absurd, it lets you completely bypass the frontline to reach the carries, or if you didn't need your ult to approach it lets you escape unscathed after the job is done.\n\nLategame this play style is a little difficult. You still kill carries almost instantly but you fail to do so then they can kill you quickly because they're carries.
