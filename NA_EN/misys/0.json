Not only that, but he has an instant escape. Like literally, he pushes R, and he&#039;s safe. Yup, please respect the front line Kassadin, while the real men go from one and a half of your ults.\n\n{{champion:76}} **pounce on hunted targets: 750**\nNot gonna go into much detail on some of these, since there&#039;s enough on Nidalee, just pointing out all of the ranges of jumps in the game.\n\n{{champion:91}} **cutthroat: 700**\nHonestly one of the most balanced assassins in the game, in my opinion, talon&#039;s cutthroat is pretty fair to me. In order to get past the enemy front line, you have to stand right in front of it first. Not only that, but he does not have an escape afterwards, leaving him to the mercy of the enemy team.\n\n{{champion:5}} **audacious charge: 600**\n600 range  isn&#039;t that bad, just listing ranges.\n\n{{champion:55}} **shunpo: 700** (resets on kill/assist)\nThis is probably the biggest fucking insult to Kassadin to ever exist. Katarina beats Kassadin in almost every way now (not in a 1v1, he still counters Kat, but Kat brings more to the team). Katarina essentailly has the same mobility as Kassadin, with the exception that she can&#039;t jump over walls to get around the map faster. Katarina can run away with the same tactics as Kassadin, provided that she has a ward, which is not hard to come by. Not only that, but in an actual teamfight, her mobility far exceeds Kassadin&#039;s with her passive. She also does not have to be \"smart\" with her shunpo&#039;s as she&#039;s a resourceless champion. Not only that, but if she messes up one of her shunpos, she doesn&#039;t even get punished that hard. Her shunpo has a 6 second cooldown at level 5, making it easy to recover after a mistake.\n\nLet&#039;s calculate damage now.\nAssuming both champions are level 18 and have 500 AP against a 0 MR enemy, here are the damage statistics:\n**Katarina:**\n*Bouncing Blades damage: 160 + 225 (dagger) + 75 + 75 (proc) = 535 damage\nSinister Steel: 180 + 125 = 305\nShunpo: 160 + 200: 360\nDeath Lotus (1 second, out of 2.5): (75 + 125) x 4 = 800\nTotal Damage: 2000* **(PLUS 1200 PER KILL, FROM RESETS)**\n**Kassadin**\n*Null Sphere: 170+350 = 520\nNether Blade: 140 + 300 = 440\nForce Pulse: 180 + 350 = 530\nRift Walk (3100 mana, with tear + roa, assuming he uses it three times in a teamfight): 120 + 62 + 120 + 62 + 60 + 31 + 120 + 62 + 60 + 31 + 60 + 31 = 819\nTotal Damage: 2309* **(This is assuming he builds tear and roa, and uses every rift for damage. I usually don&#039;t build tear, and some people build tear, without building roa.)**\n\nKatarina - balanced, since she can be countered with hard cc.\nKassadin - op, since he ignores the front line.\n\n{{champion:7}} **distortion range: 600** (x2 for a total of 1200...)\nThis is like kat, but with higher initial burst damage, without the kill resets. Not going into detail, since everything said about kat pertains here.\n\n{{champion:84}} **shadow dance: 700**\nExactly the same as kat, since she gets more ult stacks for every kill/reset.\n\n{{champion:105}} **playful/trickster: 400 each** (x2 for a total of 800)\nKASSADIN - OP BECAUSE HE IGNORES THE FRONT LINE AT 700 RANGE\nFIZZ - NOT OP, BECAUSE HE CAN GO **UNTARGETABLE** FROM **800** RANGE\n\nbecause logic.\n\n{{champion:114}} **Lunge: 600**\nSee Xin Zhao.\n\n{{champion:121}} **evolved leap: 900** (resets on kill/assist)\nKha is a little underpowered if you ask me, but his e defies Rito logics.\n\n{{champion:18}} rocket jump: **900** (resets on kill/assist)\nSee Kha, but balanced.\n\n{{champion:254}} **assault and battery: 800**\nSee Fizz. She can&#039;t be disabled, except by killing her. Most Vi players usually build tanky, so if she ults at full heath, not much you can do.\n\n{{champion:62}} **nimbus strike: 625**\nSee Xin.\n\n{{champion:19}} **infinite duress: 700**\nErmmmm, so point and click 700 instant blink plus cc? Hm. Seems fair, when you compare it to the Kassadin riftop.\n\nPre nerf Kassadin already had a terrible win rate of 45%. Post nerf Kassadin dropped him down to a whopping 35%. That was the lowest in the game. He&#039;s slowly come back since, dangling at around 42%, if you can call that a come back. I usually am on Riot&#039;s side with most balance changes, but this is the first ~~stupid~~ ~~retarded~~ ~~idiotic~~ ~~absurd~~, ahem, *balance* change that I vehemently oppose (I&#039;ve been playing for a year).\n\n**Here are some changes I propose, since Riot is obviously having some trouble with one of my favorite champions**\n\n*Make his ult range scale with his level.*\nThis is by far the best suggestion I&#039;ve seen browsing the forums. Not only would it preserve his weak early game, it would allow him to regain his former glory of a 45% winrate.\n\n*Reduce his stack resets, and lower his ult cooldown at levels 6 and 11.*\nCooldown: ~~6/4/2~~ --> 4/3/2\nThis would give him a more \"rushed\" feel, where he is designed as a champion to literally be everywhere at the same time. \n\n*Rework his kit into a top lane fighter mage.*\nLower all of his cooldowns, and reduce their damage. Make his ult not do damage, and lower its mana cost again, and make the maximum number of stacks five instead of four. This would force him to use his ult for utility, and not damage. It would allow him to seem to be in multiple parts of a team fight at once, allowing him to help his teammates as a \"firefighter\", giving help to those who need it. He would need a better peel ability, such as a knockup, to protect his teamates (especially his adc).\n\n*Rework his ult to be similar to Ahri&#039;s ult, with a twist.*\nWhen he ults, give him four stacks to use, which have a 100 second cooldown after 15 seconds. Lower the individual riftwalks to have a 2-4 second cooldown. Add a new effect:\n**\"Kassadin&#039;s walks through the rift leave infected areas on the ground, trapping anyone who steps on them, rooting them for 1/1.5/2 seconds.\"**\nThis would be an awesome change to his ult. It maintains his identity of a mobile assassin, while giving him a small amount of cc, in order to allow him to chase like he did before\n\nAlso, for those that are curious, last season I was a silver II jungle Shaco main, but I usually played Kassadin mid lane when I didn&#039;t get/feel like playing jungle. This season I am a Fiddlesticks jungle main, and play Thresh support when I don&#039;t get/feel like playing jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2015-03-26T06:02:00.980+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"So, i don't play kass, but lets give him a fair trial here. \n\nZed: ulting is single target, *PREDICTABLE* (god do i love seeing him ult when I'm playing soraka) and has a long CD.\n\nNidalee: is only going to be pouncing for a solid kill. dodge the spears and her execute (main kitty attack) hits like air.\n\nTalon: 100% single target, with no escapes worth a damn in a team fight.\n\nXin: not a fair comparison. xin's is a bruiser gap closer that is to make him sticky* (going over what kass has at the end)\n\nKatarina: personally, i dislike her for her point and click mechanics, but she has weaknesses. you will never see a smart kat be an engager. it mitigates her chance of a reset, maximizes her chance of getting CCed. She has one role: get in you team and AoE. of course she has a gap closer (with a decent CD if you play against her properly.\n\nLebonk: exactly like zed. shorted CD for sure, but 90% single target, predictable, and you can play it. a nami bubble at her recall spot makes her stay in and get hit, plenty of champs have similar defenses. if she uses her ult to get that extra gap close, you just won, because that's a TON of damage lost for her.\n\nAkali: is an assassin, easily blown up. she has to close on you, and is CCable, susceptible to AoE, and isn't going to get a reset without her team.\n\nFizz: you hope to god that he engages with playful/trickster. oh man, the beating that you can lay on a defenceless fizz in the middle of your team. its like a free insec, because his dash has a solid CD. \n\nFiora: no escape. she goes in, she ain't coming out till people are dead. very CCable except in her ult, which is 70-80% of her team fight presence. lunge isn't a main gap closer, its a dueling stick mechanic.\n\nKhaz: i'm not sure how it defies logic. it's completely different than kassadin's void crawl. his is a gap closer or escape.*\n\nVi: long CD. predictable landing point. separates herself from her team. no major escape because champs can block her.\n\nWukong: another stick mechanic. he will use that to engage, right into his ult. and is completely CCable at any time during it. that's his main AoE attack, and it has a solid CD.\n\nWarwick: see: zed. love him when i'm playing raka. he just stands there to get blown up for several seconds. is open to silences, stuns, really anything. \n\n\n\nNow lets look at kassadin. what does rift crawl bring to the table?\n\n1: AoE damage. holy cow. by the 3rd or 4th one, he's hitting everyone in a decent range for a not small amount, on a VERY short CD. \n\n2: blink. it dodges all skill shots, something that cannot be said for most of the above. especially with the viegar stun changes, this is powerful.\n\n3: CD. He can use it continuously throughout a fight. its not just an engage, it's a pure damage source. one of his largest in a team fight. that doesn't apply to many of the above.\n\n4: it's an escape as well as an engage. he can get in, do damage with it, and then get back out. all with that one ability. the longer the range, not only the better engage, but also the more spread your team has to be to not get clump-dumped on by his AoE, but also the range that he can just disappear and be effectively uncatchable. slows are ineffective, and no one else can jump walls on that small of a CD.\n\n\n\nDid he get hit too hard? yes. but riot is working on fixes, they're in PBE and (from what I've heard, I'm not actually there) they address some of these. his ult is not just a gap closer, and to classify it as such (and to compare it to other gap closers) is unfair to both sides. no then, BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES!","replies":[{"poster":"Dyonas","date":"2015-03-26T11:41:04.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=usul1202,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pcOBjpMh,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-26T06:02:00.980+0000)\n>\n> So, i don't play kass, but lets give him a fair trial here. \n> \n> Zed: ulting is single target, *PREDICTABLE* (god do i love seeing him ult when I'm playing soraka) and has a long CD.\n\nA long CD?

At 4 stacks (the max) it's barely close to a non-crit ADC basic attack. The area? 150 range (melee range) around him. Hydra has a larger AoE than that.\n \n> 2: blink. it dodges all skill shots, something that cannot be said for most of the above. especially with the viegar stun changes, this is powerful.\n\nIt does if you have very fast reflexes. The cast time is actually enough that if a Nidalee spear is going to hit you and you try to ult away it still hits.  \n\n> 3: CD. He can use it continuously throughout a fight. its not just an engage, it's a pure damage source. one of his largest in a team fight. that doesn't apply to many of the above.\n\nContinuosly = 4 times? Unless you're trying to chase down someone with a few hundred HP you're not using it throughout a fight even if you can.

Like if that Lee Sin fellow had one, or Zed, Ahri, Jax, J4, Nidalee, Shaco... plenty of others but these are probably the most reliable. That's not counting those who have stealth. Are they on the same cooldown? No but they offer a lot more flexibility in their use than a straight forward move.\n\nOh no! Kassadin moved slightly closer to me. I'd better stand still because that is his biggest counter, right? Zed moves closer? It's to engage and ult likely with you dying. Same for Lee, J4, Nidalee, Shaco...... Other champions burst you in a second or less. Kassadin has his ult to wear you down gradually. Only super late game or when really fed can he come close to doing relatively high damage but even that is low compared to other champions. The only thing that makes people cry \"OP OP!\" is that his mediocre ult gives him sticking power. His is better than most but so what? We have top tier junglers, mids, adc, support and top lane. Each brings something unique be it massive range (Xerath), high mobility with damage (Ahri), team engage (Sivir) .... you get the point.

(which calls attention to it's invisibility issue, but that's not the topic) \n\nXin: we're looking at ignoring front lines, not their kit. you're literally comparing a sticky bruiser to a mobile mage by pointing at the power of a sticky bruiser. not a fair comparison.\n\nFizz: you said he does damage with his abilities. yes he does. the point still stands, if he uses them to engage, chances are he doesn't last long in your team, unless hes building tank fish.\n\nnow for Kass:\n1: not small. because individual AA's surely don't make up the direct source of damage of ADC's, the tank melting role. Its not his only ability. what i'm saying is that it does AoE  damage and serves as an attack with a low CD. it's not going to be Dunk or an execute.\n\n2: That is completely range dependant on if you get hit or not. if you're going to ult there, know your positioning. the issue i bring up is it bypassing walls or anything else, like viegars stun.\n\n3: IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT DAMAGE. its about wasting (enemy) moves. its about getting in range. its about him being difficult to hit, getting in, and getting out. that's what the CD is for, and why its such a hard to balance move. \n\n4: You're making unfair comparisons again, but i'll address every single one of them. Lee sin: he has options. possibly too many. but he's not going to be using gap closers as continuous dodges and he has extreme counterplay if you're good (it's a dash with a set target. interruptible, CCable throughout). J4: again, bruiser with a gap closer. hes cutting his damage by using his basic  ability to engage, and the point of his ult is for the enemy to NOT escape (something that rift-crawl counters). Nidalee: already addresed on using it as an engage. it has a longer CD as a disengage, and an awful range as one as well. Shaco: I love shaco, but if you play him, you know you get a choice, engage or disengage. the Q CD is just too long for both unless you're Shaclone and useing that ult to be tricksy. (which, btw, is the ROLE of shaco, to be a tricksy assassin. not a power engager)\n\nAs for something unique, Kass define(d) short range mobilty. yes lee has those nice long range ones with his Q and W, but they have decent CD's, and hes not going to spend the fight all over the place like kass is. that is kass's role, to be everywhere in a team fight. he's not a long engager, and to say 'he's not unique because his ability doesn't fit other champion's roles better' isn't fair to him. \n\nAs for the nerf process, i like it actually. it hurts, but its better than the alternative. this way, they fix the immediate problem, then can safely work on tuning. if they reversed it (slow nerfs) then he's overpowered until they pick the right numbers to hit, a dangerous game on someone who is very finicky like kass.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Misys","date":"2015-03-26T06:08:11.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"1.

Much shorter CD, and while talons ult scales to .9 (with a decent enough base damage) it only hits once per movement phase. \n\nIrelia follows suit with an ult that doesn't damage like kass's does in a team fight, khazix would be unfair to compare, but lets go for it. that W with 3 shots instead of 1 is a null gain. rengars ult adds utility and one empowered move, but thats not where his power is at. malzahar's ult is almost useless in a team fight because of it's range and interruptability. \n\nThe point here isn't the comparisons, its the fact that the moves ARE NOT FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. you compared kass's utility engage/escape with 2 of the highest damage ults in the game, and a untargetable dodge on a CD 4 times longer, that does FAR less damage because it's an AP scaling abiltiy, and fizz's mostly build ad now. Kassadin will ALWAYS lose a comparison game if you're comparing him to other people's strong points. its a straw man argument that doesn't help anyone, since following it won't fix the issues that actually effect this champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Reazale","date":"2015-03-26T23:38:18.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Point taken, +1.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trumpet","date":"2015-03-26T16:30:35.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi empowered AA returns 40% of missing mana (on champion hit).

Katarina can run away with the same tactics as Kassadin, provided that she has a ward, which is not hard to come by.

She also does not have to be \"smart\" with her shunpo&#039;s as she&#039;s a resourceless champion.

Also the damage on his ult is laughably small - the rework change did a good job in completely wrecking its damage.\n\n>It would allow him to seem to be in multiple parts of a team fight at once, allowing him to help his teammates as a \"firefighter\", giving help to those who need it.

He just needs to get his old (not worthless) slow back, and possibly his silence. \n\nAlso, as an assassin, his job is not to protect, it's to murder things.\n\n> *Rework his ult to be similar to Ahri&#039;s ult, with a twist.*\n> When he ults, give him four stacks to use, which have a 100 second cooldown after 15 seconds.
