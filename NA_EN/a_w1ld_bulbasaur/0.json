I like all of the music you guys do. From login screens to champ select, i love it all. It has an orchestra + modern feel to it whenever i listen to it closely. Sometimes  just sit in the login screen listening to the music until it repeats. Keep doing the good work Music team! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-01-31T19:42:39.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks so much for your kind comments, guys!

As a musician myself, I always look forward to the login screens just for the epic music. Braum, Super Galaxy Rumble, URF, Lissandra, and Dragon Trainer Tristana are some of my favorites. I also love Summomer Rift's ambience sounds too. Keep up the good work Music Team! You send dreams :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holyfrost Sub","date":"2016-01-30T07:55:12.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you man. I love music that can paint feelings and moods in my mind. The riot orchestra team is very good.\n\nI like guild wars 2 and somewhat world of warcraft (wow has great music but terrible balance in pvp and boring gameplay) I also enjoyed starwars and lord of the rings.\n\nMy favorite instrument is the erhu. A chinese violin. A spike fiddle as they call.\n\nMost people analyze music (especially ones with lyrics) but they cannot hear music with their feelings or heart. \n\nThanks riot for making good music. You have spirit and depth.","replies":[]}]}
