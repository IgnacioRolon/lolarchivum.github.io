If you back against him after killing him it makes your game crash with an error telling you &quot;Ezreal_Pulse_1&quot; and if you try and reconnect to the game it keeps giving you this error. It also tells you to reinstall, which I have done twice, and every time I play against him it does the same thing to me and my teammates..\n\nThere is some type of exploit going on and it needs to be figured out because people are doing it on purpose.\n\nA few extra details:\nThey always mid.\nThey always start with two mana regen charms.\nIt always happens when you kill them once and back to base.\nIf you reconnect it gives you the error, and I know its nothing to do with my installation because I&#039;ve reinstalled twice tonight to each of my SSD&#039;s with fresh installations because they&#039;ve never had League on them before.\n\nIt&#039;s some new exploit because only a small number are doing it and who the hell plays Ezreal mid lately.\n\nIf I get punished for \"leaver\" or whatever it would be I'm literally going to rage and charge back and make a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T20:06:05.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey desiccating! \n\nSorry for the delay here - weekends tend to be a bit more quiet here.\n\nI did some investigating and I was unable to repro the issue you're having. Would you mind sending over your R3dlogs? \n\nA match log is created each time you play a game. It contains vital information about your loading process and will log any errors that occur during the course of the game. So, in this case, you'll need to attach a R3dlog that had the crash occurring. Any one of the logs will be fine! \n\nEach file appears like this: [yyyy-mm-ddT15-40-03] _r3dlog.txt, where yyyy-mm-dd is the date of the match played.\n\n**You can find them here:** C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Game - R3d Logs\n\nI would also suggest trying a client repair, as opposed to reinstalling. A client repair will fix any jumbled files. You can do this by launching the client and on the launch screen clicking the [?] in the upper right hand side and then selecting Repair. \n\nOnce we have your Re3dlogs, we can do a bit more digging.
