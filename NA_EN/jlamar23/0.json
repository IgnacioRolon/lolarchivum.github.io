You know like even though every log prior to patch showed little to no packet loss and an average 50 ms than since the patch its been border 220 ms with spikes of 500+.\n\nYep its \"our\" network for sure.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kEVn0n","date":"2016-12-09T20:45:48.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"use hotspot shield, it might be internet traffic from your neighbors","replies":[{"poster":"Beastofall69","date":"2017-01-21T08:28:34.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tired it but still same thing, any other fixes","replies":[{"poster":"kEVn0n","date":"2017-02-13T22:53:05.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my problem was the speed and duplex in my network connection, it was too low for gaming so my ping was high, so i increased it and it worked","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beastofall69","date":"2017-01-21T08:20:01.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a great internet too just as he said everything runs crystal clear for me but this game somethings is going crazy with that spikes.
