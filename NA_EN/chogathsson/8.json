That&#039;s not hatedaddy, that name is ChoGathsSon.\" Allow me to explain my fellow summoners! You see, the last few days my demeanor has been rather confrontational and hostile. As a result, I may have gone a little overboard and Riot decided to step in and ban my main from the forums for 7 days. Alas, my troubled frame of mind was due to the fact someone stole my Transformers Walkie Talkie. I&#039;ve since found it and I&#039;ve changed my perspective and have decided to improve my attitude. I am here to kill you with kindness!\n\nNow, we move onto the guide that will teach you how to deal with this Ionian stupid idiot Zed, I swear to god he&#039;s a rip off of Lord Zed from power rangers but riot might ban me for pointing this out. Yolo. But before beginning, please listen to this stimulating track on loop to help you focus on reading such a pro as heck guide:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Me3t0JbNz_4\n\nSo friends, what is Zed? Zed is an energy based melee assassin with mobile tools and skill shots aimed to help him kill targets quickly. You might have known this already, maybe not. Quite frankly all of the energy champs appear to have Ionian ties but let&#039;s be real, in a few patches all of Ionia is just going to be retconed to Frejlord or Shurima. But that&#039;s besides the point. Rip lore. Back on topic....\n\nBefore we get into weaknesses, let&#039;s start talking about his strengths. Early on, Zeds energy actually hold back his all-in potential (minus not having death Mark available obviously). So his early lane phase is going to focus on tossing out some Qs, using his W to extend his range and toss out Q/Es and otherwise just poke/farm. Post 6, he will still play this style until he&#039;s comfortable enough with the prospect of going all-in on you. Once he gets some items, he&#039;s an exceptional duelist against a variety of different classes. He can kill squishy targets relatively quickly, because of his passive plus his itemization, he&#039;s also very effective at dueling tanks. Simply put, Zed is a champion aimed at catching single targets out, dueling in split push scenarios and like any champion in this game, snowballing. He&#039;s also a strong auto attack based champions as well because of his item pathing (think Botrk and Ghostblade here for increased DPS) as well as his passive. While many AD casters still have umph behind their auto attacks because of AD, keep in mind Zed and his normal build path and passive give him incredibly strong DPS with auto attacks alone.\n\nWe&#039;ve covered his strengths on a basic level. Let&#039;s get to his weaknesses.\n\nBelieve it or not, Zed is actually relatively weak at early levels. His energy costs restrict him from spamming his full combo without leaving himself as a sitting duck. He&#039;s level dependent like any caster and this is the biggest thing you have to keep in mind, *he is a melee champion in a lane that is dominated by ranged champions.* His living shadow is very good at closing the gap, but it&#039;s not a good idea early on to ever shadow into melee range of an enemy and start auto attacking them - minion aggro alone will slaughter you. So the majority of his damage in lane will come through Qs and Es from his shadow form. Stand away from his shadow to avoid taking Es and look to dodge Qs. Nobody is perfect, you won&#039;t dodge every skill shot but he shouldn&#039;t either. Unless he&#039;s scripting. Wait a minute, has riot acknowledged that yet? Point is this, early laning for Zed is basically poke oriented and like any champ in any circumstance, if you take too much poke and are low, he will go in to kill you if the situation allows it.\n\nLevel 6, not unlike most champions, his play style slightly changes. Without anything other than a long sword, he should not be able to 100-0 you with his R. In fact, in order to do that, you&#039;d basically need to allow him to auto attack you several times after using death Mark. Point is, the less damage you take after he&#039;s used his R, the less damage the pop is going to do (again think of his passive here). In many cases, unless you can just straight up blow him up when he jumps on you (old Syndra comes to mind), you want to run away from him as he jumps on you. If you&#039;re a champion with mobility, wait for him to reappear after casting the death mark then use your mobility spell (there&#039;s a good chance he uses W to catch you but at this point, he can&#039;t slow you unles she HS cutless and you should be relatively close to tower). If you survive above half health, he is prone to dying because death Mark is his all power. \n\nTypically, if you fear your all-in is weaker than Zeds, taking Exhaust as a summoner spell is not a bad idea. Barrier isn&#039;t either, I&#039;d advise only taking that on champions with shields who can amplify the power of barrier like Orianna or Karma. Also, as an immobile mage, this is a build you should consider that I&#039;ve watched work very effectively and was suggested by a good friend of mine, Charles Barklius (dudes master tier, I&#039;d listen)\n\n{{item:1056}} {{item:1056}} start\n{{item:3191}} next item\n{{item:3165}} then finish this\n\nThis path gives you everything you want: flexibility, a mixture of durability, damage, utility and CDR. If you&#039;re doing extremely well, you could probably skip the Morellos and go straight into Zhonyas. If you&#039;re playing it safe and desire the mana regen and CDR, Morellos is the way to go. With this build, so long as you don&#039;t die early on (and frankly you shouldn&#039;t unless getting camped), this build allows you the durability to survive his all in until you can complete Zhonyas or if you feel you&#039;re strong enough, win duels against him.\n\nLate game, Zeds teamfight actually becomes very lackluster. That sounds kind of crazy, right? Let me explain. Yes, he&#039;s mobile. Yes he has tools to get in and out. But watch competitive play. QSS and Zhonyas make it impossible for Zed to kill carries in teamfights. It&#039;s why they elect to split push. Anyway you slice it, if your ADC sticks with it&#039;s front line and support has Exhaust ready, there&#039;s no way a Zed should ever kill an ADC with Qs/Es and AAs alone (I&#039;m saying this knowing QSS is used to remove death mark). When Zed jumps in, exhaust him and apply CC and he will be forced to jump out and retreat with no death mark (and now very little teamfight power) or try to kill a carry through peel which shouldn&#039;t happen: he should explode on contact. I know its not always this black and white and nothing is because comps are different and strategies vary as a result. But this general approach is very effective at dealing with him and the proof is really in the pudding here quite frankly. Just watch pro games and high elo streams. The only way Zed teamfights well is if he&#039;s snowballing out of control; something that applies to every champion, not just zed.\n\nDoes that make sense? I&#039;m hoping this helps now that I&#039;ve given you a more serious (well satire look) perspective on how to deal with him. I will now proceed to the Q and A segment!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nQ: \"HateDaddy, Zed always kills me, how do I stop dying to him??\"\n\nA: well little Timmy, quit eating Qs and respect his Shadow Q/E. If he is using shadow to harass every time it&#039;s available, call for a GANK as well. He has no form of natural escape when using his W this way!\n\nQ \"But HateDaddy, why do I have to build Armor against zed as a mage? I should always be able to rush chalice no matter what!\"\n\nA: well little Bobby, MAGES have what I like to call first world problems. They have the most overpowered, erm, best itemization in the game that allows them to have both offense and defense as well as utility in their items. Check yourself before you wreck yourself.\n\nQ: \"but HateDaddy, Sona needs buffs badly\"\n\nA: *Blood Vessel pops in left eye*; *forces a grin* go play in traffic\n\nQ \"thanks HateDaddy, this was a great guide and it helped me! You&#039;re such a swell guy!\"\n\nA: well thanks little Ricky, anything for the children.\n\n___________________________\n\nThis concludes this guide.

This isn't just Zed. So why is this a problem with Zed, with only one long range poke ability, when it's not for Jayce? For Kassadin? Corki mid? Because they have long range poke on more than one spell and have mobility as well to go in and execute a target\n\n>people complain about when talking about Nidalee\n\nNidalee mid is garbage at the moment, she's only really good more or less as a jungler.

Yes, he can kill you. Oh my god! Shocker of the century! A champion can kill another champion, what the fuck!!! This is league of legends, welcome to a game where getting poked 50% or below could have you end up dying in the next rotation of spells by the enemy champion. This isn't only specific to Zed and there are several champions who have a much easier time getting on top of you to get off their rotation. \n\nYou're not even saying anything. You're saying what Zed can do and you're refusing to acknowledge that every step of the way, you can play around it until you decide at 30% hp you're going to stick around and wonder what goes wrong?

You shouldn't constantly eat zed Qs during early lane. And if he's using W to extend his range, you can easily just a walk away from his shadow and take advantage of your range as a *ranged champion*. You bring up poke as if Zed himself is immune to it, for some reason that mindset is a thing. I don't know why.\n\nWhen Zed uses death mark, you use your mobility spell as soon as he appears on top of you again if you're mobile. He uses W to continue chasing but has no way of sticking to you now. He uses flash? You use flash. Unless ungodly fed, he shouldn't 100-0 you under those circumstances. If you're immobile, it's a bit more complicated than that and becomes more champion specific. Either way, level 6 shouldn't be an INSTA kill and he shouldn't be snowballing for that many kills of you itemize properly.\n\nHis clean up as an assassin is actually pretty average. LeBlanc, Kassadin, Talon are far superior because of point and click gap closers or more spammable mobility and not depending on one large ability to 100-0 an enemy squishy.\n\nIt's like you literally didn't read anything I say or at least take it into consideration. And if that's the case and we are basing this on whose word is more likely to be correct, it's mine because I'm not bronze V like you are (my main is plat 1; check it out: HateDaddy).

Yes, you can poke him down from long range as well, but the longer the range is, the easier it usually is for Zed to dodge it. So trading with him definitely isn't easy.\n\nThere are only a handful of champions in the game that have the mobility to outrun his ultimate. Everyone else is pretty much screwed. \n\nI will agree with you that his clean up is pretty standard for assassins, but assassins are way above the average for champions in the game due to the very nature of what they do. \n\nYour article is good and I am going to try that early item build on my mages against him. But the biggest problem is that if you go even in lane or get slightly ahead, any smart Zed player then roams to another lane gets a kill and then you are behind again. That is what makes him such a toxic champion.\n\nAs a final note, even though this account is Bronze V, that shouldn't automatically discount my comments. I have played plenty of games with and against Diamond and Plat players and held my own.

My reply was slightly tongue in cheek, but addresses a lot of the concerns a LOT of people have when playing against a Zed.\n\nI said you either didn't read it or acknowledge it, there's a difference. The things people complain about regarding Zed are pretty stupid. Riot agrees. Zed has 1 spell with extended range, his mobility is tied into a spell that can help his range or close the gap. Anytime you use a gap closer into an enemy champion, it's actually a big risk believe it or not. And if he doesn't use it to gap close and just to poke with Q/E, hes vulnerable to poke, being ganked and so on when his W is down. And you can simply stand away from his shadow form. Again, there's room to play around him every step of the way. People refuse to acknowledge this because most players are bad. Sorry, but it's true. The truth hurts. Want to know how I'm right? Riot hasn't nerfed Zed.\n\n> You don't have to constantly eat Qs. Zed is manaless, he can spam them forever and throws 2 of them when using his shadow so you have even less chance of dodging one. He will eventually whittle you down. Yes, you can poke him down from long range as well, but the longer the range is, the easier it usually is for Zed to dodge it. So trading with him definitely isn't easy.\n\nAnd believe it or not, likewise, it isn't easy for Zed to trade. Yes he's manaless, but as I suggested above, double dorans (which I didn't initially put 2, I meant to) gives you good mana regen and HP + morellos mana regen. What Zed lacks in mana costs, he is awarded more damage. He isn't awarded any real utility or durability in the form of shield or heals (think Karma, Cho etc) like many mages are. This is the epitome of a skill-match up in many cases, which in riot's mind and many people with a healthy perspective on game balance, is a great thing for this game. Not the opposite.\n\n> There are only a handful of champions in the game that have the mobility to outrun his ultimate. Everyone else is pretty much screwed. \n\nAnd for those champions, getting an early armguard + double dorans is the best way to go. They also have range and the burden is on Zed to gap close to them, so in many cases, positioning is a big deal. If Zed isn't stupid fed through bad play by his opponent, he isn't going to 100-0 his enemy mid game. It's just not going to happen, sorry.  \n\n> I will agree with you that his clean up is pretty standard for assassins, but assassins are way above the average for champions in the game due to the very nature of what they do. \n\nYes, there's nothing to discuss here. This is one of their strengths and he's not even the best. Moving on.\n\n> Your article is good and I am going to try that early item build on my mages against him. But the biggest problem is that if you go even in lane or get slightly ahead, any smart Zed player then roams to another lane gets a kill and then you are behind again. That is what makes him such a toxic champion.\n\nAny mage with this build should be out-shoving him because his waveclear isn't nearly as good. Champions will roam, you shove him in and take it upon yourself to roam first. A champion with the capacity to roam doesn't make them toxic because if that's you define as toxic, it's time to delete every champion in this game. Zed's roams aren't even that great for a mid laner. Mage's roams are far more terrifying because of how much stronger they are in skirmishes with AoE etc. Zed is just good at picking off a target and leaving, that's his design. And it's far from toxic. \n\n> As a final note, even though this account is Bronze V, that shouldn't automatically discount my comments. I have played plenty of games with and against Diamond and Plat players and held my own. I also watch a lot of LCS games and see what the pros do as well.\n\nIt doesn't discount your comments. But if we're going to base this on sheer experience of the player, diamond/plat > bronze. Many bronze players lack a good understanding of this game because the level they play at is pretty terrible. Compared to higher level play, where the game picks up and many things are very different, they have better perspective. As a result, they likely understand champion balance a bit better due to having more general game knowledge. That said, being plat/diamond doesn't automatically make you better at arguing, discussing and breaking down points - just better insight on the topic at hand. I'm not going to dismiss you, but I am going to tell you that in most cases, higher elo knowledge trumps lower elo knowledge in both understanding of balance and gameplay. I don't mean to come off as elitist, offensive or flat out mean but that is the cold hard truth.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-04-30T00:59:23.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Riot hasn't nerfed Zed for the same reason they haven't nerfed Lee Sin.

That was an article written about zed on s3 worlds, TWO YEARS AGO. There's a lot wrong with it. I don't recognize the writer for starters, which doesn't mean he isn't a known writer or good one for that matter. Nowhere in it does it cite anything about pros saying Zed is/was op and if it did, IT WAS TWO SEASONS AGO WHERE A SHIT TON OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED.\n\nIt's also worth nothing, since you say Zed hasn't had any nerfs since then aside from his attack speed nerf, that s3 worlds was played on 3.11. That article was written reflecting upon Zeds state in s3. In 3.13, two patches later, Zeds W missile speed was nerfed which was a big deal. Not to mention his ult had some changes back and forth in s4. So yes, since that article was written, he has been nerfed. Not to mention, the opinions expressed in that article are about Zed of s3, not now or even recently. A lot of things have changed regarding him directly and indirectly - you can't even compare them. Even if zed had no direct changes since then, there's constantly indirect buffs and nerfs that take place accordingly due to itemization changes, champion changes, new champions, mechanical gameplay changes and so on. \n\nSo to sum it up, that's a terrible example and isn't even relevant.

Did you use your ult when Zed ulted? What's his HP at? Generally mages are going to outrange his W as the range isn't long, so you should position yourself so that he can't just W/Q/E you and kill you or even gap close to his shadow and try to finish you. That's a generalization though, it's definitely match up specific. But again, I cannot stress the power of exhaust against Zed. Even heal and barrier is worth considering.

His early and midgame are quite strong, but when people start grouping heavily and teamfighting, and when Zhonyas/QSS gets built, he falls off incredibly hard.  I've always seen Zed as that 'win lane, lose game' champion, which is why it frustrates me in particular when I lane against him.\n\nI can get around his strong early and migame, but it usually sets me slightly behind my average CS and kill participation.  The problem this presents in soloqueue (for me) is that if I do slightly below average, then I can't deal with the top laner who traded 4 kills/deaths or the ADC who went legendary in 8 minutes (exaggeration for effect).  I hate relying that heavily on my side lanes performing well to make it through the midgame, but Zed pretty much forces it unless you get a lot of attention from your jungler.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kariu Rena","date":"2015-04-29T15:30:27.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Implying any other mid laner cant one shot you if you are at 50%","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-04-29T15:35:36.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kariu Rena,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XgEZErfp,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2015-04-29T15:30:27.345+0000)\n>\n> Implying any other mid laner cant one shot you if you are at 50%\n\nI never implied that.
