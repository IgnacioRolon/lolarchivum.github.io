The year was 2015. Prior to this, for almost 3 years the class known as fighters/bruisers were complete shit as a class. Riot promised a rework for them in 2013, didn&#039;t happen. Promised them one in 2014, still didn&#039;t happen. Then in 2015, after reworking AP and mages to be even more OP for the 17th time, riot finally got around to the fighter rework. \r\n\r\n&quot;The fighter rework?&quot;\r\n\r\nYes, son. They went on to name it the &quot;juggernaut patch,&quot; also renaming Darius, Skarner, Garen and Morde  juggernauts. In that same patch they finally gave these bruisers direct kit changed and all bruisers much needed itemization they needed for years. It was glorious. The tears from Mage mains and ADC mains screaming broken OP, wtf riot my mandatory class is being threatened again to not be the absolute best class, etc. They wouldn&#039;t stop crying about it and how broken the juggernauts were. \r\n\r\n&quot;Wait dad, people thought the juggernauts were broken?&quot;\r\n\r\nYes, yes they did.\r\n\r\n&quot;What happened that changed that? Nobody don&#039;t thinks that now, dad.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe marksmen rework a few months later\r\n\r\n&quot;Ah fucking ADCs ruin everything&quot;\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s my boy","replies":[]}
