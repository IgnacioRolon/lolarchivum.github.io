Initially I was even under the impression that things were relatively the same, but really they aren't.\n\nThe rules are pretty much the same but the enforcement of those rules is basically one day suspension for the smallest things and eventually banned. For major offenses, I get this. Nobody wanted hentai spam or really fucked up comments/attacks on people being the norm. But we've gone full Lyte here, getting a little chippy with someone basically puts you in ban city.\n\nFurthermore, posting a thread outside of a specific board gives you options of which board you want to post on, GD is not included. The search function works but won't bring up anything from GD threads/posts. And for fucks sakes, its just a little island on the board that just says \"GD.\" It doesn't even say General Discussion.\n\nThey forced us off the old boards when we were relatively happy with it. They claimed the changes we wanted could only be implemented here, which I understand. But its basically become a daycare here. Tamat cries everytime someone drops an F bomb and the mods ban you for telling people to shut up. Whats worse is if you're banned once, it all goes down hill from there. The smallest, most questionable bans will eventually pile up until you are gone. Lyte island whoo.\n\nGD is Riots bastard child and they wanted it dead despite a community that really enjoyed it. Reddit will always be their golden boy and thats that, and they have successfully buried GD.\n\nCall me what you want, say I am salty over a silly one day ban - I will be honest with you, I'm skorpii x10 over it. I tried to enjoy it here and be active and optimistic that we would have a really similar feel to old GD but we just don't because this \"wild wild west\" crap they try to bill it as is nothing more than a nursery where you go into timeout for drinking your bottle before the other kids. And frankly, as it is and with the stupid voting system not requiring you to read the thread itself and the people I really enjoyed being gone, I wash my hands with this mess too.\n\nFantastic job Riot, you really got it right here.","replies":[]}
