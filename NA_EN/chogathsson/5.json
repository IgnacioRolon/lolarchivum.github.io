I hear your immobility argument, I stopped caring when you had 1000+ range on your spells. Not to mention, you have (had) the best itemization in the game since this game has been around. Get over yourselves.\r\n\r\nAssassin mains think having zero counterplay abilities being strong, safe and easy to pull off while safely getting in and out is the trait of a balanced assassin. Zed is a balanced assassin design, Akali is not. Even still, assassins are a hard class to balance and very polarizing, you should understand this the moment you main your this class.\r\n\r\nBruiser mains think they should be able to duel everything, one shot carries because they built 2 damage items, one shot bruisers because they built two damage items, 2 shot tanks because they think that&#039;s fair and still be the 2nd hardest class of champions in the game to kill. Like assassins, this class has historically been a nightmare to balance. It&#039;s not ok for bruisers to stack all tank items and kill everything minus a few unique designs, but that&#039;s besides the point. You can&#039;t anymore and you shouldn&#039;t ever expect to again.\r\n\r\nADC mains think their class should be the strongest class at all points in the game and can&#039;t seem to get over this idea that when you build zero defensive items, you die really fast. They also need to stop thinking their class hasn&#039;t been mandatory for the last 5 seasons because stats show us otherwise.\r\n\r\nSupport mains - what more do you want? You&#039;ve been given a class of champions that are specifically designed to function on low gold income. The sheer power of supports kits alone are overpowered as fuck but kept in line by the fact that riot has intentionally tried to keep them out of solo lanes because solo lane supports have been the most broken things ever. Riot spent two seasons making your class less frustrating to play and they&#039;ve come a long way since s2. Yes you can stand to have a few upgrades but stop pretending riot hates your class and hasn&#039;t paid any attention to it because they have.\r\n\r\nJungle mains, just shut up. You main the most impactful class in the game that has been given the ability to farm just a few camps and reach ridic power spikes. It&#039;s going to come with some frustration given how impactful your role is and continues to be. It&#039;s the most dominant and important class in the early game, your itemization and general champion diversity have been nothing short of the biggest nightmare in the game to balance ever.\r\n\r\nThere it is. I hope after spending time reading this, you&#039;ve decided that you should probably take a step back and keep perspective. I know I get in a little over my head at times and I rethink my stances constantly, especially on my class that I main. It doesn&#039;t hurt to think in this manner and it&#039;s the healthiest perspective to have when it comes to discussing balance because at its core, it reduces your bias towards certain discussions. \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"only zhule","date":"2015-11-05T04:23:12.465+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support.

Because if a mage/utility support has damage, they thrive in a solo lane and offer TOO MUCH utility, especially if their utility scales with a stat they can buy.  Think Top/Mid Lulu of recent seasons, or older, Mid Soraka Starcall spam.  It becomes severely oppressive in solo lanes.  If they lack damage, they still lack tankiness, and only provide the utility.  So they offer something similar to tanks, but die much faster.  On the other side of the coin, if a tank thrives in a solo lane, they typically don't do it at the expense of their lane opponent.  (There are a few notable exceptions that got nerfed, like Maokai when he transitioned from a support jungler to a top lane megatank.)  Generally, the tanks are much easier to punish if they are alone.  Leona and Braum are both just awful in a solo lane because they generally lack damage.\n\nFor me, as a Shen Top main, I still prefer the tanky supports, but that's just my playstyle.  I like Shen and Tahm Kench, but I hate playing as Leona or Braum.  Well, Braum's not so bad, but I would quickly pick Janna or Morg over him.","replies":[{"poster":"only zhule","date":"2015-11-05T09:56:30.743+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is kind of my point as to why i dislike tanky supports.  The idea that you put out roughly the same level of utility as a support mage, but you get to so with considerable less risk. \n\nI'm all for characters having counters, but it after a while of the meta shifting and settling, you can't have 90% of a champion type be bad in their role, and neither give them the tools to play a different spot or be more impactful.  If the meta shifted so that mage characters were bad picks for mid lane (expect 1 or 2 in fringe cases), i wouldn't expect Riot to drop everything and deal with it.  If the meta stayed that way for 8+ months and mage characters were not viable in other roles, i might wonder why Riot doesn't do anything about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2015-11-05T06:13:54.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust me, it's the traditional, NON TANK ones that are long forgotten.
