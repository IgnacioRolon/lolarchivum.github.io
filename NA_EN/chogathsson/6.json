The item as it is can't be good in its current state unless you focus on giving its block and flat HP a buff and remove its sustain. When D-shield was OP in s3, it was because it gave 10hp/5, not because of the health or block. This change wouldn't make an absolute must in any situation, this makes it incredibly powerful vs single target spell spammers and auto attackers. The extra pot really helps, too.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-07-03T20:58:25.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that the block applies before resistances.

When it's been good, it's given champions who aren't supposed to have a good early game a free pass. It CAN'T be as good as the others, it can be way stronger. I think if anything, Riot should focus more on it as a niche item designed to help deal with harass.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChoGathsSon","date":"2015-07-03T21:05:50.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tusutaki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4XElxbWL,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-03T20:58:25.873+0000)\n>\n> You do realize that the block applies before resistances.

That's interesting. \n\nThat still does prove my point though, it's only ever been good when it's hp/5 is absurd. With block and unyielding in the defensive tree, a change to the block passive on d-shield and removal of its sustain plus the decrease in cost would still make it very effective in its niche. \n\nYou don't want this item to be too strong though either, because it can be a very game changing item for weaker early game champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-07-03T21:08:53.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just reduce the cost to 400 or 405 and it's done","replies":[{"poster":"ChoGathsSon","date":"2015-07-03T21:15:05.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sasogwa,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4XElxbWL,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-03T21:08:53.334+0000)\n>\n> Just reduce the cost to 400 or 405 and it's done\n\nagreed\n\nD shield should just be free if you're melee","replies":[]}]}]}
