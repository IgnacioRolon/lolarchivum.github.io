With AP itemization, they&#039;re BURSTING you while also DPSing tanks down instantly. Now I understand the argument that ADC&#039;s do this, too, and that&#039;s true. A full build ADC is going to kill any squishy target relatively quickly, too. But the difference here is AP&#039;s have access to itemization that grants them durability, utility, CDR and invulnerability - while still getting offense through their build pathing. \r\n\r\nTo prove my point, just look at Azir, Ryze and Cass. When they&#039;re good, they ARE DPSing but they&#039;re also 100-0ing teams with burst as well, so it&#039;s a stupid mixture because it&#039;s both burst and DPS and with AP itemization, they gain utility AND they become harder to kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2015-07-02T07:19:26.012+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"ADCs don't just \"dps you\" with full items. They crit you for 800+ damage, over 1k with certain champs (draven, caitlyn passive). That's a lot more than most mages can you hit for. Mages also have cooldowns and most of them have to land their abilities, while an ADC just right clicks on you. In return ADCs have to deal with armor.\n\nSo what exactly do you think Cass should be able to do? if she has worse damage than an ADC, why not just go another ADC mid? Ryze, you have a point, and the new one needs to be \"fixed\" so he can't root you over and over and over again while destroying your entire team.  Azir, eh. I havn't played against him enough to form a solid judgement, but I don't really see him \"bursting anyone from 100%-0\" unless he's disgustingly fed. Have you seen what a disgustingly fed Draven can do? What about a fed Kalista?\n\nYou say mages \"have access to itemization that grants them durability, utility, cdr, and invulnerability.\" Durability and invulnerability are the same thing, but I'll grant you one of those. utility? Where? Supports and tanks have most of the utility items, Ii'm not really sure what you're talking about. Maybe rylais? But ADCS have access to phage / botrk / many more movement speed items. Also, saying their items are better because they give CDR is silly because adcs don't care about CDR for the most part. That's like mages whining that adcs have access to itemization that gives them attackspeed. Furthermore, adcs can easily get CDR if they want it via black cleaver (which is a great item), ghostblade, and / or blue boots / runes. Except they get berserkers, because they don't really care about cdr. \n\nSo, now we've narrowed it down to just durability (i hope). Why do they need more durability? Because if they can't one shot you, then they will die immediately to the ADC without durability. That doesn't sound like a very fun game... it sounds like a very boring fps. Better hope the rocket launcher  hits them, or you will die to machine gun during reloading.

Auto attacks are the primary damage of an AD marksman so attack speed is essentially just lowering the cooldown on their primary damage ability.\n\nAnd durability?  ADCs get lifesteal, dps mages do not.  That's an extremely large benefit.  Mages are also far more limited by mana than ADCs as a general rule.  In the lategame this may not appear to matter as much, but after a big teamfight a mage has to recall because they're low on hp and mana, while a marksman will have half their mana left and get all their hp back by autoing a jungle camp 5 times allowing them to stay on the map and pressure an objective.\n\nSo sure, if you think Zhonyas is better durability than a bloodthirster then maybe you're right.  Personally I'd rather have an AP bloodthirster in my mage build and give up the active though.\n\nAnd I'm not sure what you mean by utility.  If you're referring to aspects of their kit (Azir ult, for example) then that's not really comparable because ADCs all have different kits anyways.  You can't really compare an Azir ult to a Graves or a Caitlyn ult (and hell, let's just mention the utility in a Kalista ult) because they both have completely different purposes and both offer different kinds of utility.

But you don't think that a Cass that builds Rylai's pays for it in her total damage output?\n\nTheres two arguments I see here. One is about DPS mages playing APC and doing just as much or more damage than adc's - or at least with more upfront burst - while maintaining the utility a mage possesses. The other is simply that AP itemization is overpowered, facilitating damage growth on par with AD items while also given extra utility/defense.\n\nFor DPS mages, they do possess utility, but you can't tell me adc's don't as well. Or mobility or self peel. Vayne, Sivir, Ashe, Graves, Tristana, they all have kits with things in them besides damage. They're much more frequently mobile while mages have more cc.\n\nI take exception to the example of Azir, because in my opinion he's overpowered. Yes, he's too good at everything and he doesn't have any weakness besides the skill people keep telling me it takes to play him.\n\nBut as to the AP items, I don't think they keep up with adc dps unless you build the pure damage ones. Stacking the dps multiplers of damage, attack speed, crit, and %armor pen is how adc's damage can explode as their gold does, while defenses can only multiply armor and hp and maybe some attack speed slow.

She needs to get ahead to snowball or she needs a team to forget about her.  She has very little mobility (1 speed up now) and is extremely susceptible to cc and kiting, as she needs to poison someone to destroy them.  Her ult makes this easier, but most assassins can take her down without too much of a hassle, she's just got the DPS to be good in the current meta, but still often can't get ahead because the very tanks she melts can cc her for the opposing mid laner.  High DPS doesn't mean OP, it just means that she'll excel in a drawn out fight while mid laners like Katarina or Leblanc will be happier to wait out her ult and go in for the insta-burst before running out (unless kata gets a kill, then she just bursts some more).  Cass struggles against a lot of mid laners and is very mana hungry early plus suffers from being extremely easy to gank if she ever gets to pushing her lane.  Her power is mostly in team fights, and if your team cant win those, split-pushing or getting some picks is always a good option.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-07-02T06:14:16.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure about Snake Lady ~~but I fucking hate Ryze he feels OP even if he isn't which I am unsure of~~\n\nI mean they're totally balanced and stuff and are completely fun and fair to lane against!\n\n*sweats as Rito's gun is lowered from my forehead*","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-07-02T09:09:42.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cassiopeia is everything but not balanced.
