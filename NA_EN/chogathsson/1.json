I simply place in plat 3-1 and get Diamond and AFK for the season. This climb has reminded me of the journey, the grind, the climb - though it hasn&#039;t been that challenging, it has reminded me of what you need to do as a player to climb and I think that&#039;s what gives me a good track record here given I&#039;ve done this climb twice (s3 went from silver 1 to plat 1 and now G4 to plat 2 and will hit Diamond in a few days)\r\n\r\nAsk away","replies":[]}
