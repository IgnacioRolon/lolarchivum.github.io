My whole team then tries to get the game to end faster than waiting for the 15 minute ff because we didn't have much time to get the custom game on the road. All 5 of us were running it down all game, and i don't know if anyone even on the enemy team reported me because we were having dance parties, and fountain races, etc. For some reason out of all 4 of my friends (all doing the same thing i was, some with even more deaths in enemy fountain than me) didn't receive any penalty, but i get a 14 day ban which also comes with an honor reset. This sucks because now anything bad i ever do will get me perm banned if i have read other stories correctly. Is there anything that can be done about this.

Since it's not chat-related, it skips the chat restrictions and goes right to a 14-day suspension. It doesn't matter that your whole team did it; it's still against the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"xCoffeeex","date":"2019-03-03T11:12:08.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"but what i don't seem to understand then is why only i was issued the 14 day and none of my friends were","replies":[{"poster":"Stand Still Plz","date":"2019-03-03T11:27:00.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its triggered by deaths pět minute. You had most deaths like 12 in 14 min. That can be the case. Hashinshin got 14-day ban for having quite similar score and he was actually trying to win.
