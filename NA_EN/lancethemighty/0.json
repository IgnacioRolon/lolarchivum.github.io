I got autofilled ofc but it was to botlane so I just hovered Yasuo anyway. Well my mid laner bans it and tells me to pick a \"real adc\" while picking ezreal himself ( my only adc ). His name was pretty offensive so I decided that I would just leave when the game started and wait it out till next game, you know cause theres no punishment for leaving. I flashed in base, bought items, and placed a ward. However it still asked for a remake at 3 minutes. Well two things. First good on riot for revamping remakes, and second I was autofill protected when I got out. So a 5head idea occured to me, what if I just forced all my autofill games to be remakes? You aren't going to get punished so it would be actually greatly in your favor. What do you guys think.","replies":[]}
