I have tried multiple solutions, like changing the Protocol 4 DNS address to 8888/8844, adding Riot to my hosts in windows/system 32/drivers/etc, launching game as admin, checking my firewall, none have worked. This really sucks and am looking for a solution...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T03:54:08.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RADS errors are typically a good sign that your OS doesn't have the right permissions in place to allow League to launch. Basically, your OS needs to decide whether a program is alright or not, and if it doesn't have permissions set up it will outright shut down that program.\n\nRun through our [**Permission Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and you should be able to get those settings in place.
