Yeah it matches the in-game look, which I'll admit is really good, but the splash art itself I think is very lackluster. Mostly from the distortion of the limbs and all. Kinda like how the new Ahri splash art makes no sense on the angel she's jumping from versus the way all her tails are moving. Weirdly enough, I just had a match that was Tristana adc with a Poppy support, and they were not bad together. Especially considering our opponents were Ezreal and Sona.\n\nTLDR: I like that Poppy is getting an update if not a \"yordlefacation\".","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-03-08T20:39:10.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg O_O \n\n*The Red Goat has returned.*\n\n((Sorry people, this guy had the first CCC I'd ever been exposed to, and at the time I was really new to the forums.

Also I would love to see what you can come up with for a re-worked version (lots happened since the end of season 4 started and all)! I also have a concept I will be trying to post and once I have it up I would love for you to come tell me what you think of it.
