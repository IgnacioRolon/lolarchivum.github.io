Sometimes it's caused by not having the right permission settings in place, other times it can actually be caused by certain firewall and antivirus. At this point with it crashing so often on you, I'd like to have you go ahead and grab the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with both **Reinstall and Clean Uninstall** checked. Make sure you install and run the HRT as admin as well.\n\nIf that's not helping, keep talking with the tech agents in your ticket. They'll be able to dig through your logs to see what might be going wrong in your ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"AZ Frost","date":"2017-10-30T02:02:05.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Completely uninstalled the game and reinstalled it to see if this works (currently another  30 mins of patching left)\n\nWhat am I to do about getting the hard LP loss just outside of promos (trying to get gold b4 the 7th).

Screw me getting to gold this season! I got another leaverbuster bc of this game. I can have my gaming laptop on all day with no issues until this last patch. \n\nIt literally shuts off my comp and i have to reboot and log in. Once in champ select and 4 times during a game! It only shuts off when the game is running and nothing else.\nI can play World of Tanks or other games just fine, but this one is screwing up hard. What the hell is going on?
