I go into a custom game and all seems good. hotkeys reset as I wanted. But when I go into a normal game it still uses the old settings &amp; hotkeys. \r\n\r\nalso in the options menu in the client it uses old hotkeys. The reason I want to reset this way is becuase there are keybindings I want to get rid of and this seems the only way for those.
