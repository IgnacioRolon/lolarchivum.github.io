I checked my task manager and found the lolclient.exe did ran in the processes tab, but it just never come up. I followed the guides on the game support, re-patched the game, reinstalled the game, ran the launcher as Administrator, tried everything I can found on the board, and nothing works for me. Another issue that makes me even more confused is that for a few times the client actually did worked (5 times during these days)  and the login screen showed up, but not again for the next 10~20 attempts with same settings. I used to play league until May with the same laptop I am using right now and it worked perfectly, so I have no idea about whats going on now.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T23:59:46.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time when this happens, it's caused by an unstable connection to the servers.
