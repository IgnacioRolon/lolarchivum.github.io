Yeah, got 5 min penalty for dodging and on the next one i got 15 min all of this for no responsability of my own, the game just got stuck. \n\nI think you guys should have at least fixed this major issue before opening the beta world wide because this is huge, i know it's a beta but still at least you could give the players free dodges on the new client because people is getting punished for no fault of their own. But don't get me wrong, the new client is marvelous, looks beautifull but is missing like small simple features, but anyway, just fix that champ select which right now is the most important thing, so i'm sorry guys, i'm going back right now to the old client {{champion:32}}  until you guys fix it. \n\nGood luck on that, on the rest ? Good job !\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n","replies":[{"poster":"PhoolsGold","date":"2016-11-21T05:16:08.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you go to the old client?
