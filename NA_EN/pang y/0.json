Potential for abuse is NOT a reason to dismiss a change. EVER. I've said that for near 25 years now.  It's not OK to dismiss changes purely because they can be abused.  It's the developer's job quite literally to code out that potential for abuse or provide safeguards.\n\nI'm not sure if this idea is good or not.  But I can't stand people just bashing the idea for no reason at all like you and Ulanopo did.\n\nJust hope something changes.  The status quo for player behavior and matchmaking is just abysmal.

What are you talking about?\n\nIt's actually not at all.  Think about it.  Apple wants people to use their Apple Wallet so they can charge a fee.  But if their security isn't done just right... then people can abuse it.  Does Apple not release their new wallet? NO. They make sure the security fucking works.  Or go really basic and disturbing... what if the Wright Brothers thought... no this aircraft can be abused... someone can fly into building with it.  And never released their designs?  Or maybe the guys making Glade shouldn't have created one of the most loved household cleaning products because people can huff it (please don't try this, it's extremely dangerous)... Potential for abuse is just a poor excuse to be lazy.\n\nEVERY LINE OF CODE, EVERYTHING YOU PRODUCE, EVERYTHING YOU SEE CAN BE ABUSED. It's the job of testing and product safety to make sure the risk is minimized.  It's the job of the developer to figure out if that risk can be minimized while still upholding their original design.  It's NEVER the job of anyone creating something to dismiss an idea purely because \"it can be abused\".  Because NOTHING would be made in this world if that was the case.\n\nSorry, but I've had this argument for years and not a single person has even made me think about changing my mind. I'm an inventor. I have 6 patents in chemistry, a couple of them because someone, somewhere figured \"that can't be done or shouldn't be done\".  Excuses are purely excuses and have no relevance in development.  And \"potential for abuse\" is just a shitty excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-12-12T17:54:12.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand what you're saying, but the EASE of potential of abuse has to come into play. \nYou may get more business at your store if you put all your merchandise outside and have an honor system for pay.

There's quite literally zero reason to look at a half baked idea, say \"oh but someone might abuse it\" and dismiss it.  Because then NO IDEA EVER WOULD MAKE IT TO MARKET... You have to take risks.  Quite literally there is no place for the \"potential for abuse\" fairy in the development process.  That's a job for testing to ensure the design works as intended.  You can certainly think the idea isn't good or provides a loophole or something like that which would counteract another system.  Fair enough.  But dismissing it purely because people can abuse it is just complete idiocy.  For this idea, I think offering a shot at redemption might help. It hasn't worked with some experiments in the past but if you can make it to 30 without any penalty and did it because you might be able to get your plat rank back then maybe there's enough incentive.  It's not guaranteed. But it's something and I'd like to see something (maybe not this, but something) which addresses the recidivism rates and encourages reform.  I refuse to believe as Ulanopo does that if permabanned RIOT \"simply doesn't want you playing here\". Because that's what you use IP bans to accomplish.  The penalties they put out are just that.  They're meant to take away YOUR part of the toy.  Not take out the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-12-13T08:07:13.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, let's start from the top:\n\n>Potential for abuse is an extremely poor developers excuse.\n\nFeasibility, however, is a good excuse.

That's no reason to jump in front of a train. \"You have to take risks\" is not the same as \"You have to take every risk and ignore any dangers\".\n\n>That's a job for testing to ensure the design works as intended.\n\nAgain, feasibility comes first.

Partially because they don't really accomplish that, but mainly because you simply don't use IP bans. At all. Ever.\nThey're extremely easy to circumvent if you know what you are doing. But even if you don't know what you are doing, you might circumvent them without actually even intending to do so (my IP address automatically changes every 24 hours) and they have a huge risk of collateral damage if multiple people happen to play on the same IP address.\n\ntl;dr: Risks and feasibility of a project **need** to be considered and can absolutely be valid reasons to dismiss it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-12-12T19:02:36.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/59yU9dAK-a-way-to-retain-your-rank-from-your-old-account-onto-a-new-account?comment=0007\n\n> The idea behind a perma-ban is that we wan't them to stop playing League of Legends.

He obviously was wrong. We don't need to see a reform card to know that.  What he's asking for is something fairly interesting... a chance at redemption.  There's a lot of great ideas on the forums, such as this one, that RIOT simply refuses to consider on principle. And not very good principles at that.\n\nIf perma banned, I don't think RIOT wants us to quit playing altogether.  IP bans are extremely effective at this and have worked since the 1970's.  They don't do this and in fact most people are encouraged to make a new account and try again.\n\nThe road to ruin right now is a short one with a sudden stop.  The road to recovery and change is excruciatingly long.  The day we stop focusing on what people did wrong and rather on how to improve the overall game and behavior of players needs to happen. And it seems you couldn't give a fuck about that from most of your responses.  Hope you take some time to really think man. It's one thing to reiterate what RIOT has said.  It's a completely different and fucked up one to hold everyone to every aspect of their absurdity.
