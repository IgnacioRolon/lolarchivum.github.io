This video is more than enough evidence to prove that he has not only reformed, but be a model player in league of legends. He even recieved a teamwork ribbon, and those are almost impossible to get. What does the rest of the community think about this.

Not to say that he couldn't be reformed, but one game is not proof.  If he truely wants to get unbanned, then he should work with Riot support, like Incarnation did.  He won't get his accounts back, but he might be able to play again, which basically means he can stream again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2016-09-14T15:10:04.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol do you watched every single game, he played?\nOr just this one?\nIf you only watched this one, how the fuck you can know \"how much\" he reformed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-09-14T14:36:10.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like you're the boosted animal that's unforgiving of Riot banning the ever living crap out of Tyler1's accounts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zykklon B","date":"2016-09-14T13:49:09.223+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"He is reformed","replies":[{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2016-09-14T14:06:03.212+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Little too late now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Irene Fanboy","date":"2016-09-14T14:15:31.528+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"his stream is hilariously entertaining. is he toxic? yeah. what gamer isn't. as long as he doesn't int or troll in his games, he should be good to go imo. flaming teammates happens all the time. if you wanna ban him for being toxic, just get rid of 95% of the league community and have fun managing a game with 100 well-mannered kids with no social skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-09-14T14:50:20.996+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Irene Fanboy,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=67wigde4,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-09-14T14:15:31.528+0000)\n>\n> his stream is hilariously entertaining. is he toxic? yeah. what gamer isn&#x27;t. as long as he doesn&#x27;t int or troll in his games, he should be good to go imo. flaming teammates happens all the time. if you wanna ban him for being toxic, just get rid of 95% of the league community and have fun managing a game with 100 well-mannered kids with no social skills.\n\nYou do realize one of the reason for his bans was because he was intentionally feeding.
