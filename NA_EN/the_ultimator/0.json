In fact, they put the animation of the new Singed Skin \"beekeeper\" to all Singed Skin. Which create a tons of bugs. Like, with the Dark Scourge, the head pass throught his shield when he run, the animation of the Augmented skin is totally bugged, the \"Surf\" skin too.\n\nI report the bug, I hope they will correct this very soon.","replies":[]}]}
