Most people bandwagon hate on riot. I don't have any issue with them, but when I throw ranked games and get reported because my toaster of a pc can't run swain is super annoying. Come on, Riot. You're really pissing off your playerbase here. Now, I can't play ranked unless I give up my ban on a champ that I could totally beat if he didn't break the game.\n\nEdit: Spelling because I'm a monkey.

If you add a setting to your game.cfg file.\n\nCfg file is in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n\nYou will need to add it under the [Performance] section.\n\nLiveProfile=1\n\nIf you have that section included in your game.cfg, when you finish a game, it will generate a log that we can use to analyze the performance. You can find that log here: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Performance Logs\n\nWith a format like \"2017-12-06T22-05-40_PerfDump.rpd\"\n\nIf you set up that LiveProfile setting and generate any logs like that, we could use them to look more into the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Specy3","date":"2018-02-08T05:00:31.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Live profiling?
