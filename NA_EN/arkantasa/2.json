I don't play {{champion:27}}, and love the Talon skin. But if the team has seen the number of people who just wanted the particle to be blue, to fit the theme of the skins, why won't you consider changing them? Blue in Normal and Colourblind, Doesn't seem like too difficult a change, but then again i'm not experienced in the field at all. Merely a thought/question from the mind of a Web Dev/Designer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-04-30T00:47:00.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=iKzfmsH5,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-04-29T20:26:39.637+0000)\n>\n> We won't be changing the particles for SSW Singed, unfortunately. \n> \n> This was an error on our part, but as you've seen, using colorblind mode will still make the appearance of having blue particles.
