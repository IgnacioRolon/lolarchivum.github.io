Lowering the sound of my PC would mean I would need to turn it back up during the game or when I am with friends. I have been simply muting it lately, has this option not been implemented yet or am I just a little more {{champion:64}} (blind) than what my doctor told me? Thank you for your time :D","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-06T19:03:18.324+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"More audio settings will be added.
