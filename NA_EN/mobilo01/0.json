I for example thought about Blitzcrank, whose passive scales with his mana. So if you want to build him tanky against AD you can build these &quot;Frost&quot; items, but if you want to build tanky against AP you got to buy Banshee&#039;s or Spirit Visage. Those are nice items as well, but it would be awesome if there would be at least one item like the Gaunlet which costs about 2800 gold and gives you 60-70 magic resist, 400-500 mana and 10-20% cooldown reduction for example. This would make mana-based tanks (even tho there might not be that many), and tanks in general who want some pure magic resist, a bit more fun to play i think.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, have a nice day","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-03-05T11:37:46.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A fourth spellblade for MR wouldn't be awful but I don't think it's necessary.
