It looks great - but there are a few things that need improvement in order for this to truly replace GD.\n\nI'll list the things I have personally noticed, and I'll add anything that you guys suggest.\n\n1. Quotation: \nThe current quote system is ugly and nearly unreadable. The old system was plenty fine, and I think it's fair to say a full port of the old GD system would be perfect. What this means is that the quotes should include the name of the poster you're quoting, and it should also NOT include any quotes that post happened to contain. This last point is pretty key, I don't think anyone likes looking at huge chains of text during long conversations.\n\n2. Pictures:\nThere are some big improvements here, specifically in the area of GIFs, embedded videos, and the cute little summoner spells. But when it comes to posting pure JPEGs, the new system frankly sucks. It either lists your picture as an attachment, or it forces you to embed through an outside source (like imgur), and seems to cut off the picture at random. If you're going to support pictures, just go all the way. Let us post what we want, otherwise it becomes an ugly mess of needing to click links just to see a picture. Also, and while I haven't tested this out fully, I'm getting that there are some bizarrely strict restrictions on how many pictures you can post at once. RIP picture threads? Also, it appears that we aren't able to place pictures where we want inside our posts, they just show up at the end.\n\n3. Avatars:\nHonestly this isn't the biggest deal for me, since I'm confident the FEK crew will have avatars up and running soon enough. But really, you guys spent all this time on the new boards and ignored the overwhelming demand for avatars? Seems odd.\n\n4. Notifications:\nI've noticed the notification section that tells you about people quoting/responding to you is rather buggy. It frequently shows notifications even after I have looked at the posts in question. I'm not sure what the source of this bugginess is, but it could use some work. Personally I would be ok if the notification system automatically reset to zero every time you click the button.\nEdit: So I think I've found what I consider to be the problem. The notification that someone has replied to you doesn't go away until after you click that little button in the top right - even if you have already read the post in question. I'm not sure how easy that would be to fix, but it's annoying to see the notification and think, \"Oh, there's a new reply!\" even when it's the same post you just saw.\n\n5. Upvote/Downvote:\nI'll admit this one is more controversial, since there was a pretty large school of thought on GD suggesting that the ability to upvote/downvote a thread itself lead to a less productive environment. That being said after experiencing it for ourselves, I've seen a lot of people complain about not being to upvote or downvote the first post in a thread, and I rather agree. I know this is on your radar here, and I think it would be a good idea to implement. Honestly I would miss seeing some of the more epic threads on GD that have 1k+ upvotes. Edit: Someone come up with the idea that OP's should have the downvote threshold so that the community can remove the spamming PhaneSorter type, while still keeping a more positive environment around your average thread.\n\n6. Aesthetics:\nOn a more personal note, although I've seen this thought echoed by plenty of other people, the bar on the left is large and cumbersome. I think we would be better off with a dropdown menu near the top, although I was always terrible at website design in school.\n\n7. Most Recent Poster:\nI'll edit in something I personally kind of miss. I liked having the most recent poster being listed by name under each thread. In a forum full of people whom are familiar with each other, it was kind of cool seeing your thread being bumped by people you like.\n\n8. Color Scheme:\nMany people have voiced complaints about the color contrasts here being difficult to read, or hard on the eyes. Personally I rather like the current scheme, but adding additional options should frankly be a pretty easy and easy fix. Again this is something that FEK addressed in the past, but should also be on your list of ways to improve this forum.\n\n9. Text Formatting:\nThere appears to be no way to customize your posts to include different text layouts. You cannot center them, or change font, or highlight anything. Given that this was a painless option in the old forums, there's really no reason not to include it here. The current auto formatting is alright, but the ability to customize is pretty important for the more creative thread creator.\n\n\nI feel like I had some other points in mind, but I can't think of them off the top of my head. I'll update the list with other people's ideas/responses as necessary.\n\nPlease feel free to add your own ideas/arguments/insight on what Riot can do to fix the problems around here.","replies":[]}
