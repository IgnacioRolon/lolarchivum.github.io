That's a pretty long term project though, rather than a mid-season thing, both due to the amount of work needed to do it right and the need for the new client to be out and used by everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-02-03T21:49:48.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the (potential) 5 mastery pages and rune update is more likely preseason 8?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-04T00:49:45.863+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pre-season would be the earliest yeah. Changes like those are disruptive enough we wouldn't want to drop them towards the end of a ranked season/just before Worlds. Mid-season's basically the last window of the year we target major changes for (though occasionally stuff will need to be done after that it's not something we plan for).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-02-04T06:51:25.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about summoner spells?Any plans for those?\n\n{{summoner:1}} {{summoner:21}} ?\n\nEver thought about returning {{summoner:13}}  and combining it with {{summoner:7}} ?\nMaking them obtainable ingame rather than in Lobby so Summoners can be taken reactively ? \n\nPersonally I think League could learn a thing or two about flexibility and variety from SMITE's Relic system .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Muz√©t","date":"2017-02-03T18:19:43.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's same to assume they won't work on runes for the mid-season. \n\nPretty sure I read something about \"not address those kind of changes (which will be different clearly different from now) during a season\". \n\nThey're going to work on it and the mastery tree. So let's wait for pre-season 8. (They finally understood that 3 trees isn't enough yeaah. #voteforsupports2k18)","replies":[]}]}
