The 4.18 and 5.2 nerfs compounded together have stripped away so much of what made her originally viable that she has literally become one of the worst champions in the entire game. \n\nAll of the other assassins actually have at least one defensive ability that they can use to either dodge or mitigate damage... but for some reason it was decided that Akali is not also allowed to have such an essential tool, even though she is one of the only assassins who has practically no escape abilities past the level 9 mark. If even there were justification for her not having an escape (arguable), there is none for leaving her with an ability that has no use against competent players. It's like the ultimate extreme of \"counterplay philosphy\", there is SO MUCH counterplay that even the highly skilled Akali player has very few chances to make use of the ability.\n\nTrinket Upgrades make her W a complete waste of energy in 90% of situations post-level 9, and lets not forget that Trinket Upgrades are looking to be free in the near future. Isn't that cool? Now you can make Akali's primary defensive mechanic obsolete for FREE!\n\nSo, what exactly is the justification for allowing her to exist with a gutted skill that no longer provides any worthwhile practical use past the very early stages of the game, while leaving her as the only true assassin with no escape ability? Her playstyle has always been about using spellvamp to survive the counterburst, but she can&#039;t do that if she has no inherent damage mitigation, and if she builds tanky then she is not putting out enough damage to be useful. Honestly, I think it&#039;s time to give Akali back the resistances to her W and return the skill to what it was originally meant to be: **A defensive skill, not a useless one.**","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-11T18:24:27.047+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":1,"body":"We agree that akali is in a pretty bad spot.

(No hostility intended whatsoever, just expressing a concern based on how certain other champions have been handled.)\n\nAfter all, we are a group of core players who have stuck with Akali for years even though she has been rightly considered a rather weak pick for almost her entire lifetime. That means there is already a huge amount of value in her kit for us, and we just want her to be \"nudged\" properly instead of in the heavy handed manner that she has been dealt with so far.\n\nI think though, if you were to label certain aspects of her kit as  \"Do Not Touch; Akali Players Love This\", then mark her Passive and her Ultimate. Every other skill can change, but it is those two things that define the champion for us. It's her ability to stick to nearly any target with ease and the ability to sustain through a large portion of incoming damage, continuing to be scary throughout an entire fight when played skillfully. Basically, Akali is the \"fighter\" of the assassin category, and that needs to be kept in mind. She is not a PURE assassin like the others. (Which even materializes in the fact that it takes her much longer to lay out her burst than most other assassins, including Zed and Diana)\n\nKeep in mind, her original kit was intended as a hybrid. She was basically supposed to the ability-based counterpart to Jax. Lategame scaling of huge sustained hybrid damage and self-healing. Unfortunately, the AD scaling part of her kit was implemented poorly and you guys never really played with it so people reinterpreted her as an AP burst assassin. At her core though, that's not what she really is, it just happens to be the most effective way to play her.\n\nScaling Spell Vamp, high sustained damage, and multiple resetting targetable dashes are what makes Akali amazing. I don't really play her hoping for instagib burst damage. If I wanted that kind of damage I'd play LeBlanc or Diana. It's the idea that my kit scales in a way that I can be an ability power version of Yi lategame--the ultimate cleanup crew and AP duelist--that is why I play Akali.

You like big burst damage? You like coming in and out of a smoky shroud? Dual scalings? we want to hit on all of these things that we think akali players hold close to their hearts right now.\n\nI believe these goals are what everyone wants to achieve with Akali, so let's try to point the things people usually consider toxic about her: \n\n-Triple dash with no cost (and resets)\n-Shroud OP (when people don't buy pinks)\n-No way to stop when she's ahead and scalling spellvamp through {{item:3146}}, with full AP build\n\nWell, nobody does anything without reaching its targets, so let's start with her ult:\n-----\n**SHADOW DANCE** has been tweaked recently, but the main issue remains the same: Triple guaranteed dashes with high AP Scaling damage, and no way to stop. Also, this is what MAKES Akali, so it has to be preserved somehow.\n\nMy sugesstion: Give the Yasuo treatment, unless you jump against marked targets. Let's be clear, you'll usually be wanting to mark targets before jumping in to maximize damage (unless in some really specific situations, or when you're, let's say, 20/0), so it won't be a nerf against experienced Akali players. This is to punish people for spamming R without even think, and open some window to an enemy to work on top of it. Plus, reducing the damage on this skill seems a right way to go.\n\nThis makes marking targets most rewarding at all, and forces Akali players to make choices when jumping on someone beyond her Q range, making her unable to jump again on this target for, let's say, 10/7,5/5 seconds (she still can use her W, or jump on minions to reach it. All about choices). About damage, let's say... Increasing a bit her first R damage, but reducing by 50% Shadow dance's damage against the same target in some seconds (regardless of being marked or not)\n\n---\n**TWILIGHT SHROUD** is the core of Akali defense. Hard counter issues with True Vision MUST be removed. But then, we'll need to balance it.\nI have some thoughs about:\n\n* First, 8 seconds is too damn long, it's hard to turn it in anything cool with such a big duration. It could be 6 or even 4, then we could reduce this skill's cooldown too. \n* Second, I feel that Akali's could be \"True\" stealthed for at least 1sec when entering her shroud, regardless anything. That's enough for escaping from bad situations.\n* Third, people could reveal her by just stepping on her shroud (after that 1sec said), but it could apply that Graves's vision debuff to everyone inside it that isn't Akali. (What do you think?)\n* And last. What about it stealthing allies? At cost of the said debuff to allies too. People would reveal them by stepping on it, and that 1sec of \"true stealth\" would be applied only to Akali, in that case.\n\nSo, Akali's W would work as a mobile bush for your team to seek advantage on fights. For such utility, it's duration HAS to be lower, and maybe his AoE could be lower too.\n\n---\nAbout her Q:\n\n**MARK OF THE ASSASSIN** is her main damage skill. It has to be more rewarding when you proc it, but I don't feel it's right to having someone marked 100% of the time, on lane.\nWe could double her Q cooldown, but restore 50% (or more) of it if Akali manages to proc the Mark, preserving her double proc'ing Q mechanic. Akali could restore her Q cooldown if she manage to kill a target with her Q too (for last hit issues). Then, we could add some damage to her \"throwing Q\", (AND INCREASE THAT MISSLE SPEED, FOR GOD'S SAKE) since it would be impossible to just poke people all time with just Q. (maybe reduce the AP ratio on throwing the Q, but increase significantly her base damage).\n\nSo that's it. I have no idea about what has to be done with her E (aside from a complete rework), and I believe her passive is fine, and it could even be buffed. The problem with it is {{item:3146}}, that quadra-scales with it (double increased dmg proc, spellvamp proc, and even more spellvamp over it). Just delete or rework this item and we're fine.\n\n\n=========\nTL;DR:\n-Adding some conditions to her R to function as live, to punish for spamming on the same people\n-Rework her W to be some sort of a \"portable bush\" that could even hide your allies, adjusting numbers to function properly.\n-Making her Q most reliable for an last-hit tool, but punishing on its cooldown for throwing on people and not proc'ing it.\n\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Rope Fox","date":"2015-08-19T17:46:33.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm relatively new and am by no means a normal alkali player, but the shroud ability operating similar to graces smoke bomb or having it stealth allies are both cool ideas.

Instead of being blinded inside it and unable to see out, people outside it are \"blinded\" to the target inside it. Obviously AoE abilities or skillshots could still land, as they do currently in game, but this would allow Akali to force opponents into her fighting area in short range to truly attack her. This gives her a unique ability that isn't currently in game and works well against a lot of current champions that we see in play right now. \n\nIt gives her a unique advantage over autoattack/targeted spell focused mid or top laners; for example, imagine seeing Akali top against Ryze where the Ryze player is unable to root her down for the kill unless he dips into her shroud to hit her, but then he's put himself at a disadvantage of basically being inside her kill radius. Akali mid lanes against Lux and makes Lux unable to trigger her passive from the safe distance of her auto range; Akali in mid against Viktor makes him unable to target her with his Q and the followup empowered auto attack!\n\nThis brings a unique ability to a champion who is really lacking in the cool fantasy/uniqueness level, and also gives her a tool to fight back not only against ranged players in the mid lane, but effectively duel with marksman champions or top lane champions with ranged abilities as well. The ability to counter something like a late game Vayne or a Caitlyn ult that would surely kill you, things like that, would make sense on a champion who is designed to kill these squishy targets; it enhances her abilities as an assassin while still allowing counterplay in that you can wait out the shroud or step into it to continue the battle if you have the advantage in the battle with her.\n\nThe slow/move speed buffs are fine on it, but I think for an ability like this the duration would probably have to be shortened;  8 seconds is a very, very long time to not be directly targeted by enemies; something in the 4 to 5 second range would seem much more balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-11T19:59:50.501+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Definitely an interesting concept.

Here is what he wrote :\n\n\n\"Her shroud could be so much cooler. What if it worked like Graves W so it's actually like throwing down a smokescreen? If enemies are in the smoke they get reduced vision but they can see Akali. If they are out of the smoke they can't see her (so it sort of works like a bush). One last thing to make it awesome: she is invisible during her ult.\n\nOk maybe that's OP but this is how I envision it: There's a Leona, Wukong, and Ashe ganking you. You use you're shroud on yourself and they can't see you. Leona and Wu walk in to gain vision. Leona is about to stun you when suddenly you disappear. Their vision is reduced so they walk out of the shroud only to hear the announcer saying Ashe has been killed.\"\n\n\nI find this more logic and more interesting that in the shroud, ennemies get reduced vision, imagine in TF ; if they could see Akali by going into her W, and that's all, it would be even more a nerf, because in TF, as Akali, you usually put your shroud in the middle of the fight (to try to \"protect\" yourself after all-in the ennemy team), so they would see you instantly. \nHOWEVER, if ennemies can't see out properly when inside, yes, in TF, go in Akali's W would be taking a BIG risk (and you have an Akali who can be  useful to her team even if she is far behind !)\n\nTo sum up, Akali's W would be like Graves' smoke, but in bigger, and Akali can hide herself inside, without pink wards counter. And not only ! It is the idea I find amazing (I already thought about something like this on Shadow Dance, I see that I am not alone !) : in the shroud, Aka would be stealthed when using R. (I would say only stealthed, pinks can see.) \nHanky2 already explained it well, so you understood the idea, I believe ; Leo an Wuk are about to hit Akali in the shroud, then, stealthing animation, she disappears, when about to hit Ashe, \"unstealthing\" animation, and boom. With specific particles, it would be wonderful don't you think ? And the ult would fit better his name : \"Shadow\" Dance. \"Akali dashes through the shadows to hit an ennemy\".\n\nI don't think it would be OP at all, if Akali is well balanced around it !\n\nWell, that is all I wanted to tell you, I hope you agree with this idea, from hanky2. \nHave a nice day, and thanks for reading me ^^ Can't wait for Akali's changes !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akaliholic","date":"2015-08-11T19:45:18.176+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cronovey,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cNYALVBp,comment-id=00060007,timestamp=2015-08-11T19:42:34.962+0000)\n>\n> Smoke bomb stuff <snip>\n\nWhile I like the idea in general, as a hardcore Akali player it would make my laning phase even more hellish against a great deal of matchups unless other compensations were given as well.

Similarly, the extra spellvamp from AD is nice, but she's not building much AD (Gunblade is about it).

And half of that doesn't matter if she builds ad or not. So really she'd have 26% with just gunblade, so the conversion part of her passive is giving like 20-30% more spellvamp, not 70%. \n\nIf having to weave auto attacks in to maximize damage fun a burst cast character? Does having stronger autos matter much when she only really autos to proc her q? Doing the math again, a somewhat conservative max build Akali (I used Void, Rabadon's, Zhonya's, Rylais, Sorc Boots, Gunblade (and even did some runes and masteries)) will get + 135ish damage per auto from her passive. Pre mitigation. That is about half of Lichbane, but without the cooldown. So maybe 100 after mitigation? Maybe? I mean, it's certainly not bad. But it's not great, and it's not very interesting.\n\nRegardless of strength, her passive is boring. It's just a bundle of free stats tied to hybrid incentives. And, as we see right now, since hybrid builds don't work with current itemization, it's just free stats. Bonus damage on autos and free sustain does not an interesting assassin make. My fear is that, if her passive stays as is, she will be more boring and less fun than if they removed it and implemented something else. Either that or they have to find a way to make Hybrid builds functional.","replies":[{"poster":"Akaliholic","date":"2015-08-11T22:54:34.414+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"First off, you are operating under an assumption that I keep trying to point out is erroneous. Akali is not a pure assassin. I've said it at least twice already in this thread, she is a Melee AP Hypercarry. Master Yi with abilities instead of autoattacks. She isn't made for the kind of people who like complicated mechanics and tricky assassinations, LeBlanc is ALREADY the epitome of that playstyle. Akali is made for people who want a straightforward champ that will kill the ENTIRE enemy team if not focused down. Assassins don't do that because you need large amounts of sustain or tankiness and sustained damage in order to do it and Assassins have none of the above, but Akali DOES.\n\nLooking at Akali like an assassin will result in ruining what makes her unique and fun, which is why I keep repeating myself: Treat her like an AP Yi. She's similar to Kat, except unlike Kat she can actually 1v1 people (Hint: It's because of the Spell Vamp).\n\nSecondly, I love her passive. Boring is subjective, so let the people who actually have loved Akali through thick and thin decide what is fun.\n\nThat said, if anyone comes up with a passive that lets her perform the same while being more interesting, I'm all ears.","replies":[{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2015-08-12T01:20:13.973+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"I had a freaking essay typed up and decided, screw it, it was the wrong way to go about this. First: I disagree with you. And you disagree with me. So we can either keep arguing as to why each other is wrong or maybe try and get some back and forth to help Riot make her as good as she can be.\n\nHere are what I view as Akali's \"cool\" aspects, or the highpoints of her kit:\n\n1. Not super mechanically complex. I tend to enjoy assassin characters that  aren't about **how** you fight but when you fight and where you fight. Sure, there should still be skill involved, but for a good assassin the pre-fight prep should count for a lot. Having good vision of the area, being in the right spot at the right time...that's what makes playing an assassin fun for me. Getting the perfect kill is sort of the icing on the cake. Or being so far ahead from having played well that those matter less. That also feels good.\n\n2. High(ish) mobility. Akali has always been a little slower at killing her targets than, say Talon or LeBlanc. But she has unparalleled ability to chase her target down (compared to other assassins. Not compared to Yi which may be part of the comparison you were making). You don't flash away from Akali. You can't run from her. If she wants to fight you, she will fight you.\n\n3. Ability to turn a fight around. There have been several times where I get ganked as Akali and with the upfront burst and then the ability to get resets end up walking out with a double kill,\n\nBased on what you've said (and do edit or add tho these as you see fit, I don't want to put words in your mouth) you enjoy\n\n1. Her ability to duel people. Her ability to fight someone and, using her kit, win a fight often by being able to heal through the opponents damage or kill them with unexpectedly high auto damage. The \"Fighter of Assassins\"\n\n2. Being able to, I don't want to say single-handedly, but using her resets to win a team fight. Getting kill after kill and keeping a fight going after it normally would have ended for other non-reset champs. \n\n\nLooking at this, the big area we seem to be at odds with each other is, honestly, how \"tanky\" should she be. You describe her as the \"fighter of assassins\". Rylais, Zhonyas and Abyssal. That's the sum total of her actual defensive purchases, and those are almost never all bought together, and never as a first item. That's not a lot of defense. Most of her \"fighter\" aspect comes from healing. But ALL of her healing (save for the base 6% vamp from her passive) comes from a single item: Gunblade. This item is STUPID GOOD on Akali. So good that it is first item rush almost 100% of the time. There is no reason not to get it. And almost no one else IN THE GAME buys this item. It is almost literally an item solely for Akali. Which means she is balanced around this item. And I think this is bad for her. A champion should not be balanced around a single item.\n\nAnd this shows part of the problem with current hybrid kits. This hybrid item is amazing on akali. But she doesn't build rageblade. Because attack speed. Even if the rest of it is GREAT for her. Heck, fighter Akali should want this item.\n\n\nAnyway, that's stuff to think about. In terms of her kit, instead of saying what shouldn't be touched, moving fromt he other end, what SHOULD be touched is her \"e\". Worst part of her kit, does nothing for her. But it's supposed to be the part of her kit that likes AD and is ALSO her only AoE. Even then it was a little wave clear and a ranged way to proc her Q. It's never done much for her. So, questions:\n\n1. Does Akali need AoE in her kit? Very few champs have no AoE. 6 in fact (Firoa, Poppy, Kalista, Trundle, Vayne and Warwick). And that's for AoE damage. If you include AoE CC it drops to 3 (Vayne, Warwick and Fiora), and if you remove AoE support abilities it drops to 1 (Vayne). What's interesting about this to me is that, out of all \"classes\", assassins always have AoE/ The supreme single target bursters always have AoE of some kind. There may be a place for a pure single target assassin, and it may be Akali. Or it may not. Just something interesting.\n\n2. Does she need more of her kit dedicated to AD? Right now only her passive and her E have any sort of real AD scaling (sure, her q needs an auto to proc it, but that doesn't count). Is it enough for her to be  a hybrid if only her autos and passive scale with AD? (And ability that really isn't used?)\n\n3. Does she need to focus more on auto attacking? That's certainly one way to make her more hybrid. And this would make her more of a \"fighter\". I disagree with it, but it is an option.\n\n\nIf I had to pick how I would rework Akali, I would do this: I would emphasize her mobility. I had the idea ages ago to do something like give her 10 ult charges, and let her dash to anything, ally or enemy. But if she dashes to the same enemy twice in a row, everything of hers does reduced damage to that enemy. It's not a great kit. But the idea is encourage and reward her for being mobile in a way no one else currently is. She would be the literal hit and run assassin. Maybe not always getting the kill, but maybe able to force a priority target to leave a fight. \n\nI'd like for her bubble to have less utility. Or, maybe just more \"coolness\" 20% more coolness. In one sense, it does a lot. Stealth AND move speed for her and a slow for her enemies. Also vision. But the vision and the speed changes aren't really that interesting. If you're able to use the bubble to fight, then those are nice, but ultimately of little consequence. If you get pinked, then they again probably matter little. If we're sticking with mobility, the idea I had before was to allow her to ult to her bubble as if it were a target. This let's her dash in and around her bubble, making a focal point of fighting for her. Or make it kinda like Zed and let her reactivate her bubble to dash back to it from a certain larger radius.\n\nMaybe combine it's current version with that suggestion from elsewhere in this thread. Those inside the bubble can see and fight each other, but those outside can't unless they enter. Heck, if you really want to get crazy, find  a way to make it so those inside can't be hit by skillshots, only AoE zones (yes, I realize there is a ton of overlap there and it's not an idea that can actually happen. Would be cool though.\n\nI don't think her ult needs to be a skillshot. It's reliability is part of what makes Akali Akali (would be nice to have access to all 3 charges on level up though. She's like the only champion that doesn't get access to her whole ult at 6). I think her Q can stay as it is. I'd say go ham on W, E and Passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2015-08-12T02:15:47.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly I have to nitpick myself.

Here's an upvote for approaching things constructively. :)\n\nThe difference we have though, is more in our understanding of who Akali is and what she needs. The main standpoint I want to stress, and as any Akali player who has stuck with her over the years will tell you:\n\nWe neither want nor need fancy new mechanics. We love Akali just the way she is, we just want her FIXED. Once upon a time she was a great and well-balanced Champion, and then Riot decided to heavily nerf her based on public outcry even though the facts showed that high level players had no trouble whatsoever in dealing with her.\n\nNow, we have to swallow the fact that Riot will balance champions around the low level community to a certain extent, so we won't be getting back some of her more easy to access power, but we will be content just for her skills to actually have functionality rather than being useless.\n\nIn this situation, the line of thought we need to be following is \"How can we make these skills not useless?\", not \"How can we remake this skill to be more cool?\". Seeing as how the community has rejected Akali en masse while just a few of us have faithfully kept playing her, I think it's only fair that the rework be oriented more around making her more playable for the people who already play her rather than coming up with new ideas in general that serve no ultimate purpose other than to make her \"different\".\n\nRiot has constantly failed to follow the \"If it's not broken, don't fix it.\" philosophy, but they absolutely need to follow it in this case. Currently, the only aspect of Akali is broken is that her W is a nearly useless skill outside of laning (and also during laning if your opponent can afford a pink). Her E could also use a bit of a love, but it would only take subtle tweaks to turn it into a very good skill. It is not in need of major buffs or reworks.\n\nThe truth is that Akali is not boring to those who desire her specific playstyle, nor is she in need of further depth. She is exactly on par with Master Yi and Katarina in both depth and playstyle, the difference is that those two have access to FUNCTIONAL tools and capabilities that Akali does not, making them much more viable and less painful to play. (Admittedly, Kat still requires more finesse than Akali, but if played well she will have a greater impact in teamfights, and she also has a much less painful laning phase. Yi on the other hand not only has two strong defensive abilities for teamfights, he can also jungle to negate the weakness of his laning phase)\n\nSo while it may be kinda fun to toss around various ideas, as it concerns the fate of my favorite and only \"main\" champion, I'm not especially interested in any sort of \"reimagination\" of her skills. I just want what she has to work, I don't want something different.\n\nWhile I am willing to accept an alternative, there really is no reason why Akali cannot have free resistances in her shroud. It certainly improves her dueling ability and makes her harder to focus down, but Yi still has far greater dueling capability, and his defensive steroid gives a HUGE defensive stat boost while also healing him (at the cost of making him immobile of course). Plus he can become **untargetable ** every few seconds which is another huge boost to his survivability. \n\nA simple buff to Twilight Shroud in that regard, combined with some small QoL buffs on her E such as energy return for every target struck, making it a viable teamfighting tool similar to Katarina's W, would be more than enough to make the Akali fans happy, and for her to be viable enough that she is worth picking up for the sort of people who actually enjoy the straightforward hypercarry assassin playstyle.\n\nTL;DR: We don't need Akali to be another \"Every Play is an OutPlay\" champion. We already have Yasuo and LeBlanc for that.

You're absolutely right about how much Akali mains love her core themes. I for one still run the original Rune/Masteries that were used to both trigger and maximize her passives at level 1! Akali and I have seen some days together and throughout it all I have gained a very clear perspective on who she is. I think she has a place in the permanent lineup on the Rift. \n\nSo I wanted to throw some of my perspective at you as a 3 season Akali player who is NOT a fair weather fan - I still play her as much as I can today - and tell you the things that make her cool right now and the struggles we have as well. Hopefully when redesigning her, the essence of these choices and strategies will remain.\n\n---\nWhat is great about Akali:\n\nDouble Qs\nThis is a sweet bit of champion depth that takes time to master. Knowing the exact window of the overlap gives skilled Akali players a major edge over the competition, especially now that you have to AA for both procs.\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\nOne of the great things about Akali is that the player is constantly choosing between passive and aggressive play. Every time a Q goes out or a shroud goes down you're actively deciding if its time to kill, and your opponents know it too. Posturing is Akali's most subtle mechanic. You play the crouching tiger and use the threat of engage as a control tool to zone defensively or create the right engage. You play the hidden dragon, literally, and disappear into the fog or you strike from the shadows. The balance is key. Do not impede the balance.\n\nQ-R VS R-Q\nAnother bit of champion depth that uses balance. It's like a change-up pitch that batters just don't see coming. You condition your lane opponent to expect the double-Q setup and then choose then next cooldown window to jump right on their face and Q from point blank. It's the option to play her passively or actively that gives her depth.\n\nShroud dodging (Lookin at you, Darius Ults)\nYea so the Darius Ult Dodge is an outlier that might be considered a bug someday, but there are plenty of lane match-ups that can be won or lost by the use of shroud. Basically anyone who likes to stun and AA/single target spell your face off (irelia, jax, ryze) you can bait into a favorable situation with proper use of shroud. Put their CC on CD and take your window to find the vital spots.\n\nShroud Evading\nYou already know this, but its hilarious when you can do things like cover two brushes with a shroud and watch your enemy's indecision take hold.\n\nShroud Zoning\nThis is a big one. When Akali gets ahead, I've zoned entire teams just by throwing a shroud down in the middle of a lane and walking away. Enemies tend to either avoid it entirely or pile on top of it and wait. Even if they can see me not inside the shroud, the potential threat is just too big.\n\n\nAs you can see, shroud is an integral part of Akali's game play and that's the real reason why Akali mains have so much frustration right now. Almost all of Akali's high level play utilizes her shroud, and the shroud itself has now become obsolete. **One of Akali's design pillars suddenly became a toothpick.**\n\n---\nThings that need some work:\n\nLocalized invisibility\nWhen you're Shaco, Evelyn, or the forgotten Twitch, pink wards and red trinkets are a whole lot less oppressive than when the enemy team knows literally the only place you can be invisible. \n\nTrue sight\nMan...pink wards are such a B**CH. I think the most frustrating thing is that enemy pink wards work under your own tower AND towers no longer kill wards. So even in the safest place in my lane, 100g obliterates my effectivness. \n\nThis next one is a little off topic but, was ignite really meant to give True Sight? Or was it supposed to just reveal enemies through the fog of war? \n\nAkali VS Melee: The Story of QQ\nIt is damn hard for Akali to trade with melee champions now. And I don't mean Singed, I mean true melees like Jax and Irelia. Akali's only real means of damage, especially in the early game, is a cyclic ability proc (the Q). When E was able to proc that Q, we could at least get a little distance between ourselves and the enemy. Now we have to fully commit to a face to face battle against champions who are designed to have consistent resource-less damage - their auto attacks. Akali simply cannot win those trades without precise and high level gameplay. Setting up a good double Q before level 6 is difficult on its own without factoring in an Irelia/Jax stun, a wu-kong evade, a garen silence + shiled combo, a darius pull to eliminate escape. The list goes on. \n\nIn my opinion, the greatest impact that the changes to Akali and the addition of True Sight options have had has been a huge decrease in her viability against melee champions. It's just too hard.\n\nFind a place for E \nIdk where Crescent Slash fits in anymore. The newly lowered CD has definitely made wave clear nice, but other than that it needs a better way to fit into the kit.\n\n\nThat's my information download for right now!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heptapod","date":"2015-08-12T08:19:54.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Make her E proc Q again, that is all what im asking for {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gooberp","date":"2015-08-12T19:32:37.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like some others (and the TC) have mentioned, her W is her main flop at the moment; her E is kinda boring but it does its job of energy-dump-damage-pump. I like where her passive, Q, and R are at.\n\nMy suggestion for a new W builds off of Cronovey's but slightly different. Don't make her W into a battle arena for her and her target, which I don't like because she will lose trades to almost everyone unless her base stats are buffed tremendously, plus it doesn't fit her current play pattern/theme/fantasy. I like the current lane play pattern of \"Shroud is my hunting ground/safe space, if you come too close you will be punished.\"\nExpand the W radius moderately, remove her invisibility but add untargetability. Give her windows of targetability after she has attacked something (the exact same windows as she currently has for breaking/re-entering stealth would be great) via some visual cue, probably by fading her out when untargetable and back in when she can be hit.\n\nThis way, she can still use W for all the same uses, e.g. to farm in lane if she's careful via popping in and out of untargetable \"stealth\", her assassination pattern doesn't have to change at ALL, (Shroud is Akali's hunting space) she can still be damaged by AOEs, and we balance the fact that she's now easier to hit with those AOEs because she's visible by expanding the Shroud radius.\nCounterplay via AOEs or hitting her back during her brief windows of visibility. This is the exact same counterplay she has now but she is no longer negated by pink wards, problem hopefully solved?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WiegrafOfValor","date":"2015-08-11T20:29:57.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"* Make her W like Graves blind, when inside the shroud the enemy can see akali inside but everything else is black, when outside everyone inside is invisible.

Akali was in a good spot but due to many nerfs given to her for absolutely no reason, she has ended up where she is right now. Even though right now Akali is so weak that she can't even be considered viable in any elo above high gold/low plat, I still love her. I've played so many games on her that I am able to execute scenarios perfectly. I know how to use my ulti for escape or exactly how to move in my shroud to avoid skillshots. While I really would like her to be buffed or at least patched for viability, I do not want her to be changed. \nAkali is my main champion. Even though I am at a disadvantage when playing against people who main a meta champion for example, I'd rather have that than not have Akali at all. \n\nThings that you should not change for Akali: Her ult, her passive, the fact that she has a shroud\n\nThese are her core. Akali's ability to stick to people is what makes her Akali. If you were to change her ult in any way, it would ruin her. The resets are important for her ability to jump around like the ninja she is. The fact that she cannot jump to friendly minions/players/wards is important because it keeps her from being op.\nThe shroud, I simply like the idea of. You can change it but she should have some form of stealth mechanic. After all, she is a ninja.\nThe passive is super important! Akali gets most of her health/tankiness from lifesteal. Without her passive that would not happen.\n\nThe e on the other hand is currently completely useless since it no longers procs q. It's nice for aoe waveclear and Akali is a champion that I've learned to cs with almost perfectly. That being said, if it was changed to something more interesting, I don't think any Akali mains would be too upset.\nAs for the q. It's currently the main source of her damage when you proc it, but by itself it does little damage, especially compared to Kat's q for example. Maybe have it give movement speed as well.  \n\nAll in all, some help with Akali would be nice, as long as it doesn't ruin her for us Akali mains.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2015-08-11T20:29:59.897+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please be gentle with her :/","replies":[{"poster":"Rastilan","date":"2015-08-11T20:41:07.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali is SO HOT,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cNYALVBp,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-08-11T20:29:59.897+0000)\n>\n> Please be gentle with her :/\n\nLike a virgin\n\nreworked for the very first time!","replies":[]}]}]}
