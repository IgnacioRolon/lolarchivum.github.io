ANY OTHER developer would be saying \"Oh crap, half my player base can't play, lets fix it\".\n\nSince 19th August 2016 I have been unable to launch a game and I am not the only person having this problem, you are asking people to give as much information as possible in their bugsplats, but how much are you expecting us to be able to put?\n\n1. Launch the launcher.\n2. Update if necessary.\n3.Click \"Play\".\n4. Enter username.\n5. Enter password.\n6. Wait for it to load the game client.\n7. Click \"Play\".\n8. Select game mode (I have been testing it in custom games by myself so avoid penalties for disconnecting/leaving).\n9. Select champion.\n10. Select Runes..\n11. Select masteries.\n12. Select summoners.\n13. Click \"Lock In\".\n14. Wait 10 seconds.\n15. Client closes.\n16. Screen goes black (Usually prior to seeing the loading screen).\n17. Enter the bugsplat details.\n18. Click \"reconnect\".\n19. Click \"Do not send\" on the second bigsplat.\n20. Close the game in anger because yet another day has gone past without being able to play.\n\nMy wife found a post linking to your \"Hextech Repair Tool\" (for anybody that has not found and tried it yet, you can find it [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) or you can google \"Hextech Repair Tool\").\n\nUpon using your Hextech Repair Tool the game worked, in a custom game, with a password, by myself. So I launched a live ranked game excited that my game was finally working and the error occurred again, as listed in the steps above. Now I have another Leaver buster notch against my name which seriously pisses me off, even more than the fact the game is not working, because every single one I have is there because of YOUR server or client errors, and that is saying something considering I have a wife and 2 kids.\n\nSo come on Riot, FIX YOUR SHIT!","replies":[{"poster":"Pandaizm","date":"2016-09-07T14:49:34.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"August* u from the future?","replies":[{"poster":"Pojop","date":"2016-09-07T15:11:47.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha, oops","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T15:27:48.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patches only change local files within your League installation folder, they're *very unlikely* to have caused bugsplats. Bugsplats are the result of a weird reaction between your system's drivers and the League client, so they're most often caused by driver issues or problematic hardware. As a first step in resolving this, I recommend working through the steps outlined in our [Bugsplat & Crash guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Pojop","date":"2016-09-07T17:48:03.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have previously attempted everything on that page except turning off Debug version of DirectX. I attempted it, but I was either reading it wrong or it was just too confusing, I always have all the driver updates including BIOS chips, motherboard chip set usb bud drivers, Radeon GFX, direct x, sound cards, windows, firewall etc etc on automatic updates, as well as when I find errors like this, drivers are the first thing I check.\n\nThe ONLY corresponding patch to the problems with league was either, your game patches, or Windows 10 implementing version 1603? I think it was 1603 anyway (Whatever the really big update they just did was).\n\nIf there is a compatibility issue with any devices of hardware, it is fixable with a patch to the game, making whichever files are necessary to be changed, now accept the new versions of whatever is wrong... A lot of people are complaining of this, and the only common criteria I have noticed is the windows update, and people using nVidia cards. If you could inform me of how to upload them to you, Your hextech Repair tool gathered all my logs into a file I am more than willing to submit. I am just unaware of how to make the upload private so members of the public can not access information they can harm my system with.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T18:06:11.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can attach your log file to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and a member of our tech team will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
