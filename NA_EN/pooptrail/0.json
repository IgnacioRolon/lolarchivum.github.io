Honestly, I have lost multiple games because of DC'ed team members -and have probably won my share of them too. I'm lucky if I get a loss prevented for them 50% of the time. I'm terrified to even try a ranked game because of the crap shoot the servers have become. Maybe spend less resources on balance patches and fixing your new champs and ensure the game is playable first.\n\nSeriously take a note from Valve and how DotA runs for them. They have significantly less man power than you guys do -they also actually let their community contribute to the game in a meaningful way, not the point though-, but their client and server are incredibly reliable. You guys have a great product in LoL but the quality of it has been questionable at best the last month; and if not fixed I think you'll see your player base begin to dwindle quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"SWTOR Champion","date":"2014-09-18T03:40:19.868+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"My same points, well said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Testosterox","date":"2014-09-18T03:15:55.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The server issues are becoming pervasive.

And why, because after the patch a few days ago, every game I tried ends with Bug Splat, and reconnection is hell!  Oh, I did reconnected after several minutes and several tries, and i did finished the game as well except for one which ended already when I finally reconnected.\n\nNow you say there is a problem with the server, and yet you blame us for 'idling by/disconnecting' and sanction us with a ban?  How dare you?  Did you even consider bug splat reports when giving sanctions?\n\nGuess what?  I tried using an alternate account, got problems connecting again.  When I finally did, and when I finally got into a game, game start resulted to Bug Splat again.  More than 10x I tried reconnecting, all resulting to bug splat and crash.  Restarting the computer then reconnecting again got me nowhere.  My game is still on the 'Reconnect' screen as I post this.  I guess your LeaveBuster would level up my alternate account as well, wouldn't it?

I just received a 7 day ban because of riot's bs servers, BUT WAIT. I know what you're thinking.. \"dude you would have had to leave a whole lot of games to get a 7 day ban\" SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. ALL of my leaves were a result of substandard server quality, back a couple weeks ago when the servers had immense amounts of lag that's when it all started, then today now I join a team builder game everyone ready's up and i go to watch a youtube vid while i wait for loading screen.. check back in a couple of seconds, I'm at the home screen going wudduhfuq as I think \"oh maybe someone left or something gg that penalty.\" So I try to join another team builder and I get an error message saying I'm already in a game, so at this point I'm like rito ples. I exit re-log and join the game, 10 seconds \"the game has crashed please reconnect\" \"lel ok rito\" I reconnect. BOOM game crashes again *such surprise* I reconnect.. AGAIN. BOOM POW get hit with the idler and I have to leave, reconnect again we lose QQ, then I receive a message saying I'm suspended QQ some more. RITO WHY?! I know I sound like a little raging Feggit, but I don't believe I'm in the wrong, I've spent time and money on this game to then get kicked in the ass by a fucked up system that has needed fixing for even longer than Morgana stuns, \"wow Ginomai, dat long?\" Yes dat long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kyoukitenshi","date":"2014-09-19T04:31:36.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm not really understanding the lag myself. \n\nIt's been happening for about a week for me, but particularly since the new patch, the lag is unbearable.

The more you put on your server the more you hinder its performance. What you need to do is stop putting out new things this season. Stop making minor changes that lead to more lag. stop adding new champions and game modes just log enough that your team can sit down and asses the server situation. Your player base is getting angry and you don't appear to care. You guys are handling this situation like the US government, \" you guys have a problem with connection? well here are some new champions, and a new game mode. Did that make the lag go away?\"\n\nSo I implore you, stop adding to the problem. The only thing you should be working on right now is the state of your servers. No more champions no more game modes. Get the servers back to prime condition, then start introducing new aspects to the game. You should assess your servers after every thing you add to the servers. Release a new patch with all your updates. Step back and observe for a while. Fix problems, make sure servers are stable, then work on the next new set of changes. Never make new changes when you have a current problem on your hands cause then you end up stacking problems on top of problems and the difficulty level in fixing it just increases exponential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tblaze420","date":"2014-09-19T06:23:02.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey everyone,\n> \n> I updated another thread regarding the server issues going on right now, but I wanted to make sure to jump into this discussion as well.\n> \n> Make sure to check out our[ Server Status page](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_US#na) for the latest information!\n> \n> We'll update it as soon as we have any new information to share!\n\nWell what's your excuse this time? 2days in a row.
