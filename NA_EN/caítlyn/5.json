He goes in to auto you, you scare him into jumping and grab him as he lifts off the ground, he goes nowhere, you kill him. Blamo, dead Gnar.\n\nHow do you scare him into jumping? \n\nYour Q is the only ability that can outrange his auto attacks at any point in the laning phase (and once Gnar hits six, no ability outranges his autos), and that has a wind up that doesn't actually allow you to cast your E when he would jump to avoid it. This is assuming he even needs to use it, considering the speed boost he gets from his W. \n\nThe scenario as you described does not exist if both players are playing even sort of competently.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-10-02T03:08:59.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How to scare him into jumping: Run at him. All there is to it. He cannot fight you face to face, and he will run.

Don&#x27;t act as if you get hit by it 100% of the time.\n\nIf you have to side-step his Q, he has procced Hyper on you (he can probably do it without you having to side step since Gnar) by then, which gives him more movement speed than you, which means you can't catch him. Meanwhile you're eating free damage while you're trying to run through his minion wave (did you forget that he has one of those?) to kill him, and even if you do hit him said minion wave will be beating your ass the entire time.\n\nOnce again, the scenario you are describing doesn't actually exist.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ryuyah","date":"2016-10-02T15:48:34.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At desperate times, you need desperate measures\n\nCall upon your inner Urgod","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-02T00:24:23.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play something with a gap closer.
