Why does llama have 2 L&#x27;s? Its stupid.\n\nIt's a foreign word and it's to emphasize an elongation to the \"L\" sound.\nJust in the manner that TaliyAH puts an emphasis on the last \"A,\" due to the H. and how JHIn puts extra emphasis on the \"I\" because of the H.\n The H's aren't silent because if you actually know how language works, you understand how they contribute to the words.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2016-07-26T04:45:10.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I bet your name is Robert... or bob or something.
