This 4th option simply adds a new dynamic to the collection. \n\nWhat can be concluded here is that most people are indifferent to nexus siege or just so interested in URF that they'd rather just complain about the lack of Urf compared to how bad Nexus siege may or may not be.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-07-22T23:09:27.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mentioning urf, specifically, hints at the OP's bias, especially since it's a game mode likely to elicit strong reactions.

The data is as is, it is what it is and it is  not what you were expecting.

Not to be the bearer of bad news, but any poll will have bias.

Of those 20% that do, only about 1% (again made up statistic) are going to bother clicking on this thread. Then you are going to have another 1% of that 1% who are going to bother voting on the poll. There's bias right there. Had they put \"I neither like nor dislike Siege\" instead of \"Gimme URF\" - those responses would STILL be irrelevant (i.e. erroneous results - the +/- you see in every poll) to the poll results because those folks have 0 opinion about their preference in this particular poll.\n\nBasically what I am saying is: Go play the game and stop arguing over stupid shit on the internet.","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-07-22T23:18:04.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Whyzerman,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BMRBvusI,comment-id=00000001000000000001,timestamp=2016-07-22T23:11:39.748+0000)\n>\n> Basically what I am saying is: Go play the game and stop arguing over stupid shit on the internet.\n\nWho the fuck are you?
