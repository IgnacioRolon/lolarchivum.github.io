This passive gives him a little more \"oomph\" to make up for it, but also pushes some power into the late-game. Imagine if it was removed and that shaved power was put into his bases. Tank builds would be even more effective on him, and his early to mid game laning phase would be even stronger, and nobody wants that. \n\nSo yeah, on paper it does seem like it's \"free,\" but it serves as an incentive to build AD instead of tank whenever a \"faux tank\" assassin meta appears, and puts power from his power budget (a concept I'd recommend becoming familiar with if you're going to continually post in balance) toward the lategame rather than stacking it completely in the midgame.\n\nAlso, instead of complaining, it's best to describe why something is bad rather than calling it \"free.\" Maybe recommend a solution? What if his W passive was changed into his regular passive, and scaled similar to {{champion:69}} new passive? And we could move his old passive into his ultimate, making it a stronger late-game execution but making him weaker in non-ult assassination attempts? \n\nIf you want to talk balance, discuss rather than merely complain.","replies":[{"poster":"Caítlyn","date":"2016-06-07T22:53:32.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zed falls off? Nobody noticed because of all this free AD. He's had that free AD since release, so nobody knows if he \"falls off\" or not. Remove it and see what happens on PBE.  And anyways if he does fall off, is that a bad thing? Since now hes too strong early, mid, and late so if he was weak late, why is that a bad thing? Its his power curve as the game goes on that most champions in the game have. Although for Zed its less of a \"curve\" and more of a straight line at the top.","replies":[{"poster":"CR4ZYRONDH4VI","date":"2016-06-08T02:56:39.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does fall off. Late game his team fighting is not that great. he can't ult tanks, he can't ult people with zhonyas, etc. Some people have ults, like Kayle and Kha'zix that counter his too. So his late game is rough for him. Id say that his strongest point of the game for him is probably mid game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-06-07T23:00:12.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's already weak late right now, the only thing that that Free ad does is make it so that he's not COMPLETELY useless late game, champions should have fall offs but none should be completely useless jsut because a certain point in the game started.","replies":[{"poster":"Caítlyn","date":"2016-06-07T23:06:43.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-06-07T23:14:24.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's not completely useless?
