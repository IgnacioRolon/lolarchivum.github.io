I had ~250 AD and 100% crit chance and my basic attack dealt ~400 while Q dealt only ~440. It should be way more than 40 when 5th lvl Q have 100 damage more than basic attack. While attacking more minions after using e, only first one had been struck by lower damage, rest got much higher damage. Also I saw that q didn&#039;t critically strike 2 times while I had 100% crit chance, and it dealt ~350 damage.","replies":[{"poster":"splashmasta","date":"2015-12-15T12:41:01.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"wait wat {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lû Bû","date":"2015-12-15T19:19:45.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop flaming his thread, if u cant answer his question, then leave","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wild Wes","date":"2015-12-15T15:27:47.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yasuo player crying that Yasuo's critical chance has to work 100% of the time... {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lû Bû","date":"2015-12-15T19:19:11.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"reported, dont flame his thread","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lû Bû","date":"2015-12-15T19:20:35.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too experienced this in a Poro match, Had 300 AD 100% Crit chance, tool tip said 100 more ad, but saw only a minor damage difference.","replies":[]}]}
