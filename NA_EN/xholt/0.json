I've tried restarting my computer, repairing the client, and opening it as administrator, and none have worked. Looking for somebody who knows what to do or how to fix it/bypass it.

Apps like play.tv, overwolf, etc have been known to cause some issues with the client.  If so, disabling it could fix this.
