Install the game on a hard drive that is not the default C drive\r\n2. Launch the game\r\n3. Sign in and create an item set\r\n4. Select Play and create or join a match\r\n5. Open the store when in-game\r\n6. Notice that there is no arrow in the Recommended tab to select a custom item set\r\n\r\nThe issue was resolved after uninstalling, and then reinstalling the game on the C drive.\r\n\r\nI've seen that quite a lot of people have seen this issue, and I figured that I'd post it here due to not being able to create a discussion in the Bug Report section of the site due to my level.\r\nI also contacted support through email about it, but the person who responded didn't help at all, saying that \"the game needs to be installed properly for the client to work properly.\"  How installing it on my D drive instead of C is \"not properly installing\" is a mystery to me, especially since the installer gives the option to install it in another place besides C.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope this helps people with the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T05:47:52.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a *vast array* of issues that can be caused by installing the game on a separate drive than your Operating System. This is often because League relies on specific software packages and can run into issues if it takes too long or simply cannot access them. In this case, the Item Sets system is pretty fragile, so it's not *completely unexpected* that this can happen when League is installed on another drive.\n\nYour Boards level has been updated in case you wanted to still report this as a bug. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
