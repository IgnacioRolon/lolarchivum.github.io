Most of these people probably would not pick the \"fill but\" option if it were implemented, because they will still have a chance to get a role that they don't want. Some may change over because the chance to get that role may be small and the queue times will be smaller. So, this group will slightly decrease queue times because of a small group of people switching to \"fill but\" secondary.\n\nThen let's take the people who are comfortable in one, two, three, or four roles but still choose secondary fill anyways because they want low queue times and/or want to give other people low queue times and/or because they're indecisive in what role they want. The people who want to keep their queue times as low as possible will retain their fill secondary and queue times will not change. People that feel really uncomfortable or tired with one role will exclude that role, decreasing the amount of players wanting that role and increasing queue times. The indecisive ones will also probably exclude the role that they don't want to play. This group will lead to an increase in queue times.\n\nThen, the people comfortable in four roles who do not pick fill because of that dreaded fifth role. They will, undoubtedly, switch over to the \"fill but\" option, decreasing queue times.\n\nThen there's the primary fillers who are comfortable in all roles. Most of these will probably stay primary fill, but if some are getting particularly tired of one role, they may change to the \"fill but\" option. This will increase queue times.\n\nThen there are the primary fills who aren't comfortable in all roles. Most will probably change to \"fill but\", except for the ones who want lower queue times. This will increase queue times.\n\nI think that covers most people. \n\nNow, I think Snake On Bush was talking about that second group, the group that takes fill secondary because of lower queue times or the goodness of its members' hearts, despite not wanting to play one or more roles. They're going to switch over to this \"fill but\" option and increase queue times. Why they're doing this is what puzzles him: they're potentially taking roles they don't want by selecting fill, and are complaining about it, when said problem could be fixed by not selecting fill and instead selecting another secondary. Why must we pander to these people and increase queue times?\n\nOn the other hand, there's the third group, the one that will decrease queue times because it's not selecting fill because of one role. Does this third group outweigh the second group, resulting in decreased queue times? (The first, fourth, and fifth groups will probably have negligible effect on the queue times if this change is implemented.)\n\nThat'd be something to poll the player base for. Thinking about it now, I _feel_ like the third group would be bigger than the second group, but it's just a feeling.\n\nHowever, I don't think Snake is pushing for reduced queue times. I think he's trying to explain the tangible goal of what people want is easily achievable through changing one's secondary role. Why choose fill to hopefully get one of those three other roles you want when you could just change your secondary to one of those three roles that you want the most, and once you get tired of that, change to one of the others? Fill might decrease queue times a bit, but the effect isn't that obvious, and the discomfort from getting a role that one doesn't want is probably greater than the discomfort from waiting X amount of time longer.\n\nI hope this makes sense, since I was doing the thinking as I wrote the post rather than having the thought in mind at the beginning.","replies":[{"poster":"jQuery","date":"2016-03-20T13:37:07.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just let me ask you one question but first consider this scenario:\n\nLets say you have Top laner that chooses fill secondary, he doesn't have many support champions.

If you mean that you're taking fill but aren't comfortable in all roles, then that's not a good idea. If you want to win, you should be playing on one of your two strongest roles. This is not a question that addresses the addition of a \"fill but\" option. This is a question that attacks people who use \"fill\" or would use \"fill but\".\n\nAlso, I don't get your scenario. You said that my duo doesn't have many support champions but did not say anything about his skill as a support. Also, what does the other team's waiting time have to do with anything? I assume they weren't covering support and needed a support, and then when Leona the support main popped up they got in...? I don't get what point you are trying to make though. I think that my duo partner was stupid for choosing fill when he could have chosen an actual stronger role, and I wish he chose another secondary. I would still be mad at him if he chose a \"fill but\" option, because that would mean that he doesn't have a specific gameplan in mind and he still might not play on his second strongest role if he gets his secondary choice.\n\nI was responding to Marik. Marik brought up queue times, so I talked with him about queue times.\n\nWhat do \"troll\" picks have to do with your original point? That is something that can happen in all roles, and it has nothing to do with the addition of a \"fill but\" option, unless you're implying that many people who are filling and are getting support are choosing troll picks and that adding a \"fill but\" option will alleviate this because only people who want to support will support. That's not going to happen. \"Troll\" picks **will** happen regardless.\nTwo support choices? I'm quite sure that there are a lot of decent supports right now. Janna is great (as always), Blitzcrank is solid, Brand is good, Alistar is strong, Leona is pretty nice, Morgana is decent, Nautilus is pretty decent, Sona is doing great...\nTahm or Lulu might not be doing that well now in support, but there are far more than two available supports.\nWhat do you mean by a cocky twelve year old support?

Why do people get to pick 5 out of 5 of the roles they are good at, and other get to pick 2 out of the two roles they're good at, but people with 3 and 4 get nothing\n\n>How can you manage to pick and play 1 champion from your large champion pool but then you are somehow incapable of choosing 2 out of your 4 roles?\n\nBy having a small champion pool for each role.\n\n>Really hard to understand how you people can function in life.\n\nOh boo hoo there are people who aren't like me, I can't believe they can survive for having different problems and ideas!\n\nI find it hard to believe people who flip coins rather than ask a matchmaking system to find the best role for them can function in life. Does that mean I have the right to tell them that the things they ask for are 'redundant' without even knowing what the word means? No.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Seekêr","date":"2016-03-20T01:35:43.132+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've just accepted my new role as a support main -.- since im too indecisive to pick any secondary role other than fill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cynicatt","date":"2016-03-19T21:55:13.026+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would always pick fill if I could get rid of Jungle as a role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2016-03-19T21:26:22.998+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":13,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\n\nUnnecessary.\n\n**DO NOT PICK \"FILL\" IF YOU DON NOT WANT TO PLAY ALL ROLES.**\n\nSimple as that.

They want to negate a role, which means they do not want to fill, which means higher queue times since then someone else to be that support.\n\nOr, they could just be like us normal people and learn to choose 2 specific roles they want to play and use them. Picking \"fill\" means getting the role that needs to be filled ... usually it is the support since other have more demand. Should not pick \"fill\" then.\n\nThere is no reason whatsoever to have this stupid thing, since we can already negate 3 roles instead of 1. And there's always blind pick for those who have difficulties choosing their roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Parceval","date":"2016-03-19T23:44:19.476+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your lack of logic baffles me. \n\nSo you're assuming that the ONLY reason any of us play support is because it's ACCIDENTALLY happening when I press fill.\n\nSo, essentially, you're arguing that if a person wants to play 3 roles then they should man up and accept that 'fill' is their only option. They should roll the dice for the good of league! \n\nYou're mismanaging humanity. Less people will chose this option, more will choose to pick only the 2 they prefer slightly more at that juncture. You would have increased probability of people selecting more options if they could avoid the role they don't want. Which would inevitably reduce queue times. \n\nIn my case, it would be top, or mid, depending on the day.
