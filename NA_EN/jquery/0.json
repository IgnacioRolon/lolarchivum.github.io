PASSIVE: like {{item:3026}} _ Upon taking lethal damage, restores 100% maximum Health and 100% of maximum Mana after 1 + (current level / 2) seconds of stasis (1 second cooldown). And gain 100 shield for every enemy champion nearby  that lasts 3sec._\n* New summoner spell [**Ragnarok**(ish)]:\n  1. ACTIVE:  _Removes all disables from himself and becomes immune to them for the next 5 seconds, gaining bonus movement speed_\n 2. PASSIVE:_ After [**Reset**] activation  get a charge of  **Ragnarok**_\n* Start and finish at blue base\n* Shop only at Red base \n* Checkpoints are individual and are proceedingly activated\n* AA on active check point gives 100 gold\n* To finish a circle one must activate all 4 checkpoints.\n* Finishing a circle grants +1 level (no other XP)\n\n----------\n\nTLDR; 2 teams race across TT with disabled turrets acting as checkpoints, after death a summoner re-spawns on the spot they ware killed on. Levels are granted on completing circles.\n\n------\n\nEDIT: \nRemember; \nAll 5 need to finish. \nYou can take Rammus and Zilean and try to gooooo faaaast and run **circles** around your enemies... But you will need to pass your enemies... and there are a lot of choke points... And they can cross the jungle for an intercept... And they will get more gold for kills... And finaly they can pick Rammus too, mirroring is allowed.","replies":[{"poster":"boo910","date":"2017-01-22T15:37:37.848+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"one word,  singed","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-22T18:02:27.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Bj-u5EdO8","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2017-01-22T15:30:59.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so donger dash....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2017-01-23T03:00:23.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:33}} \nhttp://i.imgur.com/RaJkp48.gif\n\n{{champion:91}} \nwhen you chose the assassin's path where you kill them to past them\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f3Gh3R1.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkilusal","date":"2017-01-22T17:30:31.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hrrm. Is Singed necessarily all that fast to begin with? Post-6 I think I can see it but before that...\nBut bigger issue I think is the idea that whoever has the most movement speed just takes it, or if someone has a movespeed booster innate to their kit (Eve, Singed, Quinn) Seems like they'd win no contest.\nThen again I guess you could go for kills and move ahead while your opponent resets but...I dunno about the balance. All you need is a few champs who are slow/bad duelists...\nI dunno. I don't think this mode works out if only because SR does enough to glorify champs that move fast, and burst hard, which this one seems like it would also do.","replies":[{"poster":"jQuery","date":"2017-01-22T21:31:37.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really want to try and see this, the number of strategies are inconceivable.\n\nCurrently we have at least 10 items with slow...

That way, it provides a bit of competitive counterplay for the race. And you can prevent someone from staying ahead if you could. And if you die you respawn at the previous checkpoint instead of on the spot.","replies":[{"poster":"jQuery","date":"2017-01-22T20:57:40.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AA deactivates the activated and activates the next one. Quinn will need too AA them and she does not instantly starts to fly.\n\nYou can send 2 to pass the jungle and cut her of and kill her. This is what i want to see, some strategy. Having channels for checkpoints... does not fix the problem every one will need to stop.\n\nThere are also 6 bans... And both teams can have a Quinn...\n\nAnd I dont know how  good of an idea is to go a full circle around your enemies :D\n\nBut the most important fix for a \"Quinn Race\": ALL 5 need to finish 20 circles, we have a saying here \"_One Swallow does not make it spring_\" :D","replies":[]}]}]}
