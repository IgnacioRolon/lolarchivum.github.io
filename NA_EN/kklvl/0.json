If so, not a bug, but it should be changed to prioritize daggers.\n\nSince the introduction of the dagger mechanic, Kat can no longer E to wards.\n\nE is supposed to get the CD refund if Kat hits a dagger. She doesn't necessarily have to target it. If Kat uses E on an object right next to the dagger and then touches the dagger, she gets the refund.\n\nThat said, the webm is inaccessible, so I can't see what happened.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-06T04:26:34.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  the webm is inaccessible\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \n\nYou cant open the replay in the client?","replies":[{"poster":"KKLVL","date":"2019-08-06T04:28:45.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, i don't know how","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-06T04:46:23.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How has this not been common knowledge since like.... the second week after the rework?\n\nIt's not a bug, it's just how blinks work. If you would blink even a single pixel beyond halfway through the terrain, you get put on the other side. That's how Kat manages to get over walls. That also happens to put her outside the dagger's pickup range. \n\nYou don't cast your E on a target/dagger; you cast your E on an area around a target/dagger","replies":[{"poster":"KKLVL","date":"2019-08-06T05:04:17.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"B-But at the end im Picking up the Dagger, So it should get my Shunpo CDR Refunded . \nOnce i pick up a dagger my E CDR Resets thats how the ability work {{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-06T05:04:57.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was only going by your description.
