I'm now reposting this because MAYBE there's a solution now. When I open my league launcher and go into the client, and then hit launch, the button goes dark and then does nothing. This has been a problem for the longest time and I wish I could fix it. I've done everything I can to fix it and I'm out of ideas. Any help would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-02-04T19:53:14.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try right click - run as administrator","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T16:48:27.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This reappearing launch button can happen when a security setting on your OS is preventing the patcher from loading or scanning game files.
