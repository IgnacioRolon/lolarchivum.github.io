My client somehow is laggy. Like when I accept a game people already start champ select before I even see the champ select. \r\nI have re-installed league 4 times now. \r\nI tried to enable low spec mode but it doesn't help. \r\n\r\nThis was working before no problem before re-installing league and windows. \r\nThe only difference I can see is before I had the client upgraded from the old one which didn't lag. But when I download it fresh it lags.\r\nAll my drivers are updated, is there anything that could fix this or am I stuck with lag?","replies":[{"poster":"Le Blue Flamingo","date":"2017-08-18T04:46:22.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didn't work I will send a ticket instead.
