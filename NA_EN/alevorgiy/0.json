Can't get justice for 5 years","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello. I need a huge help. My account was banned 5 years ago while  i was in the army for 2 years. I joined LoL in may 2010. Played 6 months, my behavior was almost perfect ( i am sure it can be verified by riot ). I was drafted into the army in november , and served  for 2 years. I have siblings and we share 1 computer. My siblings were using computer and were playing games on it.  All my life we played together and i was using the same password in all games, so my siblings saw it ( of course ). So they played without me while i was serving. I asked support  personnel  for help many times but they say it is my fault. I please anybody to hear and understand that it is not my fault. Thats how it goes. After this banned account my siblings created 2 other accounts and they were banned too. Names of banned accounts: Zhesy and AlevOrgiyBanned. Can anyone help me? ( Iv also created this duscussion in ''The Game ''Player behavior'').","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T00:13:56.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the sounds of it, this ban might have happened due to [**account sharing**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204214670) which is against the ToS. You're welcome to reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see what could be done though!","replies":[{"poster":"AlevOrgiy","date":"2017-09-25T08:03:10.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support personnel don help me. They say it is my fault. It last 5 years already. But I am  trying to explain that it is not my fault.  I did not share account. My siblings did not play on my account, they were watching me.  Thats it. Just imagine:  I got letter from military commissariat, i go to military commissariat and after 3 day i am in the army. Hah, thats how it goes. LoL password change was the last thing I was thinking about.","replies":[]}]}]}
