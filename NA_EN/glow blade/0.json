Or at least make you waste summs and back. No shield or heal support can counter his insane damage pre-6 laning phase, combined with his adc damage as well. The moment he walks in a bush- if its not already warded, you're probably dead.. You either die by trying to ward it or when you move an inch. Combined with his late game team damage... He needs to be looked at.\nEither his CDs or mana costs need to go up, considering he is played mainly as support. I have never seen a Brand go OOM in lane. Considering they spam their stupid stuff all day long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissDianaPT","date":"2018-04-17T17:34:54.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sick of Brand supports.
