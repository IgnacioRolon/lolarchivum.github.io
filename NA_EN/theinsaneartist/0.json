Are they gone forever?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T02:07:24.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like that skin shard reroll did end up going through and you got the FrankenTibbers Annie skin. Those skins are automatically unlocked, so you should be able to find the skin in your collections now.","replies":[{"poster":"theInsaneArtist","date":"2017-06-26T02:09:22.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh. Okay, I'll check when I'm on again, thanks! That didn't happen when I rerolled before, but that must have been because I didn't have the champion that time...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T02:17:13.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's precisely the reason! If you own the champion, the rerolled shard will be auto-unlocked. If you *don't* own the champion, it will go into your loot as a permanent that you can activate for free once you DO own the champ!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
