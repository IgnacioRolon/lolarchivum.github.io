But Garen being able to turret dive, take Multiple turret shots, Spin for true damage and then ult someone under tower completely 100-0 them. Wether it is the ADC or the Tank. Then he can Q out with a quick sprint just as good as the summoner ability \"Ghost\" and Instantly start regening huge portions of his health, so that he doesn't even have to back after such a greedy decision.\n\nIs that no different than he was before the Juggernaut patch? Its fucking broken, maybe it was before too  but it is undeniable now. Except to Garen mains who want to push 2 buttons the whole game and still complain about things Garen does and the \"nerfs\".\nHe is an Automatic Champion. \nFisher Price's My first champion. \nHis ability rotation is no different than Katarina.. the difference is all the Armor, Health, Magic resist True damage, Health regen and escape.\nThat is the EXACT definition of Imbalance","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-09-17T17:37:59.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Garen could always do that!!! Thats what im trying to say.... the only difference is you needed to build tanky. Btw Garen's Q gives him 30% MS for 1.5 seconds, Ghost gives 27% MS for 10 seconds and ignores unit collision... So its not really just as good, i mean if it gave the ability to ignore unit collision id say it was.  \n\nBtw the more simple a champion is, the easier it is to deal with them. If you complain they are too simple then its because you don't know how to deal with them. The best way to deal with Garen is to not get hit by his Q, and you basically win the trade. If you are the Villain then run away, his Q has an 8 secod CD so if you can stop it (which you can easily with any form of CC) then you are pretty much home free unless he has Dead Man's Plate, but thats really a problem with that item now isnt it? Poking him to remove his passive during laning phase is how you bully him, if he cant regen then he will lose most trades. They lowered his silence duration and his E's damage early to mid game so he is a bit weaker ability-wise.   \n\nDoes Garen need nerfs? Yes his ult should not do true damage based off the targets missing health. His ult doesnt make sense anyways as it has nothing to do with Justice, its more like picking on the weak... but most of the issue is Garen's synergy with Dead Mans, Steraks, and Black Cleaver. But Garen is not OP he is a noob stomper, no one knows what to do and they panic when they see him coming.

Do you even understand the implications of what that would do to your team if you're the tank? He's going to kill you within 6 seconds of the engage or you can wait until all your lanes are completely pushed. There's no way that the \"Run away\" excuse is actually legitimate.

Regardless of what he said. Irelia often stuns people with lower percentages of health because the game doesn't recognize the changes fast enough when she goes in. It happens to me all the time with Gnar. I burst her and she drops lower than me. She Q W AA which drops me lower then Es and stuns me anyways.

How is it fair that every other top laner gets punished for how they preformed in top lane, but she does not?

She has built in tenacity, long duration stun that activates when when she has lower health percentage (this specifically leads to a lot of dumb moments when laning against her), gap closer, and heal. It's as if she was made for climbing in solo queue. Her power spike, which is huge, is at such a convenient time in ranked play. She doesn't have as many trade offs, and I don't believe she takes a lot of skill to use.\n\nShe does fall off late game, but the fall isn't as dramatic as her rise is, and her early game is not weak.\n\nSince everyone is always complaining Riot releases skins before nerfs. I propose in celebration of the Irelia nerfs, they should create that \"Better Nerf Irelia\" skin that has been floating around in Skins and Champion Concepts. It's a good opportunity to make fun of that silly meme people still use today, even though she's been the queen of solo queue for this season. FOTMs have come and go, but she's still there. Irelia is way too strong compared to most of her peers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-09-16T22:03:16.333+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are people really only NOW catching onto the fact that Irelia needs a complete rework?\n\nI really hope they pull a Gragas on her and say fuck off, she shouldn't even be a bruiser in the first place, let's make her thematic and gameplay watch better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImpossibleGT","date":"2015-09-17T04:41:48.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What?

Are you confusing Irelia with Renekton? Renekton was long considered to be the #1 top laner.\n\nI am not. When she was released, Irelia caused all sorts of problems because she dominated top lane by having literally everything in her kit. It got to the point that Riven was specifically tailored upon release to be \"strong enough to compete with Irelia in top lane.\" We all know how that turned out. Irelia was the bar that all other top laners were compared against, and it created a ridiculous arms race where each new champion had to be strong enough to compete with all the other champions strong enough to beat up on Irelia, namely Riven.\n\nRemember, this was back when Heart of Gold and Philosopher's Stone were still auto buys on top laners. Renekton's lane bullying didn't matter because double gold per 5 items meant enemy tops could miss every CS and still scale to late game stronger than him.\n\nAll of this is getting off topic, though. The point is Irelia started a chain reaction by having a kit so perfectly suited to top lane that she pushed out basically everyone else, until she got pushed out in turn by new releases effectively designed to beat her.","replies":[{"poster":"Hazare","date":"2015-09-18T23:54:05.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah no, you're really confusing Irelia with Renekton HARD.
