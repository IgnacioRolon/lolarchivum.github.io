Don't know about the rest of you, but I don't see how any mana-using melee champions will be able to hold their own against her.  Hell, I don't think very many ranged champions will be able to hold their own for very long either.","replies":[{"poster":"mtAkFzLsUS","date":"2015-01-19T21:36:33.292+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shes been broken since release because of her stupid kit","replies":[{"poster":"19 19 19","date":"2015-01-19T21:53:33.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nuclear Blender,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=76HgYEo5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-19T21:36:33.292+0000)\n>\n> Shes been broken since release because of her stupid kit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-19T21:44:38.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jokes on you!

They said it had something to do with the Over lapping CC problem that they where trying to fix. It's possible that this is Inadvertent and unavoidable. And Frankly, She should not be balanced around bad controls.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-01-19T21:48:32.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People are just gonna play Rumble or J4 top into her and completely shit on her.","replies":[]}]}
