Locking out the odds because 3 people pick the same champ no longer makes it a lottery, and plus it defies math. Here's how math, and a lottery, works:\n\n100%/5 = 20%\nEach player, therefore, should have a vote weight of 20%.\n\nIf 3 players pick Yasuo, their combined vote weight is 60%.\nThat means there is still 40% vote weight unaccounted for. \nIf the other 2 players pick Caitlyn and Jinx, there vote weight should be 20% each.\nSo the lottery odds should look like this:\n60% Yasuo\n20% Jinx\n20%Caitlyn\n\nWhat this SHOULD mean is that Yasuo is 10% more likely to be picked over Caitlyn or Jinx combined. What this SHOULD NOT mean is that Caitlyn and Jinx are *never* picked, because the math still allows for them to get picked, albeit at lower odds.\nThe current system is utterly stupid, and whoever designed the math calculations needs to go back to school and re-evaluate his or her life as a programmer.","replies":[{"poster":"B01","date":"2016-08-10T15:26:20.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But majority pick works in the way of there are 5 people in the game 3 vote a certain champ 2 vote another.

By that logic, which clearly whoever designed the pick system is not using, there should still be odds for 2 other players' picks if 3 pick the same champ.
