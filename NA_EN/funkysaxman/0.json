The only time i can get this to not happen is when i ALT+TAB out of the league window, in which case league just crashes. I have tried resetting my computer to an earlier date, which didn't work; I have tried deleting league and re-installing it which didn't work; I have tried cooling my computer to keep it from overheating, which also didn't work. I was wondering how i could fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T20:44:50.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your PC running Windows 10?
