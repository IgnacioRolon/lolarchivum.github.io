I switched it back to the legacy client and I press the play button to go to the login screen but it just grays out and then lights back up and I can press it over and over again with nothing happening. I was just wondering if anybody could give me some insight on how to fix this. I tried reinstalling it and the same problem happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T20:56:47.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever the Play button grays out, it means your network is having a hard time keeping a stable connection with our matchmaking servers.
