Once I tried playing with my friend and the game had started right? When it started I saw an Empty map. No minions, no champs, no chats. just an empty map. I thought it would load, but it didn't so I had to reset. I tried to reconnect and it happened again. Then i got a AFK Penalty. \r\n\r\nNEXT I played with my friends again and the queue pop up wouldn't go away. It wouldn't get off my screen even when I clicked accept. We ended up going into champion select and I couldn't select a champ cause this crap wouldn't get off my screen. I rapidly clicked accept and decline and it wouldn't go away. so I had to leave league and tried again and now I have a 12 min penalty. This needs to stop, before it turns into an hour and i can't play. It's not my wifi or anything. it's literally league being glitchy. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!! ASAP!! THIS IS HAPPENED 4 TIMES!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T04:44:13.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straaaaaange. I've got this account pulled up now and it doesn't look like it's received *any* punishments since 2016. Also it's rather strange that you would have been hit with a 12 min penalty, seeing as that's not one of the increments for low priority queues. Let me know if you were referring to a different account and I can check up on that one for ya.","replies":[{"poster":"Oetui","date":"2017-07-23T23:38:43.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't? i don't know then :( But thank you for your reply.","replies":[]}]}]}
