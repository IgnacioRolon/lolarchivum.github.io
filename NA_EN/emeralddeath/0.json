I have no proof of this but i decided to play league for 24 hours and most of the games went horribly. i wasn&#039;t feeling too positive while playing . I believe i have gotten at most a 14 day ban and a week ban. Maybe a mute. I allready understood the consequences of my actions but i totally forgot them when i (like i said you wont believe me ) decided to not sleep for 24 and play league . i forgot the consequences and started flaming. Is there any way eventually to get my account back? I have spent a lot of time on that account , playing everyday and on my birthdays i would get some money to buy skins.. can u please think about my request and get me unbanned.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-29T03:52:36.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nobody gets unbanned, especially not for feeling sorry for themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Viomaster","date":"2018-07-29T05:46:09.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive seen people unbanned but usually the logs aren't that bad and didnt warrant the use of a perma ban.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BEST MEAT BALLS","date":"2018-07-29T03:47:14.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i dont think so , but maybe cause recently someone got unbanned lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2018-07-29T03:46:15.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"support.riotgames.com\n\nsubmit a ticket. this board is for players to chat about the punishment system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2018-07-29T13:44:11.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can try a support ticket...but you already said you are very negative and have had multiple punishments, staying up all day to play league is not an excuse for poor behavior","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-07-29T04:23:38.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can try contacting Riot via a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
