My ping would be at 35ms then it would randomly jumped to 300-400 then back down to 35. I went through hextech its not a packet loss issue and i had this since beginning of 2016 and this made me quit lol for awhile and i started to ply again now but still have this issue. I have verizon fios, EST Coast in Rhode Island. I have and i5 and a GTX1060\r\nNOTE:THIS ONLY HAPPENS IN LOL EVERYOTHER GAME IS FINE\r\nDoes anyone whats happening to me? or has anyone else have a similar situation","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T22:00:29.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those kinds of random ping spikes are most likely going to either be some issue with your ISP or some form of packet loss.
