In my game, there was a {{champion:67}} that Inted, Griefed (attempted and often succeeded in getting our players killed), and spammed a few less than kind things in chat. The {{champion:67}} spammed the words &quot;motherfucker&quot; towards my team and towards me. {{champion:67}} told me and others to &quot;kill yourself&quot; and to &quot;kill your mother&quot; (on mothers day). I did not act in a way that was good. I called the {{champion:67}} out for her toxicity and for griefing. This was to let the other team know that her &#039;mistakes&#039; were actually intentional. I spoke to 2 people in live chat, and 2 tickets. None of these people could give me a reason for my ban that actually made sense. The first live chat ended up saying that rule #4 of the Summoners Code, was a reason for my ban. Enjoy yourself, but not at anyone else&#039;s expense. Not only did i not enjoy this ranked match  that i was put into, but the {{champion:67}} got to have her fun at my team&#039;s expense. The next reason was simply that i was negative. They second live chat, while not giving me any true reasoning as well, also gave me the idea of posting to the forums about this. Below will be my chat logs from the game, including all of my &#039;negative&#039; comments. My main issue, and ultimately why I followed through with the idea of posting to the forums, was that when I asked for reasons to put here in my case, they avoided something they had previously said. I wanted to get their quotes so that it would not seem like I was withholding any important details from this discussion, but when i asked about a specific quote, a reason for my ban, as they put it, they avoided the topic. They had said that I had negatively affected the {{champion:67}} and her game. And this is where I realized they didn&#039;t know what they were talking about. This player had gone into ranked with the intent to throw games and behave in a toxic manor. When i acknowledge the fact that she is toxic and throwing the game, calling her out is not negatively affecting her play, as they are already losing the game on purpose. I don&#039;t have any of the other player&#039;s chat logs, but my live chat records show that it is seen by the support member, making sure it is true. Eventually, I was fed up, and spam posted the quote in our live chat. I know I know, this was rude, but guess what happens next. The support member says, &quot;(12:05:24)\tAgent 007: Since it appears there are no further questions, I will now be closing out this chat\r\n(12:05:29)\t*** Agent 007 left the chat ***&quot; This is copy pasted from the transcript just like the rest of my conversations will be. \r\n\r\nReally I just want to get the opinions of my fellow League players. I don&#039;t think I did anything wrong. I didn&#039;t break any written rules and nothing has been provided to support my ban. They said I haven&#039;t improved with my chat behavior, but my first ban, back when i first started playing, was for pretty much the same reason as the {{champion:67}}. I was being harassed, and not knowing the rules, and not being a kind person, I did the same thing the {{champion:67}} did, telling a player to kill themselves and used a homophobic slur. If you compare that, to how I act not, there is a clear difference and shown improvement. All in all, I just want to see what others think of this, and if you&#039;re on my side, speak up, because this happens to everyone. People who are ruining this community for everyone else, do not deserve to get away with this type of thing, and those who simply call a player out to tell they they have been caught (even though i did go further in that, again i wont lie) get banned. Again, bellow are my conversations and in both my chat logs are included. Even if you don&#039;t think i should be unbanned, I&#039;d like to know why, as i am still yet to have gotten reasoning for my ban. Thanks and have a good day. \r\n\r\nFirst, I will show the last part from the second live chat (the main problem i have with my ban)\r\n\r\n(11:59:38)\tAgent 007: Perhaps you can try going to the boards\r\n(11:59:47)\tAgent 007: And seeing what the community thinks\r\n(12:00:20)\tXxScorpionKillsx: can you repeat for me the different reasonings so that i can copy paste it into my community discussion\r\n(12:00:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: so that i dont get anything wrong\r\n(12:01:03)\tAgent 007: Your account was penalized for calling out Vayne\r\n(12:01:06)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i dont want this to turn into a he said she said id like there to be proof of what is being poseted\r\n(12:01:13)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and regarding the negativity\r\n(12:01:19)\tAgent 007: a lot of what was said was disrespectful, rude and insulting\r\n(12:01:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: what is the quote for the negatively affecting the vayne that i should inclide\r\n(12:01:38)\tXxScorpionKillsx: on regards to her play\r\n(12:01:50)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and my teammates pla\r\n(12:01:56)\tAgent 007: A lot of the chat was not neutral, positive or strategic in any manner\r\n(12:02:11)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that is not what you said earlier though\r\n(12:02:29)\tXxScorpionKillsx: Agent 007The things you were saying negatively affected Vayne\r\n(12:02:32)\tAgent 007: I said it at 4:14PM\r\n(12:02:50)\tAgent 007: Agent 0074:14 PM And I&#039;m not saying what they did was okay I&#039;m not saying that at all But I am saying CALLING them out on their negative play does not help you or your team. It&#039;s not neutral, it&#039;s not positive, it&#039;s not strategic.\r\n(12:03:02)\tAgent 007: Agent 0074:09 PM A lot of this chat is disrespectful, rude, and insulting\r\n(12:03:19)\tAgent 007: Agent 0074:17 PM Literally the every line in the second half of this match is only calling out Vayne\r\n(12:03:25)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that is not specific and you are not responding to what i posted as acopy paste\r\n(12:03:44)\tAgent 007: I apologize if this is not specific enough for you\r\n(12:04:06)\tXxScorpionKillsx: you have not responded to what i poseted\r\n(12:04:12)\tAgent 007: Your account was banned for calling out Vayne\r\n(12:04:15)\tXxScorpionKillsx: Agent 007The things you were saying negatively affected Vayne\r\n(12:04:16)\tXxScorpionKillsx: Agent 007The things you were saying negatively affected Vayne\r\n(12:04:17)\tAgent 007: Here are some examples\r\n(12:04:29)\tXxScorpionKillsx: you are not responding to your other quote\r\n(12:04:40)\tAgent 007: [9:33] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): vayne is telling us to kill ourselves and our mothers also swearing and trolling please report [10:08] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): see [10:28] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): no just vayne shes so toxic and trolling [11:34] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): thanks :) it would be worth it if you report vayne because shes actually so toxic [11:48] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): shes ruining our community [13:51] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): we can do this even if shes a trol [18:06] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): ?

this?\r\n10-game chat restriction &gt; 25-game chat restriction &gt; 2-week suspension &gt; Permanent suspension\r\n(11:55:06 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: i feel like while they are negative, they arent truely toxic\r\n(11:55:34 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: and i only say they are negative because one i got banned for them and two cause i said the word toxic in most of them\r\n(11:55:51 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: are they truly bannable?\r\n(11:56:53 PM) Mr. Feeny: So to put it bluntly Kills, it is. \r\nBut in more detail, we apply penalties based on your previous chat logs and how you&#039;ve improved or unfortunately not improved. :\\\r\n(11:57:13 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: wait thats is simply not correct\r\n(11:57:19 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: i have improved emensly\r\n(11:57:30 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: in the past i was on the side of the vayne\r\n(11:57:32 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: as in what i did\r\n(11:57:41 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: now im saying its ok we got this all the

Feeny: I do highly respect that you do your best, that&#039;s exactly what you gotta focus on.\r\n(11:58:44 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: but you said that i havent been improving\r\n(11:58:48 PM) Mr. Feeny: Unfortunately, the chat was focused on the problematic players rather than the game.\r\n(11:59:01 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: how could it not be\r\n(11:59:12 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: a long game where they have done nothing but break the rules\r\n(11:59:47 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: i have read all public things on behavior and no where can i find anything that makes my responses bannable\r\n(12:01:33 AM) Mr. Feeny: The only reason we had to apply a 2-week suspension was because you did receive a 25-game chat restriction. And the next escalation of penalties is a 2-week suspension. :\\\r\n(12:02:08 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i would like to add that my first restirction (the ten game) was a friend typing while i was in the bathroom he was playing so i wasnt afkk\r\n(12:02:23 AM) Mr. Feeny: I forgot to mention this, if you&#039;re not familiar.\r\n10-game chat restriction &gt; 25-game chat restriction &gt; 2-week suspension &gt; Permanent suspension\r\n(12:02:37 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: also i dont get how my actions were even reportable\r\n(12:03:01 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i mean i broke no written rules\r\n(12:03:40 AM) Mr. Feeny: Are you familiar with the Summoner&#039;s Code?\r\n(12:03:46 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: yes ive read it many times\r\n(12:03:57 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: especially with this recent ban\r\n(12:04:49 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: if this ban stays is there any way to move skins and stuff to another account\r\n(12:05:51 AM) Mr. Feeny: Sadly this is a ban that will remain in tact and on another sour note, we don&#039;t actually transfer goods from one skin to another.\r\n(12:06:35 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: wait you brought up the summoners code but have not provided me with an area that shows that my actions in those two games was reportable\r\n(12:06:59 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: is there someone who is higher up than you that i can speak too\r\n(12:07:14 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i mean like ive said multiple times\r\n(12:07:37 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: Imaqtpie does worse than i did on stream and nothing happens to him\r\n(12:07:44 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i dont want him banned\r\n(12:07:52 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i want to use his as a reason for my unbanning\r\n(12:08:26 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: how come my non report-able actions have gotten me banned\r\n(12:09:53 AM) Mr. Feeny: Part 4 is kinda what I can aim at if you&#039;re looking to reference the summoner&#039;s code\r\n(12:09:54 AM) Mr. Feeny: Enjoy Yourself, but not at Anyone Else&#039;s Expense\r\n(12:10:19 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: their actions where at my expense\r\n(12:10:19 AM) Mr. Feeny: Though another player caused issues. There were many times where you were calling out that player&#039;s poor behavior :\\\r\n(12:10:36 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: if you dont mind can you pull up the full chat log for the game with vayne\r\n(12:10:42 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: id like to show you what they said\r\n(12:10:46 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and how i did nothing\r\n(12:10:50 AM) Mr. Feeny: I won&#039;t be able to actually, for privacy reasons. :\\\r\n(12:11:26 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: their chat logs? from my game???? thats not privacy restricted because i can access it and do whatever i want with it\r\n(12:11:51 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i cant get them myself right now because the ban does not let me access replays\r\n(12:12:08 AM) Mr. Feeny: Yes, we cannot provide other player&#039;s chat logs.\r\n(12:12:32 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you dont have to provide me with it if i was able to access my replays but my account is banned...\r\n(12:12:38 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: here ill tell\r\n(12:12:43 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you what they said\r\n(12:12:49 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: &quot;kill yourself&quot;\r\n(12:12:54 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: &quot;kill your mother&quot;\r\n(12:12:58 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: spammed &quot;motherfucker\r\n(12:13:00 AM) Mr. Feeny: That&#039;s super not okay.....\r\n(12:13:05 AM) Mr. Feeny: Ima look into that player&#039;s account....\r\n(12:13:14 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: thats not all\r\n(12:13:17 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: they afk&#039;ed\r\n(12:13:23 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: ran it down in the jg\r\n(12:13:28 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: inted\r\n(12:13:31 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: griefed\r\n(12:13:39 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i did nothing to that player\r\n(12:13:46 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and they ruined my game and my experience\r\n(12:13:58 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i simply asked others to help me remove this player from the community\r\n(12:14:25 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: as they were the reason for the game being &#039;at my expense&#039;\r\n(12:14:53 AM) Mr. Feeny: Welp, you have every right to be irritated in this game. :|\r\n\r\nBut these are the types of games we do need to learn to deal with to prevent a even furthering negative atmospherics.\r\n(12:15:09 AM) Mr. Feeny: Atmospheres\r\n(12:15:37 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i fail to see why asking others to report a truly bad and toxic player from the community got me banned\r\n(12:15:41 AM) Mr. Feeny: I totally get it though, I&#039;d wanna be calling that player out left and right too &gt;:[\r\n(12:15:44 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i didnt harass the player\r\n(12:15:53 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i did nothing to the player in game\r\n(12:16:01 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i saved him from feeding about 20 times\r\n(12:16:05 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i didnt give up\r\n(12:16:07 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i did nothing\r\n(12:16:21 AM) Mr. Feeny: Though asking to report is minor in a sense. You honestly do not need to, it only takes 1 report for us to fully investigate a player&#039;s account for any sort of ill-mannered behavior\r\n(12:16:40 AM) Mr. Feeny: It&#039;s honestly the frequency of calling that player out, that issued this penalty\r\n(12:16:56 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: (i ask this in a polite way not meaning to be rude) how should i know the system and how it deals with reports\r\n(12:16:57 AM) Mr. Feeny: Legit, just gotta keep those thoughts to yourself and to focus on the game.\r\n(12:17:13 AM) Mr. Feeny: Oh no worries, our IFS (Instant Feedback System) is far from perfect and I will not argue that\r\n(12:17:23 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: going back to the time stamps\r\n(12:17:40 AM) Mr. Feeny: It&#039;s a unresponsive function that needs to be reworked without a doubt, but you just have to trust us.\r\n(12:17:45 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i called them out 6 times in a nearly 40 minute game\r\n(12:17:47 AM) Mr. Feeny: It&#039;s a lot more effective than you think\r\n(12:17:59 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: that isnt very frequent\r\n(12:18:13 AM) Mr. Feeny: More than once is actually more than necessary when considering what is negative in chat. :\\\r\n(12:18:17 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: they said the word &quot;motherfucker&quot; more often than i said anything\r\n(12:18:28 AM) Mr. Feeny: Swearing is no problem btw\r\n(12:18:34 AM) Mr. Feeny: As long as its not negative towards others.\r\n(12:18:43 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: yes saying &quot;FUCK&quot; isnt bad\r\n(12:18:52 AM) Mr. Feeny: Ur good\r\n(12:18:57 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: but constantly harassing me and calling me &quot;motherfucker&quot; sis\r\n(12:19:04 AM) Mr. Feeny: Not okay &gt;:[\r\n(12:19:06 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i legitimately did nothing\r\n(12:19:20 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: have you read from my first report\r\n(12:19:24 AM) Mr. Feeny: Seriously man, I just wanna prevent a perma.\r\n(12:19:26 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: my first ban*\r\n(12:19:36 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: have you read from that?\r\n(12:19:48 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: id like you to compare it to now\r\n(12:19:54 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: because you said i wasnt improving\r\n(12:20:08 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you could even read the ones from the 10 and 25 game ban\r\n(12:20:20 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i understand you are trying to help\r\n(12:20:33 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: but my actions do not cause a ban for anyone else\r\n(12:20:40 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: yet they cause it for me\r\n(12:20:52 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: they acted &#039;at my expense&#039;\r\n(12:21:00 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i didnt harass\r\n(12:21:03 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i didnt give up\r\n(12:21:07 AM) Mr. Feeny: That&#039;s it right there.\r\n(12:21:09 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i wasnt toxic whatsoever\r\n(12:21:14 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: yet i got banned\r\n(12:21:29 AM) Mr. Feeny: Your focus is so hellbent on other players that you&#039;re not realizing that it&#039;s actually causing problems for yourself.\r\n(12:21:41 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and my final warning and ban before perma comes from a game where i didnt break rules\r\n(12:21:54 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i realize what my actions cause\r\n(12:22:10 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: but it didnt change anything about how the game played out\r\n(12:22:16 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: how players played\r\n(12:22:20 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: or how the vayne acted\r\n(12:22:42 AM) Mr. Feeny: Though that may be true, it did change the dynamic of your team&#039;s playing atmosphere.\r\n(12:22:52 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: what do you mean\r\n(12:22:57 AM) Mr. Feeny: Real talk, if these were just not said at all, you wouldnt have had any issues.\r\n(12:23:11 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: that can be said about the vayne too\r\n(12:23:16 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: but nothing happened to her\r\n(12:23:25 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i said its ok we got this to the team\r\n(12:23:31 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i was positive and encouraging\r\n(12:23:37 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: not toxic\r\n(12:23:48 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i was even kind in my request for the reports\r\n(12:24:04 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i didnt say repert her shes a douche\r\n(12:24:10 AM) Mr. Feeny: Honestly man, this a 2-week that isn&#039;t going to change and having us argue the chat isn&#039;t going to change that. :\\\r\n(12:24:19 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: but why\r\n(12:24:25 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i didnt break rules\r\n(12:24:48 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you havent provided me with any true reasoning that is explained by already accepted and public text/rules\r\n(12:24:56 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: is there someone higher up i can talk to\r\n(12:25:21 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: im certain they will understand and un ban me because if anyone looks at this\r\n(12:25:25 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i mean all of the chat logs\r\n(12:25:29 AM) Mr. Feeny: There is not a higher up that has any more authority when lifting suspensions\r\n(12:25:33 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: they know i should not have been banned\r\n(12:25:53 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: did you read what i did during my other banns\r\n(12:26:04 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: not even all the chat just my actions that were bad\r\n(12:26:16 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: it cannot be said that i have not imporved\r\n(12:26:22 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i am 200x + better\r\n(12:26:39 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: i also muted the player for half the game\r\n(12:26:45 AM) Mr. Feeny: I&#039;m sorry to say that though you may feel that you&#039;ve improved, that isn&#039;t the case for this penalty.\r\n(12:27:01 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: then why did you say it was a reason\r\n(12:28:14 AM) Mr. Feeny: The improvement for the use of chat is determined by our IFS (Instant Feedback System) and if is detected that your use of chat (on a case by case basis, we do no compare you to anybody else) than a further penalty is applied\r\n(12:28:34 AM) Mr. Feeny: I&#039;ve reviewed your previous chats and I will have to agree with our decision to 2-week suspend your account\r\n(12:28:41 AM) Mr. Feeny: I don&#039;t mean to be blunt, but if there are no other concerns, I will need to close this live chat.\r\n(12:28:48 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and it thinks that me starting by telling people to kill themselves compared to now isnt an improvement\r\n(12:29:00 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: is this on record\r\n(12:29:10 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: can i access this later when speaking to someone else\r\n(12:30:21 AM) Mr. Feeny: If you do continue this endeavor with another member of player support, you will be met with the same result and your 2-week suspension will not be lifted.\r\n(12:31:48 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: but will our convorsation be recorded or do i have to take pictures so that i can get unbanned im sorry but &#039;to be blunt&#039; you clearly have not reviewed my other restrictions and bans from chat becuase you fail to see the improvement between telling people to kill themselves and calling them %%%%%%s to what i do now as in act kindly and do nothing that is against the writen rules\r\n(12:31:55 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: will i have to record this myself\r\n(12:32:26 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: because this is not being dropped that easily because you dont want to spend time to actually help me\r\n(12:32:36 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: im sorry but this is rediculous\r\n(12:32:59 AM) Mr. Feeny: It&#039;s out of hand for sure.\r\n(12:33:01 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you wont provide me with ANY INFORMATION ON WHY I HAVE BEEN BANNED\r\n(12:33:07 AM) Mr. Feeny: You&#039;re free to copy this chat log if you wish\r\n(12:33:27 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: can i get the name of the higher up that cant help with my ban but is your higher up\r\n(12:33:30 AM) Mr. Feeny: Your account has been suspended for 2-weeks for negativity towards other players in the game.\r\n(12:33:44 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: ?\r\n(12:33:47 AM) Mr. Feeny: If you would like specifics, we have discussed that above.\r\n(12:33:55 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: no we have not\r\n(12:34:02 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you have not given me that name\r\n(12:34:04 AM) Mr. Feeny: I will not be able to provide you with any name.\r\n(12:34:10 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and your reason has been disproven\r\n(12:34:16 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: well thankfully i have yours\r\n(12:34:23 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and this will be taken to the higher up\r\n(12:34:37 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and they will unban me because one you have not given me information\r\n(12:34:45 AM) Mr. Feeny: You&#039;re free to do so.\r\n(12:34:47 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: and two you will not give me the name of the higher up\r\n(12:35:49 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you can leave now if youd like will i record this\r\n(12:35:57 AM) Mr. Feeny: Sure thing.\r\n(12:36:08 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: goodbye and have a nice day\r\n(12:36:24 AM) XxScorpionKillsx: you have ruined a players game more than the player who harassed me\r\n(12:36:33 AM) *** Mr. Feeny left the chat ***\r\n\r\nChat 2 \r\n\r\n(10:42:24)\t*** Agent 007 joined the chat ***\r\n(10:42:25)\tAgent 007: hey hey\r\n(10:42:30)\tXxScorpionKillsx: hI!\r\n(10:42:33)\tAgent 007: ah\r\n(10:42:57)\tAgent 007: I want to set appropriate expectations because I don&#039;t want you to feel like I&#039;m misleading you in anyway.\r\n(10:43:10)\tXxScorpionKillsx: ok\r\n(10:43:20)\tAgent 007: My goal with chatting with you is to help you understand the reasoning behind the penalty on the account. While I know it sucks to have your account penalized, we want the game to be as positive as possible.\r\n(10:44:03)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i understand that but i need a true reason for my ban, i have spoken with 3 people so far and none of them were even able to give a good reason why i was banned\r\n(10:44:18)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the only reason im still trying is because they cant give me a reason\r\n(10:44:28)\tAgent 007: Hmm\r\n(10:44:35)\tAgent 007: Let me read over your previous chats\r\n(10:45:28)\tXxScorpionKillsx: if you can, can you read the reasons behind my first ever ban on this account i feel that it would show the improvements needed that were mentioned in my last live chat that the person did not want to read in order to see the improvement\r\n(10:45:38)\tAgent 007: Sure!\r\n(10:45:39)\tAgent 007: I can do that\r\n(10:45:43)\tAgent 007: Can you give me a few minutes?\r\n(10:45:49)\tXxScorpionKillsx: yeah take your time\r\n(10:45:53)\tAgent 007: Sweet\r\n(10:45:53)\tAgent 007: Thanks\r\n(10:46:05)\tAgent 007: Oh wait\r\n(10:46:06)\tAgent 007: By first ever\r\n(10:46:10)\tAgent 007: You mean the 2 week suspension?\r\n(10:46:15)\tAgent 007: From December 1st?\r\n(10:46:20)\tXxScorpionKillsx: yes\r\n(10:46:22)\tAgent 007: kk\r\n(10:46:32)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that was very early on in my &quot;career&quot;\r\n(10:46:42)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and that is what i wanted the other person to se\r\n(10:46:58)\tAgent 007: Ah I see\r\n(10:47:08)\tAgent 007: Yah I do see you were given a 2 week suspension for kys and homophobic slurs\r\n(10:47:16)\tAgent 007: Reading the current chat log\r\n(10:47:21)\tAgent 007: I definitely see an improvement\r\n(10:47:26)\tXxScorpionKillsx: yes and i regretted it a lot and ive changed\r\n(10:47:39)\tAgent 007: Real quick\r\n(10:47:42)\tAgent 007: props to you\r\n(10:47:51)\tAgent 007: I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;ve made major changes\r\n(10:47:55)\tXxScorpionKillsx: also if you read the full chat logs from all players in the recent games that resulted in my ban you&#039;ll see that i didnt really do anything reportable\r\n(10:48:00)\tAgent 007: Definitely!\r\n(10:48:08)\tAgent 007: So real quick on that though\r\n(10:48:24)\tAgent 007: Why do you think the reform card only shows you your chat logs?\r\n(10:48:36)\tXxScorpionKillsx: because it only cares about my behavior\r\n(10:48:45)\tAgent 007: Exactly, why do you think that is?\r\n(10:48:46)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the only problem is that it cannot take in context\r\n(10:48:59)\tAgent 007: Fair\r\n(10:49:02)\tXxScorpionKillsx: because it thinks i was behaving poorly\r\n(10:49:17)\tAgent 007: Well, the dev team can easily make it show both sides right?\r\n(10:49:28)\tXxScorpionKillsx: what do you mean by that\r\n(10:49:30)\tAgent 007: And the system is actually pretty complex and can tell\r\n(10:49:53)\tAgent 007: Well, they can make it so that it shows the full chat logs as opposed to just one side\r\n(10:50:36)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the reason i say it doesnt bring up context is because a fairly large portion of that chat (all but 6 of my messages) were not even aggressive or negative if looked at with the followup or response text\r\n(10:51:21)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the last person i talked to tried to bring up part 4 of the summoners code i believe\r\n(10:51:32)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i think it is have fun but not at any others expense\r\n(10:51:47)\tXxScorpionKillsx: this was the only thing they could come up with regarding my ban\r\n(10:51:59)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but again with context you&#039;d see my karma\r\n(10:52:08)\tXxScorpionKillsx: as in the person in the game i was calling toxic\r\n(10:52:14)\tAgent 007: I see\r\n(10:52:49)\tXxScorpionKillsx: was spamming &quot;kill yourself&quot; &quot;kill your mother&quot; (on mothers day) &quot;motherfucker&quot; and was afk&#039;ing, griefing, and inting\r\n(10:52:56)\tAgent 007: Ahh yah I do see that\r\n(10:52:59)\tAgent 007: So on that part\r\n(10:53:06)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i muted the player\r\n(10:53:12)\tXxScorpionKillsx: if that is what youre going to say\r\n(10:53:24)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that is why the time stamps are so spread out\r\n(10:53:40)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i unmuted assuming that without the responses the player would stop talking to me\r\n(10:53:41)\tAgent 007: The thing is, Riot holds each player accountable for their own actions. So while other players may say or do things that antagonize us, ultimately, we&#039;re still responsible for how we choose to respond.\r\n(10:53:54)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i get that\r\n(10:53:57)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but like\r\n(10:54:00)\tXxScorpionKillsx: what did i do\r\n(10:54:22)\tAgent 007: So most of this chat log\r\n(10:54:28)\tAgent 007: It seemed like you were arguing with your own teammates\r\n(10:54:38)\tXxScorpionKillsx: no no no\r\n(10:54:50)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i consistently said we got this in my games\r\n(10:55:22)\tXxScorpionKillsx: almost every time something went wrong i followed it up with, whatever its over we got this, or dont give up guys we got this\r\n(10:55:25)\tXxScorpionKillsx: even if i knew we did\r\n(10:55:28)\tXxScorpionKillsx: didnt*\r\n(10:56:44)\tAgent 007: So while I do kinda see that, there&#039;s also a lot of chat logs that are antagonistic with your teammates. For example calling out youre reported, fucking trolling, BRUH YOURE SO TOXIC SHUT UP AND PLAY, ok youre getting banned.\r\n(10:57:37)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and that is one of the 6 bad text parts from the huge amount, i mean i had told the player over and over to just play so we could win and that is when the &quot;motherfucker&quot; spam came in\r\n(10:57:53)\tXxScorpionKillsx: im pretty sure right after that\r\n(10:58:00)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i assured the team that &quot;we got this&quot;\r\n(10:58:13)\tXxScorpionKillsx: trying to diffuse the situation\r\n(10:58:36)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the last person i spoke to said that i was not improving on my toxicity\r\n(10:58:46)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but i really have a hard time believing that\r\n(10:59:08)\tAgent 007: I actually think you&#039;ve improved since your first penalty\r\n(10:59:29)\tAgent 007: But the reason why this penalty is a 2 week suspension is because this is the 3rd tier in the penalty ladder\r\n(10:59:38)\tAgent 007: The first 2 are the 10 game chat restriction and 25 game chat restriction\r\n(10:59:44)\tAgent 007: Both of which your account already got previously\r\n(10:59:57)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i think that even between the 10 game (which was actually a friend while i went to the bathroom) and the 25 game chat restriction to now has had an improvement\r\n(11:00:39)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i mean if i was a well known streamer this wouldnt have happened\r\n(11:01:03)\tXxScorpionKillsx: its seen all the time that people call others out on stream like imaqtpie for example\r\n(11:01:07)\tAgent 007: Well actually all players are held to the same standard\r\n(11:01:21)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i love that guy and i dont want him banned but i want to use him as an example for my point\r\n(11:01:25)\tAgent 007: So even if imaqtpie said these exact same things in the exact same circumstance\r\n(11:01:31)\tAgent 007: He would also receive the exact same penalty\r\n(11:01:45)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i can send a link to a video where he calls a player useless over and over but nothing happens\r\n(11:02:14)\tXxScorpionKillsx: yet i mute someone after they are literally ruining the game for the team and i get banned for a call out\r\n(11:02:17)\tAgent 007: Sure but just because you don&#039;t see he got a penalty doesn&#039;t mean he didn&#039;t get one\r\n(11:02:32)\tAgent 007: Well.. do you get why calling someone out is considered negative?\r\n(11:03:27)\tXxScorpionKillsx: well again if the system is more sensitive the more bans on the record and the consistancy of his comments i think it can be said that it would be evident that he was penalized because it would happen on stream\r\n(11:03:28)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and no\r\n(11:03:31)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i am not\r\n(11:03:35)\tXxScorpionKillsx: just like in my case\r\n(11:03:47)\tXxScorpionKillsx: a lot of the things said can be and are taken out of context\r\n(11:04:12)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that is why i feel that there are only 6 possible things that can be considered negative\r\n(11:04:46)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and even then out of all of my chat from the past however many games 6 call outs is nothing\r\n(11:05:04)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i also wasnt aware that the system was good enough to only need one report to be effective\r\n(11:05:10)\tXxScorpionKillsx: if i had known that\r\n(11:05:18)\tXxScorpionKillsx: a lot of my text would not even be there\r\n(11:05:41)\tXxScorpionKillsx: there is no public document i can find that would explain my banning\r\n(11:05:59)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and this is why i havent given up and accepted that i screwed up yet\r\n(11:06:31)\tXxScorpionKillsx: cause i cant find anything and the only thing given to me to try and show it was thrown out instantly\r\n(11:06:55)\tAgent 007: So I want to bring it back and focus\r\n(11:07:23)\tAgent 007: Firstly, I would say almost the entire chat log contributed to the penalty on the account\r\n(11:07:27)\tAgent 007: Not just 6 possible things\r\n(11:07:39)\tAgent 007: Literally almost all of it\r\n(11:07:55)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i talked about this with the last live chat person and he agreed that only 6 of the messages applied\r\n(11:08:13)\tAgent 007: The few lines of text I sent you were but a small snippet\r\n(11:08:14)\tAgent 007: Okay\r\n(11:08:15)\tAgent 007: But that&#039; sthem\r\n(11:08:17)\tAgent 007: I&#039;m telling you\r\n(11:08:23)\tAgent 007: A lot of this chat log flagged your account\r\n(11:08:44)\tXxScorpionKillsx: (11:44:24 PM) *** Mr. Feeny joined the chat *** (11:44:25 PM) Mr. Feeny: Hey there Kills (11:44:26 PM) Mr. Feeny: Gimmie a hot minute to check out whats going on here (11:44:31 PM) XxScorpionKillsx: ok (11:45:29 PM) Mr. Feeny: Hm, do you have the chat log for this 2-week suspension pulled up right now?

Summoner&#039;s Code because for one, it&#039;s not playing as a team or winning as a team, you&#039;re tearing other people down, you&#039;re not making allies on the rift, it&#039;s definitely not leading the way to newbies nor is it helpful.\r\n(11:24:36)\tAgent 007: That&#039;s 4 things\r\n(11:24:54)\tAgent 007:

teammates\r\n(11:25:51)\tXxScorpionKillsx: if someone is already throwing the game on purpose\r\n(11:26:10)\tXxScorpionKillsx: how does it affect her play in a negative fassion\r\n(11:26:16)\tAgent 007: When you have this back and forth with Vayne and you&#039;re calling them out\r\n(11:26:31)\tAgent 007: And your other teammates are trying to focus on the game\r\n(11:26:38)\tAgent 007: How does this affect them?\r\n(11:26:48)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the player was already doing everything they could to throw th game without being obvious to the other team\r\n(11:26:57)\tAgent 007: Right\r\n(11:27:10)\tXxScorpionKillsx: my teamates would not be affected by what i said if you check the logs they only complain about the vayen\r\n(11:27:11)\tAgent 007: But does what you&#039;re saying help your other teammates in any way?\r\n(11:27:14)\tXxScorpionKillsx: not about what i said\r\n(11:27:31)\tAgent 007: What if I told you your other teammates did not appreciate the things you said?\r\n(11:27:53)\tXxScorpionKillsx: id say id need them to say it for me to know it because everyone takes things differently\r\n(11:28:22)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i mean they complained about the vayne and all i did was agree nothing else was directed towards them but the positives on my chat logs\r\n(11:28:53)\tAgent 007: Them complaining about the Vayne does not make it okay for you to add to it\r\n(11:29:12)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i mean i personally get encouraged when others agree with me\r\n(11:29:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: if i just said to a random player why is she toxic\r\n(11:29:50)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and that player responded with yeah i know right its so annoying\r\n(11:29:50)\tAgent 007: Bottom line, the things that were said in this game were creating a negative environment for other players in the game, Vayne included.\r\n(11:29:56)\tXxScorpionKillsx: it would help me not break me down\r\n(11:31:05)\tXxScorpionKillsx: wait why is the negative environment around vayne a thing at all acknowledging the that the player is throwing a game and being literally the worst player ive ever encountered is the environment already\r\n(11:31:14)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i didnt create the negative environment\r\n(11:31:22)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i commented on its existanse\r\n(11:31:24)\tAgent 007: Regardless of whether or not they were throwing the game or not, they are still a player\r\n(11:31:44)\tAgent 007: Commenting on its existence is not what chat is there for\r\n(11:32:33)\tXxScorpionKillsx: chat isnt for calling others motherfucker over and over again or telling people to kill themselves and their mothers over and over on mothers day either\r\n(11:32:50)\tAgent 007: Thats true\r\n(11:32:52)\tXxScorpionKillsx: chat is mean for communication between teamates\r\n(11:33:25)\tXxScorpionKillsx: this negative atmosphere wasnt created by me and just like you said i did call them out as most of my text in the later half of the game\r\n(11:33:28)\tXxScorpionKillsx: however\r\n(11:33:41)\tXxScorpionKillsx: none of these comments were directed at the vayne\r\n(11:33:47)\tXxScorpionKillsx: she wasnt spoken too\r\n(11:33:54)\tAgent 007: So who were you talking to then?\r\n(11:34:26)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i was requesting that the other players report the vayne (not knowing that 1 report gets the system on the hunt)\r\n(11:34:36)\tAgent 007: and why\r\n(11:34:36)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i only learned about the system yesterday\r\n(11:34:48)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and this same thing has been done in my games MANY times before\r\n(11:34:55)\tXxScorpionKillsx: someone says the player is trolling\r\n(11:35:01)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and requests that others report as well\r\n(11:35:24)\tXxScorpionKillsx: its is to my knowledge that no one really knows that the system only needs one report\r\n(11:35:35)\tXxScorpionKillsx: excluding those like me who are informed later on\r\n(11:35:42)\tAgent 007: Does telling the other players in the game to report someone help your team win? As in, is it strategic in any fashion?\r\n(11:36:38)\tXxScorpionKillsx: in professional play, if someone has fed so hard that a player can one shot nearly the entire team and there is no counter play, is the game over? dont the casters even say, this game is over\r\n(11:36:56)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i was positive and kept trying\r\n(11:37:11)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i even protected the vayne trying to stop them from inting anymore\r\n(11:37:17)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i never gave up\r\n(11:37:28)\tAgent 007: Does telling the other players in the game to report someone help your team win? As in, is it strategic in any fashion?\r\n(11:38:16)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i believe removing a player from the community that represents the purest of the toxic stereotypes for the league community as a win just like many others do\r\n(11:38:44)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i dont remember so dont quote me on this but i dont even think i was the first one to suggest that we should report the vayne\r\n(11:38:57)\tAgent 007: No no\r\n(11:39:02)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i mean isnt your job to remove that kind of player from the game?\r\n(11:39:21)\tAgent 007: Does telling the other players in that game you&#039;re in to report someone help your team with THAT GAME?\r\n(11:39:29)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and to help them realize their mistakes and what they were doing\r\n(11:39:37)\tXxScorpionKillsx: no it does not\r\n(11:39:41)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i wont lie\r\n(11:39:52)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but would saying we got this one more time help either\r\n(11:40:12)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the game was lost from the start it was 4v6 with one player feeding another so much that we couldnt do anything\r\n(11:40:19)\tXxScorpionKillsx: again i didnt give up\r\n(11:40:22)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i tried my best\r\n(11:40:26)\tXxScorpionKillsx: playing to the very end\r\n(11:40:40)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but it could not have made a differense\r\n(11:40:53)\tXxScorpionKillsx: also sorry im tired and cant spell\r\n(11:42:22)\tXxScorpionKillsx: all players in the game on my team realized just as soon as i did that there was nothing we could do about the situation\r\n(11:42:40)\tXxScorpionKillsx: we didnt ff because that is the easy way out\r\n(11:42:58)\tXxScorpionKillsx: we wanted to play it out like it is supposed to be\r\n(11:43:10)\tXxScorpionKillsx: we all knew what was going to happen\r\n(11:43:16)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but we still tried\r\n(11:43:51)\tAgent 007: Bottom line is the things that were said in this game were not okay which means this 2 week suspension was correctly placed and will not be removed or reduced.\r\n(11:44:10)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i still dont get how they were not okay\r\n(11:44:30)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the example you gave me for a reason is just like the last one i got\r\n(11:44:38)\tXxScorpionKillsx: it doesnt really work\r\n(11:45:09)\tXxScorpionKillsx: #4 enjoy yourself, but not at anyone else&#039;s expense\r\n(11:45:15)\tXxScorpionKillsx: this was the last reason i was given\r\n(11:45:26)\tAgent 007: The things you were saying negatively affected Vayne\r\n(11:45:40)\tXxScorpionKillsx: HOW?\r\n(11:45:50)\tAgent 007: Calling them out on their negativity\r\n(11:45:52)\tXxScorpionKillsx: her play didnt change at all\r\n(11:46:04)\tXxScorpionKillsx: infact it improved after realizing she was caught\r\n(11:46:09)\tXxScorpionKillsx: at least her play not her chat\r\n(11:47:05)\tAgent 007: it&#039;s not about how her play changes or anything like that\r\n(11:47:06)\tXxScorpionKillsx: look i get where youre coming from and i get youre doing your job but to you honestly think that what my teammates and i did negatively affected her play?\r\n(11:47:13)\tAgent 007: It&#039;s simply just these things are not okay to say\r\n(11:47:19)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i think that is what it is about\r\n(11:47:31)\tXxScorpionKillsx: you said it negatively affected vayne\r\n(11:47:46)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the only negative way she was affected was with her banning shortly after\r\n(11:48:12)\tXxScorpionKillsx: she archived her goal that game\r\n(11:48:13)\tAgent 007: Calling out others on their negativity is not okay\r\n(11:48:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: if i hadnt done that\r\n(11:48:49)\tXxScorpionKillsx: people wouldnt know or suspect her of the inting or griefing\r\n(11:49:02)\tXxScorpionKillsx: those are important to how the player is seen\r\n(11:49:08)\tXxScorpionKillsx: having a bad game isnt reportable\r\n(11:49:13)\tAgent 007: It&#039;s not your job to get players banned\r\n(11:49:18)\tXxScorpionKillsx: doing these things on purpose is\r\n(11:49:22)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i get that\r\n(11:49:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but without the reports from players\r\n(11:49:37)\tXxScorpionKillsx: just like me\r\n(11:49:45)\tXxScorpionKillsx: they would not have been seen by the system\r\n(11:49:50)\tAgent 007: It&#039;s true\r\n(11:49:56)\tAgent 007: But chat isn&#039;t there to call out players on their negativity\r\n(11:50:01)\tXxScorpionKillsx: or is there some other part that is not disclosed that i needed to know\r\n(11:50:46)\tXxScorpionKillsx: chat isnt there to tell others to kill themselves and their mothers or spam motherfucker ( im sorry if what im saying and the way im saying it comes across as rude i dont intend it)\r\n(11:50:56)\tXxScorpionKillsx: yet it is used that was consistantly\r\n(11:51:13)\tXxScorpionKillsx: the fact of the matter is that i didnt affect this player\r\n(11:51:21)\tAgent 007: Let me ask you something\r\n(11:51:27)\tAgent 007: Why do you keep bringing up what they said?\r\n(11:51:51)\tXxScorpionKillsx: because it applies very much to what happened to me\r\n(11:51:52)\tAgent 007: It has no relevancy to your account\r\n(11:51:58)\tXxScorpionKillsx: it does though\r\n(11:52:01)\tAgent 007: Nope\r\n(11:52:10)\tXxScorpionKillsx: without this player doing what they did\r\n(11:52:15)\tXxScorpionKillsx: nothing would have happened\r\n(11:52:17)\tAgent 007: Only the things you say and do matter in regards to your account\r\n(11:52:26)\tAgent 007: Your account was not penalized for their actions\r\n(11:52:30)\tAgent 007: It was only penalized for your actions\r\n(11:52:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i know that\r\n(11:52:39)\tAgent 007: You keep saying that\r\n(11:52:42)\tAgent 007: But then you keep bringing up what they said\r\n(11:52:50)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but to say that I negatively affected this player&#039;s game is false\r\n(11:53:01)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and that is your pretext for my ban correct?\r\n(11:53:04)\tAgent 007: You&#039;re welcome to disagree\r\n(11:53:05)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that is what you have told me\r\n(11:53:08)\tAgent 007: But this suspension will remain\r\n(11:53:29)\tAgent 007: If there are no further questions Ill have to consider this matter resolved\r\n(11:53:37)\tXxScorpionKillsx: then id like to talk to your higher up because the reasons given are not stated anywhere and dont apply to the situation\r\n(11:53:53)\tAgent 007: There is no one higher to talk to\r\n(11:53:59)\tAgent 007: This is the highest escalation possible\r\n(11:54:09)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i was informed that there is no higher up regarding my ban\r\n(11:54:27)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but there was regarding my conversations with my helpers\r\n(11:54:46)\tAgent 007: There isn&#039;t any escalation\r\n(11:55:13)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i was told this by another support\r\n(11:55:18)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i have it in my chat logs\r\n(11:55:24)\tAgent 007: Ok but I&#039;m telling you, there is no escalation\r\n(11:55:40)\tXxScorpionKillsx: you cant tell me that you are your own boss and arent regulated by anyone else\r\n(11:55:51)\tAgent 007: I can literally say\r\n(11:55:54)\tAgent 007: I&#039;ll escalate you\r\n(11:56:04)\tAgent 007: But there is no one higher to escalate you to\r\n(11:56:45)\tXxScorpionKillsx: but there is someone who hired you right\r\n(11:57:04)\tAgent 007: Yes but there is no higher escalation\r\n(11:57:07)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i have not been given a true reason other than ones that dont apply regarding me ban\r\n(11:57:23)\tAgent 007: I get that you disagree with the reasoning\r\n(11:57:38)\tAgent 007: And that&#039;s understandable\r\n(11:57:45)\tAgent 007: But the suspension was correctly placed\r\n(11:57:46)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i disagree because it truly is unrelated\r\n(11:57:48)\tAgent 007: and will not be removed\r\n(11:58:08)\tAgent 007: Since it appears there are no further questions\r\n(11:58:11)\tAgent 007: I will now be closing out this chat\r\n(11:58:15)\tXxScorpionKillsx: then i will continue to peruse this issue even after my suspension has been lifted\r\n(11:58:20)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and just liek the last person\r\n(11:58:28)\tXxScorpionKillsx: you cannot supply any reason\r\n(11:59:01)\tAgent 007: 4 different people gave you the reasoning\r\n(11:59:05)\tXxScorpionKillsx: other than what the stupid computer tells you to do in order to hold this job (not implying this is a full time or attacking you in any way)\r\n(11:59:28)\tXxScorpionKillsx: they have given me no such reasoning other than it will stay cause of this unrelated pretense\r\n(11:59:38)\tAgent 007: Perhaps you can try going to the boards\r\n(11:59:47)\tAgent 007: And seeing what the community thinks\r\n(12:00:20)\tXxScorpionKillsx: can you repeat for me the different reasonings so that i can copy paste it into my community discussion\r\n(12:00:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: so that i dont get anything wrong\r\n(12:01:03)\tAgent 007: Your account was penalized for calling out Vayne\r\n(12:01:06)\tXxScorpionKillsx: i dont want this to turn into a he said she said id like there to be proof of what is being poseted\r\n(12:01:13)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and regarding the negativity\r\n(12:01:19)\tAgent 007: a lot of what was said was disrespectful, rude and insulting\r\n(12:01:34)\tXxScorpionKillsx: what is the quote for the negatively affecting the vayne that i should inclide\r\n(12:01:38)\tXxScorpionKillsx: on regards to her play\r\n(12:01:50)\tXxScorpionKillsx: and my teammates pla\r\n(12:01:56)\tAgent 007: A lot of the chat was not neutral, positive or strategic in any manner\r\n(12:02:11)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that is not what you said earlier though\r\n(12:02:29)\tXxScorpionKillsx: Agent 007The things you were saying negatively affected Vayne\r\n(12:02:32)\tAgent 007: I said it at 4:14PM\r\n(12:02:50)\tAgent 007: Agent 0074:14 PM And I&#039;m not saying what they did was okay I&#039;m not saying that at all But I am saying CALLING them out on their negative play does not help you or your team. It&#039;s not neutral, it&#039;s not positive, it&#039;s not strategic.\r\n(12:03:02)\tAgent 007: Agent 0074:09 PM A lot of this chat is disrespectful, rude, and insulting\r\n(12:03:19)\tAgent 007: Agent 0074:17 PM Literally the every line in the second half of this match is only calling out Vayne\r\n(12:03:25)\tXxScorpionKillsx: that is not specific and you are not responding to what i posted as acopy paste\r\n(12:03:44)\tAgent 007: I apologize if this is not specific enough for you\r\n(12:04:06)\tXxScorpionKillsx: you have not responded to what i poseted\r\n(12:04:12)\tAgent 007: Your account was banned for calling out Vayne\r\n(12:04:15)\tXxScorpionKillsx: Agent 007The things you were saying negatively affected Vayne\r\n(12:04:16)\tXxScorpionKillsx: Agent 007The things you were saying negatively affected Vayne\r\n(12:04:17)\tAgent 007: Here are some examples\r\n(12:04:29)\tXxScorpionKillsx: you are not responding to your other quote\r\n(12:04:40)\tAgent 007: [9:33] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): vayne is telling us to kill ourselves and our mothers also swearing and trolling please report [10:08] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): see [10:28] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): no just vayne shes so toxic and trolling [11:34] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): thanks :) it would be worth it if you report vayne because shes actually so toxic [11:48] [All] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): shes ruining our community [13:51] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): we can do this even if shes a trol [18:06] XxScorpionKillsx (Alistar): ?
