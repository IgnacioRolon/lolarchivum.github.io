Double edged sword has perks, but also drawbacks since mage supports are already very fragile and taking any % extra damage is painful.  You could always opt-out entirely and go into the Resolve tree, but that really is a non optional use of 12 points.\n\n- Tier 2 Cunning for non-mana dependent assassins.  Given that both Stormraider&#039;s Surge and Thunderlord&#039;s Decree are in the cunning tree, most assassins should want to spec 18 in this tree, but that teir 2 mastery feels really useless on them.   Without mana, or, at least, without mana problems, there&#039;s a low chance they are going to be given many blue buffs, so they are forced into the biscuit mastery, which isn&#039;t bad at all, but at many lower levels of play, you won&#039;t see summoners buying potions past the first buy or two, and even in higher levels of play, getting bonus mana isn&#039;t really useful to them, though the extra HP is kinda nice, it still feels like a halfway wasted mastery in many cases, and it kind of eliminates the whole idea of getting to choose your playstyle through masteries since you are going to be forced into biscuits by default, even if you don't have a portion heavy playstyle.\n\n\nThe good thing is that this is super easy to fix just by adding a few more mastery choices.  Previous masteries &quot;Expose Weakness&quot; and &quot;Blade/Spell Weaving&quot; seem like good candidates, but that&#039;s hardly the important part.  As long as they get replaced with SOMETHING that feels more worthwhile, I think there are a lot of good options.\n\n\nWhat do you think Meddler?  Or have you not thought about this much... In which case, feel free to mull it over and let me know what you think :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-24T05:05:12.237+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're generally on the same page. Long term we'll probably flesh out the tier 1 and tier 2 keystones until there are three choices there for each tree. First thing we're likely to add to is the Cunning tree.

I personally prefer to opt into damage, and I don't care about the rune choice or the dangerous game. I'd rather pick something else.

Because that's exactly who needs it.\n\nI appreciate you taking the slow approach though.   I'd rather have mastery options that give everyone a decent choice at every teir that takes 3 months to get out, than to have more options NOW that still leave champions left out.\n\nI still think blade/spell Weaving is perfect for most assassins, and expose weakness is perfect for mage supports, but Riot always surprised me with their creativity, so maybe something entirely new would be even better! (Like, since it's for LANE assassins, maybe \"after dealing X damage to enemy champion, take reduced damage from enemy minions\" so it's easier to go for kills without dying","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"J Eevo","date":"2015-11-24T13:11:22.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any plans on introducing an option for poke mages like {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}}  who mainly poke with one spell (so thunderlord's a waste) and don't synergize well with deathfire (as opposed to champions with dot/ multihit abilities) and for mages that prefer to build CD reduction instead of flat AP (something with better base damage or benefitting them anyway)?","replies":[{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2015-11-24T14:34:48.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need a DoT to synergize well enough with DFT to use it, just reliable poke.\n\nOf course if you have poke AND a DoT ability, the synergy is even higher, but it's not a requirement","replies":[{"poster":"J Eevo","date":"2015-11-24T16:33:36.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The damage DFT adds to poke spells is laughable though, in comparison to mages that can utilize it well, and those that just go for thunderlord's.
