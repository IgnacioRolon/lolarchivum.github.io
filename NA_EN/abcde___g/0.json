The small experience I have seen leveling up a character (2 weeks) with lack of any sort of progression path is amazing in its self. All I have seen is a failed introduction for new players... I&#039;ve watched first hand as a broken system causes new players to stop playing and watch more experience players become toxic as hell. This isn&#039;t really the experience players fault, why are they even being matched with new players who do not yet have mastery&#039;s, runes or the skills to compete?\r\n\r\nWith a solutions architect background I can see several flaws straight away that could be easily addressed to accommodate new players. For a game of such age I am utterly amazed at how poorly setup this is! Or am I completely wrong in thinking that this company want new players?\r\n\r\nWhatever... As this community will say I&#039;m sure, harden up of F off. I&#039;ll give it a few more days of abuse, see how stupid to abuse I really can be.","replies":[{"poster":"Gunpowder Green","date":"2017-05-25T17:11:22.612+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently new to the game. New to the community as well, but I can agree that the learning curve is hard. But then again, I think it should be because of the competitive level this game brings. I do wish they would allow low levels access to spells, runes, and masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-05-25T17:34:42.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing for a decent amount of time now, but I do have 3 smurf accounts that are all level 10 or under.  I've played the same main champion on my main account for years, but I can't play her on my smurfs because of not having runes and masteries.  And it's not just that I'm bad with her ~~though that probably might not be completely wrong~~ as much as I've gotten so used to having the extra health, armor, mana regen, magic resist, movement speed, damage... all those things that come from runes and masteries that make it easier to live long enough to learn how to play the champions.  \n\nI learned the basics of league on my own, because I was too afraid of sucking when playing with the friend who introduced me to it.  But I watched ALOT of YouTube videos, and then I met some people in game that taught me slowly over time.  And then more YouTube videos.  And then I started subscribing to a few people on Twitch.  Basically, I went looking for the people who could teach me the things I needed to know.  Which was how I found Aphromoo and BunnyFuFuu.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-05-25T13:01:40.840+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno why this is getting downvoted. You're 100% correct.

I self taught on how to play this game and back when I started I think skarner just came out. I didn't play v people until lvl 20 as I was too scared but when I did I was bad. It took years of practice and learning to even see a result as this game is by the far the steepest learning curve in any game I have played. New champions all the time, new items, stat changes, map changes, etc. of course it's hard for a new player but with time you get good at the game. The biggest problem I see with new players is that expect soooooo much out of themselves that they automatically set themselves up to fail. With practice and a good mindset eventually you will start to climb.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bayloc","date":"2017-05-25T15:44:14.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its the internet, explain a competitive game that people are not being shitty to one another?","replies":[{"poster":"Castilios","date":"2017-05-25T17:40:01.242+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"something being competitive gives nobody the right to be mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-05-26T22:29:59.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Castilios,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=yll15Rry,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-05-25T17:40:01.242+0000)\n>\n> something being competitive gives nobody the right to be mean.\n\nEveryone has the right to be mean.

I understand there is a steep curve, but Riot has already announced they're working on that part. They are going to make it easier for new accounts to accumulate runes n such earlier. However, you won't eliminate people who just can't stand losing or having \"imperfect teammates\". These people are playing with ego, and not with their intelligence, so ignore them. you won't fix em, can't talk to em, and if they troll you just gotta accept thats the match youre in and move onto the next after.
