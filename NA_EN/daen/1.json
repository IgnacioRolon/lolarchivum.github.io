When looking at a thread's new comments by clicking the New button on the main page of a board, clicking \"Go to Comment\" will frequently pull up the OP and no conversation at all under it.  Here's a bulleted repro:\r\n\r\n1) Be in Discussion View.\r\n2) Find a thread with a New icon.\r\n3) Click the New icon.\r\n4) Find a new comment and click Go To Comment.\r\n\r\nYou will be rerouted to a page that just has the OP and no comments below it.  You can click Return to Full Discussion and it brings you there, but you lose your place and all New posts are considered read.  I am aware this has been talked about a lot and has existed for months, but I figured I would write it in the current format as per the sticky.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2015-01-08T21:27:23.277+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"THE SYSTEM WORKS!!!

Now once you pull up something like the Rioter Rundown it brings up all the comments with said tag, but as far as the 'show comment' feature goes I think it's just because they're not coded differently in the foundation.\n\nThis being said I also only really know the surface layer coding (CSS elements and such) and even then not too well, so take any of my 'expertise' with a healthy sized grain of salt XD","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-01-08T18:07:42.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more expertise than I have!  \n\nIf it is in fact the case that Rioter comments are treated no differently on the platform, that both makes sense and doesn't.  It matches the Boards team's apparent philosophies (Rioters are players too, don't want to seem eminent), but I feel like players are always going to want to see Rioter posts displayed with at least moderate importance.  It seems weird that developer comments can be hidden in the same was as your average player's comments, especially when it's possible that they are important and just hidden.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-01-08T18:45:56.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would argue that's being done via features like the Red tracker and Rioter Rundown.

It seems that things the community might find relevant shouldn't be hidden behind Show More in threads, regardless of whether it's a Rioter comment, a heavily upvoted player comment, etc.  My assumption is that players may put Rioter comments ahead of most things in order of what they desire to read, so hiding that behind Show More seems counter-intuitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-01-08T21:38:47.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree, there's also the concern of clutter. Without the 'Show more' feature cutting threads of comments, one thread will dominate over all others. Inversely, making select comments an 'exception' will still lead to comments being entirely too front-loaded imho. Where these exceptions are seen before anything else.\n\nPersonally I would like a comment system similar to Imgur's (minus the character limit), where all comments in a thread except the first, parent comment and then the user can follow a conversation via the conscious choice of maximizing. The parent comment would have the metrics of the resulting threads in it, i.e. \"35 children, 5 Red Comments\". Of course this would also produce a lot of invisibility to unexplored conversations, there's always a trade-off when it comes to limited visual real estate we're looking at.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-01-08T22:00:17.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Without the 'Show more' feature cutting threads of comments, one thread will dominate over all others.\n\nCutting threads makes sense, but it can be truncated in more intelligent ways.
