I'm personally a fan of eSports, which I think will naturally morph into esports, a la email.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-10-13T21:58:47.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I think it would be more appropriate to stick with 1 thread | 1 topic, and make this into a seperate thread.\n\nIf it recurs I likely will, but I didn't feel it detracted much.\n\n >It seems to be Esports right now so it'll make sense with the rest of the boards visually.\n\nHalf the time it is listed as eSports, half the time it's Esports.  eSports looks infinitely better in my opinion, mainly because it makes grammatical sense.  Esports really doesn't, as it reads \"eh-spOHRts\" or \"EHS-pohrts\" rather than \"EE-sports\".\n---\nANYWAY, off topic.  Typos.  Yep.","replies":[]}]}]}
