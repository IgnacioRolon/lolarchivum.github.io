The only thing new with Blitz is the in game overlay that helps show you your cs compared to different ranks.\nI'm both confused and mad because I have been playing for a long time and have paid a lot of money for different champs and skins.\nI have placed a ticket but I'm still confused cause Blitz has been said to be safe.\n\nJust recently as well I have looked into Blitz only to find that a Riot employee had said that this app doesn't go against TOS.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-10-14T12:44:28.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot recently updated their 3rd party policies for TFT.

Anything outside the game is fine, but overlays are not.  I'd try to get confirmation about that though.\nJust in case, send a ticket explaining your situation and presenting evidence that a Riot employee actually made a statement about this particular application.  The worst that happens is... nothing.  You have already been banned, so trying to argue your case can't make the punishment worse.  At best, the ban gets revoked and you get a warning if there is actually a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-10-14T11:17:28.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An overlay by itself is no problem.
