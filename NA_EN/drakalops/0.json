No.  Is this the buff I wanted as a Kled main? No.  Is this change going to hurt the game in the long run?  Absolutely.  Healing in general is out of line yes, but that is due to how easy healing debuffs are to obtain right now.  Adding more healing debuffs to the game will only force you to buff healing even more, otherwise healing won’t be useful.\r\n\r\nRevert the q change and consider this instead:\r\n\r\nStats:\r\nBuff Kled’s health to 340 + 75 per level from 340 + 70 per level\r\nNerf Skaarl’s health to 400 + 60 per level from 400 + 65 per level\r\n\r\nPassive:\r\nCourage when hitting enemy champions lowered to 12 from 15\r\n\r\nRemove the -20% damage to champions when dismounted\r\n\r\nAlternatively\r\n\r\nKled now gains 15% / 40% increased attack speed when dismounted, scaling with level.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s also a bug where his enhanced W attack just straight won’t proc.  It happens every game against minions, however, it has rarely happened against champions.  That being said it still does happen, and it should be fixed as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-07-20T16:52:18.697+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Adding healing debuffs on champions is a good way to go about it.

He is meant to be a 1v1 killing machine and a perfect single target picker in teamfights, yet his ult barely has any uses in fights other than having a slight knock-back and his E is just a way to stick to his target without anything else extra (and this, with an huge cooldown for an ability doing barely anything).\n\nHis passive is possibly the strongest in the whole game, the only reason it feels so lacking is because how burst damage is sooooooo common in the game and that Assassins are pretty much ruling everything, making remounts hardly possible against opponents who actually know how it works.\n\nMy take on balancing him would be putting a new passive effect on his E (since he levels it last, making it more late-game relevant), making him take reduced damage from all sources BUT the person hit by his Q knockback (only if it does hit). While dismounted, it would be the opposite, making him take reduced damage from those hit by his shotgun blast.\n\nWhat he is lacking is new mechanics, not bigger numbers (he already has some of the biggest in the game). Anti-healing is interesting, but not in such a meta and particularly not on a champ such as Kled, he needs something else to replace this.","replies":[]}]}
