We all met up in San Fran for the NA LCS Finals, and it was a weekend we won't forget anytime soon!","url":"https://youtu.be/PILyHaSluGI","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PILyHaSluGI/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not really sure how to make this happen, but we really want to show all of those at Riot this video! This video is a bunch of clips of all of us who flew in from around the country to watch the NA LCS Finals together and just do life together, as well as us talking about how playing together has impacted our lives! From not knowing each other at all in a random matchmaking game, to months later meeting up with each other and feeling like family, we really want Riot to know its more than just a game to some of us. Riot, if you&#039;re watching, thank you for an awesome opportunity! If you watch this and know how to reach riot, please take a second to send it their way! Thank you everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot c0ttonnz","date":"2018-09-20T16:55:53.739+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"We see you guys.
