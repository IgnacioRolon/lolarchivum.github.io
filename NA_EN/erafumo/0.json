Only once in 5 years, actually. I have always been the type to get mad, usually when I am flamed first. So around a month or two ago, I was chat banned, then banned for 14 days. In both instances I was _responding_ to flame, not instigating. Both times it was because a duo flamed and reported me, rather than a single person. Very few times have I been told the person I reported was punished, but here I am, all at once. This is obviously due to the new robot system they use to pick out the flamers, but it didn&#039;t acknowledge the afk person or anything they said. \r\n\r\nMostly what led to the report was him calling me adopted and me responding by calling him an autist. Now, I don&#039;t condone this behavior at all, but a logical response to being flamed is to flame back. It is human nature. But when the report system is based on just someone being rude to you, why is there a mute option? If muting removes all hostility chat-wise, why is it a reportable offense? I have been playing for five years and had over $600 dollars in this game, but now it is all to waste. It was my birthday yesterday and I bought myself Star Guardian Jinx today for my me-celebration. But a natural, human response to me being provoked led to a permanent ban. I could keep playing on a new account, which would be completely fine. However, I now lose more than half a thousand dollars, prompting me to write this.\r\n\r\nI am specifically targeting the new system, or _Instant Feedback_, as Riot calls it. In real life, are instant, unresearched answers ever better than a thought-out, methodical approach? No. And I am aware there are too many players to go through. For a perma-ban, I do not think an instant system should be in use, and as much as I would like to plead for a case reviewal, I am aware Riot takes no time or effort for this kind of thing, as I researched the topic and found that many had asked Riot and pleaded to no avail, with one even having Riot Lyte respond. I am aware that due to the terms I, and we all, agreed to that I have no legal right to my account or the money value attached to it, but I do believe it should not be completely wasted. If I could choose another account to send it it to, it&#039;d be great. Of course that would mean that there are no consequences, but what if I split it up between several friends? It is really the monetary issue bothering me.\r\n\r\nI get that toxicity is bad. So put emphasis on the mute button, not a perma-ban for a 5 year account. With such a toxic community, one would think it would make more sense to address the issue, not every player infected by it. Imagine how many people would be banned if every person was being scanned by this algorithm at the same time. I know it would be a massive percentage, since I only have 3 offenses, and many have many more. Riot has essentially sided with the person who flames first, acts like a victim, and has a buddy with them to report with him.\r\n\r\nI assume that there are many players who can relate to this, and I hope they respond. It is a natural thing. Riot is essentially telling us to remove our thought of freedom of speech and targeting anyone who has even mild anger issues.\r\n\r\nI believe it would be better to have an actual in depth review on who flamed who and who the blame should be on, in the case of a perma-ban. I have no closure since it was a robot who decided me being reported by two people was a better choice than banning the person reported by only one person. They probably feel great that I was punished, but it could have just been me having an off day or, as mentioned before, just having natural human response. I would personally like to petition Riot to reconsider and revamp the ban system, especially for perma-bans, even if it does not affect the status of my beloved account.\r\n\r\nSo, finally, I am likely going to bring this to a close by calling this my official resignation letter from League of Legends. I apologize for not being the perfect role model who has only had 3 offenses recognized by Riot in 5 years, which is apparently enough to have an algorithm ban me forever.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-04-08T14:20:58.509+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am also HIGHLY amused by the fact you say 'the mute button is there for toxic chat' when you clearly got in trouble several times for not using the mute button yourself in response to flaming.\n\nYou are eloquent now, but the fact is, you have a history of using flaming to respond to your problems when flaming is only going to ever make things worse, not better.\n\nAnd if flaming is the natural response, why is the permaban rate only .06%?

The IFS is in place for cases such as these because of its very high success rate compared to humans and its unrivaled speed. In the past Riot has been open to overturning or lower punishments that were issued in error or were too harsh.
