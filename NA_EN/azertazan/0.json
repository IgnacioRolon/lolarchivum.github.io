But there is an issue with his name- Is it pronounced \r\n\r\nA. &quot;Tom Kench&quot;\r\nB. &quot;Tam Kench&quot;\r\nC.  &quot;???????&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is really bugging me. If a Rioter could comment on this, I&#039;m sure it would clear up a lot of confusion. Or if it was in the VO and I just missed it like a moron, someone please enlighten me.
