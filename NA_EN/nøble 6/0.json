I am Pyke. Level 6, no ultimate threshold shown, no ultimate execute threshold shown. When executing enemy with ult, ult is not refreshed, person who assisted does not get kill gold. One bug happened where I ulted 2 enemies and successfully killed them, but randomly gave my friend, Riven, the double kill, and ult did not refresh or give me gold for assists.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-13T03:45:25.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pyke's ult has been buggy as hell since day one.","replies":[]}]}
