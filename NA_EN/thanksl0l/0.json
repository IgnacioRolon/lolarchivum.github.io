I chose ranked game, chose both positions and the \"find a game\" button didn't show. After some time I managed to do it. I was 6min in queue, so I canceled it. But it was stuck there so I couldn't queue again.\r\nI then decided to quit the client.\r\nNow the client won't open. I click on it to open and the window's client doesn't appear. If I go to the \"force quit\" option, it doesn't show the League process.\r\nWhat is happening?\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T22:29:36.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen if your connection is struggling to reach our services, for example the patching or matchmaking servers.
