It feels weird to balance around a subjective stat that may or may not be present in any given game. Swain may have 40% CDR by 20 minutes or he may have 10%. That feels like saying, \"We should nerf blitz's AP ratios because he can build damage and one shot people.\" It makes sense for Swains that have 40% CDR at 25 minutes, but it drastically hurts those at 11 minutes with no CDR beyond blue buff.\n\nI get the concept of playability windows, but the problem seems to have more to do with the functionality of his ultimate as a sustainable shape-change that deals damage, heals him, and costs a large amount of mana if he wants to maintain it for a long time. It feels like playing around Swain ult atm is dependent on making him go oom to fight him, which is obviously bad. At the same time, Swain loses a lot of sustain because he now has to wait about 3x as long to actually heal from minions and champions. It makes him more likely to try and get as much out of the ult as he can by keeping it on longer so he can heal more/deal more damage. That could lead to bigger mana problems because he doesn't want to use a 30s CD for nothing/not a lot of benefit.\n\nAny thoughts on that balance philosophy?

The last two are components of a very viable core buid (Tri+SV+GB+Tabi).\n\nI feel like the last tri force changes basically gave her \"free\" 40% CDR which covers up one of Irelia's laning weaknesses. Many matchups that used to be able to abuse her were centered around being able to fight on a shorter window than her W cooldown (Renekton, Riven...) but are both in positions where their trading window is almost equal to hers and is significantly weaker than hers.\n\nA huge part of the strength of Irelia on the last two patches comes from this **ease of getting 40% CDR** with items that she very much likes. Before Tri force had CDR, the core build was FH+SV to give 30% CDR, but it only did this after spending over 3k gold on defensive items (FH+kindlegem) after Tri Force, on the current patch the same can be acquired by just completing Tri Force and Kindlegem. The result, is also that she can have a hybrid damage-tank lategame build (Tri+Ghosblade+Visage+tank) which gives 40% CDR from relatively early in the game (by 20 min she has 40%) which gives her Q a cooldown of under 4 seconds, basically rendering the Q reset mechanic irrelevant as she doesn't have to be careful about when she uses it.\n\nI would have proposed that the stats on **tri force are returned to AD/HP and possibly some AP, bringing it back to a 10% or 0% CDR item.** And that her Q cooldown is increased to around 8 seconds when maxed. Also,** it would be nice to see some changes that allow the return of early-dominant champions like Renekton, Riven, Pantheon, Olaf, Rumble, and maybe even Darius** that allow her to be countered in lane, as her Irelia's identity has always been a moderately weak early and late balanced by a spiky midgame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-06-15T04:12:08.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Speaking from my experience with Irelia, the greater part of lack of windows to fight her when she's ahead comes from the E-W combo winning trades for free.\n\nDo you think this might finally be the time to take the equal health clause off of E?","replies":[{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-06-15T04:54:16.371+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Equal health- I doubt it.

Plus you nerfed irelia after trinity change, so now trinity is mandatory: if someone wants to start with difensive item (malmortius or some armor item) because he is behind, he'll go more behind without trinity\n\nnow downvote me without reply, that's how it works","replies":[{"poster":"Arekualkhemi","date":"2016-06-15T10:26:10.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Irelia's Ult procs Hiten Style's healing, that is the reason why it is not allowed to have such a low cooldown.
