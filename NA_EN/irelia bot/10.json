Thats what makes the RNG okay- it isnt really RNG in longer fights.\n\nEither way, I actually like the new Triforce on champions I buy it on. Jax and Irelia bought it for a mix of stats, which Rageblade provides (and still will provide. Jax is gonna build Rageblade unless it gets gutted), but some other toplaners can buy the item, such as Trundle, Dr. Mundo (its actually great on him, since he cant really buy IBG),  AD Fizz, AD Ekko (a bastardized AD Fizz that may be better now... try it :) ). And its not like Jax and Irelia are barred from the item- they can still get it.\n\n\nOverall, Triforce feels nice (10% cdr is great and makes it comparable to Cleaver for champs like Trundle, and 20% crit is a much rounder number with less RNG) and fits a wider cast of champions. It may be overshadowed by Rageblade in some areas, but its still a good buy on many champions and still fits the \"kinda works on everyone\" that the item was meant to achive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdderTude","date":"2015-11-18T06:16:47.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I build Trinity Force on Gangplank.

Get a Frozen heart + SV + death's dance/Ghostblade/Ionian boots and you have 40% without having to give up much of anything that you wouldn't already consider getting. And I will still be getting a Frozen heart and SV most games if it goes on long enough meaning that the 20% you are suggesting would in turn make other item options less appealing.\n\nI was not suggesting AP to return but to instead have 30 on hit magic damage and for trinity to be an on-hit focused item. This is reasonable for replacing crit chance and the 30 AP it use to have damage wise.\n\nAlso that 7% MS appearing out of nowhere does not fit Trinity in your concept. All of trinity's stats are found on one of the base items in some way or another.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Restless Slumber","date":"2015-11-18T02:22:01.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly miss the movespeed for udyr and hecarim.

The only two champions who appreciate the Trinity changes are {{champion:157}} and {{champion:41}}.\n\nIt's no good for Ezreal. He desperately needs the Attack Speed Trinity Force used to provide. Now that it only gives 15% his auto attack DPS is a lot lower, making the added Crit less useful on him. With 0.4 / 0.8 / 0.8 / 0.9 AP ratios, he seriously misses the 30 AP as it increased the damage of his W E R by quite a bit, and added 12 damage to Mystic Shot as well which is a longsword worth of damage.\n\nCork is focused on Magic DPS now and he too liked the AP on the item. Jax and Irelia also do not itemize for additional crit and preferred the attack speed and AP as well. \n\nI wouldn't count on Riot reverting their changes because they are literally beyond stubborn but I don't feel anyone at Riot thought the Trinity Force changes through. If they wanted it to be an ADC item why did they nerf the AD and Attack Speed on it AND increase the cost of the item, while introducing RFC and Shiv with more crit and Attack Speed at a far more reasonable price? The only reason Ezreal bothers buying it is because his Mystic Shot is balanced around him having a Sheen item and without Sheen the damage and scaling is pitiful.\n\nRiot for the love of god if you don't change anything else this patch please revert Trinity Force back to the way it was. {{champion:39}}, {{champion:24}}, and {{champion:81}} need this item to be the way it was. There is no fucking way that bastard of a champion {{champion:157}} needed any more itemization catered specifically to him. It's completely outrageous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-11-17T16:28:15.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Replacing the Zeal with either {{item:1043}} or {{item:3101}} both seem like they would be better options for most of the cast.\n\nIf it misses the movespeed too much, just buff the Rage passive a bit.","replies":[]}]}
