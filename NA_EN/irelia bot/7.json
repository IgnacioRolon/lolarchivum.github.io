Support starter items cannot be purchased along with jungle items {{item:1041}} {{item:1039}}.  For the first 15 seconds of the match, only the person in the support role can purchase a support starter item, after which someone else is allowed to instead (in case the support and someone traded roles in the lobby).\n\nEach lane has a new object added to it: a shrine.   Each shrine is positioned near the outer-most intact allied turret in the lane.  The shrines passively collect and store 15% of XP and gold from enemy minions dying in the lane they are in.  The XP is only collected if the person with the support item is not in range to ambiently collect minion XP.  Lane gold is collected and stored regardless.  If a turret is destroyed, the shrine is destroyed along with it and a new shrine activates at the new outer-most intact allied turret in the lane.  When a shrine is destroyed, 30% of the uncollected gold and XP is lost while the rest carries over to the new active shrine.  The inhibitor turret shrines are not destroyed with their turrets.  When a champion with a support starter item visits a shrine, they are granted the stored XP and gold in the form of passive charges (favor, spoils of war, tribute) which then provide the resources via the support item minigames.  If this would take the support above the maximum number of support item passive charges (which could be increased from current), then they're granted any remainder of XP and gold directly instead.  Support items no longer generate passive charges without collecting from the shrines.  The shrines also generate the ward recharges for completed {{item:3069}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3092}}, refilling at a guaranteed steady rate.  \n\nSplit XP could be changed so that the bonus 30% total is only applied when the person with a support item is present, and the bonus XP goes entirely to the non-support(s).  So the non-support XP cut would be 80% whether the support is in their lane or not.  The support would gain 50% XP while duo and would need to collect the remaining 30% from their shrines in order to match the 80% base level of primary laners.  So now that XP is being partially shared with the support whether they are in the lane or not, the support no longer creates a significant XP deficit by splitting a lane.  Furthermore, the support is now encouraged to roam in order to collect from their shrines and they will no longer fall far behind by roaming.  If they could time their roams perfectly to frequently split XP from big minion waves, they could out-level other champions (it will depend on factors like if the jungle visits lanes at the same time), but they will fall a bit behind if they time their roams poorly or when they lose uncollected XP and gold when an allied turret is destroyed (probably inevitable).\n\nLaners and supports can then be balanced around the new support XP system.  Mobile supports or level-dependent supports could be nerfed if the roaming high-XP support meta benefits them too much and supports that poorly match the new meta could be buffed.","replies":[{"poster":"Masala Chai","date":"2018-04-25T02:38:32.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes, and let's have a trolling solo laner instapickup a support item while making another minigame wahooo","replies":[{"poster":"Painted Celt","date":"2018-04-25T05:40:01.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is why the support queued player has 15 seconds to purchase a support item before anyone else is allowed to.  Besides, there isn't much point in not adding features just because griefers could abuse them to frustrate their team.  If a griefer is dedicated to losing or making the game miserable then they will find a way no matter what.\n\nThe shrines would be pretty unintrusive.  You'd just walk by them once in a while to pick up your gold and xp.  There wouldn't be any game around contesting them really.  They'd just be reminders to roam once in a while when you would normally head out to ward, and an incentive to help defend allied turrets.\n\nThe one thing that does occur to me now is that csing with a support item would need to be penalized or else a carry role might take it to passively earn gold while occasionally swapping lanes to pick up the stored resources.  Perhaps it would be enough to make it so that if the support item owner takes CS with nearby allies then there is simply no 30% bonus duo xp awarded which would make it inefficient for the team for total resources.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2018-04-25T01:07:59.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Masala Chai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ERPoWBwH,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-04-24T16:10:41.997+0000)\n>\n> That would cause supports to be incentivized to roam or not lane botside at all.\n\nGood.\n\nWhen i play support I want to roam and not be expected to stay bot lane for the first 10 to 20 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Masala Chai","date":"2018-04-25T02:37:21.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And lose all EXP?
