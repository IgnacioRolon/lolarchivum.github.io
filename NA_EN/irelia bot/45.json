Just like Facebook, or any other long running service, Rito needs to constantly change Lol to keep it fresh or it will fall off into obscurity. They DO make intentional changes to the META, just to make sure that different champion, builds, strategies and items come and go, so as to not let the game play grow stale.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-24T20:45:07.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Making changes to the game =/= making changes to the meta to make a new meta.

Do you really think they have NO understanding of their game whatsoever? Do you think it is a coincidence that all their changes in the last few years just so happened to lead to shorter and shorter games? A good example of an actual unintended meta shift was when, few patches ago, they buffed baron and it was actually slightly DIFFICULT to take without a whole team. But they fixed that little mistake in the very next patch didn't they?","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-25T05:14:19.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change the meta? Yes. They do, but not directly. It happens when something prevalent is strong, they nerf it, and then something else takes over.

No. That came out of left field. \n\nThe playerbase is largely responsible for the actual meta, because they innovate and figure out what can become viable.

Teleport has never been broken because it has always had a long CD before the 1 min nerf it was at 5 minutes and for top laners it presented a risk to use as a ganking tool. Sure you can use it as a ganking tool but when you do you give up lane pressure and if nothing comes of you using teleport to gank then you would probably start losing gold and maybe even your tower because top laners have to back and try walk and to their tower in an already long lane. The Teleport nerf did nothing but negatively affect top laners. It lessened the ability to save their tower by teleporting rather than trying to walk back to it in a long lane. It also lessened top laners influence on the map which is already low because top is the most isolated lane on the map.Bot lane hasn't changed at all from teleport the nerf but top lane has. So good luck asking top laners to Teleport gank now because we basically run ignite as the primary summoner now since the nerf made teleport even more risky to use.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-08-24T12:56:39.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Shhh shhh, don't try to use logical arguments against boards.
