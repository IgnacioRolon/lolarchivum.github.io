Tell me 1 thing from Old Karma that has survived? Don't say mantra because her current mantra is a watered down Heimer ult with a CD refund and don't even bother with the tether because it has an entirely different function and no longer works on allies. \n\nAs it stands, current Karma is nothing but a place holder. She doesn't exist. People talking about \"change is gonna happen in a online game\", it's mad because Riot has admitted to getting it wrong with Karma, GroovyLord said she didn't need the rework she got and Meddler said she's not sufficiently satisfying. I don't care about  your down votes, you think Karma is okay just because you don't care about her enough to know she's been fucking butchered thematically and gameplay wise. It's not an opinion. It's the reality, she's a mistake that needs to be rectified. We know it, Riot knows it, it is what it is.\n\nPeople are really in here talking about LCS like LCS isn't the reason she has nerfs on pbe in the 1st place... she was only in LCS because Riot broke her RE shield, and when that's nerfed she's going right back to where to she was before.\n\nI hope that I made sense, I'm a bit drunk tbh this took so much concentration.

Karma goes from having, probably too much power early game, to having no damage late game. She is boring to play as because she has damage early game and late game is nothing more than a shield bot. You click one button the entire game . . . . and that is all Karma is. She is a shield bot with no mechanics, she is a champion with no clear identity, she is a champion that does too much and not enough of one thing.\n\nKarma should have been worked primarily in a lane position, but have options to be played as a support . . . . like Morgana.I find Morgana, despite having an outdated kit, to be a successful champion that is a very successful laner . . . but can be played as a support. That is what champions like Karma should be balanced around. Riot should not be balancing and working Karma around an overpowered shield buff that doesn't even fit what Karma is supposed to be in the first place. Originally Karma was supposed to be a battlemage. Now she is a tank, artillery mage, poke mage, disruptor, tank, support, battlemage, and so on. Riot ruined her. Look at Old Karma plz . . . . and see what old Karma fans are saying. Is new Karma better? Yes. Did Riot remove things from her kit that should have kept her role as a battlemage? Yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2016-12-24T07:07:35.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ScissorsNstuff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YfK37FBE,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-12-24T07:01:30.603+0000)\n>\n> what part of her identity was lost then\n\nno one even really cares anymore, op just wants to ham it up for attention.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2016-12-24T19:38:16.821+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Karma is supposed to be a battlemage with abilities that can be used with or on allies. She is not supposed to be a straight up support champion. Her kit is very boring and bland to play with and against. I can go on about the list of things old Karma is supposed to be and what Riot turned her into. New players who never played old Karma do not care. Players that think Karma getting a decent amount of time in the LCS is proof that she is an amazing champion, don't care. Players that have their favorite champions and don't think she should be worked on at all over other champions, don't care.\n\nI do not have a problem with opinions. I have a problem with new players dogging and insulting other people's opinions in favor of theirs. We, as the League of Legends Community, should not come into a thread and insult someone for having an opinion about Karma. We understand that champions like Azir, Kalista, Kindred, and many others . . . . are suffering if not more than her right now. That doesn't make your opinions about it trump mine and give you a reason to insult someone. Instead of insulting and be condescending, why don't we all encourage each other and offer suggestions on ways to improve a said champion.\n\nLet's have a mature and intelligent conversation about any champions in this thread, other than a one sentence response saying: \"Azir is better than Karma so he should be worked on before her.\" Why do you think that and what problems do you think Karma and Azir have? Don't dawg someone else for having a favorite champion that was ruined . . . . . because in the end we are all fighting the same battle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2016-12-24T09:36:58.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny way to say malz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-12-24T06:48:53.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Really?
