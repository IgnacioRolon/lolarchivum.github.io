I'd gladly wait 10-20 minutes for my best role instead of getting placed into something I'd prefer not to do. Can I do everything? Yeah.

Maybe its not as big of a problem at higher elo though.\nI am trying to main adc and about 40% of the supports I have gotten have been very bad or worse.\nI just had a bard that didn't ult once in 20 mins, but then ulted the enemy carry when he was about to die; which saved him.\n\nRiot needs to address the issues with support, so more ppl want to play it, not force adcs to be stuck with people who cannot support at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-01-06T04:12:07.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want an option to allow us to opt out of Auto fill. I understand that it could be useful for higher elo, or for the people who don't mind auto fill but I'm in Silver elo and my wait times aren't all that bad so I don't know why I have to deal with it. \n\nAverage time I get Auto filled: Like 2-3 Mins\nAverage time I get when Autofill is disabled or I'm \"Auto-Fill protected\": About 4-5 mins\n\nWow thanks Riot, Auto fill saved me 1-2 mins of que time but it puts me in a role I didn't want to do so I can't practice champions I wanted to play since they can't play that role. Oh and then some one dodges because they also got auto filled, so I still end up wasting that 1-2+ mins in que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-06T03:38:18.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember a time when autofill did not exist, but queue times would be exactly the same or shorter.\nIt was before riot messed up matchmaking utterly. Autofill is a bandaid fix because they seem to be unable to make functional matchmaking algorithms.\n\nLook at the stories of two people in a premade being autofilled into eachother's chosen roles, or other illogical nonsense. The system is obviously not good at finding the best combinations of players.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2017-01-06T03:40:52.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, problem came from making people only chose 2 roles.
