His ultimate's restriction is on himself.\n\nYes, the CC exists in multiple champions' kits, although on less than half of the champions in the game. But while the majority of ultimates have no restriction, or specifically work better if used at a specific time, Yasuo's ultimate can *only* be done within 0.5-1 second frames of a specific set of crowd control effects.\n\nDodge the CC, Yasuo can't ult. There are so very few champions with *targeted* Airborne CC that this solution will work in the majority of real game situations. And in other situations? Don't put yourself out as a target for Yasuo, unless you're the tank and you're baiting him.
