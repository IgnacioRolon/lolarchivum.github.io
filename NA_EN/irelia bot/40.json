Sorry to say this but you aren't solving anything except making supports and ADC be 5+ lvls  behind everyone in the game. You r2v1 scenario would literally not change whatsoever because the jungler can just go farm in the jungle for a bit and be there when pushing the wave and going to either kill you or force you out of lane.

Is that it?\n\nIt makes there not be enough of a down side being the 1 who is against 2. Be it the solo against a duo who has one wave of a level 6 advantage against level 5 or the jungle who just keeps ganking over and over be it successful in killing you or not. There should be a more severe trade off for a camping or duoing.|\n\nTHis also falls into line with the idea that junglers don't focus on clearing camp much because staying around a lane is comparably rewarding.\n\nIt isn't like this is not going to work. Other MOBA don't have it. The increased EXP when near higher level allies for support items is more to keep \"supports\" more relevant after such a change but only works around a higher level ally making it not a good option for solo laners. If you are going to gank then gank but camping should be more detrimental to said lane and jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Disco Swiss","date":"2020-01-04T14:08:44.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i get you.

So it will likely increase the effectiveness of split pushing and champs like Trynda who excel at it and basically nothing else might finally get reworked to address their situation.\n\nEXP would not be given for last hits.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
