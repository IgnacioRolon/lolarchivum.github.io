No I do not want other people up to her level because it is super toxic and bad for the game. I don't want League of Bruisers.

Where an adc can crit me for 1k even with all that armor and kill me in seconds.  I want a game where carries can only kill me if they are ahead.  Bruisers should be the counter to carries because of the damage they can do while building defense.

I am simply not biased. I rarely have a difficult time dealing with adcs as a bruiser or tank unless they got so far ahead.

She is also far more reliable in killing carries than other bruisers thanks to her passive making it difficult to keep her off the carry along with a low cool down gap closer and high move speed.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-09T05:05:59.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's resistant to it.
