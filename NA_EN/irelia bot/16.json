She was not getting fired over it when the shop foreman told her she was being written up since being told many times to stop being on her phone so much had clearly not worked. She started bitching about others using their phones primarily one other employee and while he and I do sometimes check things we are not sitting in the corner for extended periods of time talking to people on a blue tooth head set about things that are not work related or of major importance such as family emergencies. She stormed out of the the foreman&#039;s office calling everyone %%%%%%%%%%s since we were not getting in trouble for the same thing. She moved her tools to the front of the shop and left shortly after since the shop foreman told her if she is going to act like that she needs to go home.\r\n\r\nThis morning I guess she had contacted the manager of the Mechanics who is at a different location. She blatantly lied and said she got fired when she quit  after being written up and I know that the shop foreman at my location who has been with the company for 25+ years is trusted by the owner so any kind of settlement is unlikely. She did however bring up conspiring and sexual harassment and might be pressing charges but I don&#039;t know all the details on this since I am usually told on a need to know basis.\r\n\r\nIf she is pressing charges I am likely going to have to go to court at some point and potentially testify. I know based on the information I have that nothign would suggest in the slightest that she is telling the truth. She was looking for a way out and wants to get as much as she can on her way out.","replies":[]}
