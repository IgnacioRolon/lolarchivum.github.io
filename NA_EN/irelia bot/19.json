Zz,Rot Portal and Wit&#039;s end. Lets be honest, When was the last time you saw any of these three items being bought in game?\n\nNone of these items have ever been viewed as worth getting outside outside of Wit&#039;s end on WW or Shen and in season 1/2 where it offered a good early to mid game power spike at the expense of slot efficiency compared to other options.\n\nThis is just a suggestion given some of the season 6 changes but it would provide some currently lacking reasoning to get these items.\n\nSo what if they offered something actually wanted? Something that has been in the game for a while but limited to a grand total of like 5 items. Something that got nerfed this season on the main item people got with it and the other item with it removed?\n\nSo what if instead of reverting the nerfs to Merc treads which would in turn force people to often get them even against a mostly AD team a different item was given 20% Tenacity. What if Raptors Cloak was given 20% Tenacity? IT would be calculated like it has always been, multiplicative. Getting stun locked is extremely easy to have happen currently so why not make a couple items that are basically forgotten about  have something that would make players consider them?\n\nRejuv. Bead (150) + Cloth Armor (300)+ Cloth Armor (300) + 450= Raptors Cloak (1200)\n35 Armor\n100% base health regen\nUnique Passive - Point Runner: Build up to +20% movement speed when near turrets or fallen turrets.\n\nOhmwreaker and Zz&#039;Rot&#039;s have their cost increased by 100 but keep the same stats while gaining the 20% tenacity. This would make them a more tempting option for fighters and tanks.\n\nWhy am I not mentioning Wit&#039;s end so far in this? Because it needs something different done to it  so it is worth getting again.\n\nRecurve Bow + Null-magic Mantel + 650 Gold = Wit&#039;s end 2100\n30% attack speed\n26 MR\nUnique Passive: 42 on hit magic damage (if 42 is too much it will make me sad since#UniversalAnswer but 35ish on hit magic damage to make it an item worth getting again would be acceptable.)\nUnique passive: auto attacking gives the owner 4 MR for 5 seconds stacks up to 4 times(max of 16 MR from this passive)\n\nLets be honest, Wit&#039;s has not been a popular item for any champ besides WW and perhaps Udyr since season 2 when it had a reason to be rushed against AP champs. Sure a few other champs can use it currently but in reality Teemo, Kayle and the few others who can use it well would rather get other items nearly every game.\n\nHow does wit&#039;s fit into this who reaso nt obe bought?\n\nWit&#039;s end + Raptors Cloak (1200) + 300 = Madred&#039;s Bloodrazors (if a different name is required for some reason that is not an issue.)\n40% attack speed\n40 Armor\n40 MR\nUnique Passive: 50 on hit Magic damage\nUnique Passive - Point Runner: Build up to +20% movement speed when near turrets or fallen turrets.\nUnique passive: auto attacking gives the owner 5 armor and MR for 5 seconds stacks up to 5 times.\n \n\nJust a concept but I could see Tenacity on Raptors cloak being really helpful for making some items more worth considering.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-20T10:14:36.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohm got nerfed this patch. \n\n\nTurrets don't do damage and die instantly already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rG Thundrag","date":"2015-11-20T10:03:54.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you mean with Zz'Rot Portal being forgotten, theres an entire high elo cult following for Zz'rot Portal on Garen and Shen heralding as being overpowered in soloque cause of how chaotic it operates.
