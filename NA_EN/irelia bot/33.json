Attack speed items are garbage on him cause of his passive, so while he can _theoretically_ benefit from a wide variety of items, he doesn't get the full benefit from either cast.\n\nWhile as a character Graves does make sense as a bruiser, this niche would've been better suited to Quinn.  She was already commonly played as such prior and she even swapped out for Valor, a melee champ which benefited greatly from melee items like Hydra and were even built on her because of this.  Rather than embracing her identity, you chose to destroy it, removed Valor's significance and forced her into a design and playstyle that's even less healthy and logical than where she was already at.  Pretty much anybody that sees a bird carrying around a human and somehow miraculously gaining MS, rather than losing it like the laws of physics would imply, will tell you how visually and thematically ridiculous the abomination is.\n\nAs for Graves' ammo system, while it's mechanically sound, visually and thematically it doesn't make sense.  Graves has a custom shotgun that just at a quick glance you can see has probably around 8 or 10 chambers to load cartridge shells.  So why then is it that he can only fire twice or thrice with E and then is forced to reload?  He's a shrewd man, he's not dumb enough to be walking around with only two shells in the chamber when it can hold several times as many.  Is it then that he suffers from a severe psychotic form of OCD?  He can't perform if his gun isn't fully loaded and his psychosis takes over if more than 1 ammo is expended?\n\nWhat then of other characters with ammo-oriented weapons, will we be seeing them being eventually forced into the same ammo system already implemented with Graves and Jhin?  Will Trist reload after every shot?  Cait?  Jinx?  Quinn and Vayne?  What of MF?  Will her pistols randomly jam like they did during the Hallowing and she pulls out a sword to become a melee champ?  How about Sivir?  Will she have to wait for her blade to return after every single time after throwing it?  Or Draven?  Many of us remember when he lost both axes during 'A New Dawn.'

Lets say jungle has a 55% winrate, mid has a 45% winrate, and support has a 48% winrate. Lets also say jungle/mid puts me mid 50% of the time.\n\n20 games as jungle/mid exclusively:\njungle x 10 at 55% plus mid x 10 at 45% = 50% winrate overall\n\nNow lets alternate and do jungle/support every other game:\nGames as support at 48% = 10\nGames as jungle at 55% = 5\nGames as mid at 45% = 5\n\n((5\\*45)+(5\\*55)+(10\\*48))/20 = 49% winrate overall\n\nThat's too many support games though, so let's do jungle/support every third game, and lets play 21 games this time just so the numbers work out:\n\n7 games in each role = ((48\\*7)+(55\\*7)+(45\\*7))/21 = 49.3% winrate overall\n\nSo even if I'm really shit at mid, my winrate is still going to be stronger by going jungle/mid. I would have to break a 50% winrate on support for it to be better for me to go jungle/support, but the problem with that is 3 things:\n\n1) If I did that, I'd basically have to become a support main in order to maintain a high winrate/ELO, because at that point playing jungle/mid would hurt my ELO even though jungle is my best role.\n\n2) It would be easier for me to break 50% on mid by just going jungle/mid and getting better at mid.\n\n3) Support is boring as fuck and I don't want to main it.\n\nAlso, lets do that same test again, but lets pretend dynamic queue worked properly and gave me support 50% of the time when I queued as jungle/support:\n\n(55+48)/2 = 51.5% winrate overall.\n\nDo you see the problem now? If I could actually put my 2nd best role as secondary and not get it 100% of the time, my winrate would go up. But if the system is intent on giving it to me 100% of the time when I pick it, I can't pick it at all without hurting my winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"DELI MEATS","date":"2016-03-22T19:28:58.117+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point wasn't to literally play support every other game.
