When I start loading onto the rift, the game crashes and says \"League of Legends (TM) Client has stopped working\"  it then says to reconnect and this just puts me in a loop. I just uninstalled and reinstalled the client and it didn't fix the problem, any help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2016-06-11T02:46:31.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI recommend closing out as many 3rd party applications as possible. Stuff like Curse, LoL Recorder and even some antiviruses can cause the client to become unstable, so running anything similar in the background can cause the client to go herp derp. Anyways, the method is called \"msconfig\" and this guide is pretty user friendly in how to close out background applications.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684#wq3","replies":[]}]}
