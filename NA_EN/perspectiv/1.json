She&#039;s a new player (just level 22) but she&#039;s improving a lot in terms of last hitting and learning champ skills.  Not so loud BG music which is nice. She has around 30-50 viewers each time she streams also.\n\nShe has a super cute personality, cute look, and is entertaining to watch IMO. \n\nWhat I&#039;m wondering is what do you guys look for when your watching streams? \n\nHigh elo? Specific champs? Specific music / commentary? Are there differences between guy / girl streams that you like?\n\nAny info would be appreciated thanks.\n\nedit 1: so far I'm seeing that people just want to watch Pro streams or high elo...but there must be reasons why many other non-pro, non-high elo streamers are also getting viewers...\n\nedit 2: also having a unique online personality who is up-to-date on the current topics of league and who can be entertaining in commentary seems to be attractive.\n\nThanks for replies guys it's definitely some food for thought for her.
