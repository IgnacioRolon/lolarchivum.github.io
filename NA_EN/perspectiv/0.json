Morg works well because people at low elo don't bother trying to dodge skillshots, so it makes her very simple: Press Q, W, auto... win? It's kind of like Garen and how just presses Q -> E, except he doesn't even have to aim. While I definitely consider Garen to be a \"brainless\" champ, Morgana is among the easier ones (not entirely brainless, though).\n\nWhat really sets good Morg players apart from great ones is their use of E and R. When used at the right time--and without feeding--she can feel really hard to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"perspectiv","date":"2017-03-17T16:45:06.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with mostly all that you said and if you're good enough any champ can get you to gold.

Nice. Question, what do you typically do? I literately just tried this this morning (before seeing this. Weird. o.0), and I was running a more DoT build (DFT, {{item:3151}}, {{item:3116}}, etc), but you appear to be going a more traditional TLD mage route with {{item:3165}} as a first item. Have you experimented with DFT Morg at all? Do you have any comments on it?\n\nOverall, nice video!

Also reducing her summoner cool downs with {{item:3158}}  is a plus since she's often going to engage fights. \n\nI play a \"support\" mid morg trying to push waves and land lots of binds for harassing/picking off people. {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} These items are definitely nice when I can afford to build them. In long games or if the enemy team is pretty tanky you really need {{item:3151}}  to do any damage.\n\nedit: And I haven't really tried DFT with her actually. The TL proc from W is pretty nice.

Midlane and support i preferred to use {{item:3117}}  because it helps land Qs when you come speeding up. Either role you do not have to build a ton of damage to be relevant. \nShe has a buttload of utility and can farm waves very safely with W and the spell vamp in her passive helps heal you for sustain. my favorite morg build was something like:\n{{item:3117}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3157}}  {{item:3107}} {{item:3512}} \nBut I think her core is Liandry's,Morellos,and zhonyas right now. Being just stocky enough to land and survive a teamfight where you can use your ult to its potential is game changing.\nI do agree morg is a solid pick in low elo's because if you play her patiently and farm safely you will usually press an opponent into making a bad decision. Baiting them just under turret range and landing a q+ult+w will usually kill anyone and if youre being dove you can ult any number of people and hit zhinyas","replies":[{"poster":"perspectiv","date":"2017-03-17T18:19:50.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I havne't tried a build like that yet.

It gives you _certain_ bonus damage on her W, instead of having to either land a Q first, or hoping that the enemy's just too dumb to walk out of it. i actually basically ran the same masteries I have for Satan, but I use vampirism and sorcery, instead of the other two.\n\nI got a tip of maxing W first, and rushing {{item:3027}} to make up for the absurd mana costs (130/use at rank 5. ;w;) (mana regen quints helped a bit, too. :P). I then got {{item:3020}} for more mpen, _then_ {{item:3151}}. Even more tank-melting. :D\n\nBy this point, the enemy {{champion:238}}  couldn't even touch me, he was too scared. XD\n\nI led that into {{item:3116}} so that I could melt entire waves with one W. The slow on it made it even more cruel. :D\n\nBy _this_ point, I had more health than both our {{champion:80}} and {{champion:412}}. It was a _bit_ absurd, having over 3k health. :P\n\n{{item:3165}} was next, mostly for grievous wounds, and I was planning to finish with {{item:3089}}, but the enemy {{champion:420}}  was just too strong. ;w;\nIronically, our {{champion:103}} (toplane) _had_ won laning phase.
