I am an Ahri main who plays her because of her playstyle and not because of her tits! Although her Fox ears help I guess....\n\nBut anyway, now that we got that whole \"perverted weaboo Ahri player\" stereotype that  you guys are most likely going to use as ad hominem, let&#039;s break down the arguments I have seen against Ahri:\n\n- SHE CAN SPAM HER Q AND GET MS BOOSTS FOR DAAAAYYZZ!!! : ... She cannot spam Q without going out of mana, even with a morelonomicon.\n\n- SHE HAS SUSTAIN ALONG WITH MOBILITY OMFG!!!! : Her sustain requires her to spam her high manacost abilities over and over again in order to function. Basically, Ahri mana hungry AF.\n\n- SHE CAN 100-0 ANYONE AT ANY TIME OMFG!!!! : No she cannot 100-0 you at any point of the game other than Mid Game. Early game she has to poke you down with her easy to dodge Q first. Even when she lands charm her full combo can&#039;t kill you from full health during early game. Ahri&#039;s full combo is very short ranged. During the late game if the ADC dodges her charm or she get&#039;s CC&#039;d while performing her slow combo she will die INSTANTLY. And at this point Ahri&#039;s damage falls off because people start building defensively and she can only 100-0 low mr targets since her dmg is mediocre compared to other conventional mages and AP assassins. At the same time she doesn&#039;t have that much AOE. Other safe mages capable of kiting such a Vel&#039;koz and Ziggs have INSANELY powerful AOE ultimates. Ahri is mostly singe target damage.\n\n- HER PICKRATE AND WINRATE ARE HIGH!!! : Woooow a safe fairly easy to play champion that capitalizes on people&#039;s mistakes has a high winrate and pickrate in solo que. How surprising.\n\n- HERE RANGE IS HUGE YET SHE&#039;S SO SAFE!!! PLEASE FUCK ME SIDEWAYS!! : Ahri is actually low range. Her main poking tool (Orb of deception, I bet you Ahri QQers don&#039;t even know what the abilitiy is called) is medium ranged and fairly easy to dodge. Her foxfire and spirit rush are auto attack range. By the way most mages can&#039;t go in autoattack range because they get blown up easily. Ahri goes into autoattack range in hopes of dealing damage and praying that the enemy is incompetent enough to allow her to kite around the teamfight and pick off targets. If you just stay back and use Q then you don&#039;t know how to play Ahri. Her only long range ability is charm which is a single target CC in the form of a slow, linear, low damage, high manacost, high cooldown skillshot.\n\n- I HATE PLAYING AGAINST AHRI AND I HATE WEABOO AHRI PLAYERS!!!! : Good for you.\n\n- SHE&#039;S MORE MOBILE THAN A ROAD RUNNER!!! : {{champion:84}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:7}} . Also she pays for this mobility. As a mage, Ahri is similar to the likes of Vel&#039;koz, Xerath, and Brand. She is a kiting mage. Her advantage over other kiting mages is her mobility and sustain. However, in exchange for this mobility and sustain she has less range, less damage, and MUCH less AOE. \n\n- SHE LANDS HER CHARM AND YOU DIE!! : Err... Like every mage with their crowd control? Try stepping into {{champion:161}} &#039;s E and see how fast you get melted. Also, unlike vel&#039;koz and brand she can&#039;t even kill you early game post 6 by just landing her charm and combo-ing you. She has to poke you down first. Even in the mid game she usually needs ignite to finish someone off after charm-combo&#039;ing them.\n\n\nThese are my thoughts on the anti Ahri arguments. However, if you want her to get Nerfed really badly, I suggest reducing her charm range to be about the same as her Q. This will make it easier for you to outplay her charm I guess. I don&#039;t even care anyway, Ahri is usually in reach to get melted in a teamfight most of the time. This will nerf her without making her damage even more mediocre. I guess it will make her harder to play too.\n\nTL;DR: MOST OF YOUT AHRI ARGUMENTS ARE DUMB BUT IF YOU WANT HER NERFED NERF HER CHARM RANGE.\n\nEDIT: Ok calm down fox haters Ahri's sustain is getting nerfed and LEBLANC is getting buffed. Are you happy now?","replies":[{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2015-08-07T17:11:32.167+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":8,"body":"Most arguments that people have about nerfing someone is dumb.

It might be that she is too safe of a champion, but she does have a lot in her kit, but doesn't compensate with ample points of weakness in her kit.

At the same time she has lower effective range than both of those champions. She's basically a less punishing but less effective version of those other champions. If you have a good team that knows how to protect the squishies, it's MUCH better to have a Vel'koz/Brand/Xerath/Lux/etc. than an Ahri. In solo que however, it is better to have Ahri. Ahri is actually one of the best solo que champions in the game which is why her win rate and popularity are both high.

The one Bjergsen used to beat **CLG** in their first encounter of the year. After that she was heavily brought down. She's not even a Tier 1 pick in professional play.

I can't kill her! What do I do?!\"\n\nLock in Annie, get to level six, charge her passive then flash tibbers stun her.  It takes NO effort.  Annie does not give two shits about Ahri's mobility when she cannot even make use of it while she is stunned and getting bursted down.   \n\nThere are other solid options that do well against her.  Diana, Fizz, Talon, Malzahar, Swain.\n\nPeople are so fucking blindsided and intimidated by a stupid movement speed buff.  The 20% damage amplification on her charm was traded for that which resulted in a heavy power loss.  Everything else is the same except for the reduction in range acquisition for foxfire and spirit rush. \n\nYou cannot just simply remove the MS on her Orb Of Deception without giving something back in return.  Otherwise that will COMPLETELY destroy her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-08-08T01:00:11.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"All you are doing is listing Ahri's weaknesses.  The problem is that literally every single weakness you mentioned applies to pretty much every single other midlaner...except she doesn't suffer from them nearly as much.\n\nGet stunned by Xerath?  Get chunked for 1/2 hp.\n\nGet charmed by Ahri?  Death.\n\nTry to gank Xerath?  He can sit far back, but he dies easily even inside his tower?\n\nTry to gank Ahri?\n\n_Lol._\n\nListing a champion's weaknesses doesn't negate how much they need nerfs.  What you're doing is the same as someone saying that Preseason 5 warwick didn't need nerfs, and then proceeding to list all of his weaknesses.  \"He's immobile!  He's melee!  He can't gank pre-6!\"  Etc. etc.\n\nThe problem is, his strengths WAY, WAY, WAY OUTSHINED those weaknesses at the time.\n\nAhri is in literally the same situation.\n\nShe is the most popular midlaner in the game.\nAnd the highest winrate CHAMPION in the entire game.\n\nAnd she has a 52%+ winrate for players playing their first 5 games with her.  So no, it isn't due to Ahri players being overly \"skilled\" on average.\nTo further compound that, she's rank 21 or so out of about 48 midlaners in terms of average games played.\n\nGet it?  She is almost _perfectly average_ in terms of the amount of experience players have with her.\n\nExcept even people who have never played her before pick her up and win most of their games.\n\nHow can you seriously keep denying there's a problem by listing her weaknesses?  They clearly aren't meaningful enough.\nAgain, you're doing the same thing as, in preseason 5, listing Warwick's weaknesses.  Or at the release of Cinderhulk, listing Sejuani's weaknesses.  Or at the release of Xin Zhao, listing his weaknesses.\n\nI'll say this again.\n**Listing a champion's weaknesses MEANS NOTHING.**  What matters is how relevant those weaknesses are compared to\n1) that champions' strengths, and\n2) the weaknesses of other champions in their role.\n\nAhri's weaknesses \"having to land skillshots, being squishy\" don't affect her nearly as much as they affect champions like - for example - Xerath, or Orianna.\nAnd they don't mean much when coupled with Ahri's core strength of being nearly unkillable.\nQ speed + Zhonya's + Flash + Ult dash + Ult dash + Ult dash.\n\nCan we please stop this whole, \"hey guys, another Ahri main here, I think she's balanced because she has the same weaknesses as every other midlaner!\" trend going on?\nI appreciate the politeness of it, but the arguments don't make any difference.
