No promises though. I only made this thread to get the word out on the skin and about a player from a community I have no idea about because far as I know of I didn't see anyone do the same here on the boards and after reading what I did learn of her I felt bad I didn't get to know her as she sounded like a great person. I'm not begging for a skin. I'm asking for a skin. All I did was create a thread to get the word out. Regardless what you think its a great skin concept. I will not be editing my post. I never knew the person which was further explained in the comment section of this thread. Since you know her personally then create a better thread as you would be more knowledgeable on the issue you apparently have instead of calling me out for \"begging for a skin\". If the skin doesn't get made oh well. It won't be the 1st time or the last time a skin with a great concept or meaning behind won't get made.","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2015-12-05T23:46:29.613+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Should probably apologise, it was Super early in the morning, I was tired and not in the best of moods when I wrote it.\n\nI'm Sorry, I was not intending to imply you were simply begging for a skin or the likes, and I know you understand the full meaning behind the skin concept, even if you didn't know her yourself.

Riot is a busniess. Riot doesn't have to make the skin or put a reference to anyone in the skin like Jaximus quote. But it's nice of them to do so. Riot isn't the bad guy and isn't obligated in anyway to hand out anything free or do anything for players or its community. The fact Riot does do things for us such as Dravens legendary skin being discounted for a huge price for ever is huge.

Going back to at least 2013 or as far as it being mentioned even as earlier as 2012 when Nurse Akali was being questioned. If you google even harder you will notice that it was even asked for 2011. Nurse Soraka even had cos-players dressing as one. Having a quote like Jaximus would be great. Riot could even make a thread or a news report regarding the Situation and Sora who was a Soraka main from what I have gathered.\n\nThe Image I happened to use of course was for a get well card.
