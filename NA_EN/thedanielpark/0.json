Is this a bug or intended cause i really like highnoon gun shot sound. As an avid Yasuo main I feel so off when i play with the highnoon skin and now i have to play with the classic or project just because of the sound.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T20:18:22.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya thedanielpark  -\n\nThanks for reporting this.

If you don't have an answer that's fine, but the least you or the others owe us is your acknowledgement. In my post I stated that according to another person in another thread that this has been an issue that was addressed a week before this patch came out while on the PBE. At least let us know that you're working to solve the issue. It seems that when I go through the threads the _only_ responses we see are for the Lunar Revel shop or something skin related. That isn't even fair to the rest of us players who are trying desperately to get an answer. We finally found a really poor temporary solution for the time being but that isn't enough.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T22:53:36.245+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! While \n\nI can't speak for others, I personally haven't responded to those threads because it's out of the realm of my expertise and I'm not sure what the status of that issue is. \n\nIn the case of me responding to other posts today, keep in mind that it's Saturday, so a lot of Rioters are spending time with friends/family. I just happen to have some free time, so I'm hanging out on the boards for a bit.\n\nThat said, I'd be happy to pass this on to the proper team to ensure it's on their radar.  :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheYasuoMain","date":"2016-02-01T11:35:44.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think this will be fixed next patch? I really love this sound when playing High Noon Yasuo and its what made me buy the skin. Right now I am using Project Yasuo becuase I can't simply deal with the classic Q sound. If it isn't fixed next patch can you give a suggested time frame.
