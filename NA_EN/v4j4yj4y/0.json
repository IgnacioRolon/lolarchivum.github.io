If you had the \"Great Teammate\" crest but you were honoured more for \"Honourable Opponent\" or \"Friendly\" then you'd lose the \"Great Teammate\" crest but you'll be awarded with another one should you receive enough of the required Honour points.","replies":[{"poster":"v4j4yj4y","date":"2016-07-04T20:16:43.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the green one, I thought that was a multi? either way, I don't have one at all :(. oh well.

For example, Teamwork honours would carry a heavier weight in the \"Great Teammate\" creast than Helpful honours.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-07T23:27:27.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rineyy provided some solid information here!
