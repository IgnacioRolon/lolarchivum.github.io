The error message pops up when I log in at the home screen and when you press on the hextech box icon next to your summoner profile. This is really annoying and I literally can't do anything without my chat service. Anyone know what to do at this point because I don't. I looked at other discussions but its either someone just has an unknown error or is disconnected to chat not both like my problem.
