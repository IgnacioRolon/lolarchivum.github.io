Big whoop.  Outside of your team having a sufficiently long enough knockback (incredibly uncommon by the way) she&#039;s got no weaknesses at all.\n\nYou can't really abuse her well in lane because built in sustain... for some reason.\n\nRanged can't abuse her because she'll gapclose you and burst you.\n\nYou can't play anything remotely squishy against her because she'll call literally anyone up and stop you from moving while you just take it.\n\nYou can't play melees against her because she'll just walk up and win every trade with Q.\n\nYou can't kite her because she gets free MS plus her gapclose stun might as well not have a CD.\n\nAnd even if you do get around all that she gets a free shield for hitting you, how exciting.\n\nThis is probably the least thought out release since aatrox.","replies":[]}
