Why did you promise a solo queue when you know we're never going to do that?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":41,"down_votes":7,"body":"Lyte: Hmm?\r\n\r\nPhreak: Well, we all know dynamic queue is the future of League and that we don&#039;t care about those peasants. So why did you tell the solo players that we would make a special queue for them?\r\n\r\nLyte: Because I have a PhD in psychology, bitch.\r\n\r\nPhreak: I don&#039;t get it.\r\n\r\nLyte: That&#039;s because you don&#039;t think, Phreak. What are they going to do, quit?\r\n\r\nPhreak: Well, no, but -\r\n\r\nLyte: Exactly. They&#039;re not going to quit, they&#039;re not going to take a break from the game while they wait for solo queue. They&#039;re going to bitch about it now and then, but they&#039;ll keep playing.\r\n\r\nPhreak: But then -\r\n\r\nLyte: Exactly. In a couple of months we make an announcement &quot;Awww, so sorry LoL players, no Solo Queue, better luck next time. We tried so hard but we just couldn&#039;t do it!&quot;.\r\n\r\nPhreak: Won&#039;t they flip all the tables?\r\n\r\nLyte: No, because by then they&#039;ll be so used to Dynamic Queue that they&#039;ll barely remember what they were complaining about. When you boil a frog, you turn the heat up slowly, and it never jumps out of the pot.\r\n\r\nPhreak: Why would you boil a frog?\r\n\r\nLyte: Because I like to watch small things die, Phreak.\r\n\r\nPhreak: Wow, you&#039;re really messed up.\r\n\r\nLyte: Yes I am, Phreak. Yes I am.","replies":[]}
