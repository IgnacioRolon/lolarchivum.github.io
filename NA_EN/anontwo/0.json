However the current boards *do not allow you to open other thread pages in another page*, rather the page number navigation doesn't allow you to interact.\r\n\r\nIt becomes difficult to make a post that takes everything into account if it's difficult to go back and read pages that i can't see at the time that i'm posting. If the post was at least separated from page navigation, then i could go back to page 1 or 2 or 3 without losing my post.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this could apply to the other boards as well, but in particular this is a request for GD.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-10-02T23:43:47.189+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for bringing this up.
