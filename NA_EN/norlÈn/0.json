This means that each fragment that drops reduces the changes for the next one to drop exponentially.

Somehow my brain decided to throw S-Grades in there, likely because I personally see them more when I hit S-grades in ARAMs, but that's just personal experience. Playing with friends will actually *slightly increase* your key fragment drop chance.\n\nThanks for pointing out my mistake, I appreciate knowing when I'm incorrect!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
