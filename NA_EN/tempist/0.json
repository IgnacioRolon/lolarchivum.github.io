My teammates weren't so good at placing wards, especially the support. He had placed 10 less wards than I did (24) at the end of the match. End game vision statistics say we were down 14 wards, and not only were we down wards, our wards were less effective because Sightstone wards are longer-lasting.\nThe map was so dark at points, especially at the end where I could no longer put out Control Wards.
