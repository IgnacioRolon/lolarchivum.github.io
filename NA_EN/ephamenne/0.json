I've had three matches with the miniboss ( short joke ) of the game; 1 success and two flops. In both of my losses I noticed my foes ( an Ahri and an A.D. Gangplank ) both were able to poke me down when I went for farm given my auto attacks and abilities were out-ranged by the opposition's abilities. I'd love for some tips & tricks in countering foes who have more range along with any generalized tips for Veigar/the middle lane you have. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nEphamenne.\r\n\r\nP.S: I'm also seeking tips/tricks for Evelynn/the jungle; please visit http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/5k462W43-tips-tricks-for-the-jungleevelynn if you think you can help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Volt Cruelerz","date":"2014-11-30T18:26:20.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rules of Playing Veigar\n\n1. Q is your life, your love, your passion, and your victory.  Farm with it like mad.\n\n2. Q->E->Q->W.  Those first four levels will have you probably pushed and poked hard by the enemy champion.  Just play safe.  They know they have to be aggressive early to compensate for what you can do later.  Once I hit level four, I usually go for a single \"get off my back\" E->W->Q->AA burst.  Against most mid champions, that'll knock out about a third to half their health provided they don't have boots yet.  After they know that you can poke just as hard as they can, they'll be more hesitant to go after you.  \n\n3. If you can force a farm lane as Veigar, you've won, because at level 7, you start getting into 80-0 burst territory where one burst can send them back to base or to the grave.  Around level 9, you're starting to get into 100-0 territory.  Once you can drop them from full health with impunity, they're done and you can then go roam or get a free turret.\n\n4. Get a second level in your E before a second level in your W, but max W before E after that.  The reason for this is that once they have boots, you need the extra duration to make sure your W lands.\n\n5. Every skill you have that is down drastically increases your chance of death.  Veigar is a glass cannon.  If your E and W are down, you had better be farming under turret or have so much AP that they're terrified of what your Q can do.\n\n6. Lategame, your Q and W are on par with Smite for objective control due to their very high damage.  As the dragon/baron gets low, try to time them correctly so that they knock out the last 1.5-2k health to prevent Smite steals.\n\nI typically build tear->sorc boots->fiendish codex->NLR->DFG->Blasting Wand/NLR->Deathcap->Seraph's (tear is typically charged by this point)->Zhonya's/Void Staff/Abyssal\n\nA few things change as needed on a per-game basis.  If I'm facing an AD mid, I'll rush Zhonya's for obvious reasons for instance.\n\nVeigar is very much a kill-or-be-killed style of champion.  If you can't kill them, run.  If you can, kill them, then run.","replies":[{"poster":"Ephamenne","date":"2014-11-30T18:46:51.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,\n\nI hate to be a pain, but can you space out your tips so your post is not one big paragraph?

(obv dont take too much)\n\n2 LEARN HOW TO AIM YOUR E AT ANY POSSIBLE POINT TO WHERE YOU IMMEDIATELY STUN SOMEONE. This sounds stupid obvious but it's literally the hardest thing with veigar, even harder than landing his W. Exceptions being against champs that are dash heavy like fizz and diana. Make them dash through your gate and W the point where they will dash through and end. Your wall will not stop a champion mid dash.\n\n3 Your Q gives every minion a +6 gold value i think it is, so the more Q farm you have, the more \"gold\" you've earned over your lane opponent. Basically, if you both have 50 farm at 10 minutes but 25 of it is on your Q, you have a gold advantage. I average 100 farm on my Q about 25-30 minutes in regardless if i do bad in lane or do well.\n\n4 You really should of carried the game to victory already before you break 1000 AP.\n\n5  {{item:3128}} Is overhyped on Veigar. Personally i think it's only for greedy Veigars. That being siad, it is ridiculously strong on him. Just don't be scared to rush a Rabadons for offense first instead is all I'm saying. Especially if you have free farm since 2:00.\n\n6 {{summoner:21}}  > {{summoner:7}}  Because Barriers effect is not reduced by {{summoner:14}} .

Doesn't matter how you kill them, you still get it. Killing with Q might give six or seven, I'm not sure.\n\nDFG may be over hyped, but it's still a great item for him.\n\nI disagree with your evaluation of ignite. If you can play safe enough the first few levels, having ignite drastically improves your kill potential, letting you instagib the enemy laner sooner. For a new Veigar though, I can understand the value of barrier.","replies":[{"poster":"Klax002saur","date":"2014-12-01T18:30:01.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO For verigar only, Ignite has pre-level 6 value. After that it's pretty much useless. Barrier is useful Early, Mid, and Late game however. That's why I advise not taking it. It does help that I generally have a jungle duo and if i don't i just convince the jungler to gank 24/7 once i hit 6, so I don't need ignite early on still.\n\nAlso thanks for the passive fix, haven't read his Q in so long.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jiujitsuPhD","date":"2014-12-01T12:46:09.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you have a team that can carry early game. Ive only played vieger a few times and I learned very quickly that if team fights start early (like level 6-8) and no one is really carrying/snowballing at that point that its going to be very hard for you to do it either. Especially as you are probably being pushed a bit early and didnt take a tower or get a kill in the first 6 levels unless your jungler set up a good gank for you. Other mid lane champs can carry from early game and scale well into late game too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-01T01:00:17.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! Veigar's a REALLY fun champion, even if he isn't as mobile and doesn't bring as much utility as other midlaners do. His damage potential is off the charts, and unless he's ENTIRELY shut down in lane and throughout the midgame you can't really stop him from becoming an absolute monster in the late game.\n\nFirst and foremost, learn your Q damages. If you cast your Q and either the minions get it before the Q connects, which happens more times than I care to think about, or your Q doesn't deal enough damage and a minion gets it, you just lost out on gold, mana, *and* that 1 AP bonus. Last hitting is absolutely essential for him, both with your AAs and your Qs, because you have no escapes and so pushing your lane is extremely dangerous for you.\n\nYour W gives enormous zoning potential, although it's a bit pricey to use mana-wise during the laning phase. It has a 100% AP ratio on top of the base damage, so it goes without saying it's going to hurt no matter what stage of the game you're in. Don't be afraid to use it to poke at an enemy champion or to clear a weakened row of caster minions after you've got enough AP to make it eat them alive. Enemies can see where it's going to fall before it does, which is usually enough to get them running, and if you learn how to lead it you can control where you want them to go and when. As you're running it's invaluable to get some damage on chasing enemies while you prepare to turn and reign down your unholy Yordle vengeance upon them.\n\nYour E is awesome. An AoE stun, and quite a long one at that, that while it starts off with a meh duration eventually last long enough for you to get your entire combo off on one poor soul while halting an entire team of enemies long enough for your team to come crashing down on them in fights? His other abilities hurt, but this is the ability that will make or break a good Veigar. Get good at setting it up to where an enemy will be standing on top of one of the walls when they rise; I play with everything smartcasted and can land this 9/10 times spot on.\n\nDo I even have to say anything about his ult? Hitting R with Veigar is like shouting \"FUCK THIS ONE GUY IN PARTICULAR\". Learn it. Love it. Build CDR to abuse it.\n\nDon't be discouraged if you have a bad laning phase. Most Veigars get a bit pushed back during the early levels, and any midlaner worth their salt knows you have to try and deny him farm. Deny them denying your farm with smart use of your W, get stupid good at last hitting, and wait for that magic level 6 to land an E W Ignite Q R kill and then taunt on their body for a little while. \n\nJust don't do it so long the jungler gets you.\n\nBut always keep in mind that no matter how janky your early game is, so long as you keep up on your farming when the roaming starts and land team stuns for your allies, you're still going to hit the lategame like a truck. \n\nA tiny, incredibly evil truck.\n\nHappy ulting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legostrike","date":"2014-11-30T17:54:32.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play passive. Farm is important but you need to be able to threaten your opposite back. his Q does do a bit of damage, enough to make them think twice about just bullying you. Once you have your E and W, use them. Yea, you'll blow mana but his passive helps. All that said, mana pots are a necessity on veigar, as his only option to say in lane is to use his high cost abilities to threaten the opposing laners with the power of evil.\n\nAlso note he is very, very anti-mage. taking him up against anything A.D, especially assassins like Zed, will get you killed.","replies":[]}]}
