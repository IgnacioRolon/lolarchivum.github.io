Then I'll explain my reasoning as to why I'm wondering if Ohmwrecker would be a good choice on Nunu and let you guys debate it.\n\n\"+300 Health\n+50 Armor\n+100% Base Health Regen (+round(1*stats[BaseHPRegenRate]*5) Health per 5 seconds)\n+10% Cooldown Reduction\n\nUNIQUE Active: Prevents nearby enemy turrets from attacking for 3 seconds (120 second cooldown). This effect cannot be used against the same turret more than once every 8 seconds.\n\nUNIQUE Passive - Point Runner: Builds up to +30% Movement Speed over 2 seconds while near turrets.\"\n\nI'm not sure when This item would be built ( most likely sometime after Spirit Visage/Sunfire Cape would be my best guess ) but I feel given the item gives HP, Armor, and Health Regen the item might be a good fit. Jungling Nunu is often built as an off-tank, so getting a boost in the HP and Armor departments just makes him more durable. I also noticed the passive +100% Base Health Regen (+round(1*stats[BaseHPRegenRate]*5) Health per 5 seconds) from the Ohmwrecker isn't unique so it would stack with the +100% Base Health Regen (+round(1*stats[BaseHPRegenRate]*5) Health per 5 seconds) on the Spirit Visage. \n\nIn addition to this I feel the active pairs well with Nunu's attack steroid, which allows him to buff himself and another player increasing Movement Speed by 8/9/10/11/12% and Attack Speed by 25/30/35/40/45% for 12 seconds. A two second period without a turret firing on Nunu's team could potentially allow them to dive and clean up the enemy team or take down a tower. If you add in said attack steroid on an ADC or Assassin champion such as Jinx or Master Yi  your team's damage per second could potentially spike as both Nunu and the person he's buffed would be putting out an additional X number of attacks per second.\n\nOf course, I realize the item would lose it's potency after taking down the three inhibitor turrets but the Ohmwrecker could then be replaced with a different item. I could see a Thornmail/Frozen heart or a Locket of the Iron Solari/Orb of Winter ( the Orb of Winter carries the same +100% Base Health Regen (+round(1*stats[BaseHPRegenRate]*5) Health per 5 seconds) passive that Spirit Visage and Ohmwrecker have ) being of use depending on if your team was going up against A.D. or A.P.  I'm sure other items could be used as well, but I'm not going to drift away from the topic of the Ohmwrecker. It seems like it would be a solid mid-game item choice for when teams begin taking down the inner/inhibitor turrets.\n\nAnd now I leave this in your hands. Do you think the Ohmwrecker would be a good item on jungling Nunu? If so, explain why and if not tell me why not and what items you think would be better. I'd love to know how the community feels about this. I think all who read and/or post for their time.\n\nMay you be blessed with a Merry Christmas,\nEphamenne.","replies":[]}
