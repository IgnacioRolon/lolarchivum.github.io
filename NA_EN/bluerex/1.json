She is an burst mage that can get in the face of her enemies and drop tons of area damage while keeping her self safe by skillfully parrying attacks with her tessen. When she is about to unleash her fury, watch out.\n\n* * *\n\n> http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/pathofexile.gamepedia.com/9/96/Purity_of_Lightning_skill_icon.png Passive - __Stormfury__\n\n> Amaya gains _Stormfury_ each time she attacks, uses an ability, or takes damage. Once it reaches 100, she unleashes her built up _Stormfury_, empowering each ability for a brief time.\n\n> When _Stormfury_ activates, her fury will drain over time slowly, or quickly if abilities are used. Once her _Stormfury_ reaches 0, it goes on cooldown for a moderate duration.\n\n* * *\n\n> http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/pathofexile.gamepedia.com/e/e0/Phase_Run_skill_icon.png Q - __Gale Uppercut__\n\n> Amaya bursts forward, gathering wind energy as she moves. She stops at the first enemy hit, and uses her tessen to create a strong windforce, knocking up and damaging the enemy.The knockup lasts longer depending on how far Amaya dashed.\n\n> __Stormfury__ - Amaya channels her inner storm and quickly dashes the full distance of _Gale Uppercut_, causing lightning to strike and deal damage to any enemy she passes through. No knockup occurs in this mode.\n\n* * *\n\n> http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/pathofexile.gamepedia.com/b/b2/Shock_Nova_skill_icon.png W - __Thunder clap__\n\n> Amaya claps her tessen which makes a loud, thundering noise, releasing built up storm energy in a circle around her, dealing damage to any enemies struck.\n\n> __Stormfury__ - _Thunder clap_ has increased range, and releases an additional circle of storm energy that is smaller and does reduced damage.\n\n* * *\n\n> http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/pathofexile.gamepedia.com/e/e1/Assassin%27s_Mark_skill_icon.png E - __Tessen Parry__\n\n> Amaya faces a direction and extends her tessen very briefly to block an enemy ranged projectile or attack.\n\n> __Stormfury__ - Amaya equips another tessen, causing her to dual wield. This grants bonus attack speed and an additional cast of _Tessen parry_ before it goes on cooldown. \n\n* * *\n\n> http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/pathofexile.gamepedia.com/9/9f/Power_Siphon_skill_icon.png R - __Eye of the Storm__\n\n> Amaya summons the strength of a storm and causes a bolt of lightning to strike her, which deals damage in a small area around her, fills her _Stormfury_ bar, and enchants her tessen with lightning which deals additional damage on hit.\n\n> On cast, _Eye of the Storm_  refunds a moderate portion of all other abilities cooldowns.\n\n* * *\n\n# Combos\n\n__Tempest__ - Q - R - W - Q : Use your Q to get close range to your enemy, then unleash your combo: R will put you in fury, W and Q will give you the burst you need to finish them off. Be careful though - with your Q on cooldown you have no escape!\n\n__Tessen Death__ - Q - R - Auto - Q - Auto : This focuses on staying close to your enemy and using auto attacks with your ultimate on to \n\n# Personality\n\nAmaya is an energetic girl who loves proving to others her true strength. Amaya has a temper though, as channeling storm energy can cause a buildup of hatred and anger - when this happens, she unleashes her true power, her Stormfury. In this time, she loses her bubbly charm and energy, and becomes a maiden of fury and death. Beware, those who wish to challenge her in this moment.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-03-11T22:05:22.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's see...\nPassive feels very remeniscent of Rengar\nQ - skillshot knockup gapcloser, the empowered Q not knocking up feels kinda bad\nW - AOE champion centered nuke, empowered version does more damage - feel like this needs to do something else when empowered besides just more damage\nE - So, like fiora's parry, but only for ranged abilities - seems like an unneccisary constraint to have on this, unless it's supposed to be like Yasuo's wind wall. The empowered version giving you attack speed is really weird, since you have no on-hit type abilities for this champion except for the ultimate active\nR - another self targeted aoe, which adds on hit to you (for a duration? or only on your next attack?), and let's you recast your abilities\n\nI assume it would be better with this kit to use your abilities follow up with your ult to get the cooldown resets to let you recast everything again.\n\nMechanics wise, not particularly interesting. You don't have any tankiness in here, so I guess she's intended to be more of an AP burst assassin, unless you're intending for her abilities to scale of AD. There's nothing particularly interesting about her abilties either.\n\nThematics wise, she feels like she's stepping on Janna's and Karma's territory, just given by her appearance and storm related moves, still you can pull it off if it's interesting enough.\n\nI think I'm getting sort of an idea of what you're trying to accomplish with this champion design: a graceful battle mage who fights in a dress with war fans. You want her to be more of a melee mage, which is fine, but it feels like this is a champion that is sort of just pieced together from parts of other champions. Try to think of a few things:\n1) What do I want this person to be good at? Melee burst AP, or more Sustained AP?\n2) What can I make this person do that no one else does?\n3) How should this champion deal with different types of threats (melee vs ranged, squishy vs tanky)?\n\nYou have a okay \"core\" of an idea, but right now it really needs some work.","replies":[{"poster":"Bluerex","date":"2015-03-11T22:25:12.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome feedback, thanks!\n\n> Passive feels very remeniscent of Rengar\n\nYep, sort of, except it would last a duration. Sort of a mix of Rengar and Gnar.\n\n> You don't have any tankiness in here, so I guess she's intended to be more of an AP burst assassin\n\nThat was more the focus. I wanted her tankiness to come from her E and have it rely on skill (you'd have to time the parry correctly, and if you succeeded you'd be rewarded).\n\n> You have a okay \"core\" of an idea, but right now it really needs some work.\n\nI really liked the questions you posed at the end. Something I'll definitely ponder on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-12T01:23:49.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great art, formatted really well and easy to read.  Props on the technical side of things for sure.\n\nFor me, the concept itself is a little bland, however.  Amaya has a lot of similarities to Karma and I was also getting some major Akali vibes with self-targeted AoE and the dash.  From a usability perspective, having an uncontrollable \"power up\" mode that actually removes CC from an ability feels bad, as Jeden said.\n\nOverall it's a solid and balanced kit, but I don't think this pushes the envelope in terms of theme, trope, art or kit mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"Bluerex","date":"2015-03-12T02:13:33.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the comments.\n\nI agree with pretty much everything you said - this champ is more in the style of a 2012 - 2013 champ rather than a 2015.

I have been needing to tidy up some of the older ones as I go along because they simply don't match up to the quality or design philosophies that Riot has learned about League over the years.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Fusionist","date":"2015-03-11T21:11:19.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looks like an amazing champ","replies":[{"poster":"Bluerex","date":"2015-03-11T21:44:59.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dancing Rapier","date":"2016-02-26T00:25:36.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hullo just wanted to let you know that the ultimate's name is already taken by janna's shield, sorry :/","replies":[]}]}
