I can log into Riot's website fine and the credentials for my account are accepted, but when I try to log into it on the Riot Launcher it says there's a problem. I can log into other NA accounts fine, and this problem just started after the most recent patch. I think it's related to the removal of region select. Any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Awwww Yeaaaaahh","date":"2020-02-26T21:04:00.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there.
