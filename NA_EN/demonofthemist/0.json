So for awhile now i have noticed that the attack animations for Omega Squad teemo (his auto attack and his q animation) aren't lined up with when the person you are attacking takes damage.  The person will take damage about .5 seconds after the animation has hit them, making it a pain to last hit with.  Has anyone else noticed this problem?  And can a rioter maybe look into this?  Thank you :)","replies":[]}
