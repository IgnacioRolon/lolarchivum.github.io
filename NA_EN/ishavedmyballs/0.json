I also had problems with Omega Squad {{champion:17}}  which had problems with joke and moving quotes. I tested the skin in a custom game to see if the problem was still there, and it wasn&#039;t. I don&#039;t play Teemo that often so i cant say if the bug is still there, but the problem with Janna happens everytime","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-04T17:15:08.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! This should be resolved in 6.9. We are still working on audio theft if there is another Janna on the enemy team, but if you only have Forecast Janna in a game, it's fixed! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2016-05-03T04:26:31.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the omega squad teemo bug happens to me too","replies":[]}]}
