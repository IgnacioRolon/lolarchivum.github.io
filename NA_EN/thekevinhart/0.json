Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nYou were given a 14 day suspension because you received a 25 game chat restriction less than a month ago, and continued to be toxic towards your teammates.  When you were given the Reform Card for this 14 day suspension, it will have told you that if you continue to act like this, your next punishment is a permanent suspension of this account.  \n\nJust to be really, really clear about this.... even **_ONE MORE GAME_** like the ones you posted up above is enough to have your account permabanned.  If you act like this again, harassing and insulting your teammates, and they report you for it, you WILL BE PERMABANNED.  It is against the rules to call your teammates apes, to continually tell them how bad they are, to tell them they are worth less than trash, that you cannot carry them, etc.  Riot considers that to be verbal abuse, harassment and toxic behavior.
