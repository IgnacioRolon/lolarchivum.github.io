My question is who and why do people actually watch that?  I can&#039;t think of any worse of a way to spend my time other than watching people who sold their lives and soul to be addicted to a video game.\n\nLets look at what League Is and Is Not.\n\nLeague Is:\n\n* A video game\n\n* Best played with friends\n\n* A game of knowledge rather than technique (shooters tend to be the opposite)\n\n* A game where luck plays a VERY heavy role (surviving with 20 hp can snowball an entire game)\n\nLeague Is Not:\n\n* A profession (lmao)\n\n* A sport (LMAO)\n\nSo why do people watch league in a stage where it&#039;s portrayed as everything it Is Not, while hiding what it is?  I feel there&#039;s something sinister going on behind the scenes here.  Riot is trying to portray LoL as a viable life route to deceive impressible teenagers that their addiction is something they should peruse, rather than something they should tame.\n\nWhat are you thoughts, do you watch LCS?  What do you get out of it?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-18T01:35:37.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not personally, but a large number of people do, and e-sports is a rapidly growing industry.\n\nJust because you do not like it personally does not mean your opinion matters at all.

All who have responded are saying they do and I say the same. I'll watch however much I can watch whether it be LCS, LPL, LCK, OPL, you name it. \n\nI'm an esports fanatic. I'll watch whatever peaks my interest because it's all under the same umbrella of competitive gaming which is an interest to me as a spectator.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Black Jesus","date":"2018-06-18T10:43:33.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> * A game where luck plays a VERY heavy role (surviving with 20 hp can snowball an entire game)\n\nlol\n\nLots of people watch professional poker, which is also counted as a sport despite being based on luck.\n\nAlso, the enemy getting away with 20 hp is not \"luck\", you were just stupid to take that risk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-06-18T04:24:05.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it's not a sport in the traditional sense of the word. Hence why it's called an e-sports. Also a profession is literally anything you can use to make a living. If I can call dog walking a profession I sure as hell will call playing any sort of competitive video game one. \n\nYou can disagree all you want about league being a sport or a profession all you want. That doesn't change the fact that thousands, if not millions of people disagree with you.
