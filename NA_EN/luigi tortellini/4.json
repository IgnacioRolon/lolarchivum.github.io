IMO season 4 was the closest the game has ever gotten to being perfect, and every patch since then has been designed to make the game as unperfect as possible.  5.22 showed you stating to lose your mind, and the skuttle change demonstrated you do not have a person on your team who actually plays the game.  I have 0 faith in you guys making the game fun again, so you should just re release the game was it was in a fun state.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-17T17:40:04.180+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could have sworn people saying that Season 4 was the worst season yet when it was around but meph.","replies":[{"poster":"Luigi Tortellini","date":"2018-08-17T17:44:39.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I started playing in season 3, quit during 5 preseason, and started playing again once I graduated in season 7.

The game has come a long way, and it's got a good ways to go yet. Nothing is gained by turning back and reviving an outdated season just because you want to experience nostalgia.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-08-17T19:22:10.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, like Jagex, cares more about their community and the game than money and competitive.","replies":[]}]}
