I've been reported multiple times and my friends don't wanna play league with me anymore since they think I disconnect on purpose. My game simply freezes and I have to reboot via a button on my PC case ( the whole pc freezes and I don't have access to the restart button). Sometimes , the game does unfreeze after around 20 seconds but that has only happened a few times.\r\n\r\nMy graphics driver is fully up to date.\r\n\r\nPC Specs : \r\nIntel Core i7-3930k @ 3.20GTHz\r\n64 GB of RAM ( A lil' overkill)\r\nWindows 10 pro.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T02:49:15.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I really don't think your pc specs are to blame here, that's a heckin' lot of RAM O_O, pretty jealous myself xD!\n\nI want you to double check your drivers first (only due to how often people can miss this little step) but also check to see if any background programs might be causing your pc to lock up like that.

The same thing is happening and now with other games. I'm guessing my hard disk / SSD is the problem and I'm gonna need to buy a new one / new ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iSmellBadd","date":"2018-01-10T22:17:09.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=9u1VrEyq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-10T02:49:15.687+0000)\n>\n> Yea I really don&#x27;t think your pc specs are to blame here, that&#x27;s a heckin&#x27; lot of RAM O_O, pretty jealous myself xD!\n> \n> I want you to double check your drivers first (only due to how often people can miss this little step) but also check to see if any background programs might be causing your pc to lock up like that.
