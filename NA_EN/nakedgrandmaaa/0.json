Reading through forums has began to stir this question in my mind. Are they even allowed to and if so would any of them even consider it?! I just want to see what you guys have to say or what riot employees have to say about this. They probably get spammed with friend requests if their own friends list arent full already xD","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-05-07T22:03:48.839+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I have an interaction with someone on the forums or in person such that the request isn't completely out of the blue, I'm comfortable accepting a friend request. Different Rioters will have different levels of privacy.\n\nHonestly I'm mostly a Solo Queue Ranked player, though, so being on my friends list doesn't really accomplish very much. ;-)","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-05-07T22:38:25.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity though, how often do you get FR's by completely random people?","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-05-08T00:24:41.432+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only been visible on the forums for about a week (started at Riot shortly before that), so I've only gotten like 2.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-05-08T00:46:05.980+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, good to hear about a +1 to the Riot crew! Small interrogation time.\n\n* Were you a League player before jumping in?\n* How's the Riot life treating you?\n* Worked on anything fun and interesting yet or are you working up to it?\n* Have you thought of doing an introductory AmA for the lulz yet?","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-05-08T15:42:43.708+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've been playing since Caitlyn came out. My highest rank was low Gold in Season 3.\n\nRiot is really great. My situation is unusual, in that I'm working most of the time in Seattle (my fiancée is finishing a PhD at UW, so I can't move to Santa Monica till she's done), but Riot has been super awesome about making sure that's workable. I do meetings one or two times a day via video chat, and feel like I already have a good group of friends down there from my first two weeks on site.\n\nThe sort of work I'm doing isn't super visible, but I'm excited about it. I always love finding hurdles and slowdowns that affect designers, and I am in the process of handling an annoying one. Basically if we change an item's stats, there's two different places that we need to change the number, and then the tooltip is retranslated into all the languages we ship into. I'm making it so that the tooltips can pull the numbers out of the actual game data. So yeah, nothing super sexy, but it'll save people like Xypherous and FeralPony a lot of irritation as they do their work, and also help our translation team to only have to translate real changes.\n\nAs far as an AmA, I don't feel like I have enough insight or visibility to answer Anything, so I'm mostly just focusing on answering interesting posts when I can. ;-)","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-05-08T20:46:42.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds awesome! While I'm not the best at coding, I have taken a few classes and can seriously appreciate that project, as I know currently a lot of the tooltip changes are found via PBE and live player feedback. You guys have a *lot* of text to wrestle with.\n\nThat's really impressive Riot is flexible enough to allow you to stay off-site for an extended duration, as well as hearing about your fiancee's PhD, best of luck to her!\n\nUnderstandable about the AmA, those usually devolve into \"WHO'S THE NEXT NEW CHAMP???\" spam anyway. I for one always enjoy them anyway, it puts a person to the name you know? But you've humored me with this small barage of questions, so for that, I thank you. =)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-05-08T01:27:44.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Open the flood gates!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2014-05-08T03:54:30.322+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm the same way. If i get a random invite from a name I don't recognize, I won't accept simply because my space is super limited on my list and I wan't to keep it down to folks I know. However, if I meet someone on the forums, at an event, or elsewhere, and they add me, I will totally accept and play some games with you. I can't promise I won't have to clear them off one day to make room down the road for another player, but I will add folks I meet for some fun times when practical!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2014-05-08T18:38:50.389+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, similar to other Rioters: random invites, not so much, but if we've met on forums or at events or wherever, happy to add you.

Other than that I believe they're just another member of the community and playerbase. As you said, they probably get bombarded by FR's often so you probably have to make a really good impression/meet the IRL. All speculation of course.","replies":[]}]}
