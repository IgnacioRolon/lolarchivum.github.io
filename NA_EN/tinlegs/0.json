I could never see the point in it as what ever result you got wouldn&#039;t be your achievement.  The only way I have had fun with games is to work hard and work out how to improve.  \n\nNow I am facing the situation where Riot has put in place a system that not only assumes you are guilty but gives you no way to prove you are innocent.  \nA decision is made with evidence you can&#039;t see or respond to and these closed courts have a judge and jury of 1 person that has to get through 100&#039;s of cases quickly.  Now on more than one occasion I have asked a riot employee what evidence I could supply to prove I was innocent, each time it has been ignored. You can&#039;t tell me that such a system is going to mean that I have any chance of getting a fair &quot;Trial&quot;.   In real life the only people who have a justice system like this are Dictators. The only evidence allowed is gathered by the prosecutor and you have no way of knowing how to prove you are innocent.  Dictators  who wish to get rid of people and not have their judgments questioned are probably not the best people to model your \"Justice System\" after.\n\n In my case the first response I got to a request for appeal was just a cut and paste reply which is a nice feeling when you have had to wait a day for any response. \n\nNow I realise that almost everyone reading this is going to say that if I was detected as scripting / hacking I must be doing it.  Hate to ruin your day but that isn&#039;t the case and what ever triggered the &quot;Detection&quot; system to ban my account can also happen to you.  So enjoy that knowing that you could have your account perm banned without any fair way of getting it back.\n\nI have had more than just one person say that the ONLY chance i have to get my account unbanned is to make enough of &quot;riot&quot; in the forums to get someone to look at it and deal with it personally.

Fact of the matter is, the use of third party software to gain an advantage is very prevalent in League and an issue that needs to be resolved. I just hope you did not share your account with someone who did use such software otherwise you would be on the hook as well.\n\n**The off topic part:** As someone holding a law degree and having passed the BAR it bugs me that you refer to your punishment and \"trial\" like it should somehow work like an actual civil trial. You are using Riot's intellectual property and as such they have the right to limit your access to their intellectual property as they see fit especially because you do not pay a monthly membership. Any purchases made through their store is made with the agreement that they do not owe you anything should they terminate your account for any reason.

What I have issue with is that I have limited to no recourse in getting my account back for an issue where I haven't broken the T & C's etc.  As for your last statement I have never loaned my account out to anyone and this is why I am so certain as to what has happened or not on my account.  I have had this account for 5 years and I have friends in plat and challenger who have offered to \"boost\" my account.  I have turned them all down cause I know I wouldn't get any sense of achievement if I didn't do it myself.\n\nAs to your off topic statement, whilst I have studied the basics of law in University I am not a lawyer nor passed the BAR so I will bow to your legal knowledge here.  That being said just because the law is set out one way doesn't necessarily mean it is just or fair.  I am a person with no power having something that I enjoy being taken away from me for something I didn't do with little or no avenue to get it back.  How is that even close to being fair ?   Just because you have the legal right to do something doesn't necessarily mean that such actions are fair and hence my title  \" Automatic Assumption of Guilt and No Justice for Innocent People \"\n\nOn my part when I play the game and purchase items their is an implied assumption that there will be fairness in the dealings that I have with Riot and visa versa.

Find me a single example of riots anti-cheat software banning innocent people. You must not work in IT, because there are many ways to ensure your detection is a 100% positive rate. One strategy is to detect a practice you do not condone, for example, lets say skin hacking. If you target users using skin hacks, only users who are actually using skin hacks can be flagged.. this means that there is no false positive. There is no legitimate program that could set that off, because by nature, if a skin hack occurs, the program is not legitimate or at least not condoned by riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tinlegs","date":"2016-09-22T23:11:08.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly there is no way of knowing if the above example applies in my case or not because Riot won't provide any details on WHY I was banned in the first place.

You think the only way you can detect something is by a signature scan? Detecting unwanted programs is not an exact science. Just for examples sake, lets say you wanted to detect people calling a game function through their cheat. \n\nThey might place a hidden hook on that function call inside the client which is activated in response to a packet being sent, and check the call stack for calls outside the expected result. This is just one of many things done by other games that simply does not return false positives.. if you're calling their games API from a place you should not be ,there is no false positive, you simply are doing something they do not want you to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Tinlegs","date":"2016-09-28T03:19:00.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am going to just do you a favour here.
