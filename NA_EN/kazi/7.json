The pizza feet duo has priority now in my opinion , hope riot will take care of them this year and make two completely different champions , visual and gameplay . (:\r\n\r\n\r\nWitch one is your favorite ? Dr.Mundo or Mordekaiser ?\r\n\r\nLets show some love xD any memories funny/nostalgic with this 2 champs to share ? xD or some ideas for them when they get reworked or something you wish Riot would keep after their rework for example - Dr Mundo muscular body and body color or Mordekaiser identity and one ability in particular ?","replies":[]}
