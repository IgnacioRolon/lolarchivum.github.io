Keep in mind that Mundo is tier 1 in the VGU list . Would you like to see something like this picture in the game ?","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-08-23T10:53:32.477+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"He looks exactly the same, like if this was the end result of a Mundo rework I'd be wildly underwhelmed.

It would be funny to see mundo hopping around the rift on one leg while he tries to headbutt you as  we waits for his other limbs to grow back","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigSquirrell","date":"2018-08-23T16:18:14.284+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like Blanka raided the Final Fantasy armory.\n\nIt's a cool picture for sure, but this doesn't read as Mundo at all to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Herlgar","date":"2018-08-23T15:26:11.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be pretty sick if he walked on all fours after his VU, though.

The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde trope is really popular in my experience and I think they should go that way again, but just add their own twist to it to make it different from the hulk and Hyde.\n\nJust like Warwick was a generic werewolf and still fills the werewolf trope in LoL, but the rework changed him to be a Chemtech chimeras who still hugely resembles a werewolf, but without actually being one.\n\nI have faith that they can do the same with Dr. Mundo.
