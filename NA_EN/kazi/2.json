He doesnt have any 1350+ skins , but damn man this skin looks legendary 1820 and i would glady pay for it ,the skin is too good. He needs a good quality one and this is a good chance.\n \nIf the skin would come in a bundle with Devil Shaco skin , Devil Shaco icon and ward i would buy it in 2 seconds.\n\n                                   Lets do this guys!
