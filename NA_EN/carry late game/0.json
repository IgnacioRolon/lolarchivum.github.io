But there's no range indicator.\r\n\r\nI have the : show attack range enabled in the interface options, but it still doesn't show any range indicator it just attacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-21T17:21:07.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's odd, when you tap A there should be an indicate for the range of your basic attack.  There may be some configuring issues not loading your options correctly, see if resetting your config might help with that:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Carry LATE Game","date":"2017-12-21T21:22:42.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, i found out 30min later the cause was it having a secondary key binding.","replies":[]}]}]}
