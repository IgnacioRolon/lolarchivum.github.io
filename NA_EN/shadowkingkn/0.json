Every time the game crashes, one can find an error in the Windows Event Viewer application which shows that the crash results from a problem in ntdll.dll with exception code: 0xc000041d. Searching the web with this infos didn't revealed too much insight. However the error suggests that the LOL Client is hooking into a window but not releasing the handle (or that it didn't get the permission to the hook in the first place). \n\nFurthermore, one can reproduce the same error message without even to start a game. Start LOL, click on \"Launch\" in the patcher to arrive at the login screen. Now open any other program with admin rights (right click on a icon in the taskbar -> open as admin). There pops up a dialog asking if you really want to run this program, click cancel. Now the LOL client crashes. \nThis shows that the problem has its roots not in some missing textures ect but is really connected how the lol client handles/hooks into windows. Thus I think this problem is also related to the crashes which happened even 5.4 if you switch between the fullscreen lol client and some other program.  This suspicion is further enhanced by the fact that these previous crashes resulted in exactly the same error message.\nI hope this insights help riot to solve this problem more quickly!\n\n\nNew 5.5 crash info:\n> Faulting application name: LolClient.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x515663e0\n> Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 10.0.9926.0, time stamp: 0x54bdee57\n> Exception code: 0xc000041d\n> Fault offset: 0x0002d992\n> Faulting process id: 0xcf8\n> Faulting application start time: 0x01d05d9f3afbebca\n> Faulting application path: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.134\\deploy\\LolClient.exe\n> Faulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll\n> Report Id: 801e8c59-c992-11e4-82f0-18a905fa3e1b\n> Faulting package full name: \n> Faulting package-relative application ID: \n> \n> Faulting application name: LolClient.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x515663e0\n> Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 10.0.9926.0, time stamp: 0x54bdee57\n> Exception code: 0xc0000005\n> Fault offset: 0x0002d992\n> Faulting process id: 0xcf8\n> Faulting application start time: 0x01d05d9f3afbebca\n> Faulting application path: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.134\\deploy\\LolClient.exe\n> Faulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll\n> Report Id: 7d90b9ca-c992-11e4-82f0-18a905fa3e1b\n> Faulting package full name: \n> Faulting package-relative application ID: \n\n\nOld 5.4 crash info (dated 11.03.2015)\n\n> Faulting application name: LolClient.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x515663e0\n> Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 10.0.9926.0, time stamp: 0x54bdee57\n> Exception code: 0xc000041d\n> Fault offset: 0x0002d992\n> Faulting process id: 0x33f4\n> Faulting application start time: 0x01d05c14ef53ea08\n> Faulting application path: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.131\\deploy\\LolClient.exe\n> Faulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll\n> Report Id: bc506de6-c810-11e4-82ee-18a905fa3e1b\n> Faulting package full name: \n> Faulting package-relative application ID: \n> \n> Faulting application name: LolClient.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x515663e0\n> Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 10.0.9926.0, time stamp: 0x54bdee57\n> Exception code: 0xc0000005\n> Fault offset: 0x0002d992\n> Faulting process id: 0x33f4\n> Faulting application start time: 0x01d05c14ef53ea08\n> Faulting application path: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.131\\deploy\\LolClient.exe\n> Faulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll\n> Report Id: b4691bdb-c810-11e4-82ee-18a905fa3e1b\n> Faulting package full name: \n> Faulting package-relative application ID:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bowser Gaming","date":"2015-03-12T23:56:42.743+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"SO I would have to downgrade to windows 7 to run League?

It is a *technical preview*, it is not a complete build of what is going to be released as the actual product. \n\nWhy would Riot be concentrating on making sure their application runs on a technical preview? Applications and Operating Systems change when going from Beta to Beta to official release. \n\nIts not like pulling a lever the game is automatically compatible with the operating system. It takes time to write the code in development, work through Q&A and then finally get pushed out to the actual product. \n\nYou take a risk when you decide to install a beta of an operating system. There are no guarantees it will work with any existing application that doesn't belong to Microsoft and even when the official build of Windows 10 releases, it does not mean LoL will even be supported with it then. \n\nCompanies never jump on an operating system when it first releases, doesn't anybody remember Windows Vista? We have products within my company that are just getting supported with Windows 8 and we provide hospitality management software for properties around the world. \n\nObviously not everybody with a technical background knows or even understands this, but what you're asking for is just absurd.

Saying that companies don't jump onto operating systems immediately is a moot point as who plays League at work? There will certainly be a sizable uptake of **individuals**, particularly of the power user variety, as soon as MS goes into production phase.\n\n- Goodwill. Sure there's no legal obligation but there are thousands of Win10 users already, if they just let the problem slide until release how much flak will Riot get on release? \n\n- Financial loss. \"I Can't play the game? Why should I buy those shiny new skins coming out?\" Not a huge factor since Win10 users aren't exactly a massive percentage of LoL's user base but it would affect the bottom line, however marginally.\n\nSure, it's not a priority, Windows 10 IS a theoretically unstable OS and there's no LEGAL obligation to look at it. That doesn't mean there's no reason for Riot to do so, even if it's just to stop people from flooding the forums with bug reports.\n\nIn any case, Riot isn't solely in this for the money - as far as I've seen over the years they genuinely want people to enjoy the game, so I think it is going to be looked at simply so that we can do so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dawnesha","date":"2015-03-13T18:29:28.952+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that's it, huh? \"Deal with it\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squeester","date":"2015-03-13T00:46:49.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How the hell does this have 80 up-votes in 12 hours, but my post about this happening on mac has been up for a few days now (since patch 5.4).
