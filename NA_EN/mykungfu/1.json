Turns out they had closed it (without telling me) and determined that the issue is **_NOT_** on their end.\n\nAnd despite all my explaining of traceroutes and such, they were VERY persistent in telling me the issue is **_NOT_** something they can fix, and even went as far as to tell me that the problem is not on their end.\n\nThey need to be contacted by an actual tech support person who actually knows all the technical terms and actually knows how to PROVE the issue is on their end and force them to investigate it, and **_investigate it properly._** Considering Riot built an entire fucking network to make their game run better, you would think Riot would have someone qualified to contact the ISP and explain the issue to them and get it fixed.\n\nIf this keeps up I will probably quit League. Helping my ISP to fix their issues would go a long way toward keeping me as a paying customer of Riot Games, and buying RP. (**_MY ISP IS EVEN PARTNERED WITH YOU, this means you have the appropriate business contacts to get this solved_**)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesus is Saviour","date":"2016-07-14T15:10:23.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=lhfOKJ05,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-13T23:10:10.965+0000)\n>\n> Routing issues are generally caused by packet loss or latency spikes at specific hops along your route to the server.

They don't care.
