It stayed there for the remainder of the day. The following day it went back down one game, up another, down another. It does not fluctuate in game but it seems random as to whether I get put in a game on a 58 ping server or 28 ping server.

There are times that your ISP sends your connection on a very efficient route, netting you only 28 ping.  Other times it sends you on a more in-efficient route, given you an extra 30 ping.  This is why it can vary fairly drastically game-to-game.  \n\nUnfortunately, since the path is being provided by your ISP, there is very little we can do.

Load up a free trial (and pay for it if it works for you) and manually connect to Toronto 4. Toronto 5 also seems okay, but Toronto 4 in my experience has been a bit better.\n\nYour ping will only be 5 ms higher instead of 20-30 ms higher.\n\nEDIT: if you don't live in Ontario you may need to try other servers closer to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Mykungfu","date":"2016-06-15T04:51:55.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice, using Toronto 4 I actually don't experience any less ping than I did before this routing issue came up. It's a shame Riot can't just poke Rogers and say \"hey, some stuff is messed up, let's fix this.\" But maybe I'll just pay for this service.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2016-06-15T03:06:49.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=vANJaJ4f,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-10T21:30:11.477+0000)\n>\n> Hmmm....this honestly seems to be a routing issue with your ISP.

They really don't care when their customers complain.
