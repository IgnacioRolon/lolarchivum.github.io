Last night, I used Roguekiller to scan my computer for mal ware that I had. It took care  of my problem, however, now my league doesn't work. I;m not sure if it's a coincidence or not, but some time after that scan I can't use league. I'm not sure how they could be related. I looked at the files RK took away, and none had anything to do with league. When I start league ( have tried as an admin as well), I get the RADs error that the game can't connect. My internet is working fine and has been tested on multiple devices. I've tried going into the network settings and changing the DNS to 8 8 8 8, 8 8 4 4, as many other posts have stated. Most people who did that had their software fixed. I've tried changing the game to start as an admin as well, to no avail. I'd really like to play LoL and I feel the solution can't be too complicated, but I'm growing angry trying to do this on my own. Does anyone else have something I can try to get rid of the Rads error? I've also tried disabling windows firewall temporarily and then starting the game. No luck with that either. Any advice / ideas from people who have had this and fixed it would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks,,\r\n\r\n-MK (THE Marineknight)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T22:21:22.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The error you're receiving can be a little misleading.
