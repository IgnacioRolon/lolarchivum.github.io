Can you guys investigate if optimum is purposely slowing down on league on tristate(northern NJ) area? Also, it appears in most of my games there are occasions where my ping will read 20~30 and internet is still connected as i can search stuff in chrome but i will disconnect regardless. I thought my computer was laggy, but after seeing task manager and network logs, I concluded it can't be anything besides packet loss. In my latest game i averaged about 10% packet loss according to your network log. When I tried ping test to 104.160.131.3 32 byte 20 times. i got 0 % packet loss. Every other program seems to run fine. So i think this is league specific problem. I would like a feedback from riot networking team. \nConstant disconnect and ping spikes(I think this might be just bad internet) and packet loss pretty much makes it impossible for me to play any assassins or fighters.... so im sticking with janna for now but please help me fix this asap. (Actually I think most of this is your server's problem as I've searched up and seen numerous complaints at patch 7.7 which is i think around when i started having this problem.)\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention but fps capping doesnt work for me. I have 30fps selected but my fps keeps being 54 or 60","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-01T20:23:37.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have jurisdiction or visibility over the conduct of ISPs, but we do have a [list of peering partners ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210665503-NA-Peering-Partners)who work to connect players faster.
