In fact, probably even dropping out because of that. But after reading a bit into it, I'm definitely on the assumption of visas (going to Poland) or even just reentry into the country after given the quality their staff. I'm leaned more onto the visa point but there's definitely a bit of concern for the latter. Politics isn't a point I really like to touch on much but it does suck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2017-02-09T19:34:58.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"yea well...why would an NA team need international experience when it can just win at home and fail at worlds again? \n\ngood lord.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-02-09T20:01:30.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Korean and Chinese teams going were both at the bottom of their divisions leaving only the EU teams and FW as the real competition.\n\nI think they would rather try to win this split then go to MSI to face the best teams, but from what I have heard the main issue is that they are dealing with is visa issues and it is going to be difficult for them to get the full team there.\n\nNot sure if the last part is true but if it is then it makes sense why they would not want to go play with half of a roster.","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2017-02-09T20:07:22.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why though? \nCan't think of any reason why a team from North America should have any trouble playing in a tournament hosted in the EU.","replies":[{"poster":"101100111000","date":"2017-02-09T20:14:30.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because some of the players on a North American team might themselves only be there on work visas from another country, and therefore moving them from Country B to Country C when they're really from Country A poses paperwork issues at the bare minimum.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-02-09T21:27:32.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\n\nI was looking forward to that XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-02-09T19:33:28.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woooo! \nI did not see that coming\n\nI was very excited about C9 going to IEM","replies":[]}]}
