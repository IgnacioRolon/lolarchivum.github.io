Doing this will have Tryndamere's portrait laughing but the blades would still spin around him.\r\n\r\nAfter the visual rework, Tryndamere can still laugh and spin, but the blade spinning animation is completely removed.\r\n\r\nNow at 9.13, Tryndamere simply cannot laugh and spin any more. This is an easy test and it involves key input so I am not going to make a video about it.\r\n\r\nSteps: Get in a game as Tryndamere. Level up E. Use E and in the middle of spinning, press the keys for laugh (I bind my laugh to C), observe that Tryndamere does not react to laugh while spinning but can do so otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis lasted the whole game.\r\n\r\nI know laughing actually cancelling the animation is troublesome and unwanted, but if we can have spinning blades while laughing before, we can have it with rework. Please don't just simply remove this feature altogether. Think about how sad Foggedftw would be when he finds out about it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nFQVBSina","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-06-26T15:27:00.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know laughing actually cancelling the animation is troublesome and unwanted, but if we can have spinning blades while laughing before\n\nLol wat.\nI don't want another Riven Situation where Riot thinks ,,Uhhh, Bugs and resulting Animation Cancels are now part of the kit, we know we can't balance the champ now anymore, because people who can't properly do it will play the champ like those who can.

But isn't it cooool??\"\n\nAre you talking about this in reference to Riven's animation cancel for her Q? This is not the same thing.\n\nTryndamere has his own animation cancel where you can use auto attack and right after it lands to use E to spin out, canceling half the auto animation. This is still there.\n\nWhat I am talking about is the interaction where the portrait part of Tryndamere does the laughing action while the blade still spins around him. It does literally nothing more than a kind of cool way of spin. It is not like the Riven animation cancel where she can Q at a higher frequency. The only issue is with the visual rework, the blade animation is gone but the character is still spinning, just you don't see the blades anymore. This should definitely be fixed, but not by simply removing his ability to spin and laugh. That would be the equivalent of deleting Riven because they can't change the Q animation cancel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-06-26T15:37:28.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what are you trying to say. What does this particular interaction has to do with \"people who can't properly do it...\" etc? It was just an interaction between spinning and laughing. Much like back when Garen could machine gun laugh in the sense that it does nothing else other than that. But it is not annoying like the machine gun laugh, it is just a legacy bug interaction that people enjoyed for so many years.","replies":[]}]}]}
