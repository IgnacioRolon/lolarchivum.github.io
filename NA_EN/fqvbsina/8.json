Unsure of how far would they travel, so far they definitely will go up to their outer turret. To test: use Singed and walk through the poison jungle to Proxy between bot&#039;s inner and outer turrets.\r\n\r\nStrategy 2: They ignore Karthus&#039;s passive.\r\nCurrently: Not anymore! They will stay right on the rim of the range for Q. Stop upgrading your codes Rito!\r\n\r\nCan we even beat them anymore? Is there even point in playing it? Why do we have a game mode where we can&#039;t win instead of a game mode that we all love like URF, ARURF, One for all, or even the most appeared game mode but definitely one of the least liked - Ascension?","replies":[{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-06-10T06:36:57.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a terrible game mode; not even fun to play because there's really no chance of winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2017-06-12T04:58:47.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can be done but it is not easy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Awsar","date":"2017-06-12T04:50:40.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes the bots are pretty OP even when we get to the teemo we cant fight cause the bots are all over us.\nalso the frequency of getting 1 shot is crazy im not the best at this game but last year won this mode alot but now cant even get close","replies":[]},{"poster":"crzymdscntst","date":"2017-06-10T06:43:56.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't won it recently, but I've noticed A LOT of players who equally don't pay attention to how to play. The little nuances of helping allies and actually poking enemies down seems to be lost. I think there might've even been a bot player in one of the matches.\n\nWhatever Riot did, I'm not sure it was quite an improvement, but despite how much people enjoy it, there's something distinctly not working with the mode or how players approach the mode.\n\nMy best results have been with Teemo. (Go figure.) I was pushing my lane to the enemy tower. (Which heals you as it kills your minions.) I only started failing when another lane did, which triggers the roaming phase of the bots.\n\nAlso there is little-to-no counter to minion-based champs in it. You get Udyr AND Malz, you won't be keeping your lanes up. I think this actually is compounded by something causing the towers to be less durable and enemy champs to me more durable.","replies":[]}]}
