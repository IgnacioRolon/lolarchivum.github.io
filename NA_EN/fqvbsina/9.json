I believe I even clicked the save button when the window is closed as the game was about to start.\r\n\r\nEither way, it completely ignored all my edits and gave me a random mastery page. I got the glacial augment, basically, support preset mastery page for Tryndamere.\r\n\r\nThere are so many things wrong here:\r\n1. Why would an AD champion get the glacial mastery page as a random?\r\n2. Why can't the game just save the masteries I selected? I would rather have half of my mastery page (and leave the other half blank) than having a random one that has no synergy with the champion.\r\n3. The game has a prompt that asks if I would like to save the page when it closes, please make it actually work. If the page is incomplete, see number 2 above. Or at least randomize only the ones that didn't get picked and let me keep the categories that I selected (precision, domination, etc.).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nFQVBSina","replies":[]}
