The visual rework did have an issue with spin laugh because with the change, laughing while spinning actually removes all the animations unlike before when the spin animation is still there. But removing this feature completely while it has been around for so many years and not causing any issues is very disappointing. Not to mention Foggedftw would be hugely disappointed as well in this since he pretty much only plays Tryndamere and the laughing spin is his signature. Please consider somehow get it back.","replies":[{"poster":"kda akali","date":"2019-06-26T15:52:03.347+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot should make it like singed flip where he laughs automatically","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-06-26T16:03:48.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dracovicus","date":"2019-06-27T06:28:52.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is because, though it was a bug, it only did it recently allow you to glitch a split second free attack while spinning. it happens when you clip into someone or comes with in about half of trynd AA range. It also gave you an advantage as it cancles the animation of the end spin which is .5seconds. I hope that explains to you why that happen.\nPS I did report the bug multiple times as i notice the free damage i was taking from it in a few games.","replies":[{"poster":"MEGAchriso","date":"2019-07-06T11:21:53.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't cry plz , if they want to delete animation cancels they should start with Riven.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmDrei","date":"2019-07-03T10:14:48.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of that, I wouldn't call it gamebreaking as this bug has not impacted Tryndamere hugely.. I mean, he hasn't been meta since, well, ever. Also, what about other champions using animation cancelling?
