That is totally useless. We already got very familiar with using discord and other voice chat systems for premade parties. The whole point of ever implementing in-game voice chat is to make it convenient so that everyone else on the team can join in because it is much more complicated if we have to send them a link in the chat box to discord, and they may not have used discord before, and all that stuff.\r\n\r\nPeople worry about hearing other&#039;s BM, then just silence them! What? Never saw people BM with typing chat before? How is it different?","replies":[]}
