Red side has no comeback potential what-so-ever. When average player failed you can say we couldn&#039;t use teamwork to turn the game around, but what about this game? Red side certainly tried - tried very hard in fact, especially Uzi, but it was not going to happen. This game is not even fun to watch despite urf is supposed to be fun to play and watch - would you enjoy a game of Cloud 9 main team versus 5 bronze?\r\n\r\nWhat we need is 10 ban draft urf. All annoying champion pick problems solved. You can see what you are going to play against, pick accordingly, or ban them. If 10 bans aren&#039;t enough, make it 12, make it 14! We really don&#039;t mind the extra time because it is urf.","replies":[{"poster":"Etwahl For One","date":"2018-12-07T13:48:03.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but champs like karthus, teemo, sona, alistar, and i think soraka, are already banned in the mode anyway, last i knew. granted, i wouldn't mind zed and lux being added to that list. still, arurf is unfortunate in that it's often one sided, but that's okay with show matches, since they're just show matches.","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2018-12-09T00:11:20.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it is even worse in show match. Show match is meant to be fun to watch for the viewers. I didn't enjoy much of that due to how one-sided it is. Even worse when you realize the people playing are better than you","replies":[]}]}]}
