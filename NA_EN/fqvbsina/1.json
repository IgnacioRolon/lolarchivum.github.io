It changed around the time emotes and free wards came out because at that time I set wards and emotes both to T and I still have that set today - whenever I put a ward down I also cast an emote. But I am no longer able to bind any other keys to the same button.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Foggedftw taught me Trynd's swag spin where if you spin and use laugh, the character portrait stands still while effectively I would still be spinning. I find pressing E and then control+3 quite tiresome after a long time. I currently changed laugh to Y since I pretty much never use character focus camera anyway. But I am wondering if there is still valid options out there that can just let me bind laugh to E so I can spin and laugh.","replies":[{"poster":"RIP Tahm Kench","date":"2019-03-01T12:13:46.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you need to do it through a configuration file now. \n\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n\nYou'll see an .ini file that you can modify.","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-03-09T02:47:52.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried. Although it stayed as changed in the ini file but it won't update in the client. Nothing I tried will make the change appear. I think they backup a copy of the hotkeys on the server. Kind of make sense that I won't be allowed to change this way, otherwise I can just bind all the skills to one key and for some champions this will break the game. I will stick with laughing with Y","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-03-01T08:40:33.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiding animations should be considered cheating.","replies":[{"poster":"RIP Tahm Kench","date":"2019-03-01T12:15:28.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This only works with abilities without cast times, and even then all spell effects play normally when doing this.
