There is still a comp differential but I am hoping the game moves towards a holy-trinity style in the sense that comps are somewhat of a counter to each other instead of just having one be stronger. And comps being countered can relieve the counter by mixing up the comp with another synergy. I think this part is really missing in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReaI Estate","date":"2019-11-02T16:35:19.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somone doesn't know how to use MF ~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-11-01T17:57:40.431+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont understand how this idea is supped to \"make strategy more interesting\" when everyone is just going to build whatever comp their 5 star is.\n\noh i got a kaisa, im going voidssassins, oh i got a swain, i'm going shapeshifters.\n\nseems like you're taking the majority of the strategy OUT of the game by doing this","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-11-04T22:29:12.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You have a point that this seems to decide the final choices but it certainly does not take way strategy since you are only given higher chance for that tier 5, nothing says the player gets more chance at other void assassins throughout the game.\n\nAnd you are saying that as if people are not beelining for one comp right now anyways.
