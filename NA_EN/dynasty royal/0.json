On my second to last re-roll I got Forecast Janna and I was so excited, but when I clicked to add the skin into my collection it instead went into my skin inventory inside hextech crafting. I double checked and I know something is wrong. The skin shard is \"legendary skin permanent\" and it has an \"Owned\" status when I hover it and the gold border around it. But when I looked in the shop I confirmed that I already owned Forecast Janna. It came from a 3 shard re-roll so it has to be a skin I don't own and it should have been unlocked automatically. Why did I get a shard for something I already have?\n\nedit: After going through purchased content and tracking that skin down I realized that it unlocked Forecast Janna but gave me the shard back as permanent. The first time I went through my shop it appeared as I didn't own the skin, the same thing under champions tab but after refreshing a few times it appears as owned in both locations. It still doesn't explain why I got the shard after the re-roll....","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T20:12:21.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very interesting situation.
