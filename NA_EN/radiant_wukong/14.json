It&#039;s complete bullshit that any AP champ that wants sustain has to build a fucking gunblade. While gunblade is ideal for Akali, Katarina, Mordekaiser, Fizz, Diana. I used to use WotA for so many champs and gunblade isn&#039;t a substitution for ranged mages like Vlad, Morgana, Lux, Karma, Ryze, Zyra, Heimer, etc \r\n\r\nPLEASE BRING WOTA BACK!","replies":[{"poster":"A Nunu","date":"2018-03-30T10:43:16.904+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"WoTA promoted a sustain meta due to the Spell Vamp that it had, and how useful it was to the wrong champions.\nSustain in the game is ultimately unhealthy for the game.\nThe reason why Gunblade has Spell Vamp on it is exactly because of the champions that _ actually_ use it. \n\nLet's say, for example, a mage buys a Gunblade. The mage can't really make use of the AD that's on the item, ultimately making it a worthless item on them, preventing them to abuse the Spell Vamp and have an AFK, sit back and heal playstyle.\n\nNow, let's say a standard Gunblade user, like Katarina buys a Gunblade. Katarina (and basically all other Gunblade users) have unique fighting styles that require them to all-in in order to actually do damage to enemies (unless they're insanely fed). All in-ing like this is risky since they are very squishy and weak to most forms of CC, and in most cases, WILL result in them taking damage. The Spell Vamp IS ONLY THERE to help make their fighting styles not so overly punishing. \n\nAlso, the way Gunblade users work is that they are very feast or famine, only making it so that you MUST constantly take risks for kills in order to be useful. This makes it virtually impossible for users to just sit back and sustain themselves to victory.\n\nEdit: I've seen that you've used life steal as an argument on why WoTA is okay to be brought back. Lifesteal on melee champions is okay to be in the game for nearly the same reason that Gunblade is okay to be built on Gunblade users. ADCs on the other hand, have next to no forms of self-peel  and disengage compared to mages. They're also not bursty enough in the early game to make as much use of all the peel they already have. So in return, they get life steal. In the late game, life steal on ADCs doesn't really matter since they will most likely be bursted down by an assassin before they can even heal up.\n\nI hope this helps you better understand why your beloved WoTA shouldn't be added back into League of Legends.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/lapuoda6bee.png\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Radiant Wukong","date":"2018-03-30T11:24:24.273+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"What League of Legends have you been playing?\n{{champion:119}} move speed and knockback\n{{champion:22}} stun and perma slow + ability that grants vision\n{{champion:51}} traps and dash\n{{champion:81}} blink\n{{champion:18}} leap and knockback\n{{champion:222}} bind and slow\n{{champion:96}} slow\n{{champion:110}} bind and slow\n{{champion:133}} \"blind\" and knockback stun + ability that grants vision\n{{champion:15}} spell shield and movespeed\n{{champion:17}} blind, movespeed, perma slow that also grants vision\n{{champion:498}} untargetable and stun\n{{champion:67}} invisibility, dash, knockback that can stun\n\nThey have plenty of self peel on top of having range.

I'll give you a hint, it wasn't {{champion:122}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:25}}\n\nWhy did Ashe get to heal herself back to 100% health with {{item:3072}} , negate a lot of my damage with {{item:3812}} , and even if I killed her, get a second chance at life with {{item:3026}} . Which also reminds me, mages got screwed over on GA as well. Speaking of mages being screwed over, guess who the first to die in the team fight?\n\nGood old Morgana. Morgana who blew her {{item:3157}} so I couldn't execute her, giving her enough time for Warwick to come ult me. Morgana who could have healed a decent amount of health with her W on a minions and a few teammates and had a chance.

Most of the time going 1 for 1. AP assassins, AP marksmen, AP mages drop dead instantly unless they have their {{item:3157}} (which still takes them out the fight for 2.5 seconds).\n\nYou know who doesn't die? The AD assassins and AD marksmen. Why... because they have {{item:3812}} and {{item:3072}} . If that isn't enough to sustain, they have {{item:3026}} which takes them out the fight for 4 seconds and brings them back with 50% of their health, 30% mana and they still have their {{item:3072}} healing on EVERY SINGLE AA coming in a 2AA/s minimal.\n\n{{item:3157}} restores no health and no mage item grants healing.

You're just throwing out every ADC with any form of CC.\n\nAnd again, no offence, but that example you used about that game you had was really bad. And your point only becomes less credible from the fact that you are currently in Bronze.\n\n\n**Edit:** I just did a quick check on OP.GG and lolking.net, and by the looks of it, you've actually NEVER played a game of Darius with that build **OR** that comp, so basically, you just lied.\n#Yikes.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/lapuoda6bee.png\n","replies":[{"poster":"Radiant Wukong","date":"2018-03-30T11:53:37.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"My brother keeps his account logged on the boards.
