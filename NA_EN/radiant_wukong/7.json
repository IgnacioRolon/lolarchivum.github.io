WHY THE FUCK COULDN'T I STICK TO HIM!\n\nThen he sits under his fucking tower for 30 seconds and he's back to full health. \nI push lane then roam mid and this bitch takes 2 of my towers and outruns me again even though I used Bork active and was AAing him.\n\nRIOT has got to fucking fix that. Same goes for {{champion:27}} \n\nI don't know what's worse top lane, putting up with ranged champs {{champion:133}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:150}} , or shit like {{champion:27}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:41}}\n\nThere is nothing fun about laning against them or even having them in your match!\n\nFor the record, I've won the last 3 matches that featured those champions. It's not about winning, losing or balance. They're simply extremely unfun to play against but they're also not ban worthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Diamond Senpai","date":"2019-09-06T00:00:27.920+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't hate the game.

I love fighting {{champion:75}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:517}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:78}} \n\nIt's an action packed lane that forces me to play my best when I'm against one of them. Nothing feels better than watching a {{champion:122}} {{champion:31}} ult my decoy.\n\nOn the contrary, nothing feels worse than {{champion:555}}  jolting my decoy and killing me anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-09-06T02:09:28.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every matchup besides {{champion:45}} and {{champion:161}} is \"uninteractive\" for Kat, unless they screw up royally.
