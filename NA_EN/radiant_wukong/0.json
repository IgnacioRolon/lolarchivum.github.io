Two times today I was not able to select a champ to ban therefore I got kicked from the matchmaking and charged with Leaverbuster and loss of LP.  This really makes me want to play this game less and less each day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BOOMSTICK89","date":"2016-12-19T20:10:29.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed the beta client acting worse and worse sense it's release. Initially I experienced some lag or sluggishness after maybe three or four games and it got progressively worse the more I played without  reloging, it also never seemed to affect my in game experience. As time went on the lag became more and more consistent and began as soon as I logged in and even got to the point where it seemed to cause me to DC during champ loading just before a game, I found myself relogging before ever 2nd or 3rd game. I just deleted the beta client, riot has a lot of work and a lot of convincing to do before I go back. verdict as of now: 1/10 very poor... I am very dissapionted as i do like the new look of the beta client and was very happy with it for the first few weeks, it feels and though there has been too much attention spent on adding to the beta without enough attention paid to how well it works as a whole. I run into several bug every day so much to the point I no longer report them, honestly with how much time I spend reporting bugs and problems I probably should just apply for a testing job.... you're better than this Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HALPAS","date":"2016-12-15T17:15:18.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!
