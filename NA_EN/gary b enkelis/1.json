I would have to defer more to someone who works directly with the game systems on how the in-game interaction works, but what's reflected in the client is the delta of items purchased and actual gold earned.  \n\nFor example, if I go to the store and spend 50g on a potion, then I sell that potion back, then buy something else.  I don't calculate the sale price as earned gold, but I do count  both purchases in my spent column.  \n\nThis is a typical example of one way you could see greater spent than earned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-08-11T23:16:37.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Selling an item doesn't count as \"gold earned\" but if you then buy something, it does count for \"gold spent\"","replies":[]}]}
