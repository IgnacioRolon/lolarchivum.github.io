That can typically get you a smoother connection with our servers overall, and you should see some better ping with that. I'd also probably try switching to ethernet instead of wifi if you consistently have issues with ping on wifi (since wireless can be pretty unstable in general).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BHS Ledfrog","date":"2018-02-01T03:19:16.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me.
