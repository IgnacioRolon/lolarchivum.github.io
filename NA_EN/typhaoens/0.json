If you were dying to him when he got ganks you were more than likely WAAYYYY too pushed up, which is your fault. His team capitalized on it.\n\n2. League is a team game. It's not about 1v1's and who can make the flashiest outplays. In the end the game is about destroying the enemy nexus, and kills are just one way to help give your team an advantage towards that goal.\n\n3. What a lot of players think of as 'playing like a pussy' is often times players being cautious and waiting for you to make a mistake so they can capitalize. And if you get antsy and try to force a play because nothing is happening, and die 2v1 as a result, that's on you for playing poorly, IMO, ESPECIALLY if you already knew the Irelia was camping you.\nI'm guilty of that too sometimes but it's noone's fault but mine for overextending.\n\nIn all honesty this is probably why he's plat and you're silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Typhaoens","date":"2018-06-23T08:06:32.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"they started killing me near my own turret and diving early on :P\nand I get what you mean but I am here to change that and make players play like REAL CHAMPS NOT LIKE PUSSIES!!!\nalso I think most ranked match making are wonky yesterday there was atleast a crapton of remake probs like 5 or 7 and the day before that I kept getting games where people afk or grief early other then that the match making at this ranking is tough u 3 u \nI came close to gold 5 for 3 seasons now and ive always never been able to make it pass promo its like league is purposely trying to get me in bad games and matches like how most enemy team had higher ranking players :0\nALSO SHUT YOUR BHLASPHEMY!

First, you are a yasuo main, you have 83 games on him this season, the guy you faced hasnt played Yasuo one single time for 3 years. For him, was the first time playing him. While there is a huge skill gap between silver 2, you, and plat 2, that guy, its only natural for someone who plays a champion for the first time to be more reserved and constrained about what he does. In a mirror match-up the main will have great advantages against the player who plays a champion for the first time, even if he is more skilled as a player overall.\n\nAlso, if you keep believing what you are saying, you will never get out of silver. And even if you do, you will get back to it.\nIf you dont learn when to be a \"chicken\" and when to be \"man\".\nIf you dont understand that laning is not all about killing and its less important than other things in a game.\nIf you dont understand that teamwork is way more important than 1vs1.\nIf you dont understand that you are a bad player and learn how to improve.\nYou will stay in silver for ever...","replies":[{"poster":"Typhaoens","date":"2018-06-24T18:04:17.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"did you read the part where he had his duo jg irelia camp my lane? someone who plat couldn't 1v1 me or fight me onwards without help even early like 3 minute into game we were in a 1v1 and irelia come flashing in like a hoe my friend I aint giving a free pass for platinum players who gotta play dat pussie shit this is league of legends >:v \nI aint gonna fight some hoe who think they can be a legend being a pussie whipped bitch gotta fight me with dat 1v1 not 2v1 \nand I know when to be a rooster not a chicken like a rooster im bouta put up some cockadoodle doo on em not some chicken shit also its not about understanding if your a bad player or not we all can improve sometime we get outbested but ya know what I say fuck em later onwards when you fight em again hoe just got lucky or played dat pussieass champ >:^)\nthat's good at running away from a fight","replies":[{"poster":"Solicitude","date":"2018-06-24T18:34:11.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apparently you didnt read what i said. You are a yasuo main, he was playing yasuo for the first time. And the right thing to do when you play a champion for the first time is to play cautiously and defensive, especially in a mirror match-up. In this game you both had an advantage. He is a more skilled player, you main the champion you played. You opted to play aggressively, you got punished. He opted to play defensively and wait for gank.\n\n######But, in all honesty, i dont expect you to understand anything.
