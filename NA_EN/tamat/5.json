C'mon man, the volume is what makes changes happen.  EVERYTHING will get lost in a megathread.\n\nEdit:  I should make clear, constructive Riot bashing.  People do not like the Boards, and honestly, it's a lot more visible seeing all those titles all over the place rather than a system of Boards free of any dissenting opinion, with one singular Megathread.  Poor form, imo.\n\nEdit 2:  Since I'm here, I should offer my own opinion on what needs fixing on the boards.  Well, to start things off, you need a color scheme that isn't freaking awful.  It just straight kills my eyes.  Second, you guys need a search function that is decently functional.  Third, the reason old GD was great was because it ended up being the 'Jita' system of Riot's forums, if you understand my analogy.  GD was where virtually anything goes, it was where the entire community came to blow off steam, talk about League or anything else, and most importantly, interact with Rioters.  \n\nYour new GD on the boards is basically being turned into the old 'Off-Topic' forum.  When you get it 'stabilized' (as much as it'll be), I'd bet my bottom dollar that it will not be a place that Rioter's frequent to interact with the community, instead choosing many of the other Boards in the system, undoubtedly one of which will end up being the \"new\" GD, simply due to community acceptance, and using the sub-par Reddit nested discussion model that happens to be reviled by a large chunk of the community, including myself.  That, in a nutshell, is why I hate the new Boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Michicha","date":"2014-10-07T22:12:43.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"To be fair, no Rioter was going to search for feedback in hundreds of threads that said \"OMG RITO I HATE NEW BOARDS!\" which doesn't help if you don't give reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaphas","date":"2014-10-07T22:14:55.187+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, but honestly, it's not really complicated feedback to understand.

Whether that was to promote tournaments/streams, ask questions, provide content, or just have a conversation about the gameplay.\n\nNow since the boards have come into play, I see the Maps & Modes section being overrun by Summoner's Rift content because the majority of players play that mode.

Reddit is a news-sharing site, this is a discussion site. I appreciate that you've brought that distinction into the system mechanics.\n\n# Colors\nI'm starting to see what people mean about the colors being hard to read. Perhaps a serifed font would help? Or a tweak to the contrast? Or just a larger default font size?\n\n# Thread Icons\nI think it's cool that threads have thumbnail icons.\n\n# GD and Reports\nI'm going to draw some hate for this, but GD really had become a cesspool. I'd like to see an expansion of the Report options. I'm not sure what to do with the standard \"DAE feminism = sexism\" and other \"trash\" threads. What about an off-topic discussion board? I feel like GD should at least stick to LoL discussion. It seems like a lot of GDers would be happier with a designated off-topic thread where they can spam memes and talk about non-LoL things.\n\n# Red Tracker\nThe Red Tracker could use an upgrade. There should be some way to prevent the system from completely breaking when a well-meaning Red cheerfully posts many, many times in rapid succession. That's great: I'm all for community interaction. But the current system makes it awkward, because such post-sprees completely flood out the Tracker.\n\n# UI Glitches\nMy main gripe is that sometimes the UI seems to behave very oddly when it comes to displaying \"new comments\". For example, if I click on the tab saying (e.g.) \"5 new\", it'll show me those 5 new comments, but if I then click on \"Permalink\" (so that I can see where the new comment is in the larger context of the discussion) it seems to get confused.\n\nAll in all, I like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuuiko","date":"2014-10-07T22:17:34.999+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"i want to post on my level 5 smurfs again, and banning ppl in-game for posting on the forums is retarded.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2014-10-08T00:13:01.593+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i want to post on my level 5 smurfs again, and banning ppl in-game for posting on the forums is retarded.\n\nWait people actually get banned in game for posts on the fourms...

I'm sure a bunch of those things you already know, but I'll try to list as many things as I can think of that could make this place better. Some of these might be problems specific to the GD Boards section, I'll try to say that for any of the problems that are.\n\n1. Slow loading times + no lightweight/mobile version of the site. There's a ton of features and widgets and things that load up every time you open a page on this site. While they're all really cool, when they all add up it ends up taking a while to load pages, much longer than just a regular forum would, or even reddit. I liked viewing the forums on my phone a lot, and I'll probably be looking at Boards a lot too, but my poor phone has trouble loading everything and the format doesn't work all that well for it. A lot of the widgets, like the one that shows a mini version of people's profiles when you hover over their names, are pretty cool, but you have to load up to 50(!!!) of them at a time each time you open up a page here. Same for thread/post voting and a bunch of other features the site has. I could easily go without some of these to be able to view the forums on my phone without it lagging to death (and some, like the profile hover I just mentioned don't even work on my phone anyway). Having a mobile option would make this place like, 100x better for me. On to of that, if there's any way to just improve load times in general, or just get the important parts (like everyone's posts) to load sooner it'd make Boards feel way nicer to use.\n\n2. Quoting currently is just bad, there's not really a nice way of putting it. I can't see who the quote is from, nested quotes just flat out don't work properly at all, and there's no feature like the old forums had that lets you click a button at the top of the quote to take you directly to the comment where that quote comes from. Those 3 things all need to be improved on really badly.\n\n3. Just a few random small features that I don't think need their own huge bullet point for. Some of these are incorporated into FEK already or possibly will be later, but having them put in by default is always better than forcing people to use a 3rd party addon\n\n * Highlighting the threads you made when you're looking at the thread list\n * Marking updates as read in the MyUpdates page automatically if you end up viewing the post it's talking about without using the updates page to get to it\n * Making the (NEW) button take you to the first unseen post in the thread instead of to the last page. This is probably only an issue in chronological view I'm guessing.\n * If any of your threads/posts gets moderated/removed, show the contents of that thread/post in the notification it gives you.\n * Notification saying that a thread or post you reported was removed. Just simple positive reinforcement to encourage people to use the report button when appropriate.\n * Hotkeys for writing posts\n\n4. I think there should be a feature to let you tag threads you think are interesting and give you updates in the myupdates page whenever someone posts in them. Not really much else to add since it's a fairly simple idea, but I think it'd be really useful.\n\n5. Currently, badges are only recorded from Season 2 and earlier. As an example, a call to the Boards API for [Doubelift](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/api/users/NA/Doublelift?include_profile=true) only returns his Season 1 and 2 badges, but not the one from Season 3. If it helps you fix this faster, badges seem to work differently (and better) for Rioters ([Example](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/api/users/NA/Tamat?include_profile=true))\n\n6.

Apparently according to the preview thing, I can't continue my list without it starting back over at number 1? WTF???

I think more layout customization in general would be nice. Having options to do things like change the number of posts per page in chronological view, changing the amount of threads shown at once in the thread listing, etc.\n12. This one is GD specific, but you shouldn't be able to vote on a thread until after you've already clicked on it. There's no reason to have an option to vote on threads without having even read them first. I'm saying this is GD specific but this is possibly something you might want to consider for the other sections too, since voting there without reading can allow low effort but quick to look at content to get voted up higher than it should.\n13. Again related to GD and voting, but I think it would be cool to see a test period where voting on that section is taken out altogether. I know a lot of people are used to it, but when you think about it it's actually a totally pointless feature in that section. Voting doesn't affect visibility of the posts at all there, and before where downvotes were used to close threads or hide unwanted posts from view, there's now a report button that handles those functions better. Removing voting now could potentially cut back on some unwanted circlejerking type behaviors and improve overall quality of content, and you don't lose any functionality in doing so.\n14. Small change: Removing deleted posts entirely instead of having the little box that says someone posted and then deleted it.\n15. This is for GD only: Potentially adding a \"Bump\" button that brings a topic back up to the top without having to just post \"bump\" in it, but you can only use it maybe 1-3 times a day.

I will copy-paste the discussion here.\n\n>There isn't a board for clan and team recruitment. This leaves communities trying to recruit in the dust. Could you make a board for this and set it up like you did the GD forum where chronological/last post is always at the top? Otherwise you will have communities making new posts every day when theirs aren't shown. Thanks.\n\nResponse from Tamat\n\n>We've been holding off creating this until the demands is really high. For now you can post recruitment stuff in Misc. We'll be watching, and if there's a lot of recruitment discussions created, we'll go ahead and create a board for it.\n\nMy Reply(ies)\n\n>I think this might be a case of which comes first. I think with the default sorting being upvotes or whatever you wish to call it will make recruitment posts disappear, resulting in people reposting them every day at least to get some visibility. So the question is, if the current sorting discourages posting threads like that because of the reason I stated, then you will end up not seeing many recruitment posts, making it appear as though the need is low, when in reality the people using it are just aware of the difficulties and don't bother. I think it might be better to make the board, see how much use it gets after a period of time, then remove it if you feel it is underutilized. This way you can see the real use it gets because there won't be anyone discouraged by the new sorting methods. (I realize you can change sort order, but I don't think many people will do that in Misc. or whatever simply in hopes that recruitment posts will be on top. Most users leave things as they are default). I think putting the onus of board creation on users who may think the board is going to be made when the designers have all the cards when it comes to board creation and removal is slightly unfair.\n\n>I don't understand how the forum's previous use is not enough to warrant its creation. Still waiting on that.\n\n\nUnrelated note:\n\n>On an unrelated note, is there going to be some sorting, alphabetical or otherwise, of the board navigation list? It's really poking at my OCD-ness. Also, GD is pretty non-descript for people who aren't typically members of the GD community, maybe rename to General Discussion? :P\n\nHere is hoping it gets some more visibility.\n\nOn another note, it would be nice if the board were more integrated with the site as the old forum was. Right now this feels like a sub-site like LoL ESports, not really an embodiment of the community. I will also echo concerns about the rating system. The inherent issue with the rating system resulting in the threads that appear and those that don't is that it is very easy for people who dislike something to downvote a thread into oblivion without real reasons. There will be far to many threads for Riot to check if this is the case, so good discussion still has a huge chances of being smashed down to the bottom from downvotes regardless of whether the thread has good merit. Instead of bumping pushing it up, and downvoting the people who talk crap, you now has a system that rewards toxic downvoting and punishes people who either don't vote, or try to had a legitimate conversation. I have heard this said in many other threads and I am not sure what the solution from Riot is. I am 100% positive this HAD to be talked anout during board development and there must be a reason why this is the prefered method. I understand working with vBulletin was becoming difficult, but there is a reason you opted to make a reddit-style board instead of designing traditional style forums.\n\n{{champion:74}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnonTwo","date":"2014-10-07T23:10:09.328+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel that the moderation thread was poorly handled.

But to then ban people (and further yet, from the game?) for *risque to sexually suggestive content*?

In order to edit this comment into the post, I had to hit \"show more\" three times.  How many people are going to do that?\n\nTechnical stuff\n\n* I find the new color scheme causes eyestrain when reading.  Need more contrast between text and background.  YMMV.\n* Completely useless on any mobile device.  Really needs to be full screen on a high resolution monitor to display any content, and death by indentation is an issue.\n* Search feature flat out doesn't work.  I can know the exact thread name and it still won't spit out the thread I want.\n* No way to save your place in a big long discussion for later reading.  I used to know I was on page 12 of this thread, then go read more later.  Show more button is capricious and really doesn't work well with back button.\n* The new markup has lots of potential, but it's buggy and brittle.  For example, try splitting up a numbered list and replying to each element.  Find that the numbers all magically become 1s.\n* The \"My updates\" -> \"All\" button doesn't work for me.  It kicks me to the http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/ rather than showing me my previous posts.  When combined with the way the unread updates work, it's easy to lose the list of posts with replies I might be interested in.\n* Quotes no longer report who is quoted.  Confusing in red tracker, chonological view, or new view.\n\nSocial stuff\n\n* New threads seem to die at an alarming rate.  It feels like a small slice of the community is even seeing the new posts, and one downvote looks like doom.\n* Forum interactions feel less personal.  I suspect a lot of this is about the FEK avatars, but at least some of it comes from the polished, smooth look and feel.\n* New style not amenable to large discussions with many people, like say the discussion about [voice chat](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4639545) we had a few months back.  Discussion becomes fragmented very quickly, and it's hard to follow more than one thread.  Spamming show more constantly is tiresome.\n\nModeration stuff\n\n* Mods seem inexperienced with launch days.  Mod leaders do too.  Feels like many decisions are being made off the cuff, rather than feeling planned.\n* Mods are applying vague policy inconsistently.  This is probably more about the vague policy than the mods themselves.\n* Specific to GD, several posters with a long history of constructive and helpful posting, like IonCannonKarthus and Evangele, have had run-ins with mods closing their threads.\n* Edit2: When mods moderate things, they aren't explaining things.  For example, I just posted a thread to what I guessed was the most appropriate forum for it.  It got deleted by mods and said mod didn't tell me where to put it.  Am I supposed to just keep guessing until the post isn't deleted?

Why not try... instead of removing content for those who aren't behaving nicely... but limiting posting for a bit longer so they have a chance to cool themselves off? Or better yet... get in touch with Lyte... and let them do an investigation and see if their behavior on the forums reflects their behavior in game... and THEN punish them based on what you guys find out.\n> \n> Also... on the subject of being nice... people like to joke around a LOT on GD. Not every mean thing is being said in a negative connotation. Hell, only time I ever mean it is when it comes to people who work for Riot who ignore really good criticism of policies made by Riot... and that's because it keeps happening time and time again.

And while the experience on ipad is quite good, trying to use boards on the galaxy is kinda painfull. I noticed 2 main problems with this.\n\n1) resources needed to load the site/navigate\n2) look and feel due to dark tone of site\n\nThese problems are not noticable when Iam browsing from normal sized screen, but when using mobile phone, it becames a pain in some situations. I cover these in details here:\n\n1) Resources needed to load the site/navigate\n\nEspecially when in places with low quality of internet connection, there is a huge difference between how the old forums loaded and how boards are loading (for example travelling in subway. Before I could load a discussion page in station and read it untill next station). I guess reasons for this can be found in:\n\n* More complicated style\n* Usage of javascript or similar with loading additional resources (calling web services)\n* Increase in loading of resources at all times (loading images etc)\n* Bad design of boards or wrong implementation\n\n\nOn the other hand if we have a look on what I expect from browsing on mobile phone, I think we can get rid of most of additional stuff. I would be just happy with displaying discussions. In the end I need rather simple query from database or from appserver (dont know whats behind). Loading of other stuff is totally not needed for me.\n\n2) Look and feel with dark tone of site\n\nThis gets painfull due to various light conditions. Mostly when in public, for example walking etc.\n\nDo I need the black style of the boards to enjoy them? Totally not! Even when reading epubs I really preffer other colour schemes. But I really think this is preferential and depend on a subjective opinion.\n\n**Proposed sollution**\n\nHow about you provide a mobile version of the boards? As it is more of simplification of the current project, the costs should not be as high. Deploying them on subdomain with different style after initial request and deciding if the device is mobile or standard... Focus of the development should be increase of performance, mobile adjustment due to behaviour patterns (I guess you track it) and maybe a way to switch between 2-3 colour schemes.\n\nIt could take like 2-3 developers/stylist, 2 testers, some time of deployment and QA and maybe one project manager and in 2-3 weeks you can have a prototype maybe even with localisation. Testing via community to lower the cost comes to my mind.\n\nI really hope you can make this more comfortable place for mobile users.\n\nKind regards\n\nVzteklan","replies":[]},{"poster":"yellowbricks","date":"2014-10-08T19:42:10.340+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the part where mods are closing feedback in the designated feedback forum so they can just pile it all in this \"Suggestion box leading to the boiler room\" thread.
