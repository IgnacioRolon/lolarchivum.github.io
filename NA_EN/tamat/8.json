Currently every time I get cut off (see obvious rule breaking posts/threads) I think 'Boy I wish we had a police force'. \n\nWhich I guess is maybe somewhat testable. You could do a survey and ask forum users how often you think the forums are moderated. Because the two comments I always see, are \"The forums aren't moderated\" or \"The mods ban you for literally nothing\". The later being people very likely got banned for obvious rule violations, obviously.

I've seen people who think there are no moderators, or only spotty moderation.\n\nThat the moderation staff is hidden has led to people assuming that a non-moderator Red who was currently active on the forum had closed a thread. Compounding the confusion is the ability for the community to close a thread with downvotes, which has resulted in people not knowing whether a thread was closed by Riot or the players.\n\nYou guys can do better. Moderation shouldn't be obtrusive, but at the same time there should be information available to those who care to know.\n\n\nI must also say, I find the police analogy kind of disturbing. Invisible moderation sounds more like a police state where the police are discreetly watching on you, and if you screw up they quietly haul you away.\n\nSome of the best moderated boards I've seen have mods as active participants and posters. The community is comfortable with them because they know they're also just regular people who enjoy the same stuff they do, but also know that there is somebody ready to defend the boards against undesirable posting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The MechE","date":"2014-05-27T05:01:05.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tamat, I'm really upset.

People on forums come from an incredibly large amount of different backgrounds, societies and age groups with their own conversational lines. i.e. a stereotypical teenager starting high school will think shouting profanities and possibly the occasional racist comment is funny and not malicious, but naturally this won't be a good thing to have. While I'm not one for  making an example out of someone wouldn't it make sense to give the average user the option of seeing what *actions* cause what response?\n\nWhere I'm going with this is, yes, I don't think moderation should be **actively advertised** or we would develop a police state mentality and stifle open voice, as you said. But I do think if someone chooses to look for either malicious content or specifically moderation activity (maybe a separate tracker? Just an idea) then they won't develop a \"they're after me\" way of thinking. Names and other undesirable pictures/videos can be blacked out in this hypothetical \"Mod Tracker\" post as well, as long as the bannable actions are shown.\n\nTo use your example of a police officer, it would be like going and watching an episode of Cops, not only would it show that mods are out there doing they're job, it would also reinforce the actions that were taken down as something that shouldn't be done. Yes, downvoting in the CB's current iteration does this to a point, but I think we can all agree there are some posts, comments and other actions that shouldn't be allowed time or even a place at the bottom and moderator action should be taken.\n\nOf course there are cons to this idea as there is for any system, like increased scrutiny/pressure to mod actions and possible specific mod heckling, which could negatively affect Mod-user relationships if not handled correctly among other possible issues, but I think they're workable.\n---\n\nTl;dr (imho) moderator action should be **available** to be publicly seen but not **advertised**.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamat","date":"2014-05-14T22:54:07.830+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Tl;dr (imho) moderator action should be **available** to be publicly seen but not **advertised**.\n\nI have a hard time understanding the value that something like this would bring the average user.

Don't get too hung up on my specific idea of a tracker and such, that's just me brainstorming out loud without much consideration.\n\nWhat it really boils down to, I'd rather have mods I know and trust and *see* than invisible mods who's actions I may only see once in a blue moon. The results can be exactly the same in both approaches, but the former will let me rest at ease more because I know \"Rioter X will come to take this down\" in a thread that deserves intervention instead of thinking \"it will hopefully disappear soon\". \n\nTrust is established off of previous actions I've seen (public disclosure of thread closures and other mod actions). If I see a Rioter's name behind an action I can put a name behind my expectations of a mod and start building a trust in that person and other mods to repeat that same action.\n\nInvisible mods.... even if they're just as effective, I can't trust them. Was the invisible action taken by a Mod or did OP just delete it? Was this the same Mod who closed 'Y' thread last week or was it someone else? Was 'Y' thread deleted for the racism or for the naming and shaming? or both? Behind the awful tone and words choice OP made a good point, was it deleted because it portrayed Riot in a bad light? Invisible actions leave too many questions for anyone outside the offender<-->Mod relationship. And that doubt, however slight, impedes the ability to trust 'the people behind the curtain'.\n\ntl;dr I'd rather **trust an individual** than **have blind faith in a group**.\n\nP.S.

But anyone who visited a horrible thread and supported it will usually come back to it eventually, and a small notice is stamped on the OP saying \"this thread was deleted for x reasons\" then these supporters, along with anyone just as much against the thread, will see mod action was taken and may have second thoughts on repeating the behavior.

There's some controversy surrounding the use of the word \"rape\", especially in competitive gaming communities, and some people take issue with words like \"gypped\" or \"fag\" or \"gimp\". Listing every problematic word and the ways in which it can or can't be used would be neither easy to do nor especially effective.

Again, going back to the cop analogy, I don't need to know every last verdict and how every case turns out. I just want to pass some guy that got pulled over now and then, so I know that the person that cut me off and ran a red light I was going to stop at, isn't just the way things are around here.\n\nBringing that back to forum moderation, I don't need (or really have any strong desire) to know what action the mod took against the specific user. I just want the mod to post \"alright guys, this thread has turned into person attack and isn't discussing balance anymore, I'm closing it\". That way I know the mods care about thread quality, and I know that everyone else knows that personal attacks get threads closed.\n\nIn a perfect world simply having a clear list of rules would work, but the world isn't perfect, and the internet is less perfect than that. And in fact, even now people post and do things that are CLEARLY against the rules (porn, racism, etc) and other people don't even blink, because they think that is just how it is here. Visibility is about assuring Joe Q Forumgoer that those things really are against the rules, and the rules really are enforced.\n\nEdit; Again, just to be clear. I don't think people want a compendium of moderator actions they can thumb through. I think they just want a quick explanation of what rule was broken (even if it was obvious) in the thread in question. To me that doesn't sound like a lot of extra work, but maybe I've got a bad frame of reference, since I clearly make long winded posts and I've got no idea how involved the back end of forum moderation is. As for the return on the time/effort investment, its an intangible. It comes back in the forum of generic board health/mentality.

IP gains? Very little communication, lots of distrust. Stealth rework? Long periods of silence, highly upset community. Magma Chamber? Delayed announcements and dialogue, still a sore spot for many. Most of the instances in which Riot chooses *not* to be transparent or communicative have weakened and stressed the relationship between the company and the players, which is particularly distressing when so much of the company is made up *of* players.\n\nYou do have a point that we, as posters and players, won't actually get a ton of direct value from seeing why xXJoeXJaneXx had a post deleted.

No post, however popular, will be visible after a few days. That's plenty of time to circulate a breaking news article or an interesting link, but not enough time for a meaningful discussion.\n\n2. Reddit only considers upvotes/downvotes, not posts, when determining visibility. I think threads with active discussion should be more visible. \"Bumps\" can be regulated by, e.g., only providing a visibility boost once per user per day.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jean Never Wins","date":"2014-05-20T22:20:28.870+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel leddit is a move to help reds connect with players. however that's not always what we want.\n\nsure you are a bunch of funny nice people, but we also want to make friends with other regular players like ourselves.\n\nGD lets us recognize each other, with an avatar [from FEK] and image tools [some from fek] to joke around with each other.\n\nsure your content might be great, but if we don't get to create some for each other with the tools introduced you are going to see your community you are trying to reach leave\n\nas for craziness, that's elf explanatory.

I know a lot of the people there, feels like a real community. The craziness is what makes GD a unique place. Why should content be of high quality? Sometimes I just want random off-topic shitposting. I'm not very good at offering insight I guess, but when everything is so cleanly divided like with this format I feel like part of the interaction is lost. Flat view at the same time makes keeping track of conversations annoying, since people will refer to a post but you can't see the exact thing they're referring to without clicking, which I suppose defeats the purpose, but it just looks like a mess of random posts. That's the best way I can put it, maybe I'm being an idiot, but those are my feelings...also the whole custom fek avatars (which I set to the largest size setting) is nice, but that's more a bonus than anything...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Splendid Cake","date":"2014-05-20T22:04:09.747+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw here's a whole thread on the subject: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4535826","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pajamasalad","date":"2014-05-20T18:16:39.266+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a fun, chaotic place to have discussions and make friends with like-minded players. Having a dedicated \"le maymays and le games xD\" section doesn't work as well because half the fun is the spontaneity in the middle of serious League discussion. Say what you will about it not producing \"awesome content\" (whatever the hell that means, since you guys never read the player concepts and stuff on their forums), but it breeds a fun, albeit somewhat trolly and toxic, community. Have you seen how active the GD chatroom and customs are? And it's really not even confined to those, there are plenty of other subgroups in and out of game that formed due to GD's chaos.\n\n\nIt's a bit lame to say, but it really has developed its own culture too. As much as you guys hate that, we love it so of course we feel strongly about it. There are a bunch of other games that have an active forum community like GD, where, like GD, lots of people have as much fun posting there as they do playing the game itself. Forums are endgame. It's just that GD ended up with a scope as large as Misc., /b/, old WoW GD etc. and then developed its own character from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zastie","date":"2014-05-20T22:37:43.864+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:6}} to be kidding me.\n\nGD has spoken out about the reasons they like GD, and the reasons they hate the CB. In the thread that you popped into(which is now a week old..) you started discussing stuff with us on GD for once, which was great, but sadly you, once again, left in favor of having the discussion(which, BTW, is *about* GD) on CB. We've told you time and time again, but honestly Tamat, you just act like you're not even reading anything we say. In said thread I left a very lengthy response for you, in hopes that you would listen, but you didn't and left the thread because you are seemingly obsessed with CB. Any time we do get a response from Riot about GD, they're always shoving CB in our faces like a channel with only infomercials.\n\n\"Can you help me understand why you feel so strongly about having a GD?\"\n\nCan you help me understand why you feel so strongly about flat-out ignoring us?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
