The first reason to keep playing, to keep trying to improve is because you enjoy playing the game, because you want to learn new champions, because you have friends that you enjoy playing with. If you're somebody who finds the game fun **and** then you're somebody who finds competition fun, playing ranked and striving for Silver, Gold, Plat, Diamond, Master, Challenger--that starts as an intrinsic goal, Riot has added some extrinsic goals (victorious skins, banners, badges, load screen boarders, ward skins, icons) but a real competitive nature needs to start from you and something you enjoy when it comes to a game.\n\nObviously there was no way you were going to get out of Bronze 5 because you only wanted out of Bronze for the next reward. If all you wanted was that reward you're often going to talk yourself out of that purpose unless that reward satisfies a basic human need or a very important secondary human need. Riot Games isn't going to give you food and shelter, they aren't going to give their whole userbase money, and practically anything else is a reward that if it's a long term task/goal (as a season lasts almost a year) is not really going to satisfy an extrinsically motivated person. \n\nThere are still staggered rewards, obviously the lowest tier of rewards (bronze) isn't going to get a huge reward (they got summoner icons) because anybody can get into bronze by going Nami jungle 10 games in a row and 1v1ing baron every game until you go 0/39/2. Maybe Silver doesn't have a huge reward but they still have more rewards than Bronze and to put it this way you don't hit the 50th percentile until like Silver 3. SIlver 5 (which still gets Silver rewards) is still a pretty low skill level in comparison to the 'average' of ranked players.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-12-03T21:36:14.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"This is a big post. \n\nResponse to first paragraph: Playing the game for fun is not the same as playing the game to win. You don't climb just from randomly playing 100 games; if you do that, you might be lucky to go up a division. You climb by going on winning streaks, and that takes either the kind of luck you only experience once every 100 games or playing a champion that can carry pretty much any game. Then you need to actually carry every game. That's not fun. That's work. I happen to *like* playing Soraka and Miss Fortune, even if I can't carry with them. \n\nNext Paragraph: What does that have to do with anything? The rewards, and simply being better than other people, are the only reason people climb. O.o \n\nThird Paragraph: No, they aren't \"staggered\", because the population ratio to rewards is off. There are around 1.6 million people that play NA; these numbers are approximate. See next post.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-12-03T22:07:08.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was 10/3 with Raka this week (until I got into promos and had 3 AFKs in a row) now I'm like 11/5, so sad. You can carry as pretty much any champion in B5 (well I'm in B1 but still).\n\nYes and no, some people find competitive play to be fun. You didn't get to level 30 without playing the game for fun, but I'm sure you also played the game to win games. You didn't just lose 10 games in a row and be like 'lol that's okay that was super fun' you were playing A) for fun and B) for win. If you're playing a game for fun then a game can fit both of those circumstances, if you're not playing for fun then it can't.\n\nas for the next paragraph it has a lot to do with **everything**. The reason you didn't get strive for Silver, no matter what you claim, is because you weren't intrinsically motivated to get there. Anybody who aims to climb a ladder like that needs to be the kind of person who is motivated *by themselves* and not by outer influences to actually do well. A reward only motivates somebody to try harder if it is considered to be a *simple task* like offering a child $5 to do the dishes will get them to do the dishes. A reward will not **fully** motivate a person to try harder for a task that is considered a *complex task* as climbing the ranks of LoL is. Going from Bronze to Silver is a huge time commitment that requires knowledge of in multiple areas. As such **it doesn't matter what League of Legends was offering a person to get go from B5-S5 because you aren't going to be any more likely to get there**. Aka the reason you didn't get to Silver, or even try to get to Silver, was because you weren't motivated yourself to get to Silver, you were looking for some sort of reward from Riot to get to Silver. That only works in very high Elo where they are competing for money and money helps people satisfy their basic needs for living.\n\n>  We should get something that feels worthwhile for playing, and the people that succeed should get increasingly more worthwhile rewards....This is something I actively felt, in Bronze V. There was no way I was going to get all the way to silver for the next reward, so why bother?\n\nThat's what that paragraph was responding to, when you mentioned getting to Silver you said you weren't going to make it **to the next reward** and therefore you had **no reason** to try. I was also responding to this:\n\n> if I'm not getting a reward, what's the point of working to get better?\n\nbecause like I've said in the longterm (aka a year long season) a **reward** won't motivate people who are motivated for the reward. Only people who want to get better and are playing for reasons inside themselves are going to get better.

This is where the 50% win rate comes in. Not sacrificing fun for the sake of winning while also trying to win. \n\nAnyway, I  see what you're saying now.

You're saying that it takes 100 games to move up a bit. I thought the way you did for a while. I was in B4 in season 3 and thought I was good enough to be in silver. Except I realized that the reason I was only barely moving up was because I wasn't really examining my play and seeing where I made mistakes. \n\nThis season I played a bunch and I really improved quite a bit. Season 4 I started in B5 with 0 LP. It took me 115 games to get to S5. I noticed a lot of differences with my playstyle. Before I lost my lane about 30% of the time went even 40% and won my lane 30% (rough guess) and said, see I'm not feeding or anything, I'm doing better than those guys. Really though that just meant I was about even, because if you assume everyone in the same rank is doing the same, that means 1-2 teammates should be losing lane every game. This season though I won lane 70% (when playing mid, stats vary for other lanes, but fairly good) went even 25% and lost 5%. I moved up pretty quickly and was able to hit S5 before the end of the season. It's about getting consistency, understanding what your mistakes are so you have more A games.\n\nI hope this means something to you and others working through it.
