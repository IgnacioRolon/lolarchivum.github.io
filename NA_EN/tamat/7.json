This is the thread for you to give us feedback. Depending on what everyone thinks, we might do this more often, and with more production value. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Cadenza Stellare","date":"2014-06-20T04:36:40.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this idea! It seems like a really innovative use of the reddit style tech of the Community site. Personally, I love feeling like I can have an input on cool and fun things like this and the Lunar Revel champion icons contest, and more \"player participation\" stuff like this will go a long way to drawing positive attention towards the Community discussions. It drew me here, at least!\n\n{{champion:131}} <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-06-20T01:20:08.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the concept, think the execution might be a little bit better if it included a poll. That would probably mean that polls had to be designed so a user could change their input though, and I'm not sure if you guys are prepared to change that or even want to. Overall though, I definitely like it, and hopefully it'll take off. Maybe tweet it out or put it on Reddit? Sometimes things slip through here on CB and I don't want this to be one of those posts >_<\n\n**Edit:** Oh, you guys pinned it, that could also help, now I look a bit stupid haha","replies":[{"poster":"Tamat","date":"2014-06-20T02:51:29.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to do a poll, but the way the tech is setup right now doesn't let you change your vote.

That being said, it needs a bit of work in execution. Not a bad thing, per say, but these are just my views on it:\n\n**1.)** Add a fourth option (Grey Card) just for this week. Maybe make it an interview with, say, a content creator from Youtube (Dunkey, for example) to learn a bit about them. Why you ask? So that next week it'll be back to three. The Doors of Fate would constantly rotate, blocking off the previous option from last week.\n\nSo let's say the famous Rioter got picked for the door. Next vote, the \"Famous rioter\" isn't up for voting. Instead it's content maker/pro player/Riot team. This way, we'll always have a new and varied discussion as well as blocking off the possible fear of picking the exact same option over-and-over.\n\n\n**2.)** Perhaps give us 3 options for the selected door. Again, let's say famous rioter got picked. Now we can vote between IronStylus, Phreak and Morello. A far, FAR shorter time span is allowed but you can at least have options. It'd prevent people from going \"omg I can't wait to have phreak on the rioter famous spotlight\" and instead they get to talk to Rivington or Morello or just someone they didn't want. Asides this would also help in case of cancellations or random acts of god that prevent these things from happening.\n\n\n**3.)** Specialize. What do I mean by that? Let's say it's halloween. The Door of Fate for October/Halloween would be three unique options: An interview with a League cosplayer (Halloween Dressup), Sharing and talking skin ideas for next year's harrowing with the skin team (Directly related to Halloween) or maybe even some spooky choose-your-own adventure or something of the like. The main goal is to make the doors of fate, like TF himself, constantly shifting sides and always offering up some new gamble that you won't be able to bet on until the next century.\n\nJust some ideas but I'm trying to offer diversity and expanding the idea of DoF, regardless of how new it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frayace","date":"2014-06-20T08:04:22.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea.

Like, 'a well known rioter' and 'a team of rioters' are going to be close enough in what they can talk about that it doesn't really matter (like, whether it's 'the relaunch team' or 'IronStylus' they're gonna give the same sort of answers to the same sort of question). I couldn't care any less about pro play, so that's not even an option for me (what the hell kind of question would you ask, 'what's it like being better than most people that play this game?')","replies":[]}]}
