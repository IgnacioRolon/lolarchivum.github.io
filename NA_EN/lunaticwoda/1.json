Seemed be a split in my game unless opposing team was trolling. So goes like this we get to champ select I am 4th pick I ask for support someone asked for top and mid. Being the 4th pick 3/4 pick at the same time. As i said support and no one said anything else I grabbed my champ (leona) and lock it down. The 3rd pick guy who hasn&#039;t said a word at this point grabs braum and debates how hes support (he hasn&#039;t locked in at this point) so he tries to argue hes support and waits down the 20 seconds or so till the game locks him in.\r\n\r\nNow whos at wrong the auto lock that was called and not objected?\r\nor the guy who deliberately ruins the team comp forcing a leo into a jungle?\r\n\r\nPS\r\nObviously we got shamed and the braum was trash to boot\r\n\r\nPPS\r\nIm sure someone will ask, why not dodge? Only had 5LP so didnt care to an extent..","replies":[]}
