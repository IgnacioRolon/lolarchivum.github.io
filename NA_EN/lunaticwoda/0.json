Utter lie.\n\nIn comparison to season one and two.\nIn the first two seasons supports got much less in resources. The role was played by going through laning to get a gold per second item or two (philosopher stone and heart of gold.) Both gave weak stats.\nSupports would get boots of mobility, and then their build was done.\nYou would then spend all of your money on wards and oracles lens(400g for 3mins or until death.) The equivalent to sweeping lens but active all the time. \n\nYou would spend almost your entire time warding, and clearing wards.\n\nBecause the game had less anti snowball mechanics, you could end up 6 levels behind people in game. \n\nWith this small amount of insight, one should know that it would be much harder for someone to have any control over teamfights, and therefore the game was almost impossible to carry.\n\n\nSupports now get more gold, free wards, never fall more than 4 levels behind, and have been buffed at the end of season 3/ beginning of season 4 to scale better with the items they did get (Janna's recent ult ap scaling was put was needed, that was a buff from that time. Ap lulu mid/top became common a short while after this. etc.)\n\nNow I would love to hear your perspective as to how it is not harder to carry in S1-S2 as support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VesperNadal","date":"2015-09-15T07:36:49.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lyless,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=ZVBV0N6J,comment-id=000200000001000000000001,timestamp=2015-09-15T07:28:33.995+0000)\n>\n> the part where you say it's easier to climb now. Utter lie.\n\n\nIn a way it is easier. As a support I keep track of jungle timers on dragon or baron or red and blue buffs. 2 seasons ago there was no dragon buff tracker.\n2 seasons ago also didn't have these fancy support starter items we have now. Before people would start with a fairy charm, 2 wards and a bunch of potions. Gold generation on supports was super low and a support almost never got more than 2-3 completed items per game. There were no trinkets (free wards) either.\n2 seasons ago there was also the assassin meta. You want to make a support feel useless? Get someone who can instagib their carries faster than the supports can peel for them. When Kassadin and LeBlanc were strong there was zero counter.\nThe only thing that is harder now as the support is that there is now a ward cap. No champion can have more than 3 wards placed at one time. In season 3 the support was the primary (and sometimes only) warder on the team and could place as many wards as they could carry with them.\n\nSo yeah, the game is indeed easier to carry through the support role.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2015-09-15T07:26:12.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tseihei,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=ZVBV0N6J,comment-id=00020000000100000000,timestamp=2015-09-15T07:22:56.477+0000)\n>\n> Could you please elaborate as to what portion of my original statement isn't true?\n\nLyless, This is a chance at a discussion.

Try other roles but keep your \"main\" support. once you get to mid silver it gets better.
