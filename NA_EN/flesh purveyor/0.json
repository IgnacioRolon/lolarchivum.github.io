Tower defense may be lackluster at the moment but it doesn't really detract from my immediate interactions in the game. I may lose because my nexus towers are squishy as hell but I wouldn't blame them solely because there were certainly mistakes that led to the point where my nexus is being threatened to begin with.\nHowever, this bug and potential consequences in teamfights lead to more immediate outcomes and I can directly feel its impact after it has occurred. I don't know how to properly explain this but when you have more control over a situation, it is more frustrating to have a bug occur as opposed to when everything is already out of your control (i.e. enemy has 20k gold lead and is pushing in on your nexus).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Visigoth","date":"2014-12-07T08:39:55.305+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOLY SH*T HOW DID XIN ZHAO JUST TAKE ALL OF HIS HEALTH AT ONCE- oh wait, nevermind, visual bugs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-12-06T18:37:39.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"And then you stop and think for a minute, and it turns out, it isnt a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Flesh Purveyor","date":"2014-12-06T18:50:48.443+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"How is this not a bug? If there is an animation of the health bar dropping, that should imply to you that someone has taken a certain amount of damage at that instant and precisely at that instant. If I were to use Veigar's ult on someone for half their health, I want to see this animation right in front of me. Conversely, I don't want to see someone's health bar drop for an equal amount instantaneously when I pan my camera over them as a consequence of autoattack trading that they may have done over a period of 3 minutes. This bug may key off to me that a teammate has used an ability such as Veigar's ultimate while in reality they may still have it, or mislead me to think that my teammates have already hard committed to taking out a target. There is no reason that this should be in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2014-12-07T12:53:08.168+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not a bug, it's a feature.
