Because it's Windows!- and I think that's what's causing this. Two games in a row now I've locked in my character, I get to the screen where it shows my team and the Doom Bots connecting, and then a window pops up:\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends.exe - Fatal Application Exit\r\n( i ) memory.c - !!sBadReadPtr(InPtr, InSize)\r\n\r\nHitting 'OK' takes me to the 'disconnected from the game' screen, and manually hitting the reconnect button either brings me back to load-in, at which point the same window pops up, or it says it can't connect and to check my internet. Skype and Chrome are running just fine; it's NOT my internet! What does this mean, and how do I fix it so I can get back to playing? I'm almost frustrated enough to throw things, right now...","replies":[{"poster":"CC Tilly","date":"2016-11-03T05:39:46.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have overwolf or Razer Cortex? This error was seen with Robocraft (link:https://steamcommunity.com/app/301520/discussions/0/35220315970698613/) and CS:GO (link\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/541907867781792585/)  And it was blamed on those, another thing you can do is uninstall updates from Microsoft if neither of those seem to be the problem (link to guide: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq) And if you have Windows 10 Pro (You can check this by going to System from Control Panel) You can change whether windows 10 auto updates from the gpedit.msc.

I still have an issue where my client will DC from the server if I'm not doing anything for too long- waiting for my friends to invite more people to queue, bio break, etc., but I do have two jobs atm and I don't have the time/attention span to try to repair the source of those.
