What is the sneakiest way YOU have cheated?\r\n\r\nYesterday in one of my exams we had to use our own laptop. 50 multiple choice questions. So my table is a bit far away from the professor BUT my laptop screen faces him. So what I did was dim the laptop screen, tilt the screen forward even more, and check for a reflection of him to see if hes looking at me or at his own computer. Right when he looked at his own computer I immediately open a new tab and copy paste.\r\n\r\nI ended up getting a 60. Funny thing is that the test was worth only 5% of our grade.","replies":[]}
