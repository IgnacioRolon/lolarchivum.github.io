And from 2015 and on that mark it has been a bumpy road for me... {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}}  {{item:3070}} \n\nNow fast forward to today, I was about to play my game it's loading everyone is at 100% i'm also 100% I'm still at the loading screen like for 10 mins and come to find out that the game already ended... I'm here like okay and i'm still at the loading screen we get to the results screen my name is on the Red so I have to play 5 games and have to wait for 20 mins... This is a unjust punishment for a person that want's to play a really good game. I thought I was loading still. So the question lies, we banning people over a game crashing??? tell me now so I can uninstall and take my business to Valve....\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\n\nEdit: I'm not playing those 5 games because of my computer didn't load me in the game....","replies":[{"poster":"Rick Yiordan","date":"2016-11-28T01:53:36.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason this has happened has nothing to do with Riot's servers/game. It's either your computer/internet that is causing the problems.\n(what do i know, i barely know anything about computers, although since you're in NA, the loading screen time shouldnt take very long and certainly shouldnt disconnect you if you have decent internet)\n\nIf the problem **is** your internet, and the reason why people disconnect **is because of their** internet, then they should certainly be leavebuster banned because, say that Riot doesn't ban people who take ages to reconnect to the game in the first few minutes. if i was some malicious troll, who just wanted mess with people's time, i could literally disconnect my router/turn off my wifi connections because **riot can't tell if you have had legitimate internet issues or not**\n\n\nfeel free to disagree with me, i'm not so bright in the tech department, and i can certainly be wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T05:05:28.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, I hear ya.. It sucks when your game crashes and you don't know why. It sucks, even more, when the disconnection contributed to conjuring a *Leaverbuster Penalty* on your account. But, it also sucks for all the others players in the matches you've disconnected from. Their game experience is also *negatively impacted* by your disconnection. This is a big reason why disconnections are *all treated equally* by the system and why we cannot remove penalties for any reason.\n\n**Rick Yiordan** provided some great insight here, these types of issues are *very commonly* caused by a poor connection to the servers. I'd strongly advise you to work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the most common culprits of these sorts of issues. Please let me know if these steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
