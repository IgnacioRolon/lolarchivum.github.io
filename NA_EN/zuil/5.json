Then one day riot added a new system role choices... but it did little to nothing as the queues were still long and unbarring from everyone picking mainly mid/adc. \n\nThat's when a secret ingredient was added to the mix... chemi..i mean AutoFill. And thus! shorter queues were born making matches happen left and right with little wait time!\n\nThen the anger switched to being forced to support. \n\nThe End. xD","replies":[{"poster":"SSrikeShadow","date":"2017-09-09T14:23:43.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked queues below Diamond never ever ran anywhere near an hour (not in the 7 years I have played). In fact, I played teambuilder and could pick and choose my team composition and still only wait 15minutes to find the team that fit my jungler. I was so good at picking the right team composition that my win rate went up to 80% at for a couple months and I was still only waiting 15minutes from login to first creep kill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wei270","date":"2017-09-03T13:23:23.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah we need to give people incentive to play the roles that are less played some how, maybe more LP lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vigopl","date":"2017-09-03T13:24:39.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Think about it a bit.
