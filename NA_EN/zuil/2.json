It was a system where your individual merit was solely measured by the outcome of a team game( Which may not sound different, but-- )\n\nThat old ranked experience became canonized by a few things, and those solidified in the games' culture and community.\nThings like:\n-The only sure way for you to win, is for YOU to carry\n-Consequently role hierarchy is established, from what role will YOU have the most impact acting ALONE\n\nSo, a 'good player' being a relative term- a good player WAS:\n-Mechanically skilled enough to win their match-up by a large margin\n-Able to look for opportunities to leverage that margin across the map for more advantages\n-Direct others to follow their lead, or BRUTE FORCE win fights\n\nPeople gave duos shit because having a known factor on your team gave you an advantage- either YOU could carry or HE/SHE could carry OR you could count on that second person to specifically help you carry rather than try to carry on their own, or vice versa. \nEither way, it displaces the burden of \"The only sure way for me to win is for ME to carry\"\ninto \"The only sure way for me to win is for ME to carry, or HE/SHE to carry, or WE to carry\"\nNot to mention that just having someone you know you can communicate with or count on a minimum performance level takes away some of the stress altogether. \n\nNow, did people win games because a stranger carried the game? Of course. \nBut my point is that the MENTALITY of the queue was different-- the CONFIRMATION BIAS of feeling like  \"I carried that game\" and remembering games where you were the carry rather than games were you were carried was very real. \nThis led to the most important point- People FELT that they were very personally responsible for their victories and so they FELT that whatever they did accomplish was very much a result of their own skill. \n\nIn DynQ, people are queuing in groups of players they can count on. Even if they aren't good, they are known quantities. They can have definite communication, they can forgo attempting to carry to help someone else to. \nThe more prevalent premades become, the more the definition of a good player shifts. \n\nAnd so, people who may have thought they were a 'good player' who forged their own way in ranked through skill (Confirmation bias or not) are suddenly not feeling like good players. And no longer feeling like they matter in a meta where the only sure way to have a chance to win isn't just for you to be the carry. \n\nHow do we fix this? How do we address a bunch of... feelings?\n\nI don't think we fix it. It's just different and many people will never like it as much as they liked it before. \n\nRiot committed to a big shift in the values of the ranked scene. In a queue where teamwork is now more commonplace and viable in ranked, people who are still trying to carry alone at all costs are not seen as favorably. And when more teams are working together-- NOT working together is much more punishing than before.\n\nI mean Riot has tried. More objectives for people to work together to get, ip incentives for premades, clubs, etc. \nFor people that played thousands of games with that Solo mentality though... idk, no appeal","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-06-28T18:55:07.802+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your analysis up to the very last paragraph:\n\n> And so, people who may have thought they were a 'good player' who forged their own way in ranked through skill (Confirmation bias or not) are suddenly not feeling like good players. And no longer feeling like they matter in a meta where the only sure way to have a chance to win isn't just for you to be the carry. \n\nSo first a quick remark: \"thought they were a 'good player' who forged their own way in ranked through skill (Confirmation bias or not)\": I talked about confirmation bias earlier, but if you reach X ranking, well, that shows you had the skills for that. I don't believe in luck on the long-term, and confirmation bias has nothing to do here. They felt good because they were good.\n\nBut then! \"no longer feeling like they matter in a meta where the only sure way to have a chance to win isn't just for you to be the carry\": dang, no, that doesn't follow. Because your way isn't the only way anymore, suddenly you don't matter at all? I mean, your old way is still just as valid as before, or close enough, it's just not the only one anymore. So yeah, it shifted the meaning of \"good player\", since there are now various way to \"being good\". But I really don't think it shifted it as much as people on these boards would make you believe, and if you break up the set of different skills that a Solo player needs to \"be good\", even a Dynamic player needs to possess most of them. I mean, good coordination with your jungler won't help you a lot if you are unable to take a single good trade in lane... And on the other hand, you also say \"And when more teams are working together-- NOT working together is much more punishing than before.\" Yes, but you DID have to work together even before as a Solo player. You did have to \"sheep-herd\" people to Victory, as one Rioter put it. It's not as if Solo players really won 1v5 before, they were just trying to take the lead, but there was still team-work and cooperation.\nMy point is, there is a much bigger overlap than is immediately obvious between Solo and Dynamic skill-sets required to climb.\n\nSo yeah, I understand, all of this is feelings, it's hard to reason with feelings. But if people on these boards would stop the propaganda, maybe those damn feelings wouldn't be so prevalent. And I'm sorry for the harsh words, but yes, I really *feel*  (wink, wink) that we have reached propaganda levels of bad faith and misinformation regarding DynQ...\n\nP.S.: I have to say, among all this propaganda, I enjoy the few tidbits of intelligent conversation like this one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-06-28T15:35:33.114+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the main difference being back in the day if i played 100 games, won 50, looked at my wins, predominantly solo q players.\n\ni look at my losses, and i find obvious duo queues. and then i do remember those \"obviously thrown\" games where i should've been closer to a 65win/35loss scenario a resulting higher elo and closer to 50%.\n\nthis was back in the day when lolnexus would tell you who was pregrouped with who else in the room. \n\nim not saying a duo cant be good and i wont find duos on my winning games too, **but the majority are bad** record your next 100 games and conduct an experiment. any time you find groupings with obvious clan tags tell me the outcomes of those games.

F Riot. I can't believe people want everyone to act like League of Legends is so important to us that we're going to remember this game on our deathbed. We're not. League is just something that people use to sedate themselves for the time being. Riot's trying to brainwash people into thinking this is culture and important but it's not. It's just a game. And if you say \"it's just a game\" you're fucking persecuted by bronze players who think it's wrong for you to think this is a game.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being bad. There's something wrong with having a bad attitude. I agree. But Dynamic Queue didn't solve any of these issues. it simply added to the already existing problems while ruining the competitive experience for most players. Ironically in the forcible decision they thought would promote competition while destroying toxicity had the opposite effect. Riot simply puts out bullshit propaganda info like \"Reports are down meaning toxicity is down.\" It's not. I'm reporting people more than ever now IN NORMALS. I never fucking report in normals. But now I am every game and they are legitimate bad attitude targeted towards my teammates usually not me so there is no bias there. Toxicity isn't getting better. Simply premades won't report each other. Riot expects you to believe that BS propaganda like they think you're all rats.\n\nLet's face it. League of Legends simply suck now. Most people who were here since the beginning who have loved it since the beginning and watched it change (change isn't bad but it is if you fuck it up even after being told not to) to the sorry state it is now. It is hard for newer players to see what everyone is talking about. Like Sure Dynamic Queue won't dictate I can't rank up. But it does make it extremely frustrating since 90% of permaeds in MY team are assholes who don't cooperate with members outside of premade and all bias-report the non-premades for simply not being in their group. Then when you're against the enemy, it is the simple matter of how they have an advantage before the match begins.\n\nIn conclusion I agree with you. I can't quite quit because I think I'm addicted but realistically I can't wait for this game to go under. Riot has it coming and it will come soon. League of Legends at the moment is one of very few e-sports competitive game where the rank you can give yourself advantages before the game starts before even champ select begins when you queue up. Which I think is absolute BS. Whoever made the executive decision to allow this move at Riot clearly doesn't have logic or never competed in official matches for sports or games.

I've been playing since season 2/3 and I Quite like how dynamic queue works. I think DQ is better for ranked because everything is individual, you don;t need to be on 4 ranked teams to play with all your different friends and you dont need 5 friends to play ranked. Being someone who wants to get out of Silver/Bronze when most of your time is spent playing with friends in Normals actually benefits me because I can still rank up and play with friends. Trust me we still lose 50% of our games and I could care less if it's against 5 man premade or 5 solo players. \n\nBy adding solo queue it eliminates playing with 3/4 friends because you will never find that one person to play on your team with. I hope solo queue doesn't come back it's fine the way it is. I've been playing 2-3 games a night for the past month and got out of Bronze 2 into Silver 4. If your good at the game you can get out of Bronze. Stop finding excuses to hide behind why you are stuck in Bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2016-06-28T15:02:44.388+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":11,"body":"Everyone hates premades, that's why nobody plays in premades right?\n\nThe league reddit/boards does not even represent a fraction of the league community, you are the vocal minority","replies":[]}]}
