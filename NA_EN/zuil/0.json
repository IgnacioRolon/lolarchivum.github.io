You'd get more human eyes evaluating if a certain player if Trolling than there currently are,  and you'd keep reactions relatively recent.

Appeal approval includes a declaration of understanding that they cannot appeal again and will be permabanned without hesitation if it happens once more. Appeal denial means they stay permabanned and the case is dismissed.\n\n1. Someone who has fucked up **badly** once gets immediate 2 week suspension. They \"reform\" for ~100 games but real life happens, bad day etc and teammates are being excessively rude. They have an outburst and immediately realise the situation. Doesn't matter, permabanned.\n2. Someone who has constantly harrassed teammates, thrown abuse, intentionally fed and been passive aggressive for 100 games consistently with multiple previous punishments get permabanned. \n\nThese cases are different and should not both be treated equally. #1 Example could easily be voted YES for a last chance, whereas #2 would obviously be voted NO.\n\nNow, unless there are an extreme amount of permaban cases (which I'd hope there aren't) I find it impossible for the tribunal to be backlogged here.\n\nThis is just an idea, I claim no experience in this subject but I do feel like there are cases of permabans which could definitely be sorted in a more appropriate manner than being shot down with a copy paste message from Riot Support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-10-31T23:51:12.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was so insanely backlogged.  Think on the order of months worth of backlogs.  Which was why at the time, you did actually get a benefit to having multiple reports, because the more reports a player had, the more important it became to review their situation.  Now, the IFS is actually able to review every single report.  It's incredibly efficient, and while people say that it hands out \"false bans,\" it really isn't.  It's just punishing people for things that they should have been punished for all along.
