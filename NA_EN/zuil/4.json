(Please help me; long post)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Two things I want to say before I ask for help.\r\n\r\n1) Yes, I am actually asking for help to be less toxic and not crying about being banned and why I should be un banned.\r\n\r\n2) Let me explain this last game I played, this is why I am toxic..\r\n\r\n So I played last game as an Amumu jungle, and since this is a forum post and not in game and these players I played with probably wont see this (even though I told them in game, sorry not sorry) are terrible players. Now I admit, I am not a good player (Silver 3) but these guys had less skill and game sense than me by a huge margin. \r\n\r\nSo the game went like any game where one team is better than the other, we got destroyed lane phase, our Malzahar died 3 or 4 times in about 15 minutes to Annie, Riven top lane lost to a Nasus (even though Riven out farmed Nasus and Nasus had a staggering 250q at 20 minutes)  my ADC (who I was duo&#039;d with and in Skype with) got his CS more than doubled and the Sona was the only one I was somewhat satisfied with as she didn&#039;t die and knew what she was doing.\r\n\r\nCome along mid game, we exchanged kills, and the battling between me and my team mates began when I was taking blue and I got ganked by a fed Annie. I flashed over the wall and then see that Riven (team mate) came in to help me, so I Q&#039;d the blue buff (saved it from going to enemy) and I ulted so that the Annie wouldn&#039;t go away (she had 50% hp). We both fought her and I end up with the kill. Riven then proceeds to nag me saying she had the Annie, I say that its fine as she had 100cs (before 20 minutes) and that she is fine. She still then calls me dumb or some sort of word that I don&#039;t remember to basically say that helping her was a bad idea, I say back she&#039;s dumb, I mute her, life goes on. \r\n\r\nA couple minutes pass and our Malzahar says &quot;I&#039;d be doing good if I got some ganks&quot; and then that&#039;s when I go on tilt and say to my team that &quot;everyone of you guys fucking sucked in lane phase, I can&#039;t help 3 fucking lanes at once&quot; (actual words).\r\n\r\nMore minutes later, team tries to surrender, I say no because we&#039;re only down by 5 kills. RIGHT AFTER I SAID NO, we get an ace and get an easy dragon. BOOM back in the game. I un-mute Riven and I try and work with the team and we all worked well until we tried to take a tower. I died, but I managed to take 2 enemies down with me, but my remaining 4 team mates were all at about 1/10 of their health so I ping for my team to get out. Riven, being the smart one she is charges back in and dies. She then gets annoyed with the team and rages at us, I say to her that she is stupid for going back in. More arguing, I don&#039;t mute this time. The rest of the game is just arguing and me basically telling Malzahar and Riven (the two blaming me before hand). Malzahar also had the audacity to call his team &#039;bad&#039; even though he died multiple times in lane phase and fed the enemy Annie. More arguing probably, we lost.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#039;t understand why I have this story (the game that happened about an hour ago) is that I become toxic whenever my team calls me out on something stupid (like Riven when I secured a kill for her). I didn&#039;t call out Riven or Malzahar on feeding the enemy team before they started bashing me, I was focused on my own game and silently judging them to myself, not saying anything in chat and hoping they would turn around and help win.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to start playing my games with all of my team mates muted the second we join in game so I don&#039;t have to see any stupid comments made by my team mates and hopefully that&#039;ll do something, but I don&#039;t know if that is the right step, can someone give me some tips to being less toxic? \r\n\r\nBTW, if I do get banned for that match, I will accept it as I broke the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whiskies","date":"2015-12-22T06:08:33.945+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"As others have said here: bravo on your honesty and self-awareness.
