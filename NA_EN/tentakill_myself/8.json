No consequences, just brainstorming! That being said, here are a few skill ideas that may or may not work in a kit together.\nFor the purposes of description, I will dub this champion ZeWhip.\n>Flayed Skin\nZeWhip passively applies stacks of Flayed Skin to enemy champions he strikes with auto attacks.\nUpon activation, all targets afflicted by Flayed Skin begin to bleed out for 3 seconds, taking physical damage based on their missing health and how many stacks of Flayed Skin they have.\n\nSimple attack speed incentive and execute ability.\n>Lacerate\nZeWhip strikes quickly in a cone in front of himself, dealing physical damage and applying on hit effects every X seconds for 3 seconds. X scales based on attack speed and spell rank. ZeWhip can cancel this abilty prematurely.\n\nAn idea I posted to another champ concept. Intended for stacking on hit effects.\n>Cyclone Cord\nZeWhip damages all enemies around himself and knocks them a short distance in target direction.\n\nSelf peel and utility. Pretty simple.\n>Crack of the Whip\nZeWhip's next basic attack unleashes a deafening crack, dealing additional physical damage based on missing health and briefly fearing all enemies around his target. If the target is killed by this ability, the duration is doubled.\n\nReplace the fear with whatever you want. A skill designed to make ZeWhip far more frightening near the end of teamfights.\n\nWhat with all the skills I've listed so far, there isn't much you can do with a whip wielder without any other thematic elements. Whatever, that's all I got for now. Happy brainstorming!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoodHotFreshFly","date":"2015-07-14T00:13:13.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=aZhN5AME,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-13T23:52:47.227+0000)\n>\n> I actually created a whip-using ADC several years ago, named Penny.
