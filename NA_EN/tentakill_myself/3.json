It all depends on the which color is used.\n\nQ could be the beach ball that seems consistent on a lot of fan art.\n\nW could be water balloons exploding on contact.\n\nThe charm I realize has to stay the same for clarity reasons.\n\nThe ult is tough because its animation is so fast.  I was thinking about it having something to do with diving, but it's already kind of like that, and the quick motion might be hard to notice a difference if one is added.  It's easy to say add a water effect, but what else can you really do without changing the animation?  \n\nAs for the recall, I'm not sure off the top of my head.  Possibly having something to do with playing with the beach ball or maybe throwing a bunch of water balloons at the ground like a Syndra ult and diving into the puddle as if it were deep, emerging out of the water at the fountain.","replies":[{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2016-03-23T01:22:42.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the ult, maybe just have her do an action that looks like somebody swimming underwater.

And the attacks could also be water balloons.\n\nHer recall, in my opinion, could be her just suntanning. Laying out a towel, then lying down and tanning, switching sides and then standing up right before recall ends.\n\nSome other things could be adding an inner tube to her, to go along with the floaties on her tails.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-23T08:16:44.888+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the well thought out replies!

How would her W, E and R be 'pool party' themed and what could we do for her recall that would be a great fit for the theme and Ahri? If you have any ideas I'd love to hear them >:)\n\nQ is a volleyball/beach ball. W are frisbees which she throws out, and E could be a heart but with water or sand effects. The effects on her R could be simple water effects or sand (like she's throwing sand or splashing someone with water), and her dash could be her surfing on a body board. Recall is her bouncing the ball up or throwing the frisbee which circles around.\n\nAlternate would be she uses aquatic creatures (ie she's one of those people who goes to beaches to collect shells and stuff). Q is a pufferfish or an urchin (both are ball-shaped), W are starfish/seastars/urchins that circle her, E are 2 seahorses (when they mate they actually do have that heart silhouette),  and R could be her throwing water/sand/fish/lobsters/anything-you-want at them with some nice water/sand effects trailing behind her, or better yet she surfs on a sting ray. I've stepped on sting rays before and you do travel with them a short while when they jet away. Tie in the theme by having her swimsuit be made out of seashells and seaweed, but any type of swimsuit would work. Her recall could be looking through a bucket of shells or poking at the pufferfish and it inflating. Pufferfish are always funny. Or she could dig through sand anf find something or gets pinched by a crab. There are just so many ocean creatures you could use that work.\n\nNot sure if you need to change her tails and ears though. Tails could be fins which I'm sure you could make look really nice. As for the ears, maybe you can give her goggles/snorkle that she pushed up onto her head? So that the eyepieces are where her ears would be. Makes sense for someone who wants to go and collect shells and things on the ocean floor.\n\nI really like 'Collector Ahri' because it would have some really unique visuals even among the pool party line, but still fit very well. Also fits Ahri's theme about being a curious fox. You could even have a story behind it - she was partying with the other champs and wants to fit in but unsure how, so she goes and tries to finds pretty gifts for everyone in the ocean so she can be friends with them. She can give Amumu a blobfish cause it reminds her of him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-03-23T14:26:13.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko is my favorite champion, it would be awesome to have a skin similar to what Sora from Kingdom Hearts would look like, but obviously without the name \"KH\" in the skin so Riot doesn't get in trouble.\n\nMy idea for a skin like that would be to of course first of all, have Ekko's headphones, maybe a red or yellow color again.
