But the flat true damage means that it's stronger vs squishies. To me, she just seems like an \"anything she sees buster\".\n\nThat's because every hyper carry is an anything buster. When you get to late game kog, trist, cait, vayne will all kill anything with little much real trouble. Doing at a max 2% more damage to a squishie then she does to a tank doesn't actually change to much because you will be killed by the physical damage before the real effect of the extra % comes into play. All it does is make sure her damage isn't as heavily effected by mass armor stacking.  \n\nIt's kinda the same way as the buff to Cait's head shot that makes it auto pen 50% of the bonus armor. They do relatively the same damage after the buff except it scales down a bit harder vs tankier targets because the raw AD it actually takes to make head shot deal high damage. However, you get late game and 6 item cait will destroy just about everything she see's. \n\nThese aren't the aspects that make people hate vayne. You only look at what's she's got after she out plays you in a frustrating way. It's mostly because people don't respect the fact she can straight up 1v1 duel like nobodies business. This is the one champion that people would send to split push vs Zed back when he was broken because she could beat him played right. Normally when you roll up on a solo ADC they have to run. Vayne's like I want to kill you and she can. Completely out of the norm for any ADC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2015-08-14T02:58:08.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't necessarily think % health true damage is necessarily a problem on Vayne, but rather how accessible constant procs of this true damage is.

What weaknesses should be highlighted to make it fair and fun to play against her with those strengths? is there something about an item that is making her too strong or is it something internet to her kit?\n\nFor those few, most would say Vayne's short overall range and relatively lack-luster lane phase warrant having high damage, and also that BotRK is the real problem in this situation.

I also am merely suggesting that, relative to her stats, she is a little too safe. This is just what I have observed.\n\nwell, to begin with, \n\nSince her threatening range is lower during the early game, and for most of the lanning phase, she is prone to go into the mid game with a gold deficit compared to her opponent (of course it wont happen every single game. it doesnt for any late game champion). \nThen as you said since her auto range is all she got in those team fight, there is more chances that she is closer to the enemy front line then some other adc (as i pointed out, most can stay away to poke before a teamfight starts and vayne has to be at max at 550 range of a champion to do any damage.), when the fight start, which makes her an overall easier target to engage on to start this actual fight. Thats a clear weakness in itself and make positionning on her rather difficult to maximize your damage output from a safe distance.  Yes, autos are the base damage of adcs, but that doesnt mean their poke abilities cant give a significant advantage before any fight start.  Every advantage count in PvP.\n\nNo. she doesnt have 2 reliable escape abilities and no, her ult isnt an extra escape engage (vaynespotting level of engage doesnt count.). Q is a repositionning tool and part of her mobility strength, but not an escape. the range on it is barely 300 unit, most champions can hit her still at that range. E can be used for a single target disengage (not really an escape, you arent blinking away, you are pushing them away), its distance is less then auto range for most ranged, and easily countered if you dont waste your gap closer left and right, and still will only push 1 guy, in a team fight i'm assuming more then 1 guy is going to dive on a team if any at all. oh and it has 20s CD at rank 1 and is maxed last (12sec at lvl 18), so vayne isnt going to land more then 1 in a normal fight, maybe 2 in a prolonged one. Then her ult doesnt give much in term of escaping, maybe just stealth, but ever heard of pink ward against stealth champion ? i mean a 100 gold item counter a part of her ultimate, that doesnt sound like too reliable to me. And come on engage ? what ? you are comparing final hour to stuff like leona E or sejuani ultimate ? its just a steroid that give her a slightly better chase ( the passive only work when she move toward enemy, not away), more ad (like some other steroid in the game) and stealth on tumble (pink ward (100g on use) or upgraded red trinket (250g for the whole game and have about the same CD as her ultimate at max rank too lol.)\n\nhow is average auto range, with no poke abilities is too safe ? like look who has lower range without any way to make their aa have more range :\nGraves\nLucian\nSivir\nQuinn\n\nThey all have actual long range abilities, sivir give her whole team an engage, have a long range poke that can deal a lot of damage on its own, and ricochet to hit a full team at a time, lucian and graves dashes have more range and lots of AoE damage. quinn become melee with a lot of speed blind and execute. in no way their threatening range are lower then vayne because of their AA range being 25 to 50 unit lower. of course if you compare only AA, the ones with build-in on hit effect will look better, but this game isnt just point and click. every champions have a passive, 3 normal abilities and 1 ultimate (on top of items and summoners), and their kit should be considered. Even in the late game, you should always use your abilities lol. \n\n not sure what you refer as too safe for her stats; her lanning isnt safe, her mid-late isnt too safe etiher. her mobility and true damage on 3rd hit on the same single target, is literally all she has. She doesnt have any form of AoE damage, she doesnt give any buff to her team, she doesnt have any form of poke, all she got is mobility, and single target damage.  I dont and probably cant understand what you have observed in your games, but i dont think it make vayne a safe champion. when i play a safe adc, i play something like ezreal and caitlyn, not vayne.\n\n\ntldr : i think you just have a misconception of vayne strengths and what is safe in general.","replies":[{"poster":"The Chuckler","date":"2015-08-14T17:30:27.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sir, I upvote you for your in depth description and rebuttal (which covers decent points).

How many time in LCK they would say twitch has such a short range. And yet, his range is 550, the same as vayne. simply, you dont want to fight wihtout your ultimate (pretty much like vayne), because you lose any threatening range you should have. Looking at twitch kit, i wouldnt really call his W a poke ability, so he has again about just his AA has threatening range (before 6 at least), just like vayne.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-08-12T17:12:16.762+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It allows them to keep the % health portion a bit lower so it's not too oppressive against tanks without making silver bolts bad against squishies.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2015-08-12T20:36:01.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't the point for it not to be good against squishies?\nIs that not the entire point o Vaynes w?\nOr is she just supposed to auto-kill anyone that comes in range?","replies":[{"poster":"TheXtractor","date":"2015-08-14T07:08:06.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is still and ADC, an adc should be able to do good damage to squisies, just like kog maw is a tank shredder but also a strong adc vs squisies.

Silver Bolts is more difficult to itemise against than it otherwise would be because it has both flat damage (which encourages health stacking) and %HP damage (which discourages it). If she only did %HP damage you would prioritise armor against her, not against Silver Bolts but against the rest of her damage. If she only had flat damage you'd get health. But when you stack armor to reduce the amount you take from her %HP, you take a bigger fraction of your health from the flat amount.\n\nYou're not supposed to itemise to counter %HP true damage, the entire point of the ability and Vayne as a champion is that tanks can't counter her W. But if they removed the flat damage you would at least be able to say \"Screw it, I'll just prioritise armor to negate the rest of her damage\", which is a fine idea because she does a ton more physical damage than she does true damage anyway. The problem here is that the flat damage COMBINED with the %HP damage means you're screwed either way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-08-12T16:58:49.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"Late game you tend to get deleted out of existence before you can consume the w stacks","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-08-12T17:13:22.490+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LadyRenly,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3cbnyn3W,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-12T16:58:49.005+0000)\n>\n> Late game you tend to get deleted out of existence before you can consume the w stacks\n\nSo do other adcs if they can't position, yet I don't see them running around with high true damage into their kits.

She can, of course, build full attack speed, which will make her very specialized at killing tanks but at the cost of killing squishier targets or even fighters - in a normal ADC build, squishy targets should die to attack damage long before the % max health bonus would kill them. Other assassins or burst adcs can very easily make short work of her, and while she can make relatively quick work of a tank, a tank by themself should not be attempting to solo Vayne. Also remember that too fast of an attack speed will actually lower Vayne's DPS since she wants to tumble in between attacks for MAXIMUM DAMAGE.\n\n> You realize \"poke\" is 100% useless when being jumped on, which is when an adc \"dies instantly\".

Ashe has a slow on every auto attack, long ranged poke, and a stun. Varus has a snare and %max health based magic damage, and burst. Kog'Maw has an attack range steroid, %max health magic damage steroid, attack speed steroid, and an armor/mr shred - he can out dps Vayne. These marksmen are immobile because they have powerful abilities which contribute to their damage or to the team as a whole; fortunately for them, they have a champion on every team whose whole job is making sure they stay alive.\n\nThe problem seems to be that you are looking at Vayne in a vacuum, where she's always in her best case fully built and fed and in a 1v1 scenario. Vayne as an assassin/carry is extremely specialized in 1v1 battles through high sustained auto attack damage, but she does very poorly in a scenario where she has to deal with more than one opponent at a time, since switching targets automatically resets her passive. Her range is also limited without poke, so she has to put herself at risk in order to attack an opponent.\n\nIf you really hate her so much, play champions that counter auto attacks - {{champion:24}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:157}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-08-13T02:33:52.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If 8% of max HP true damage every three autos is aids, what's 15%(or more) of max HP true damage per vital strike for Fiora?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-08-12T23:46:21.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To get to the other side (of the health bar)!","replies":[]}]}
