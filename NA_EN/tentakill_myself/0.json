They&#039;re disabled, we can&#039;t abuse it.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-10-09T23:04:48.878+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I don't believe Kindred being delayed will affect the timing on the next champion, that'll be determined by when that champion's ready and what other stuff's ready for release around the same time.\n\n2. 7800 as far as I know (the 6300 IP price point applies after a champion's been out for a week, not a week after intended launch).\n\n3. An issue where it was possible for Wolf to despawn after E casts until you died and respawned.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-10-10T01:26:33.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will some champions be discounted from 6300 IP when Kindred comes out?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-10-09T21:42:09.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
