Because before this disgusting downgrade (art and model) she was one of the pretty characters. Now she looks like trash, her models are trash her running animation is beyond stupid. Like it's just terrible.

Not a pit fighter.  A DUELIST.  As in, she is a noblewoman and fights against other noblemen and women for honor and glory.  She is the archetypical swashbuckler and they are know for being fashionable, often good-looking and rather vain.  She is all of those things.  It's not enough to simple beat someone down.  She has to do with with skill, grace and style.  Her entire VO puts a lot of emphasis on this.  Her hair.  The stylish cape.  She is an aristocrat AND a warrior and that is what makes her different than someone like Garen.  She fights for prestige... and anyone who wants others to think well of them tends to their appearance.  She WANTS to look good and also leave you bleeding.  That's the point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2015-07-21T22:20:01.250+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"She looks incredibly cartoony. I agree.
