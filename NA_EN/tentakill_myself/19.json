It does this by:\n\n1.  Recording amount of times AFKed\n2.  Frequency of AFKs (% of games AFK)\n3.  Supposedly also can monitor lag for network quality reasons\n\n\nTHEREFORE... because each account has a \"Leavebuster\" profile... an account who has violated in past, or otherwise has a high frequency of AFK's will \"be flagged\" in the MMR system.  Thusly these people will likely not be put on the same team in order to prevent 3v5 from occurring.\n\nWho is \"they\"?  RIOT that's who... surprised you couldn't figure this out.\n\n\nLeavebuster==Flag your account for hostile activity... adjusts matchmaking accordingly.  Therefore the statistical random probability of \"your team will be more likely have afk if you are never AFK\" is a false claim therefore.\n\n\nIf you cannot understand this... either you have serious problems or just living in denial.

They have made the afk penalty extremely harsh. Having a five or ten minute standby for the next couple games makes queuing up with friends a nightmare, and it forces you to waste time (I sadly speak from experience).  I would not ever troll on purpose since this penalty persists by games played...not time. It is also reasonable though. Everyone has that game where the internet just isn't working or something comes up. Is that fair to lose 50 LP for that? NO!\n\nBut the big thing that so many people just do not get these days is that league is a GAME. If someone dc's it is okay every once in awhile. Other people have lives too. To be fair you shouldn't go into ranked unless you can set aside that time without interference if possible. But things come up, and everyone should respect that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2015-06-12T17:20:51.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is problem I have posted on multiple times already, so ill paraphrase what I have said in the past.  \n\nIn short, my solution would prevent negative effects from actually disconnects and rage quits; it WON'T help vs trolls that stay connected, or feed excessively, or afk in base (but don't actually dc).  \n\nBasically, my idea is that in ANY case where a vote surrender has 4 or less players voting for a surrender (ie the last person/persons are actually dc'd, whatever the reason), then the people voting do NOT lose any LP for the game.  The person (or persons) that did dc takes an LP loss of 2-3 times greater than normal, in addition to the normal penalties of leaving a game.  This would discourage people from dc'ing to avoid losing LP; no one is willing to be a hero for the other members of their team (or if they are, they are REALLY nice guys).  \n\nIn regards to the people that disconnect due to a bad internet connection, or because they simply have something they need to do and can't stay to finish the game, I have to take a strict stance.  I have to take the position that if you have a bad internet connection (or risk having your internet drop, like playing in a thunderstorm where you might lose power), don't play ranked.  If you don't think you will be able to finish a game, don't queue up for ranked.  And if some emergency happens and you need to leave (hospital trip, fire in your house, etc) I'm sure you will have bigger concerns than your LP.  And of course, if it is an infrequent occurrence, that should be the only penalty you receive; if you are in the habit of disconnecting, you kinda deserve action against you.  \n\nAnyway, it sucks that you lost LP for this, and it really isn't something that should happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-06-13T04:18:38.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What does making the afk penalty harsher do? It doesn't stop anything. People will still leave. Riot has had various levels of penalties and it doesn't stop anything. It discourages some people but we have already gone well past the point where the majority of people who are going to be scared to not afk are already scared. The afk penalty is already pretty damn harsh. Your suggestion just makes the ego's of the people who voted yes feel slightly better well also introducing more incentives for people to be dicks.","replies":[{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2015-06-13T05:07:02.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't see why that is boosting the ego's of the people that voted yes, and I don't see how I am incentivizing dickish behavior.  If you could explain that a little more clearly, I would be able to properly respond.  \n\nIn my experience, most people that rage quit do so because they are frustrated; and I would argue that part of that frustration is the fact that they are going to lose LP for the game.  They are frustrated and decide that because they are going to lose the LP anyway,there are better things they can do with their time.  Therefore,  I thinking making the LP loss the equivalent of 3-4 games makes it a significant enough loss that players that normally would justify a leave no longer do.\n\nActually, I'm going to leave what I just said, though the point of my solution has been slightly misinterrpreted and I intend to correct it here (after getting side tracked by your statement).  This isn't a solution for jerks, or trolls (assuming they stay connected).  I'm not trying to fix the problems created by people intentionally trying to cause harm.  \n\nThis is a solution to stop the four players who had no control over the 4v5 they find themselves in from losing LP.  And when i say no control, I mean the 5th person's internet drops out, or windows decides it has to update RIGHT NOW (and auto updates aren't turned off).  I DON'T mean no control over other players.  That being said, this solution would *also* help against people that rage quit and actually disconnect.  With that in mind, the only purpose for the heavy LP loss is because I am assuming that all of the people playing (including the person that dc'd for whatever reason) is actually trying to win and climb.  The heavy LP loss is *only* to prevent abuse of the system to stop LP loss from 5v5 games without legitimate disconnects.  The trolls and the afker's are unfortunate, but I have to take that stance that it is part of the game and the best you an hope for there is to report them and get the account in trouble.    \n\nFor example, red team is up 25K gold at 20 minutes.  Not sure how you would do this, but just go with it.  Blue team knows they are going to lose, so their jungler (who maybe feels guilty about the game, idk im just coming up with reasons) decides to dc before the red team wins.  Because he dc'd, the other members of his team lose no LP and he would lose the normal amount, instead of everyone losing it.  Now I don't really expect a LOT of people to do this, but the abuse potential is there.  Now the idea behind the increased LP loss is while the blue team's jungler might be willing to disconnect for a normal LP loss, losing the equivalent of 5 games worth of LP makes the sacrifice much more........shall we say noble?  and therefore they are less likely to do so.     \n\nSo, keeping in mind the problem I am trying to solve (or if you prefer, the part of the problem I am trying to solve), how do you think my solution stands up?","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-06-13T05:44:02.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't solve anything. people will still leave games. Heavy lp loss creates more abuse cases instead of less. \n\nSee the problem as you correctly identify is that if their is no loss of lp people will abuse it. Even if their is only loss for one game people will abuse it. However people will still leave for friends, people will still try to bully other people into leaving. So the problem I have is that it doesn't solve anything and creates more problems or worse ones then we originally had.","replies":[{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2015-06-13T13:38:55.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand your statement that it \"doesn't solve anything.\"  It will prevent the people that don't deserve to lose the LP from losing LP and it sets up a system that discourages people from acting like heroes to preserve the rest of their teams LP.  \n\nGreat, I correctly identified the problem.  Basically, if I was losing a ranked game (5v5) I could decide to disconnect, lose my normal LP from it, and take comfort in the fact that my 4 allies didn't lose LP.  There's the abuse we agree on.  However, I know that if I were losing a game, and I was sitting at 60 lp, I would much rather take the loss and have ~47 LP instead of disconnecting and dropping to zero.  Once again, I'm not trying to handle to people that are absolutely, 100% intent on causing harm; I am only trying to make it more fair (and less frustrating) for those people that are really trying to play the game.  \n\nThe bullying others into leaving is about the only thing I can see being a problem, but that is addressed by muting your allies, if the situation were to be that bad.  That aside, like I said at the start, I think this solution *does* solve a lot (but not necessarily what you seem to want it to solve).  I also don't really see it creating any more problems that we originally had, but if you could point some out, I would be happy to reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-06-13T20:23:51.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The person who disconnects doesn't deserve to lose 60 lp. \n\nPeople will bully others into leaving. Also people will duo queue and when games go south one person will dodge for the other. This will happen. On top of that people will still leave games. It doesn't matter that you wouldn't leave if you got hit with a 60 lp other people still would. Since people are still leaving games and you add more abuse cases it wouldn't solve anything.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
