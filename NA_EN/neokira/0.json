I was playing a game as Sion in Twisted Treeline on the new hexakill mode, and i noticed that i was not getting the bonus health from w when I killed creeps or got champion kills/assists. This lasted for the entire game. My W active would work, it was simply the bonus health that would not function.\r\n\r\nNow I'm not certain I can give step by step instructions on how to reproduce the issue as I myself am uncertain as to what actually caused it. However, I do have an idea about how it may have happened. I believe that I leveled up either right before, or after my death, and switched into passive form. While in passive form, I think i put the first level into w. That may have been the cause, though I'm uncertain as to whether or not it actually was indeed the cause. \r\n\r\nThis only happened to me once so far, as I have immediately come to the forums to check and see if anyone else had mentioned it yet, and to post it if they had not. I did remember to take a screenshot in game, showing the lack of bonus health from my lvl 2 w despite kills, assists, and cs.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-29T03:17:07.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this happen to me. The repro seems to be putting a point into W while you're in your passive state \"Glory in Death.\" It's a known issue and will be fixed!
