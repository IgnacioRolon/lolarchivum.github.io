On cfg files, I think it goes deeper than the surface. League is running on a very old software and I think we are seeing it reach a time for change. I do not think I have the obligation to fix the issue if this has been a Riot side issue for awhile now.

Also, it's not a matter of what I want. It's a matter of what Riot should look into instead of pumping out all these new changes and what not.
