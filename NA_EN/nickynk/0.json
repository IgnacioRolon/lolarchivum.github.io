My apology, but I can't download the game from the client. It just starts from 6 GB then goes way up to 15 GB. I tried to download many times. Even I tried leaving my pc on for a whole night and 4 GB was done. But after I re-opened the client after 4 Hours, it started again to download from 15 GB. I am so frustrated right now. What should I do? My internet speed is so damn slow about 250 KBps. Can't afford more speed.\r\n\r\nCan anyone provide me links to download the game in parts? Please I want to join this beautiful community.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-07T16:25:02.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry you've been running into so much trouble.  :(  Everything is downloaded from the patcher, so trying to do it in parts would confuse the install and force it to rescan your files over and over.  This can also be the case if you're installing outside of your primary internal drive.  \n\nYour best bet is to just let it do its thing unless you run into any errors, otherwise you may run into issues later.

And one more thing, how much large is this game? Some says that it is 5 GB, then other says it is 8 GB. If it is, then why am I getting 15 GB of download?","replies":[]}]}]}
