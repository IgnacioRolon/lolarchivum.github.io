Once I got to the launcher where it updates the game to current patches it gets stuck at \"Applying Patches\" 79% and eventually crashes into a bugsplat error message. I&#039;ve tried every solution from the riot support page. I reinstalled a lot of times, nothing fixes the issue. I have no firewall installed and did nothing but install steam and LoL so far. Does anyone have any idea what else I could do? My internet connection is perfectly stable and not wireless.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sJGHhde.png","replies":[{"poster":"LiL Batman","date":"2015-08-14T22:09:51.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry you're having issues patching, that's no bueno. Sounds like you're getting a consistent repro so send me your largest LoLPatcher logs or whichever logs list a \"Failure\" so I can take a closer look OR you can zip them up through the help option at the top right of the patcher. Sending me the entire log folder is actually better and will give me a better idea of what is going on with your client.

Sorry for the delay. My problem was that the language was set to EN_US or something like that (a friend of mine helped me with it as he already experienced it)","replies":[{"poster":"Salena Gomez","date":"2015-08-25T02:20:46.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys I am having this same exact issue.
