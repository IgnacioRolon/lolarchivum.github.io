It's on our list of things to update but is arguably low on that list due to the stack of other things we are looking to tackle. \n\nBasically they are in the order of when they were created as Hyrum mentioned. \n\nTo the bug you're seeing we are aware of that specific issue and are actively addressing it — apologies for the inconvenience. If you see it refresh for the time being.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-10-13T21:16:44.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"With the exception of GD, Help & Support, and the red tracker, the boards are literally in the order they were added / changed the name of.\n\ntl;dr it's not a conspiracy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poro Support","date":"2014-10-14T13:08:42.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The conspiracy was originally meant as a joke - since that seems to be the common and popular theory - that Riot pumps everything into E-sports.  Apparently I didn't word it appropriately enough :P\n\nI guess even so though, that makes it another question of why E-Sports first over things like announcements, et cetera. I understand wanting to appeal to the masses so to speak and to get people's eye on the board but when people complain about Riot focusing on esports and not anything else, and you open the board's first link as Esports, it doesn't send the message the people want to see.\n\nAlso - since when is alphabetical listing not a built-in feature? If it isn't, then how can you (Riot Games, inc) claim this is an upgrade from VBulletin when it's missing basic features.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-10-14T20:48:39.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are still quite a few improvements we're looking to make, namely ones that will directly impact quality of life and usage on the Boards. It's a work in progress like most evolving websites. \n\nThat being said there are a lot of upgrades here that have already been introduced especially in infrastructure. A one-for-one exact feature rollout was not necessary for the improvements to outweigh the downsides. \n\nAs for Esports, it's listed first because — as mentioned — it was created as a Board entity first. It wasn't a matter of priority it just ended up that way. We will be re-organizing the Board order later on when it's feasible and not blocked by more important items such as bug fixes and major feature updates like Quoting improvements.","replies":[]}]}]}
