No other reason.\nTwitch and Lux? Destroyed botlane.\nTeemo? Rekt top.\nRammus? Irrelevant in jungle.\nOh but their mid is Yasuo so, even without getting fed during lane, you lost the game.\n\nThat's enemy Yasuos. Friendly Yasuo's lose you the game for dashing into 5 enemies without tornado, missing windwall, not pressing R, and building AP.\n\nNot banning Yasuo should be a bannable offence.","replies":[]}
