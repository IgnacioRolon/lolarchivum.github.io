Gameplay issues to do with preseason balance is understandable. Store issues is not as it has nothing to do with the balance team. \n\nEA games (apart from the initial payment obviously) can be played without paying a single cent. How they work is that they use manipulative ways to get unaware people to spend money. Looking at you Dead Space 3.\n\nRiot's loot box system is manipulative, locking away champion skins and encouraging kids to pile drive their way through their parents money as they don't know any better. Meanwhile their parents probs don't even realise what's going on until they see a huge credit charge on their bank statement.\n\nThen there is the questionable matter of emotes as they mainly can only be obtained through real money. Which isn't bad at first until you realise people can mute them, this leads to potential problems as someone who pays an emote gets excited, can't wait to use and show it off in game but realises no one can see it as it Might be muted by everyone. Inherently making them feel like their money is wasted.\n\nThere's also the known debates on how they handle skins. \n\nI'm just tired of waiting for Riot to fix a never ending stream of issues they keep creating. Give them an inch they take a mile, season 7 was a joke with how they handled it. It's a joke in general how long it takes them to do anything. \n\nAre they as bad as EA?

Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Dying Instinct","date":"2017-11-28T09:03:03.697+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":7,"body":"Your arguments are very skewed and biased. Skins are a way to keep the game profitable, if skins didn't exist League would be either non-existent or P2P. As for loot boxes, there are good arguments on both sides. True, it is manipulative to include a form of gambling into the game. On the other hand, boxes provide free content that is usually behind a paywall and I personally have never felt the urge to buy loot boxes, it always felt like a bonus for spending time on the game. \n\nYour point about emotes is slightly odd to me. Yes, emotes can be blocked by enemies. But the player themselves can still see them. And the vast majority of players can see them. It's just a way to avoid people who have binds that make their emote show up every time they use their Q. It's annoying and I think it's a good thing Riot has a way of avoiding it. \n\nAlso curious to what debates there are.

Issues like that is what makes champion player bases feel isolated. \n\nSome other issues are how the meta can be altered to buff champs that are receiving an upcoming skin. This isn't a problem itself but when must needed champion nerfs are being delayed until after a skin is released it becomes a problem. Creating issues for player enjoyment when facing against said champ is much longer than what is nessecary.

I played the old battlefront 2 on PC but the console companies are all a joke now and so are their players leaving the game positive star reviews while complaining everywhere else online.   \n\nEdit: I couldn't give any less shits about blue essence, never had anything to spend ip on and now I have pretty much nothing to spend blue essence on so why would I care about how fast I get a useless currency. once you own all the champs the shit is 100% useless as far as gameplay is concerned, especially now that there are no runes or rune pages.

It works, because it constantly places the prize in front of your eyes, but out of reach of your hands, making said impatience build up\nRiot is doing the same, but without the progression. Certainly, you can just buy most things you want, but the human brain reacts more to a reward that's unexpected than to an expected one, and therefore a skin you would not buy directly becomes more enticing if given out due to a random shard piece. Then comes into play the \"can't get free stuff as fast as they used to\" you mention, because that is the point in which they cash in on the impatience of players, and those who received a high enough stimulus from their random prize and want to obtain it, but lack the OE to do so... welll, don't you think they might strongly consider purchasing a hextech box now, even if they never thought about doing it before? And maybe find something else they might also want in the process? That's the whole point of this system, to incentive additional purchases, and was placed in motion not because Riot wants to reward players from the bottom of their heart, but because it works on it's intended purpose.\nCertianly, Riot does not have monetary entry barrier, and the system does not direcly improve game performance, so most people will give it a pass actually buy their excuse of it beign a reward system to players. After all, those who are not affected, those who do not receive this stimulus from unexpected rewards will feel completely safe from this as they're not even affected indirectly from a progression perspective.
