Similar to how Nashramae has a Sun Disc in the image of the City of Shurima.\n\nI thought also that maybe the picture we called the Immortal Bastion was actually Basilich all along, but the Piltover map shows a little of the Bastion, so that theory is out.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2017-08-21T03:03:43.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Oh look the Vindor Navy are approaching the Immortal Bastion... wait one second, that don't sound right?\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2017-08-21T01:48:26.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the art, it's possible the artist was given some reference material and confused Noxus' capital with the city of Basilich he was actually drawing.\n\nOr that's common architecture in the region?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-08-21T02:34:11.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Darrosh Jewfist,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Wp2YOIV8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-21T01:48:26.840+0000)\n>\n> Given the art, it&#x27;s possible the artist was given some reference material and confused Noxus&#x27; capital with the city of Basilich he was actually drawing.\n> \n> Or that&#x27;s common architecture in the region?\n\nI don't actually know the answer to this one (haven't asked) but it's entirely possible that Basilich _was_ controlled by the Noxians some time in the past too.  Noxus has been around for a while, after all, and it wouldn't surprise me if its borders had waxed and waned over those long years.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-21T03:09:08.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Bae-oluminescence can you please do me a favor and tell Repertoir that I said hi?
