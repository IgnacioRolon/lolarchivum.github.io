Every time I attempt to load into a game after champion select, I just see a white screen and it says I am not connected to the internet.  My internet connection is fine though.  Anybody know any possible solutions?  When I click retry it changes nothing and when I click cancel and reconnect again, still the same problem persists.  Any help would be great thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T00:30:30.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That frozen white screen is a pretty decent sign that the game wasn't able to get a solid connection with our servers and actually crashed from not responding soon enough.
