Because of this, you just have to eat up the rage and swallow it. Gotta keep bottling it up and it&#039;s NOT healthy!!\r\nI spent the past 5 days playing ranked, accepting the rage from my team when I was doing nothing wrong but every team needs someone to rage at and because I was the only player not talking, they chose me.\r\n\r\nAll this rage built up, and every time someone raged, I would get a massive urge to tell them where to shove it and possibly get restricted.\r\n\r\nIn the game I just played I was playing well. Always grouping when everyone else wanted too, was pretty fed too and had nice cs. Was a pretty free game until out of nowhere, my support just starts spamming chat for no reason. Raging at me for whatever reason she could think of.\r\nI did nothing wrong all game and she just never stopped spamming caps.\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;ASHE!!!! WTF!!! NOOB???&#039;&#039;\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;ASHE!!! LEARN TO PLAY ADC NOOB!!&#039;&#039;\r\n\r\nAt one point, I stated 3 times, &#039;&#039;doing Red then getting LW then we team fight!!&#039;&#039;\r\nI was at Red and our Aatrox was Top lane clearing a triple wave.\r\nLeona was mid with Xerath and Rek&#039;Sai against 5 enemies. She goes in. 3v5.\r\nThey lose and die.\r\n\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;ASHE WTF!!! WITH TEAM F^CKING NOOB!!! WTF NOOB!!!!! REPORT THIS NOOB!!! LOOK ASHE!! LOOK AT HER!!!&#039;&#039;\r\n\r\nSame scenario about 5 minutes later but they are bot and I am taking enemy Red to stop Graves from getting it.\r\nShe goes in 3v5 and dies, I get inhib top AND mid in exchange for their 3 deaths.\r\n\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;LOOK THIS F^CKING ASHE!!! DOING INHIBS WHEN WE TEAMFIGHT!!! REPORT THIS F^CKING BRONZE TROLL!!!!&#039;&#039;\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;F^CKING NOOB ASHE REPORT!!!&#039;&#039;\r\n\r\nTeamfight came up, 5v5.\r\nAatrox, Rek&#039;Sai and Leona all go straight for their Graves (Which at this point did no damage because I crushed him bot but they focus him anyway). While doing this, their tank Amumu and tank Gragas come at us and destroy us.\r\nI kite my way out of there, barely surviving but Xerath dies.\r\nWhile focusing Graves, their midlaner killed them all. I am the only survivor with like 50HP.\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;THIS F^CKING ASHE AGAIN!!! ALWAYS F^CKING RUNNING!!! NEVER WITH TEAM!! NOOB NOOB NOOB NOOB!!!&#039;&#039;\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;I COPY ASHE!!!!!&#039;&#039;\r\n\r\nAt this point she begins to solo push top lane and does not group for the rest of game. We went top with her but she recalled and pushed bot instead. We lost 4v5.\r\nBut to the point.\r\nAfter she started raging at me after that fight, I snapped. All that bottled up anger from previous games just burst out, I couldn&#039;t stop myself.\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;ASHE THIS! ASHE THAT!!!! ASHE F^CKING THIS!! ASHE F^CKING THAT!!!!&#039;&#039;\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;TRY FOCUSING ON YOUR OWN SH^TTY F^CKING GAMEPLAY BEFORE CRYING ABOUT ME!!!&#039;&#039;\r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;NOT ONCE HAVE YOU PROTECTED ME OR XERATH ALL GAME!!

If in previous games I could have said \r\n&gt; &#039;&#039;Dude, stop crying about me. You pushed with no wards and got punished for it. It&#039;s not my fault&#039;&#039;\r\nThen I would not have snapped. But the above sentence is enough to warrant a report in solo queue because everyone is so super sensitive and I don&#039;t want a restriction on my account. Due to that, I had to bottle up all the hate and it eventually overwhelmed me.\r\nThe Chat Restriction System is unhealthy and broken.\r\nI genuinely fear, that I log in tomorrow with a nice chat restriction message.\r\n\r\nApologies for the wall of text.\r\nIf you didn&#039;t read, fair enough.\r\nJust wanted to vent somewhere about my hatred for this broken report system.\r\n\r\nRiot, do something about this please.\r\nI get raged at for 5 days and I say nothing. I rage in 1 game against a super toxic kid and I&#039;m probably getting restricted because of it.\r\nThis system makes no sense :/","replies":[{"poster":"Kazaashi","date":"2015-04-01T21:56:36.808+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"You could always mute people.  \n\nUnfortunately, verbally abusing someone who is abusing you is not the correct response.

This is small potatoes compared to the rest of League, and there's like no chance something will happen, even if all 9 report ya.\n______________\n\nAll that aside, it is a serious problem, but there's hardly a cure for it. The last thing they want to do is ban 10% of their playerbase, then lose all their friends, too. It's like these players need to explain to mommy why they lost, and they do it by chewing you out. So, how exactly do you punish these players if they *must* play your game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-04-01T22:47:15.133+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont bottle it up.

I can almost guarantee you won't get a chat restriction or ban if you aren't actually abusive. I defend myself, I am in no way nice about it, and I have even flamed people. Yet I have never been warned, banned, or restricted. \n\n\nThe trick is don't get baited into a he did she did argument. State your defense rationally, one time, and leave it at that. Possibly ask them to focus on the game in a non-provocative manner. The fact that you aren't responding to their emotions will either make them shut up, or cause them to go into a blinding rage because. Either situation is fine, because in the latter you just mute and report since they'll have pissed the rest of your team off. Just don't appear like you're also raging. Don't ask for teammates or enemies support. Don't make it about proving yourself to the rager-you won't change him. And never be the first one to talk in all chat. As long as it's clear you want to play the game, not talk, you'll get less reports than someone who is purely raging. Also, people who frequently put out false reports have their reports valued down. It's possible to have the system almost ignore someone's reports. So don't worry that you can get restricted because someone has a tantrum. If they're inclined to report people for trivial shit, their reports are probably worthless.\n\nI have a number or problems with how Riot does stuff, but I don't believe people get punished for behavior things wrongly. You can defend yourself, but if vindicating yourself becomes more important than winning, you're no better than the rager. Like I said, just use a non emotional response based on fact.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FreshMeat707","date":"2015-04-02T17:18:28.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League: BEAUTIFUL GAME!!!!!!......\n\n\n\n....that's ruined by assholes, cheaters, toxic players, and trolls.\n\n\nThis entire fucking GAME needs a community re-check, i agree with you.

It&#039;s not my fault&#039;&#039;\n> Then I would not have snapped. But the above sentence is enough to warrant a report in solo queue because everyone is so super sensitive and I don&#039;t want a restriction on my account.\n\nYou could say that. You can't be punished for saying -exactly- that. The thing people get punished for is saying something -like- that but with a couple ... little... changes.\n''Noob, stop crying about me. You pushed with no wards and got your dumb ass handed to you for it. It's not my fault you're a moron.''\n-That- can get you punished. (And then the people who get punished are shocked that they got punished because they couldn't possibly be toxic if they aren't swearing...)\n\n-However-, I don't really recommend getting into it. Trying to place blame is only going to fuel the fire. Most people recognize excuse-making when they see it, which is what blaming someone else for your own death is, with very few exceptions (Blitz or Darius pulling in the wrong target and giving them a free gap close and a bad Bard ult can really screw you over in ways that you can't really play around and still play with your team. They usually know what they did wrong though and blaming them in chat is only going to create bad feeling among the team.)\n\nWith a rager like your support in that game, I would have muted them very early and reported them at the end of the game. I'm not going to listen to that crap. \n\nIn general I don't have a lot of use for chat, TBH. It does get me free kills sometimes though, when someone is standing in the middle of the lane venting their rage at length and scrambles to even start moving around the time their health bar hits zero. I'll never understand how people have time to get into these lengthy arguments. If you're a laner, you should be CSing, shopping, or positioning for the next objective or fight. If you're a support you should be warding, sweeping, shopping, or positioning for harass, peel, the next objective, or the next fight. If you're a jungler, you should be farming, warding, sweeping, or shopping -- and looking for the next gank or objective opportunity at the same time or postioning for such a gank or objective. Maybe once every 3-5 minutes I might be autopathing such a long distance that I have time to type a couple whole sentences. Usually I only take the time to say things like 'drag under 1min' or whatever when a single ping is not going to send a clear message. (Nobody gets it when I ping an empty dragon pit.)\n\nI simply have no time to play the blame-game or get dragged down into toxic fights when there's a match going on. Nobody who wants to win their game does, actually, even though many seem to believe all that time standing still and arguing is somehow going to help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"High Lord Blaze","date":"2015-04-02T02:16:11.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please.
