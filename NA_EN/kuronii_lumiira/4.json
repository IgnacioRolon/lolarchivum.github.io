It probably ranges from any point of &quot;what&#039;s wrong with you&quot; to &quot;why hasn&#039;t this jerk been perma&#039;d yet&quot;, and I can honestly say that you&#039;re justified in thinking that. I&#039;m the last person who will tell you that you&#039;re wrong to think that. But, what&#039;s really going on?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been unapologetically rude in my games as of late. Not just rude, but vicious and mean. I recognise this. I recognised this when I got a 10-game chat ban, followed up by a 25-game chat ban. I still didn&#039;t relent. I honestly didn&#039;t think of the consequences. I just played games and wanted to win so badly that I was extremely critical of my allies and their decisions. \r\n\r\nDoes anything I say here excuse my behaviour? Absolutely not. Even acknowledging that I&#039;ve done wrong won&#039;t do any good, since people may construe it as me being above the situation. \r\n\r\nI think the big question I should be asking here is &quot;why?&quot;. Why do I persist in engaging in negative types of behaviour even when I&#039;ve been told that it&#039;s wrong and detrimental? Is it a failure on my part to actualise the wrongdoing? Do I just acknowledge it, but lack the follow-through to make permanent changes in how I deal with people? In previous times, I&#039;ve done what I can to reform and treat others well, but I end up coming back to it.\r\n\r\nWhat, in a person or environment, causes someone to continually engage in these types of behaviour? More importantly, when punishment isn&#039;t getting through, what can be done to make a person permanently change their attitude? What sort of punishment can be handed out to repeat offenders, such as myself, that would allow them to keep playing the game while limiting their negative influence on the game? What can be done for such a person to truly reform? What steps would it take, and how long would it take?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m interested in looking at the identifying traits that cause people like me to continue acting in such a way, and I&#039;m equally as interested in looking at what can be done to help. \r\n\r\nDespite what you may think, I&#039;m truly interested in reforming. Two week bans are annoying, for sure, but I don&#039;t want other players to feel like the players I&#039;ve wronged in the past. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Goldilux","date":"2017-05-05T15:57:02.820+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it is awesome that you are putting yourself out there to try and show people that reforming is something you want to do.

Not many have the balls to admit they are toxic, even less got what it takes to truly admit their wronghood and seek Rehabilitation like you do.\n\nbut as much as i would love to bring good news and answers, all i can give is hypothesis about why you Keep behaving off the rails, and what could be done to lower the toxicity. \n\nFirst of all, why you Keep on behaving negatively.\nIt could be many reasons and without thoroughly knowing you one can only guess. Maybe a streak of bad days? maybe a bad personality trait you grew into a while ago? maybe you just are a very competitive personality so when you end up on the losing end it hits you deep inside. who knows, but logically seen all of the answers could be right. only one who can confirm that is your own self.\n\nas for the answers to your search for a better self. first of all, the bad news. We are all humans, emotions are always present, and all of them. means you can fight it off a lifetime long, you will at one point break, lose your shit and go hulk on people, verbally or physically. what you can however do is lessen the effects. Lower the influence toxicity has you and thus shrink the chances of you responding with the same toxicity.\n\nOne such Thing is Play with friends. They know you, they understand it when you have some bad days. With them you can fully and openly talk about your emotional state of mind, and calm down again.\n\nPlay for fun only. If competitive attitude is the source of your evil, then all you can do is quit it entirely. Play league just for the fun of it, the thrill of the chase, not the adrenaline for your performance, to word it figuretively. Just do it because you like it, not because you want to achieve something. If you are just there for fun, it means you will just Play your game and subconciously trigger your human ignorance towards negativity. sure, if it is heavy enough it might still affect you, but both damage and Response will be lowered by a lot.\n\nthird option is, and i wish i was joking but i am not, to quit league entirely. Hear me out on this one. I can tell that you really love this game, i mean 2 chatbans and 4x 2week bans and you are still here, that either means you are tenacious as fuck, or really like the game and don't wanna give up on it.\nbut if all else Fails, then i have to honestly advice you to take a break from it or quit entirely. league of legends as a game is a very strategy set, objective controlled, competitive multiplayer online Arena. You are bound to meet sore losers who will shake heaven and earth to express their Anger. And if that becomes too much, you have to avoid it entirely. I made experience with it before, and while you can Keep this option as a last Resort, i have to be realistic and say you should at all times Keep this one in good consideration. Your liking for the game shouldn't grow into an arrogance that blinds you from the damage you both take and deal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kats Pajamas","date":"2017-05-05T21:46:57.106+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Do pardon me good sir, I do believe while observing you and simultaneously playing my lane completely optimally, I thought that my observation of your poor play and making this known to you would improve it.

A guy who may be toxic in-game, but is reasonable, rationale, and wants to have an honest discussion about his behavior out of game. We can work with this, and maybe help. I wish more punished players were like him.\"\n\nSee, not all punished players are bad for the community. Those who think the rules against toxicity are stupid, or that they have some justification for their actions, or that they CAN'T change are problematic and need to be removed -- those who want positive change and struggle with it though? Those people are fine with me if they are serious about taking steps to improve.\n\n>In previous times, I've done what I can to reform and treat others well, but I end up coming back to it.\n\nAmusingly, I'm reading a book on this very sort of thing right now -- it's called \"F-ck Feelings\" (omitted letter is intentional, as it's the title of the book), and it's largely about how the idea of \"perfecting\" yourself and removing your flaws is almost entirely impossible in practice. One of the big things it mentions is how slip-ups like this happen, and that returning to bad habits is fairly normal, and fairly understandable.\n\nIn short, sometimes all you can do is mitigate the effect.\n\n------------------\n\nTo that goal, I'd look at two things -- the cause, and alternatives.\n\nIt may just be that you're highly competitive, don't like when you feel others fail, and respond nastily. But I'd take a look and see if there are any recurring trends -- does your toxicity spike when you're feeling stressed, depressed, or powerless about things outside *League*? Does it spike when you're hungry/thirsty? Does it spike when you're playing *League* because you don't have anything else to do, instead of when you're playing *League* because you specifically want to play *League*? If you can find a trend of this kind, you might be able to help figure out what you can do to reduce it, and/or when you should and shouldn't be playing *League*.\n\nFor alternatives, the first is easy -- if you're raging a bit in a game, take a break. Immediately. Don't queue up again -- you'll tilt yourself. Take a few days off if needed during a big losing streak. Play some rounds of a game you don't take as seriously (I goof off in *Heroes of the Storm* when I'm tilting a bit in *League*, since I find that game silly and more relaxed).\n\nAlso, find an anger outlet. Shout at your monitor. Punch a pillow. Buy a stress ball and just WRECK it. Keep something by your desk and just accept that you'll get angry now and then -- just don't TYPE your anger. An easily accessible outlet may be helpful.\n\nFinally, find a duo-queue buddy. I have a friend in EXACTLY your situation (although without the bans -- he was working towards it though), and having me on Skype lets him A: rant to me over Skype, and B: allows me to tell him that the fight isn't worth it, and then we just find our own way to do the best we can. It's REALLY helped his behavior, even when I'm NOT around, since he has that little voice going \"Dude...he's not worth it. Eyes on the next game.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Kuronii Lumiira","date":"2017-05-05T18:55:05.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually quite helpful. I had tried to curb my physical expressions of anger, since my boyfriend was telling me that my loudness was bothersome at times, but I hadn't thought of alternatives. A stress ball sounds like it would be very therapeutic for me. \n\nAs for tendencies, I sort of have a \"gambler's fallacy\" in another way; I think that, even if I'm upset with this loss, I can recoup my efforts and do better next game. But if I don't get a win, or even if I get a win, but things in the game just don't go my way all the time, my attitude can worsen. I mean, I'll be honest with you -- I find it hard to stop playing League in that situation. I just want to play more and more and redeem my poor play, but I never just take a break until after I've blown up at someone. \n\nWell, these two weeks will give me time to think about how to apply that and how best to recognise when I'm going downhill when I get back to playing.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-05-05T19:29:55.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kuronii Lumiira,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gLE9iEzd,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-05-05T18:55:05.908+0000)This is actually quite helpful. \n\nAlways happy to help!\n\n> As for tendencies, I sort of have a &quot;gambler&#x27;s fallacy&quot; in another way; I think that, even if I&#x27;m upset with this loss, I can recoup my efforts and do better next game. \n\nI'd try picking up another quick game then -- Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, or something you can take casually. Maybe use it as a \"palate cleanser\" in between stressful *League* games.\n\nAnd yeah, it'll be hard to stop if you have a gambler's fallacy effect. But keep trying to push past it -- you're basically fighting what may be years of bad *League* habits AND perhaps some personality traits, and it's going to be rough.\n\nGive yourself a 1-loss-per-day limit for a while, for instance, and STICK TO IT. Even if you REALLY want to play *League*. One loss, no matter the reason, and you're done. Read a book, grab a glass of wine, learn to paint, or just do anything else.\n\nIt's going to be a LOT of work to break the habit, and it may feel miserable for a while, but it may just be something you need to deal with.\n\n----------------------------\n\nWhen you get back, if you think you may need help, feel free to drop me a line.

I personally feel that this behavior comes about due to several things:\n\n- Anonymity \n- Not relating a team mates behavior with one's own\n- Not actively identifying the fact that people's play is flawed and differs from other\n\nThose final two points and many other that i believe can be related to this problem fall under a tree that can be called the root of many biases and prejudices:**_ Not recognizing the fact that the person you are interacting with is, in fact, a person._** This may seem like an obvious statement, or even a stereotypical one, but i urge you to consider it seriously for a moment. What, beyond common sense, tells you the text in the corner of your screen that you're typing hurtful things to, is just like you? nothing. It is incredibly easy to dehumanize your team mates and your opponents in League, and when you dehumanize something, you don't behave towards them as if they were your equal, or even a being with feelings, reasons for their actions, ect. I believe things like assuming when one is having a bad game that they're \"inting\" stems from this prejudice, and that it is something everyone is guilty of it. \n\nI do also believe there are a few semi-simple steps and guidelines to prevent this loss of perspective as much as posable.\n\n- **Practice mindfulness** , it is up to you when you are about to do something to second guess your motives. \"is this person _really_ intentionally feeding?\" \"could this person being toxic have had a bad day?\" \nThe perspective earned from this can change you view on a situation and help you stay calm in a stressful game and avoid using your team mates as scape goats.\n\n\n- **Think of your team mates not by their champion name, but their chosen name.** This step may seem arbitrary, and to some extent it is, but for those who have a major issue with flaming or toxicity, it can make a big difference. By referring to them in your mind by their unique name, your are acknowledging the fact that they are a person every time you think of them.\n\n\n- **Play with a cool-headed friend in an app like Discord or Skype.** At the start of the game ask your friend to tell you when your are being toxic, this step may be difficult or inconvenient as you would need a friend who does not flame others, themselves, and you would need the strength of will not to lash out at them when they point out your behavior.\n\n\n- **Simply apologizing.** As they say, hindsight is 20-20, so when you say something you know is toxic, apologize, explain yourself, and tell them why you said what you said. After apologizing to someone, few would go on to flame them 3 minuets later.\n\n\nThis has been what I have learned and observed from the behavior of those close to me, and the player base at large, thanks for reading, and i hope this helps you be a positive member of this great community we all share, good luck! \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n**PS**- to those who are affected by toxic players in their game: the best way to deal with the tilt or sadness, is to recognize that they are people as well, and that they don't act the way they do for no reason, try to be patient and understanding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-05-05T21:42:53.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, I'm glad to see someone else trying to get to the bottom of this as much as myself. I have had issues with tilt in the past, and tend to lash out.\nI believe that any player that plays and takes this game seriously believes they are good. Maybe not the best, but at least good. Some people try and pin down successful players who are also humble, but I call bullshit. If you honestly don't have any self confidence, then you'll never climb. This is because you will never trust your calls and mechanics, which will lead to inconsistent gameplay. The trick is controlling that self confidence.\n             I've been playing League for quite a while now, and I think I've figured out what causes tilt. Most tilt, believe it or not, is not a player frustrated with other players, it's that player being frustrated with **themselves** . Low elo players are **especially** vulnerable to tilting because when they fuck up, they can't seem to figure out how  they messed up.  They just see the gray screen and the scoreboard. Because of this sense of insecurity, they will often lash out at others, because they are upset that the \"perfect player\" they thought they were messed up, and they don't know why. \n             High elo players, on the contrary, will be able to deduce exactly what they did that caused their death. They see this as only a setback to the bigger picture, and know how to work through it and play from behind. High elo players also know the importance of objectives>kills. They understand that their death is usually somewhat meaningless. \n            That's my theory on tilt.

Helps pull the focus of your frustration from your team onto yourself, which will also help you improve as a player.

This player doesn't believe being toxic is a answer or the way to go and does their best to keep calm towards whatever faces them. Behaved!\n\nSadly, we all have our limits. I believe a majority of all healthy players turns into unhealthy players because we're being sick treated disgusting. **The temptation **to fight fire with fire grows every game and the part of us who didn't  intended acting that way is slowly forgotten.\n\nIt's like a virus. Once you hit your limits you cant help it and you'll act in a way you know you wouldn't if certain people didn't provoke you to do it.

Their struggles and current life situations reflects on their ingame behavour. Obviously, these players doesnt last too long, but on their way to penalties **they'll sadly manage to drag many \"innocent\" players with them.**\n\n_In short_, some players are just simply bold.

You have the right mentality and sight to move forward. Most are blinded by silly reasoning that they tunnel vision into win or lose ultimatum.\n\n2) Look at the bigger picture. You play to have fun, winning is fun, losing is frustrating, we all know that. But it doesn't always have to be that losing is the worst thing in the world, thinking that and playing a game is like flipping a coin with 50% winrate on average, you are almost intentionally hurting yourself if you only play to win and see winning as the only way to have fun. Destroying the nexus is a official win, but personally I see little wins just as good. E.G. I have been spamming Tristana for the past week, and being Tristana, I had the roughest experiences early game, often getting bullied out of lane and losing first tower, getting zoned off CSed and all-in'ed every time I walked into lane. Sure I was plenty frustrated, but I also knew I could still be useful to my team in the best way I knew how to as Tristana. Farm up and split push. Finding champs that you like, gaining profieciency, setting small goals, out farming opponents, deal most damage, little victories(Without being and ass hole and stealing CS from carries. That's my pet peeve.) are always good.\n\n3) Everyone is human. It's so easy to just think of the underperforming teammate as just a character, but the fact is that they are a very real human, like yourself who makes mistakes. You make mistakes too and by that logic you don't really have a right to flame them, sure they may do questionable things but it's just a game.

You could farm your lane and get a huge advantage on your opponent, winning you the lane with almost no contest. That would be great for you, but doesn't help your team much. The other thing you could be doing is looking at your map, seeing which of your teammates needs the most help, roaming to their lane, help them either get a kill or push an enemy out of lane, maybe drop a ward on your way out if they don't have one.\n\nOr, if there are no enemies that are gankable, you could roam down to the dragon or up to the rift herald, ping the shit out of it, ward, and try to get your team to take it with you. Or you could invade their jungle. \n\nBasically, try to snowball your own advantage onto your teammates so that they get more resources and their opponents have less.\n\nAlso, sorry to end this on a more sour note but I don't see where anyone else has told you. Typically a 14 day suspension is followed by a permanent suspension. The fact that you got another 14 day suspension is because you decayed a tier since your last one but if you don't show continued reform in the future then you could be permanently suspended from the game very easily. I would suggest unbinding your enter key or hiding your chat if you need to.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuronii Lumiira","date":"2017-05-05T18:38:00.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Redirect my efforts with an advantage, and take control of what I can, myself.

There is a mute button in the game, and it's very easy to use. Banning someone for flaming another person is just wrong when there is a mute button. I mean, if someone was telling another person to go off themselves, or something, then sure, but calling people a noob and bad? Sometimes people need to be told that just like your boss at work tells you when you fuck up and dont do this or that, or when a coach yells at his own teammates and tells them to step up their game.  Bad players wont get better  if they dont realize they are bad, some need to be told that.\n\nAnyhow, I wont get into this whole thing, cause nothing will ever be changed about the ban system and punishment system.  People become toxic due to stupidity and players refusing to communicate, and doing stupid things in game. League is a competitive game, not a casual game. So people want to win, a lot of us hate losing. ( I don't mind losses, it's just when my team doesn't listen when we're losing I get triggered) but that's just league in itself, almost every other match, you'll get onto a team where every player has their own little ideas about how to play the match, and refuse to be open to other ideas. I hate split pushers, telling them to group when they keep dying trying to split is annoying, yet they keep doing it, and not get banned for it when they should be.\n\n\nThe biggest bans come from people who are toxic. Not people who troll, intentionally feed, and afk.  \n\n\nRiot should get rid of banning people for being toxic, focus on banning people for intentionally feeding and other trolling methods, bring back the tribal community to judge, not an automatic system (which is actually good) .

I do not believe taking things out in real life makes you any better of a person. A person who isn't punished by the system isn't some saint or above those who do get punished.

Sorry, I tend to misread longer posts.\n\nWell, besides trying to look at the bigger picture (\"it's just a game, and games are meant for fun\"), you can also pay attention to the smaller ones. Instead of focusing on your teammates' performances, especially the negative ones (and how your Riven is a boosted animal, as that's a given), focus on your accomplishments. After every loss, I stop and think: \"What awesome thing did _I_ do? Did I crush my lane? Do an epic Baron steal? Backdoor a lane and take an inhib, giving us more time?\" and things like that. Barring that, I try to just…act nice. Randomly say entertaining stuff, use _all_ of the \":3\"s in the game, dance-off with their top, crack jokes, and be in character as much as possible. (Hilarious (and doubly functional) as Kled, since I'm flaming Skaarl for abandoning me in a team fight (preventing me from flaming my actual allies) and yelling at him to bring back my tacos).

In a job. Satisfied with it? How long have you had it? May be a source of frustration, but may not be. Depends on the duration and what happened before.\n\nGood to hear that your relationships are good. But could it stem from, instead of a bad experience with a family member or other loved one…one that doesn't exist? Could possibly be frustration in that regard expressing itself. Or perhaps an old, severed bond? Can't say. Hell, for all I know, you've been happily married for 30 years, now.\n\nAnger issues are, well, pretty obvious causes. Squashing it may help, but is it possible you're simply venting in League? If you haven't yet, try to find another way to vent. Hit the gym, or just buy a punching bag (preferably one that looks like Yasuo :3). And, if you're not already, try to see an actual psychologist/therapist. Even if it feels stupid to complain to them about you being toxic in a game, anyone remotely competent will try to help, especially if it's an obvious discomfort. Don't try to tackle anger issues on your own, since they have a nasty tendency to spill over in the _worst_ possible scenarios.\n\nHell, if none of that works, pick up Yoga or something.
