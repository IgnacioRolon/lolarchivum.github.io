It honestly seems like such a waste. You get a skin for &quot;free&quot;, but only seven days. Since skin shards are so difficult to come by, there&#039;s no guarantee you&#039;ll get that same skin shard you want, and chances are, if you liked it enough to rent it, you&#039;ll want it permanently. \r\n\r\nI feel like it should be changed to &quot;you get to have a one-game free trial for this skin for X Orange Essence&quot;, and have it be an actual rental system where you get to see if you like the skin or not.","replies":[]}
