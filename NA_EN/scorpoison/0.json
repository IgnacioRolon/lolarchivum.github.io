However when Azir fell from power, he disappeared. Legend says that he has been meditating since the fall of Azir, waiting until he is needed once again.\nWhen Azir returned, he sought out a new weapon to keep safe the population of his empire. When his studying brought him to the story of Fos, he sent scouts to scour the lands in search of his ancient tomb. After weeks of tiring and fruitless searching, Azir's forces came upon what appeared to be a perfect circle, with a runic design made of cracks.\nExcavation was painstakingly slow, for each time they made a breakthrough on the circle, a searing beam of light shot out, burning all of those who were hit by it. Eventually however, the miners were able to create an opening in the center, without collapsing the hollow cavern. When they reached the bottom their eyes were greeted with a being squat on the floor, imbued with light. After Fos was escorted to Azir, he decided it was time for him to once again roam Valoran.\n*--*\nFos is a ranged support who peels for his allies and blinds his enemies. Fos does not use mana and instead builds up Luminescence through basic attacks and abilities. Each basic attack generates 5 Luminescence.\n**--**\n**--**\nPassive: Illumine - Allies affected by Illumine are healed every .5 seconds for 3 seconds and gain an increased vision range while the effect is active. Illumine will also effect nearby allies who aren't effected by Illumine already. [Heal: 5+(10% AP) Health and 5+(10% AD) Mana]\nPassive: Effulgence - When Fos reaches full Luminescence, he blinds all nearby enemies who are facing him and all his abilities blind enemies, and deal additional damage. [Range: 400 | Initial Blind Duration: 2s | Blind Duration on abilities: .5s | Additional Damage: 5/10/15%+(# of allies effected by Illumine)]\nQ: Irradiate - Fos brightens a target area, granting vision of the area, and giving a small movement speed buff and shield to allies. Allies effected by Irradiate are  also effected by Illumine.

Enemies take bonus damage and are slowed for more based on the amount of flares they are hit by. Fos can not move while using this ability. [ Range: 700 | Damage: 5/10/15/20/25+(5% AP)+(5% per flare) | Slow: 5/10/15/20/25%+(5% per flare) | Duration: 1s | Cooldown: 28/26/24/22/20 | -10 Luminescence per flare]\nR: Brilliance - Fos immediately dashes a target allied champion, knocking up all enemies around them, and giving them Illumine. If the target already has Illumine, it renews it. [Range: 700 | Cooldown: 100/80/60s | Radius of knockup: 500 | Damage: 100/200/300+(10% of target allies missing health)  | Knockup Duration: 1s | +50 Luminescence]\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-04-04T16:43:02.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus Christ, man.

I like the idea of a passive heal though, it's new, and novelty is something I always appreciate.\n\nQ:  Does not have a duration attached to the effect, change \"removes Fog of War\" to \"grants vision to the area,\" make move speed buff a flat buff (+20% and no scaling off of abilities) as i is currently OP to have that big of a roid AND to have it scale off of AP, lower the radius growth as 500 is a VERY big area and would make the skill way to easy to use at max ranks (100/125/150/175/200 radius).\n\nW:  No duration to the debuff.  Does it deal damage based on Fos' armor and resist or based on the enemy's current armor and resist?\n\nE:  So Fos has two auras that he can toggle between?  Honestly, with the duel nature of Fos already, I'd strongly suggest just reworking this.  Fos already has a movement buff on his Q, and the rest just seems... unnecessary.  Also, its not clear if Fos is a Mana based, or just alternate resourse based champion, and having a free aura that can provide such randomly useful buffs is a little broken.   Perhaps a passive aura that only effects one or two stats, like attack speed and movement speed when moving towards Fos (Like the champion boots).\n\nR:  I'd change \"Nearest allied god he is facing\" to \"Targeted Allied Champion\" since it may already be a difficult skill to use targeting allies rather than enemies that allowing the game to target for you would be disastrous.  I would also remove the buff to allies since you already have a solid knock up ability.  I'd change the effect radius to a flat 400 rather than have it grow.  The range should also be a flat 750.  It's not entirely clear if the extra damage scales off of the targeted allies health.  You don't have a knock up duration, I'd suggest a flat 1 second.  Instead of the buff, all nearby allies could get the Illumine buff, since he only has 1 ability get grants the effect otherwise.\n\nWith the above changes, this champ could be a SOLID light based, ranged, support champion.  I'm gonna be mean now though.  I'd suggest dropping the unwieldy transformation effect for several.  The champion concept doesn't seemed to be based around it as a singular idea, making the transformation seemed forced and out of place.  The abilities are have some bad ideas, like the ability to damage allies and an ability that actually takes into account that it would probably kill himself, and a complete lack of an Ultimate ability.  The transformation effect is best in the hands of a figher, mage, or assassin rather than a tank or support, because it wildly changes his role in a fight if/when he can transform.\nIn addition, I'm going to suggest also dropping the alternate resource mechanic in favor of a typical mana based champion, and I suggest it for two reasons.  First, in conjunction with the transformation effect, neither are really outlined or mentioned in ANY of Fos' abilities, not even his passive, making it something of a secondary forced mechanic that doesn't fit in.  Second, a champion that can heal without having to worry about resources like mana allow for something of an \"infinite\" laning phase.\n\nOverall, I really like your basic concept for a ranged support champion.  You want to scale too many things with skill ranks, but that isn't the worst thing ever.  As a rule, most abilities shouldn't get bigger areas of effect while leveling up, since it makes for very difficult counterplay and can make the champion harder to play than he really ought to be.  The kit, ideally, brings new ways of doing things to the table, and that's more important than getting all the numbers hashed out.\nAs for the transformation effect, I want to like it, but it belongs on a different concept, in this case, perhaps a fighter would be wise.  I'd suggest taking the core of that mechanic to a different champion who's always melee, and have the alt casting resource and transformation effect as the champ's passive.\nI hope I've helped your idea out, and if you get a chance, check out my concept for a [Parkour Yordle](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/T9vzAEc8-campion-concept-zuki-the-zaunite-delivery-boy-melee-mage-pseudo-support-art-wanted)","replies":[{"poster":"Scorpoison","date":"2015-04-04T20:18:29.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly I'd like to say thanks for the feedback!\nAs for his q I reduced the radius to 200-300, but seeing as 125 is the standard radius for a melee character i felt that 100 was too low of a range. I also reduced the base shield late game and the scaling on it, I also dropped the scaling on the movement speed buff. I also forgot to put down the durations for both the q and the w, which I have fixed. Thanks for pointing it out! XD\nFor his E I didn't quite know what I wanted to put, but I know that I wanted something he could use without upping his Luminescence, so the buff is sort of a placeholder but I know that i do want some sort of buff, I'm thinking a skillshot maybe? \nFor his Ultimate I reworded it as you suggested (was playing a lot of smite yesterday with my friend) I also gave it a bit of clarity\n**-** \nMy original thoughts was for him to be able to go in and save an ally with his ult which transforms him into a temporary damage dealer, but at the cost of 'burning out', however looking back at it I can see what you mean with it being better suited for a fighter / assassin. Instead I think it would be good to remove the ascended phase, and instead just put a buff to his abilities when he gets to full luminescence for a short time.","replies":[]}]}]}
