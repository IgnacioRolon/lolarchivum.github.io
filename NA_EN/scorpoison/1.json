DFG will need a replacement item because the raw stats will be missed on every mid that's ever gotten a DFG, but the removal of it is because it made every bursty-ish mid rush it. Most Syndras throughout S3 and S4 all got an AUG then a Rabadons and could combo their lane opponent with only a quick Q+E+W+R. She'll be perfectly fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Scorpoison","date":"2015-01-20T04:32:11.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that most don't rush DFG, but the recent nerfs make it hard for her to get to the mid game, considering how they've nerfed her power over other mages with early aggression. Now her q does the damage of an auto attack and is really costly to cast :L. Just a thought though","replies":[]}]}]}
