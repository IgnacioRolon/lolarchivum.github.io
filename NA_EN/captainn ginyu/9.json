The point of the game is to secure objectives for your team, starve the enemy team of said objectives, and in turn win the game. It is not to fight any and every thing you see. Thats a low elo mentality. Just constantly fight the enemy team for no reason the entire game, until death timers are so long that you can just push up mid and win. lol thats a bad strategy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-10-01T16:13:55.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1966138036/39527966?tab=stats\n\nOlaf did 20k more damage to champions than anyone else on your team.
