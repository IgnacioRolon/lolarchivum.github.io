Lets just say I have to deal with this same issue quite a bit along with the occasional death threat and all I do is send in a ticket with a few photos of the log. Funny part is shortly after I notice their near twice a game daily history go to zero activity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2015-06-24T19:55:58.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People need to actually report these types of people. More often than not when things like this happen people either forget to report, or move on to the next game because they are fumed up. People just assume the next person will report them in the next game or something. Let alone the fact people think things like this can be caught right on the spot. its just not possible. if this is a first offense do you really think someone account should be permanently banned because of that? No or else i would assume every single person would have gotten banned by now. People have mess ups and hopefully its just a one time thing! Also learn to use the mute button. If people are always chatting about stuff like this, you only make it worse when you retaliate, so let them chat while you have them muted! report them afterwards and if they continue to act like that theyll get hit with a ban. Yes it may take awhile, but that is how the system works!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-06-24T18:40:53.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people are allowed to get pissed,  I dont agree with death threats/wishes, but really you cant expect people to:\n\nA. Not get mad\nor\nB. when they get mad to not say anything.\n\nIts tough to be in a competitive environment where no one person is entirely at fault.  Maybe for a single instance it was that one person's fault, but not the whole game.  Team effort, Team fault.  If you lose a game, you did something wrong along with your whole team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-06-24T18:39:27.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"captain ginyu sucks","replies":[]}]}
