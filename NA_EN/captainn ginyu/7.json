As someone with cancer, he says that he quite frankly finds cancer jokes to be alright and uses them himself. I think it was something along the lines that he's glad we can all unite around cancer as being a bad thing, and it doesn't bother him to see it casually tossed about.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2017-02-15T00:06:09.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's is not to say that some people won't find cancer jokes offensive, similar to how jokes about death tend to be difficult for some people to deal with.

But the fact they DID take even that small amount of time, shows that they at least care a LITTLE bit.\n\nEDIT: Hell i saw another post from a few days ago where RiotTantrum pulled some strings to get someone who was permabanned for saying HORRIBLE things to only a 14 day ban for the only reason being: EVERYONE in the game, both teams, knew who he was, they were shit talking and reported him as a joke. As dumb as that example is it still shows Riot members do go out of there way sometimes to help/encourage their players.","replies":[{"poster":"KillerBoss V2","date":"2017-02-14T00:16:52.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"w0w thats cool, i got permabanned for asking for help on the boards. \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/vXJF3Q2A-gets-a-chat-restriction-for-getting-flamed-by-4-people\n\nriot cares a lot don't they. from 10 game chat ban to perma ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Segius","date":"2017-02-14T01:08:58.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You Deserved it though","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-02-13T15:47:09.713+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats, man!
