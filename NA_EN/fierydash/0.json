Also when I was in champion select on my second game the background music suddenly stopped. Apart from that I didn&#039;t notice anything buggy.\n\nHave a nice day :D\n\nEdit: this bug happens still, but if you go to edit your mastery page from there you can select another mastery page and it will work, that's the only way better around this, besides keeping to change that mastery page to fit our needs.","replies":[{"poster":"MakaiTiger","date":"2016-06-07T21:11:00.165+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing here. I would pick my mage mastery page and on the loading screen realize that I had some other page that I didn't pick. Also ARAM games. Only time it's worked so far is when I went in to edit my mastery pages and then left it without changing anything. Dunno if I just got lucky though >.>","replies":[{"poster":"FieryDash","date":"2016-06-08T08:34:44.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, that's the only way around it for now it seems.

I wanted to try ARAM at first.. I got Ryze, chose my Dark Crystal Ryze skin, chose my AP runes and masteries.. In loading screen, I noticed I had my basic skin and about 5 minutes in-game I noticed I didn't even have my masteries changed (had my AD jungle masteries with Fervor of Battle instead of my AP masteries with Thunderlord's)","replies":[{"poster":"FieryDash","date":"2016-06-07T16:45:30.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, mine was on my Kayle mastery page that I played on the old client, I already sent a report with this bug, but maybe we can play around it for now, because I played another game and still was on my Kayle page but I tried to change it for what I needed at the moment without selecting another mastery page and it worked. So for now I guess that'll do xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"RagingPhoenix","date":"2016-06-07T22:32:24.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, when I picked my Project Lucian skin, in game it was the classic skin","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Res√∂nance","date":"2016-06-08T03:40:17.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem, unless i change the masteries through the edit my mastery pages don't switch.
