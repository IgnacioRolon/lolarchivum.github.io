It was 1680x1050 now its 1920x1080. Before when I played league of any other game it would work fine. Now with this new monitor after playing for about 10-45 min it loses my mointor signal which leaves my pc on and the only way to turn it on is to restart computer manually. I have checked the cables used both different HDMI and VGA cables both work until I start gaming. If I use the browser or anything but games, it works fine. I have also tried to change in-game resoultion from 1920x1080 back to 1680x1050 which did not change anyting. Any ideas what could be the problem. Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T00:06:16.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your resolution may be too big for league too support, especially if it's over 1080 or a 4K.

My screen isn't 4k or 3D its just a basic 1920x1080 so I don't know what the problem is. I sent out a ticket and atm im waiting for a reply.","replies":[]}]}]}
