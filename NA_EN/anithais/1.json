Thinking it was my internet, I left it be for a minute. My internet never went out. I went to task manager to force close League so I could reopen and reconnect. As I hit force close, it came up with a little warning that I couldn't read, since task manager was in the way, and it closed. Brought me back to the client and immediately let me join the queue again. There's no record of my game in my match history and I don't know the names of other of the other players to ask them if the same happened to them. I have no idea if the game simply vanished or if my Shaco is just standing in base right now as I join a new one...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-10T23:39:03.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do see a match here earlier that went unfinished.  While it's very rare, it looks like our servers failed to create the match.  It could show up in your match history, but it kind of acts like it never existed so there's no leaver penalties or adjustments to game stats.  Everything looks okay since then, so I hope you're enjoying the hunt.   :D  Thanks for the report!","replies":[]}]}
