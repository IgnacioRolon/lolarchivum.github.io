I play a lot of league of legends, probably more games than I should. This meaning that I&#039;m the kind of person to literally never drop a single day. I also attend university in NY full time along with a part time job near my parent&#039;s house in NJ. I have a different computer at both locations. Every week I spend Sun-Thu in school and Thu-Sun at my parent&#039;s house. So that means I log into my account from two separate IP addresses several hours apart (my commute is about two and a half hours). I understand why the system would find this to be sketchy behavior since I know not every is capable of signing into two different IP addresses to begin with. So I&#039;m not shocked that I was banned. I&#039;m more shocked with how it seemed to me that  all of the information I provided was taken for granted and how because of this mistake I&#039;m losing my rewards after my hard work. If I was at least banned for something like toxicity, which like many, yeah I could&#039;ve probably been a nicer player, I would at least understand and accept my punishment. The fact that I was banned for MMR boosting is ridiculous. Especially since if you look at my OP.GG you can easily see that all of my games are consistent. I am a support main with Flash on D and Ignite on F building pretty much the exact same items on each champion, playing pretty much the same champions, and even duoing with the exact same person I have been duoing with for nearly 3 years. (http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=xovation) I was able to provide them with my driver&#039;s license from NJ, my school ID from NY, my work schedule for the last 3 weeks, and my class schedule for the current semester. But clearly that is not enough to prove my innocence. With that said, I hope none of you find yourselves in the same situation I am in. And if you&#039;re also a person who travels often and has an IP change every time they log in then I urge you to be careful because clearly whatever magical system they have in place to prove who is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; isn&#039;t very accurate.\r\n\r\nHere are links of my support ticket and chat log: http://prntscr.com/hkmnb3 http://prntscr.com/hkmn5a\r\n\r\ntldr; I was banned for MMR boosting on an account I never shared because I commute every weekend to and from school (NJ to NY). And even when I provided personal and substantial information, it was overlooked and decided that whatever &quot;system&quot; they had in place was superior.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-08T16:38:25.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're unable to assist with these suspension cases over the boards (neither Broporo nor I have the resources); however, I'm replying to this one because it's gained a lot of visibility.  \n\nWe're pretty good about overturning suspensions when a mistake or false positive is found.  I asked our PB team to take another look, and confirmed that the correct action was taken.  Your best bet would be to continue speaking with our player behavior specialists in your ticket if you have further concerns, as they'll have the tools and resources to offer more context than I can.  \n\nIf anyone else is in a similar situation, reach out to our player behavior team through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and we'll assist you directly there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marlon195","date":"2017-12-08T14:27:48.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sucks man.
