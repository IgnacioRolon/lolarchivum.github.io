Let&#039;s look at their poor attempt at relieving the boosting problem.\r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204168430\r\n\r\n**&quot;THE PROCESS\r\nWhile we can&rsquo;t reveal our systems or boosting detection, we can say with confidence that we&rsquo;re looking at the right data, we double- and triple-check that data, and maintain a strong commitment to accuracy.\r\n\r\nWe start with a deep knowledge of each individual&#039;s play style and performance history.\r\nWe compare millions of players&rsquo; histories to spot unusual patterns and behaviors that indicate boosting.\r\nThe system is double checked vigorously by Rioters with a very strong eye to eliminate false positives.&quot;**\r\n\r\nWhile there is just &quot;ate up like soup sandwich&quot; all over that link, i just want to focus on &quot;the process&quot;. First I would like to ask, am I allowed to link a players match history and screen shot their most played champs, or would that be &quot;calling somebody out&quot;? If so, I would love to show you how much of a joke they think their own process is, if not, well let me just talk about it!\r\n\r\n**&quot;We start with a deep knowledge of each individual&#039;s play style and performance history.&quot;** - So last season, I reported 3 people, not a single one got rewards taken away, this season I have reported 7 i think? including the repeated offenders. I really hope I can get the OK to link player stats and profiles etc etc, but since i cant i will TALK about 1 of these individuals. So this player I semi know IRL. I used to play with them all the time early this season, now, not so much. This player is a support main, only time they would play a non support champ is if we did custom 5v5s if it was just a 5 man premade or just them playing in solo Q, it was always support. And since on multiple occasions i got to lane against them and lane WITH them, I can for certain say that this player is pure garbage and definitely deserves the bronze 1 season and low silver elo that they rightfully earned. So this person being in my  social circle, I knew that the player actually was getting boosted by a friend. So followed by about 100+ support games, all doing rather poor with a few non support games with straight up feeding, this player goes on some miraculous ranked win streak using champions that not only have they never played, but champions that take more skill to use successfully than the actual player is capable of producing. If i am allowed to show the data, you will be thinking &quot;riot why you lying? why you always lying, ooooo oh my god......&quot;. ONNN TO THE NEXT ONE!\r\n\r\n**&quot;We compare millions of players&rsquo; histories to spot unusual patterns and behaviors that indicate boosting.&quot;** - Will update if I am allowed to share information of players.\r\n\r\n**&quot;The system is double checked vigorously by Rioters with a very strong eye to eliminate false positives.&quot;** - Will update if I am allowed to share information of players.\r\n\r\nHas anybody actually had a friend that&#039;s been boosted by a friend(not a website) that has actually been caught? Because I sure have not.\r\n\r\nI wanted this to be more in depth, but it&#039;s hard to if i cannot share player information.","replies":[]}
