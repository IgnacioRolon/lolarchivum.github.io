I've watched him repeatedly dive Marksmen without allies next to them and dying because she doesn't have the burst to kill them. Sometimes he gets everything lined up and does a nice burst of damage...and then can't do anything for 2-3 seconds because all of her stuff is on cooldown. He has to build partly tanky just to survive her cooldowns and has to shroud in almost every fight.\n\nAnd the carries still escape because Akali can't go after them while her stuff is on cooldown. I swear the ult cooldown nerf has screwed him more than any other change.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2016-11-20T17:59:45.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Weren't the assassin changes to prevent 100-0 people?

That was the entire purpose to the assassin rework was specifically to make it so that wasn't how they worked by giving them counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-11-21T01:20:30.287+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"the counterplay to an assassin was not letting them do that. good warding to prevent flanks and paying attention to where you are in a teamfight\n\nthere is absolutely no reason that a carry should get outflanked and caught alone and be able to kill the assassin in a duel. inexcusable.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-11-21T01:24:48.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, that isn't how counterplay works. Counterplay is 'you did something, here's what I can do to mitigate what you just did'. Counterplay is dodging a skillshot, it's standing next to allies to prevent Kha'Zix's isolation damage, it's backing off when you see Gnar's rage bar is getting full, it's watching your opponent blow cooldowns and knowing they have no abilities left to use. Warding to prevent flanks is good game sense, but it isn't counterplay, especially with the changes to stealth.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-11-21T01:31:38.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"taking preventative measures is counterplay\n\nthere's too much counterplay to assassins now.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-11-21T01:33:33.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Certain assassins who are perhaps undertuned maybe, but to assassins as a whole?

LeBlanc, Zed, and Ekko have always been on the higher end difficulty wise, and while Kat used to be simple, the skill required to play her went through the fucking roof with her update. If any of those 4 have positive win rates it means they're probably overpowered. Akali is admittedly pretty trash right now, which is why she's the first assassin to be getting buffs. Talon, Shaco, and Fizz I'm not familiar with enough to comment on.\n\nEDIT: Here's an example.

I rarely play assassins and have luttle experience but I felt like her damage was very low.

I also would like to see Twlight Shroud's blink much longer. If the AoE was smaller but it was a true blink and left smoke clouds at both locations it would allow for more gameplay.\n\nI would like to see more gameplay with her Ulti instead of it being a dash that deals a little damage. Perhaps if she dashes from Twilight Shroud to a enemy she stays invisible for 0.5 sec.\n\nRiot wanted minor changes since they plan a full rework and VU. But I think they could have done more without needing to invest a ton of art into new effects. Just some added functionality.\n\nEach assassin should have a niche, I don't see what Akali's is, she has low damage and very little disengage.

After that I started play various other champs, which is actually a good thing. I googled every month, looking for information about when the champion I enjoyed the most would once again be playable, then I read after the Taric rework. Something like a year later, the Taric rework arrived, and I was told to wait another year (I believe) for the assassin update, where Akali was a central part. At that point, I got really mad, and abandoned League of Legends until Rito was able do to what they promised. Now, the Akali rework has arrived, and it is done extremely poorly.\n\nThere is no synergy between any of her abilities.\n\nHer passive is worse in terms of healing AND damage, the old passive made her deal more damage on the 1st AA, and all AAs after the second, and added some spellvamp that was the only way to survive in lane. ATM the new passive only gives slightly more damage on the second AA.\n\nThe E, which is pretty much only useful for waveclear since you removed Q procs has reduced dps, which hurts her waveclear and split pushing capabilities.\n\nThe non reducable cooldown on R makes you unable to chase anything down as soon you are hit by ANY kind of CC. But hey! Why would you want to chase people anyway, when all you are actually good at is to hide in your W?\n\nTLDR; My boycott goes on until the sun is extinguished, Hell freezes over, and Akali gets the love she needs utterly. In fact, I believe that Graves will get his cigar back before Akali gets the promissed update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessIsolation","date":"2016-11-20T18:43:36.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think it is damage in general? Cooldown gating? Or a combination of the two in her rotation? I remember before the best way to get all your damage was to Q someone and then shroud (which should be easier in fights with the free hop with W) Dash > proc the Q/passive> Q> proc. \n\nI'm not an avid akali player or anything, but I'm just not sure what can be changed without changes in her kit functionality... E still feels kind of worthless except as an energy dump (at least I have yet to see a reason to use it over anything else) or am I missing something with her E?","replies":[{"poster":"ehaugw","date":"2016-11-21T02:54:08.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"E is very usefull for life stealing minions and hitting minions that are slightly out of auto attack range.
