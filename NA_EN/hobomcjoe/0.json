While it&#039;s nice to finally see who they will be changing, some of these choices are confusing to me. In my opinion, only Cassiopeia and Zyra are the two champs here that are in dire need of some changes. The rest, especially Vel&#039;Koz, feel less in need of changes than some other immobile mages that are not on the list, such as Galio, Swain, or maybe even Annie. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think that, for the most part, they picked the right champions. Choosing Vel&#039;Koz of all mages to change just mystifies me, especially with all the people asking specifically for him not to be changed. There are other mages struggling and I&#039;m wondering if I can get any insight as to why they picked these 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-22T05:21:16.004+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":20,"body":"Statikk and the other folks working on the mage update will be talking in detail about why these particular champs. At a high level our goal with these class updates is to increase distinction between characters. With the mage update especially we're also looking at some champions that are distinct, but when functional aren't healthy for the game or are in an ok spot already but have a fair bit of untapped potential for differentiation. \n\n \n**Ought to bring more distinct things to a team:**\n\n* Vel'Koz - Really distinct to play as, cohesive, feels fair to play against. Doesn't bring enough distinct to a team though, so lacks a clear strategic niche or specialized tool offered. Goal with him will be to offer clearer situations where he's the right pick when you want AP poke.\n\n* Brand - Pretty similar to Vel'Koz overall, in that he lacks a clear enough niche, so primary gameplay argument for picking him is when he's the most damaging AOE mage. Needs a somewhat more distinct toolkit basically. \n\n\n \n**Distinct, but have significant game health challenges:**\n\n* Vlad - Does distinct things, but can be really unhealthy. Work on Vlad's going to involve a lot of 'how do we preserve the core of what he does while adding ways to play against him'.\n\n* Malz - More game health issues than anything else. Counterplay's not great in particular, with Malz needing to just click on you and kill you given his squishiness, immobility, lack of reach, vulnerability to item system counters. Has a lot of distinctive stuff going on though. \n\n\n \n**Untapped potential/Confused identities:**\n\n* Cass - Confused identity, unclear niche (sustained damage almost marksmen like pattern, versus poison spreading potential, versus stacking power, versus counter initiator etc). Work on Cass will need to start with constructing a clear picture of what her concept should be (suspect that'll include stripping out the stacking gameplay, though that's a guess). \n\n* Zyra - Does reasonably distinctive things, but has the potential for quite a bit more. Also ends up either a strong bully or struggling to function a bit too often.\n\n\nFinally, as with the marksman update in preseason, we'll also be making some small tweaks to a number of other mages at the same time as these bigger changes (things like the Q reset on Twitch for example).\n","replies":[{"poster":"Zorae42","date":"2016-01-22T05:30:59.232+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why did you leave out the long range mages: {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}}  ?\n\nThey all have similar abilities and don't really have distinct niches.

And it makes me concerned. Before with the changes I always knew they were coming from a good place, even if they weren't well received or ended up bad or completely missed the mark. But this reads as change for the sake of change.\n\nFor example I hate that you added a mini game and flipped Garen's power curve, but at least I could understand your reasoning behind it. \n\nOr even not going back and re-reworking Mordekaiser into something not whatever the hell he is now, since you don't see the payoff compared to the amount of effort to put into it. I disagree on the payoff to effort ratio of it and keeping Morde in that state, but I agree objectively that eventually you do need to move on.\n\nBut here you are saying you are changing a well liked, built, unique to play champion for a reason that seems very arbitrary and, at least in my experience playing against Vel'koz, false. Playing against Vel'koz affected how I built as I want health more than straight MR because of his passive, and there are a lot of champions that rely on damage reduction or high MR to do their thing and get shredded by Vel. Back with the old Poppy, Vel was one of the few champions I would be careful not to pick Poppy into because his passive countered my passive. He is really the only mage in the game that says damage reduction and MR aren't the best ways to neutralize my damage against me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArisesInMight","date":"2016-01-23T02:37:49.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"It's not really a matter of trust, is it?

Why pick Xerath when you can pick Lux? Why pick Akali when you can pick Kat/Diana? Why pick Kha when you can pick Rengar? Why pick Amumu when you can pick Nautilus? Why pick Leona when you can pick Ali? I could go on for ages with multiple examples for each champ.\n\nThat kind of logic is EXTREMELY dangerous to use. There are zero champions that don't share some overlap with other champions. Here is the logic you need to be considering instead. If something is not broken by any stretch of the imagination, then why focus resources on trying to fix something that doesn't need repair? \n\nTo compare situations, lets say you have an older model of a car. It runs perfectly, the engine is in great condition, but the paint has a very small scratch on it. Would it make sense to replace the engine? Another example, I get a small cut on my head but I am worried about infection. So I go to the doctor and they think its a good idea to amputate my leg while treating my cut. Was the amputation necessary?\n\nBasically, this word they are using, \"distinction\", has no value when it comes to gameplay. The only value it holds is when you are looking at a champions popularity. To rework a champion purely based on that is the epitome of insanity. Look at Xerath. They reworked him completely based of popularity, he was overly strong for a short while, but now that he is balanced, he is even LESS POPULAR than before the rework. So all that work they did was literally pointless in the long run.\n\nIt comes down to this, not every champion has to be a \"special snowflake\" to be a well designed and balanced champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-01-23T00:00:15.908+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> To compare situations, lets say you have an older model of a car. It runs perfectly, the engine is in great condition, but the paint has a very small scratch on it. Would it make sense to replace the engine? \n\nThis honestly makes little sense because the comparison is so far removed from this discussion; the differences between champions is more like the difference between the kind of _vehicle_ you drive, or at least it's supposed to be. With these examples, whether you pick Vel'Koz over Xerath, Ziggs, Lux or champions within that vein of long range poke machines with strong waveclear is more along the lines of a question about car models. \n\nThe question in that regard is more like whether you pick one model of the same car brand over another, such as the same kind of Humvee, where as what the plan is with these reworks is to make these champions different kinds of cars, so instead of picking just another kind of Humvee, you're picking another brand of car that does what a Humvee does, but has its own reasons for driving. In the grander scheme of things champion classes would be entire vehicle types with this kind of perspective; do you like playing tanks/driving trucks or playing assassins/driving motorcycles, that kinda deal.\n\nLet's look at the adc reworks that came in, in particular, Graves. Graves before was basically considered a worse Lucian, and if the opposite was true Lucian was effectively the worse version of Graves, because their inherent playstyle was so similar in a role that is very specific in itself. Graves's rework changed him to be much more distinct and occupy his own niche, and is now way different from Lucian even though he occupies the same gameplay space: adc. Going back to the car analogy, it's more like before, Lucian and Graves were makes of the same brand of car, but now they're two different car brands that do specific things better than the other, while still at their core being the same kind of thing.\n\nIn Vel'Koz's case the aim is to make him more distinct within the bounds of his own gameplay niche; long range poke machine with great wave clear. Right now the class of champions he's in, which includes champions like Ziggs, Xerath and Lux, is more like a car brand as opposed to each champion being its own brand of car. They're all the same kind of BMW, where as Riot's aim is to maybe have one of them be the BMW, while another is the Hyundai and another is the Honda. They're all still effectively the same kinda thing; a champion with a specific function, but with this line of thinking they go from all being effectively the same champion with slight differences between them, to similar champions that while encompassing the same role, offer something themselves that determines why you'd pick them over the others other than the fact they're just mathematically better, which is a curse some champions have suffered from in the past and continue to suffer from. \n\n> Basically, this word they are using, \"distinction\", has no value when it comes to gameplay. \n\nIt kinda does because if that distinction didn't exist this near 130 champion roster would effectively play like a 20 champion roster. There are distinct reasons why people pick certain tanks over others from a gameplay standpoint; more reliable engage, more raw tankiness, more crowd control, more inherent damage, synergy with certain stats, etc. There are distinct reasons why people pick certain marksmen from a gameplay standpoint, range, damage output, mobility, safety, etc. Champions being distinct from one another means they offer these things in different ways and overlap can exist, but each will shine in its own way in the end. That's what the whole mage update is about, it's not to destroy champion identities or increase champion popularity or whatever, it's all about making each champion in itself a fun and unique experience to play as and against, such that anyone who plays this game can find something to have fun with, while at the same time allowing each champion to have its own unique role that it can do in its own way even if it overlaps with others.\n\nI think I ended up going way to far with this car analogy, but either way the tl;dr is this: Vel'Koz is fun, he's fair, he's cool. But he's so similar to champions who fill his role that he competes with them for room in the roster from a gameplay angle. Riot wants to give him, and other immobile mages, and other champions in general more breathing room in regards to that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2016-01-22T06:17:37.026+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":7,"body":"I'm just gonna say it again, I threw the comment in the official thread.\n\nIt is not a good Idea, it will not end well, and there will be no good that will come of it.

A lot of champs become sitting ducks for skillshots simply due to a fifteen frame animation but Syndra becomes an unstoppable kiter to anyone she outranges (800 range spells will outrange pretty much any auto attack) and if she dodges a champ's important skillshot the harassing and zoning will come in full force.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-01-22T07:58:32.549+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">A lot of champs become sitting ducks for skillshots simply due to a fifteen frame animation but Syndra becomes an unstoppable kiter to anyone she outranges (800 range spells will outrange pretty much any auto attack) and if she dodges a champ's important skillshot the harassing and zoning will come in full force.\n\nYes, that's true, it also doesn't matter early game, which is when Dark Sphere is utterly garbage.

I've tried playing vel'koz myself, i've watched friends play vel'koz, i've watched streamers play vel'koz, and he definitely comes off as somewhat unique to play as but still doesn't add anything unique to his team. His range is so-so, his waveclear is pretty good, his ult can deal damage with good positioning, and he has some cc. If he lands his skillshots he can deal damage and combos deal more damage, but none of that is really unique and people won't pick him unless they just happen to like the guy or his numbers happen to be out of whack to the point where he beats out other champions that are functionally the same.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-01-22T08:04:49.214+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vel'koz is fine... has a fine niche and most importantly...

It 'counters' building resistances but no one builds resistances without getting a bunch of hp first, and raw hp is the best defense against true damage. It basically just means he has extra damage on his combos when every mage already tries to land combos and a lot of mages already have bonuses when they land combos.\n\nAlso, his poke range really qualifies as just ok compared to REAL poke champs and he doesn't really get true damage just from poking since there's a small window where he has to land another spell or two afterwards, that's really a true damage combo, not poke.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-01-22T17:10:12.678+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, being the only true damage poke mage in the game he counters resistance stacking, which is why you pick him.

Even Galio just gains benefit from MR but as a tank he still needs to build a lot of health (and planning for a galio pick is hilariously nonsensical)\n\nIf you know the enemy will build MR because you have a lot of AP on your team, then an AD champ is better than Vel'koz. If you see an enemy vel'koz getting fed you should still build MR because only 12% of his damage will end up being true, the vast majority is still magic. It changes nothing.\n\nTrue damage is strategically the same as more damage. It isn't universally relevant no matter if you're ahead or behind like %hp damage, it doesn't counter tanks as hard as %hp damage, you keep saying he gets it on his poke when he doesn't, he just gets it when he does combos for lots of  damage just like every mage in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-01-22T17:54:34.906+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> True damage is strategically the same as more damage. \n\nThat shows a drastic misunderstanding of this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-01-22T18:36:49.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sixdogman,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cn8t24G7,comment-id=00040006000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-22T17:54:34.906+0000)\n>\n> That shows a drastic misunderstanding of this game.\n\nThat shows a drastic misunderstanding of the definition of 'strategic'\nHP is still good against him, MR is even still good against him because most of his damage is still magic.
