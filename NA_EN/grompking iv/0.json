Also when i tried to login again it just sat there authenticating and loading i let it sit for a while and realized it was not going to let me log in after 3 hours.  I searched far and wide to see if i could fix the problem if there was a way to fix I could not find anything that would work. Please fix this don't have any one else endure this.","replies":[{"poster":"GrompKing IV","date":"2017-11-08T22:07:25.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok guys all that was wrong is that a internet filter Covenant Eyes had a corrupted file and did not update with the rest of every thing so if you have covenant eyes just call up customer support and uninstall and reinstall the most current version.RESOLVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"TheWildestBoy","date":"2017-11-08T22:56:14.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did you find this out?
