There is literally zero risks to him stealing anyone's ult in a fight unless he takes something useless to him like Zoe's ult. \r\n\r\n(Complete bias due to the fact that I just faced one who carried his team in a 4v5 pretty much singlehandedly)","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Q Misser","date":"2019-04-17T05:01:18.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"His ult is a skillshot with 1050 range? It can be flashed, dashed, blinked etc. He has to hit it to get a 4th ability\n\nWhat I find weird is that so many ultimates have high AP scaling and Magic damage, so when Sylas gets it, it's like their ult but much more damage. Sylas with Hecarim ult is probably the most busted thing you'll witness btw","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-04-17T05:25:27.633+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not a skillshot.
