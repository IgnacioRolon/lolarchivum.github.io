Invisible power is any kind of stat increase that can't be interacted with. Steroids are invisible power, buffs are invisible power, damage reduction is invisible power. The visual FX has little to do with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2017-12-29T09:25:20.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because they're the most uninteractive class in the game. Their entire archetype is invisible power. Some enchanters (especially enchanter hybrids) aren't included in that (like Rakan and Taric) because both of them have to interact to heal (Rakan has to hit a skillshot and Taric has to keep auto attacking to stack his Q). All enchanters generally do is press a shield/heal button and loiter and occasionally cast summoner spells.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2017-12-29T09:55:25.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cuz they take no skill obviously :^)\n\nand no one likes laning w/ them because you basically afk farm unless they are said mains of that champ and knows to actually try to do something","replies":[]},{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2017-12-29T07:41:44.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk why, I really like to kick enchanters during lane phase","replies":[]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2017-12-29T12:07:29.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because they're supports which outdamage carries in the early game, have amazing build options, have **outstanding** peel for their team and shields and heals to keep their team alive.\n\nAdditionally, they're supports which press 1-2 buttons and their job is done. As such there's not much room for interaction either in laning or mid game if they play passive, e.g. Janna shield.\n\nFurthermore, they actually get rather tanky due to the stats. attached to items such as Locket, Sightstone, Redemption and Talisman. This defeats the whole \"utility supports are squishy\" concept. \n\nIf that still doesn't convince you why they're frustrating I should also say that enchanters are overloaded with utility. Janna has a knockup, slow+self movespeed, movespeed for allies, a shield which grants AD and a heal+knockback.\n Lulu has a slow, bonus damage, an obnoxious targeted CC ability or attack speed+movespeed buff, a shield which gives her ally bonus damage or a targeted harassment tool which allows for her Q to almost be guaranteed to hit, and then she has a temporary HP steroid which knocks up nearby enemies+slows enemies around her target.\nSoraka is honestly the only \"balanced\" enchanter because she's not overloaded with utility. She mainly heals, occasionally silences and tosses out a slow every few seconds. \nNami is an odd one. She is overloaded, however she isn't that frustrating to play against because her primary peel ability is rather slow and easy to avoid.\n\nOverall, enchanters are far too good at what they do and are frustrating to play against because unlike wardens they hardly ever commit themselves to a fight, they just sit at the back providing utility and peeling for their allies if anyone gets too close. Although, if Janna's E and Lulu's W were skillshots they'd be much less frustrating to fight. \n\nP.S: Remove Ardent Censer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-29T07:54:41.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because enchanter buffs are invisible power.","replies":[]}]}
