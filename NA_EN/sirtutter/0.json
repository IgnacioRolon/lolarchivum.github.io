And they look awesome (Personal opinion). A thing i have noticed tho, is that the Minions aperence sometimes are different from the standard, due to events like, Stargurdians, Arcade, Snowday, Beach Party and so on. This (obviously) means that minions have skins.\r\n\r\nThe idea is wery simple really. Since You &quot;in game&quot; under the boss Battle event could turn the arcade look on and off, people had different looking Rifts in the same game. With all the minions different looks, Why not make it an option to BUY minion skins. Arcade Minions 500 RP or something. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a simple yet great idea, that can make the Rift an even more awesome place.\r\n\r\nIm SirTutter from EU West, and thank you for Reading this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"wiplash da beast","date":"2017-08-30T07:48:34.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think this is a great idea but yeah ip not rp or maybe an item that upgrades minions but there could be different items that gave the wave  buffs like movement speed extra damage or more health  as well as changing there appearance","replies":[]},{"poster":"QueenOrigana","date":"2017-09-02T05:14:39.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a pretty cool idea but buy the skins with ip not rp plzðŸ˜‰","replies":[]},{"poster":"He Who Has No Pi","date":"2017-08-30T00:47:28.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maby ip not rp?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roaming Noman","date":"2017-08-29T20:29:16.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing in this game you can buy that changes the look only for you.
