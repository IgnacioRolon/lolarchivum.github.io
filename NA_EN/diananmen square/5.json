I'm legitimately curious, because compared to pretty much any other mage in the game, Anivia has the most trouble farming, despite being incredibly gold-reliant in order to get her RoA and Seraph's as quickly as possible.\n\nNow, I can understand having bad basic attacks as a weakness. Anivia's a burst mage who specializes in area control, and has rather high damage, fantastic CC, a really good wall, and a revival passive. All this on top of one of the best waveclears in the game, as long as she has enough mana and AP to use it as such.\n\nThe problem, then, lies in farming without her ultimate, which is what you'll want to focus on pre-6 anyway. Anivia has incredibly low AD, low enough that farming under her turret is a massive pain. Combined with a low attack speed and moderate projectile speed, and it becomes really easy to whiff the minion. And with slow attack frames, you have to stand (hover?) in a potentially bad spot for noticeably longer than most midlaners to get the attack off, the frustration of which is compounded by her attack sound playing before the crystal launches--the same problem that Quinn and Garen have received complaints about in the past.\n\nI mean, even Karthus got his abysmal attack frames buffed at some point after his VU, despite that he can easily just farm with Lay Waste, and possibly harass the enemy in the process. Why does Anivia deserve such an awkward attack in this environment?","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-06-28T02:21:29.076+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i used to play a lot of Anivia, i noticed two things: her pre-6 harass sucks, but her pre-6 mana costs/waveclear are amazing. Her pre-6 harass is mostly autoattacks unless you have an opponent that cant dodge the Q, and having 600 range helps. Her windup and recoil animation are very long, and i get that. But if you had a fast auto-animation, you really cant leave her 600 range - id rather have 600 range and a slow animation than, say, 550 range and a fast animation (if we remember Annie, both her 625 range and her attack speed were nerfed when they decided to change her). And its not like Anivia has amazing kill pressure pre-6 to want to get a ton of autoattack harass off. \n\nAnivia has very little problems farming pre 6, since her Q (if you get both procs off) can clear the casters ridiculously early into the game. You need to clear the melees, and having 600 range allows you to do that safely. Her base AD is fairly normal for a ranged Mage. Its not as bad as Vlad, Fiddle, or Annie, but its not as strong as Morg or Lux. Its also fairly normal in growth. \n\nAlso, in comparison to some other champs, her autoattack isnt abnormally bad. I find that a lot of Mids have horrible auto animations. I find that Malz, Veigar, Heimer, Karthus, and Swain's animations are just as hard to farm with.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-06-28T04:34:50.008+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"karthus uses autoattacks?
