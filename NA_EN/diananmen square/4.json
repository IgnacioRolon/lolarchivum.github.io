Thank you for sharing this insight with us! Have a +1.\n\nMy personal opinion is that Champion mastery needs to become rolled into the ranking system (as was my initial proposal almost 3 and a half years ago. I'm actually pretty stoked to have champion mastery, its almost verbatim what I described in that post, right down to measuring the score weighed against the position played and the average for that champion in that role across all levels) and that this would help it to function a lot like Smite's True skill. The premise would be that in order to prevent abuse of the system wins and losses still need to account for the bulk of skill determination. If you are more skilled you should win. Plain and simple. But additionally if we used champion master scores to inflate or deflate MMR and LP gains based on personal performance then players who perform very well in a loss will still lose LP and MMR, but lose a whole lot less. Players who perform poorly in a win and get carried would still gain LP and MMR, but gain a whole lot less. The gains and losses would more accurately reflect a players performance in game and players would achieve an accurate skill ranking far more quickly and with a greater degree of accuracy as well. And the possibility of abusing personal performance would be limited, sure you could try to up that creep score/KDA/ward score/objective control score instead of helping the team win, but you are still going to lose LP and MMR when your greed causes you to lose. It will be better to do those things as a natural effort of playing the game to win it since you will advance that way far more quickly. That was my 2 cents back in 2012, and I thank you heartily for sharing yours!","replies":[{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2015-07-28T14:49:14.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I'm reading this right, but if I play a Mastery Rank 1 {{champion:91}} and do badly on him, I will lose more LP than my Mastery 3 {{champion:54}} ?

It's only your confusion about my statement because I was not clear with it that makes it seem less than ideal. Allow me to explain.\n\nThe mastery level of the champion you play has no effect on your ranking. None.\n\nThe mastery score and rating you receive in the end game lobby would in my proposed change. If you play {{champion:91}} in a win and get an S+ rating for the game (This is usually achieved by having good CS totals, KDA, objective control and towers taken since they are weighed more heavily for that champ when played in his standard role of mid) that S+ rating would show a high degree of skill. The win confirms it. So instead of getting 22 LP with an average MMR for the division your are in you would get, say 35 LP and your MMR gain (say it was at 1400 and would be bumped to 1435 after the match under the current system) would likewise reflect that high degree of skill and you would get bonus MMR and bump up to say, 1470.\n\nConversely, lets say you play him in a win where you receive a D rating for whatever reason (played badly and fed despite best efforts, or afked due to some reason and missed half the match). In this example you would still gain some LP and some MMR. But that gain would be modified due to the fact that you displayed a low level of skill and or effort. Instead of +22 LP you would get only +10. Instead of bumping from 1400 MMR to 1435 you would bump to 1425. This would more accurately rank players according to the skill they displayed. It would work the same for losses. An S rating in a loss would mean you don't lose too much LP or MMR and you will feel less disgruntled about being unable to win a match your teammates didn't want to work together in. This proposal helps solo Q dramatically by reducing the amount of stress one feel from playing in games while simultaneously performing the function of ranking players more accurately and more appropriately.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2015-07-28T00:38:16.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot mentioned that they might make it so that if you are in promos for a division you have already be in, you would start with 1 win already.

You win and gain 20 LP this time putting you at 29 LP Gold 4 (the 9 leftover from the previous win plus the 20 for winning the pseudo-promo).  \nOk lets say same scenario but you lose the pseudo-promo.
