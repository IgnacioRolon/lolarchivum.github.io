The way you counter annoyingly mobile champions is with targetted hard-CC. The problem is, {{champion:105}} now goes top lane building full tank so even if you can hard-CC him there's no guarantee he will die. He will go in, kill your squishy, and come out unscathed or (if you hard-CC him for a bit) partially scathed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurningRice","date":"2015-08-14T14:22:15.420+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly ap fizz isn't even that big of a deal to me anymore.
