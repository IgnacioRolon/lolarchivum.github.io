And once they fall behind they get instantly burst by fed champs so they tend to fall even further behind (unlike something like alistair who can be tanky almost no matter what). Second most lack easy to land accessible cc (like a thresh hook or flay). Nami, janna and bard actually do have this type of cc which is why you see them occasionally. But sona has no hard cc except her ult. Same with soraka and a lot of the others. They are getting better because itemization buffs (hello ardent censer/zekes/banner) but their lane remains undeniably weak, especially to ganks and the ap support item is relatively bad (especially the fully upgraded version in comparison to the other support items). \nTl;dr squishy supports suck when they are behind and most of them lack quick, easy cc outside ults.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-08-08T20:56:59.864+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno, his 39% pickrate seems to suggest he's a real top-tier pick.\n\nMaybe that's not quite crowding out, but he's certainly dominating pick-wise.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bouncemaster Zac","date":"2015-08-08T23:00:45.877+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OperationDEEZ1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hlJ4v56L,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-08T16:26:55.811+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:412}} is crowding out pretty much every utility support in the game right now.\n\nHe crowds out basically _every_ support, as he's almost (almost) objectively the best support in any and every composition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-08-08T21:57:33.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, I wish that {{champion:26}} could get some buffs to his kit.

Taric gives double the heal for 20 less mana.  I'd love to argue the shield makes it worthwhile but the thing lasts for such a short time that it's often fallen off by the time an enemy would have targeted your ally.   As for her movement speed bonus 10% movement speed buff for 1.5 seconds (Allies) on a 12 second cooldown is VERY weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-08-09T05:25:51.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not every single support in the game does or should be good early on, late Soraka is such a menace to deal with some teams actually have to focus her or she causes so many issues for whoever she is against. \n\nWhy is it fair to make her strong all throughout the game?

Tank supports run the issue of simply not being tanky, and having to be sparing with their CC\n\n\nI don't need her to be strong through out the entire game, i would however like her to have a reasonable cost on her heal in the early game.  80 mana is insanely high for a spell that heals for 30-40 hp, and provides a shield that disappears often before you notice it was there to begin with.  \n\nThe issue with comparing it to the hard CC that most tanks has is that you often don't have to land those more then twice.  If your playing a tanky support and you land a stun, provided your ADC doesn't totally miss the chance, you are going to get a lot of damage in maybe even a kill.  But let's assume you don't get the kill, your target is super damaged and has to either use up all their healing stuff or play super passive for the next couple mins.  If you land a second CC chances are you just secured a kill or two.  Basically land a spell twice in less then 3 mins and you get a kill.  With champions like Sona, you have to keep popping in and out of combat doing little ticks of damage each time.  You are likely looking at having to hit the enemy champions a dozen plus times to really have a lasting effect.  So basically i need to land 3 to 8 times as many spells on you to have the same effect that you get from one ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-08-09T06:26:43.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her heal scales off of the missing HP of whoever she heals, it's use shines during fights where it matters most anyway, because she hits a point where she is out healing other supports.\n\nAnd the minimum about of health she heals is low, that isn't the total though.

They miss their CC and they get slightly annoyed by some harass sometimes but yet when they hit a single one it's more often than not (assuming the ADC is not braindead and actually follows) it's a flash out of the enemy, maybe a kill or leaving the enemy completely zoned out due to how low that one CC took them.\n\nSona's heal doesn't get all that much stronger, it's at most a 165 + 0.3 AP ratio so while ok it's not that great, specially with the mana costs attached to it. The shield doesn't even last 2 seconds and is very weak until lvl 16 in which it turns out to be ok","replies":[]},{"poster":"only zhule","date":"2015-08-09T17:21:42.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silents429,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hlJ4v56L,comment-id=000a000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-09T06:26:43.091+0000)\n>\n> Her heal scales off of the missing HP of whoever she heals, it's use shines during fights where it matters most anyway, because she hits a point where she is out healing other supports.\n> \n> And the minimum about of health she heals is low, that isn't the total though.

So assuming i heal an ally that's at 50% health my heal will do 25% more healing.  So at rank 1 i will now be healing for 44 health on my ally up for the 35 if they were at full health (this assumes 20 AP from masteries and runes).  Also the shield would be fine to compensate for that, except that it's on a very very short timer when compared to any of the other shield based effects in game, they average about 4-5 seconds... Sona's is 1.5.\n\nI don't even have in issue with her heal in the late game, because by that point i've likely picked up some AP, and have 30-40% CDR.  At that point it's actually quite impressive and the mana cost isn't all that oppressive (100 mana at rank 5.... when i should have a proper mana regen item built)\n\n\nI still hold that she would be more viable, but not overpowered, if the rank one cost of her heal was reduced by 20 but the mana increase per rank was up to 10 per rank from its current 5 per rank.  Also double the length of her shield (maybe make it last .5 seconds longer for each ally tagged if you don't want to straight up double the length).  The shield isn't super strong as is, i might eat 1 basic attack from an ADC or a low ranked spell from a caster.  Also remember that her shield doesn't offer any bonuses like say Janna's does.  I figure that at 3 seconds of shield you can't keep it up 100% of the time, but it does make it so that their is a much higher chance of the shield actually blocking attacks instead of just popping on then off before doing any real good.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-08-09T20:42:13.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Missing health is a horrible thing to scale off of\n\nIs, is their any other time you'd heal someone?
