They took quite some minutes to finish our nexus off. Why do some people give up completely , even though we had a chance at winning? Because things don&#039;t go their way?\n\nDid they troll just to avoid LeaverBuster? Or was it because they wanted the game to end faster?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-16T16:45:10.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because Emotions are hard to deal with.

There's not much helping your team.\nIf between 15-25 or 20-30 minutes in (basically 10 minutes have gone by) and you're team still hasn't destroyed a tower. The game is lost.\n\nIf may feel like you have a chance to make a comeback but the sad reality is, it's very difficult. Basically because you spend a long amount of time defending the onslaught of minion waves and champions. There ends up being no room to relieve pressure.\n\nOf course, unless you have a Tryndamere on your team and he takes on for the team to dive turrets, all hope is gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2015-07-16T16:45:33.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When people see that they are losing, they feel its a lost cause and waste of time, so they surrender to end it and move on. Yet, some games arnt necessarily over just because they are currently losing. If seen teams comeback from simple things like split pushing, getting a baron, or even catching up in levels. Sadly, most people just assume its a lost cause and would rather give up entirely than take the chance for a comeback.","replies":[{"poster":"Diananmen Square","date":"2015-07-16T16:50:08.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a game where we could definetly comeback.

Its sad because you defeating the chance of any fed players have of making a comeback. And if you dont surrender people think YOU'RE the troll for continuing on.
