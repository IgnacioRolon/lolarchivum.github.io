I went to the store, though, and despite having enough IP on my client, it was showing that I did not have enough IP.  I made the image in the posted link then restarted my client to see if it would fix it.  When I logged on, it still showed having over 6400, but like 2 seconds after the client was done loading it went down to 5887 IP.  It's done that twice now upon reponing.  Still cannot buy Camille in the store.  Any idea what's going on? I'm pretty sure the 6400 number is correct because I've been saving for the past couple of days.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T21:27:35.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue I've seen for some players on the updated client.  Hop back on the legacy client to re-sync your balance!\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nAfterwards you can swap back to the updated version.  Let me know if that works for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Phasd","date":"2017-03-02T22:31:17.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It worked, thanks for the response Porocles :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-03-02T21:58:02.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Afterwards you can swap back to the updated version.
