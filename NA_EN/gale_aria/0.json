They make you think about which camps to smite how you can conserve your sustain and gives counter play.  There is a somewhat limiting factor on champs who can currently clear but that can always be tweaked later.\n\nOn the PBE I have tried Jax, Sion Hecarim, Elise, Nocturne, WW, Diana, Nunu, Udyr, Skarner, Shaco and Nautilus.  Out of all these the only hard clear was Nautilus.  All of these champions had time to clear and time to gank sometimes even keep all mobs down while ganking.  The sustain you get from the new jungler items is a bit lacking but overall the diversity is where it is at.\n\nYou can grab warrior enchant for those hard hitting champs like Sion or Hecarim.  You can grab Juggernaut for those who need a bit of health like Skarner.(although I prefer this on SION and Hecarim but I usually play them tank.)  The magus is a bit underwhelming but still gives ap jungles some love.  And finally the Slayer enchant.  This is a perfect item on jax nocturne and WW.  Scaling att spd with on hit damage.  I think I am in love.\n\nThe Smite options are also quite refreshing.\nStalkers give poor gankers a nice slow and some true damage.(I think this was made for Shyvana)\nPoachers give a reduced CD on smite and increased gold for invaded jungle creeps.(Shaco Nunu Lee Sin all benefit.)\nRangers Trailblazer drastically helps some slower clearers with AOE smite.(Sejuani Naut)\nSkirmishers is kinda a gank assist for those who already have sticking potential by giving a bit of damage on attack and vision when used on a player.
