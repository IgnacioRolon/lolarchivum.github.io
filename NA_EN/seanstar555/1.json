I received a message saying \"Promotion Series ended due to Inactivity\"... I was one win away from Silver III and I lost that opportunity NOT because of my hardware, but because of the game itself. I am sure that everyone else in the lobby also experienced this glitch.\r\nPlease fix this bug so that it doesn't happen to anyone else, and if you could put me back into promos that would be grand too. (I was at 1 win and 1 loss)\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"LORD TAMPON","date":"2018-01-20T06:26:01.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing has just happened to me as well I was 1 win and 1 loss in promos for silver 4 and then got the message \"Promotion Series ended due to Inactivity\" when I dodged queue for a ranked game. I'm not sure what I should do but just thought it should be mentioned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-07T16:16:33.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like a really strange issue, and I took a look into this to see what happened.  It looks like you had a queue dodge, which counted towards a loss in your series.  We aren't able to adjust promos or rankings, but we'd like to look into the error you had.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can take a closer look.","replies":[{"poster":"seanstar555","date":"2017-09-07T16:56:29.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made a ticket...
