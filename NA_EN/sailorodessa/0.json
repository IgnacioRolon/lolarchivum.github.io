Time to time I was experiencing weird lags, like if something was wrong with my ping, but ping didn't change at all. Same issue was happening to people from my friend's list. Today my ping was kind of stable, but it was around 215. The game was laggy and delayed. My Internet connection was just fine, as usual, I kept checking it every now and then. I'm not using Wi-Fi.\r\nPlease, help somehow, if you can.\r\nThank you in advance._\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T23:34:55.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different servers are in different locations, so while you may have a good latency or connection to one, you may encounter issues to another. These issues are most frequently impacted by network settings that conflict with League that are local to your network. The steps inside our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) are my recommend first steps to take.\n\nLet me know if you continue to have this issue,","replies":[{"poster":"SailorOdessa","date":"2016-09-24T14:15:18.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, thank you, I know that. I mostly play on NA. Yesterday for a few games my ping was over 200 again. I'm only reporting this because it didn't happen before. I had ping jumps, lags etc, but until recently I've never been having consistent 200+ ping.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T16:35:14.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see. Did the steps in the connection guide cause any observable changes in your latency and connection?","replies":[{"poster":"SailorOdessa","date":"2016-09-27T19:51:15.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that left to check is to turn off my antivirus while playing LOL. Yet I doubt it's the problem. Like I said before, I'm using wired connection, it made its changes, yet recently I started experiencing abnormal stable high ping. It's not my connection, because I test it during such games and it's exactly the same as during the games that have a normal ping. \nPeople keep complaining about their ping almost every game I play. There would be at least one person who will complain about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T15:26:16.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think at this point, there may be an issue along your routing to the server. We can investigate by running a traceroute log, which will give us detailed information about each hop, or node, to the server. \n\nI'd like you to run this traceroute using an app called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/). After launching the app, simply plug in 104.160.131.1 into the host field, then start the trace. After the trace has run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them here in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any troubles with this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
