I have tested the button functionality in Windows Explorer, Chrome, and Rocket League and all games recognize the button without issue. What is the root cause of this issue and what is the remedy?\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-30T04:09:16.765+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're still looking into exactly what is causing those specific mouse buttons to have stopped working. I don't have an exact fix, but I've seen quite a few players be able to work around this by using [**X-Mouse Button Control**](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm). I also noticed that the Windows Creator Update has stated they've been having the same issues, and now suggest that people running that update revert back to the most stable version of windows. \n\nThat's a little bit a to try, but please let me know if any of that works for you too!!","replies":[{"poster":"Tijisynaru","date":"2017-04-30T04:59:08.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the quick reply!
