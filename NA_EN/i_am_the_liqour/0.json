I'm trying to use the account username recovery, But every time I enter my e-mail for the username to be sent to absolutely **NOTHING** happens and I am getting no e-mail and i've checked my spam and everything. I know i've got an accepted PBE account, because when I go to the application page, It asks me to download the client, But I just can't remember my user name and the account recovery isn't working.\r\n\r\nHelp please???","replies":[{"poster":"RAMdriller","date":"2018-03-10T13:28:49.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ITS THE SAME WITH ME","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T23:58:26.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you checked your spam folder for the email?
