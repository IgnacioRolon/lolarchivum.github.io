I'm simply asking for my points back. I didn't DC... we all sat and chatted for about 5 minutes before everyone was kicked out. When I tried to log back in I got the \"server down\" message.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vegan Killer","date":"2016-09-18T23:39:57.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yesterday, I was in a ranked game when the server had crashed. Since it was already passed the remake time limit we were unable to cancel the game, which resulted in many players disconnecting in the middle of lane, at base or not even connecting at all. The result was an unfair game in which the other team was awarded by faults of the server rather than through proper gameplay. Hopefully at Riot you are reasonable to reimburse for the lost LP through leaverbuster. Although it was not Riot's fault directly, I hope that they can fix the problems that were made rather than ignoring the server failure completely.","replies":[]}]}]}
