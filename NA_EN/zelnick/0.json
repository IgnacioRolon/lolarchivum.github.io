Perhaps it's related to the fact that the store is crammed full of so many graphics that it lags severely every time I try and do even the most basic thing, like clicking one button or buying one rune. I put up with enough of losing ranked matches due to Riot's lag, I'm no longer putting up with getting conned out of something I spent money on due to your company's failure to create a functioning platform, this is at least the second time such an incident has happened to me.

I already submitted a ticket the night it happened. The store lags severely every single time I go to it and do anything, I constantly get processing glitches where it doesn't count things I buy, where I somehow have NEGATIVE rp and ip, where I somehow get more runes than I bought, you need to optimize the image files so they don't take as much memory to process.
