There aren&#039;t obvious clones like in the Star Guardian mode, but I assume Kayn isnt the only enemy that counts as a champion.\n\nEdit: I think all large enemies with health bars are considered \"champions,\" which is almost everything aside from some of the small enemies like the mini space-krugs that spawn in swarms, and I think those obnoxious mini-Skarners that drag you are treated as minions.  Also the neutral spawns that give buffs (the vel'koz things with health packs or other buffs) aren't champs since Yasuo can't ult them","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2018-09-12T17:03:54.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe all enemies (monsters) are considered champions in regards to this. \n\nMy evidence for this is that Yasuo can only use his ultimate on enemy champions, and I have seen him use his ult on the monsters in this game mode. \n\nI haven't played it yet for myself so i can't confirm this, but the logic seems pretty sound to me.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-12T17:08:02.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elite4Runner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FH6f3Uj3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-12T17:03:54.920+0000)\n>\n> I believe all enemies (monsters) are considered champions in regards to this. \n> \n> My evidence for this is that Yasuo can only use his ultimate on enemy champions, and I have seen him use his ult on the monsters in this game mode. \n> \n> I haven&#x27;t played it yet for myself so i can&#x27;t confirm this, but the logic seems pretty sound to me.\n\nI thought that would be insinuated as well. I saw Yasuo ulting everything no problem So I figured everthing was considered a \"champion\" in this mode except some plants.","replies":[]}]}]}
