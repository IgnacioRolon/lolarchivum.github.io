If it needs to scan the entire installation, it could take as long as it did when you first installed, or longer if your connection isn't quite as fast as it was then. I'd let the repair try and finish, but if it doesn't seem to move at all after hours you could try grabbing the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running a **clean uninstall and reinstall**. Make sure to run the clean uninstall as well to get rid of any possibly damaged game files.","replies":[{"poster":"Defroski","date":"2018-03-05T10:51:01.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for wasting my time with that hextech tool, i did it like 10 times and still nothing works lmfao....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SAM Snicky","date":"2018-01-30T20:26:23.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no response ?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"leva2405","date":"2018-03-17T09:55:49.948+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem nothing works i make it whit the hextech repair tool and its dont works idk what i can do i want to play lol but nothin works :/ that sucks sorry for my english i am from germany","replies":[]}]}
