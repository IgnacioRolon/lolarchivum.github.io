Getting lvl 3 just is fkn impossible and u cant drop under 0 so i dont realy want to but i feel like its my Job to flame now cuz the acc is Level 0 without any hope of ever getting to Lvl 3 I mean its maybe 3 months til season end and if 2months of consistent play without any Flame/feed or smth dont make u lvl 3 from lvl 2 then how teh fk u are supposed to ever get from 0 to 3 in a Season ?\n\nIf the Idea behind the system is to make people more friendly then let them raise faster and loose Honor levels faster this way u shud have ard 90% friendly games.

It punishes people hard for being human and flaming. We all do it once in a while. I should be able to raise my honor back to regular. Heck the New season even came and dropped and my honor Level is still 0. I said it before and I will say it again this system is bullshit. I am getting to the point where there is no point in even playing because i cant receive any rewards even after months of being cool in game. Bullshit rito this is bullshit!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"definitely a jew","date":"2018-01-14T22:10:02.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got banned a few months ago, after that I figured it was time to stop joking around since riot actually takes stuff seriously.

If I screenshot every single honor I would have received at least 500 honors by now from non-premade teammates.. Maybe more.","replies":[]}]}
