Will we have access to certain chromas, cerain chromas per champ or just all available chromas? I wanna know so I wouldn't waste time farming IP and/or waste RP on chromas.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T02:57:44.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't quite released all of the info concerning that unique shop quite yet.

I'm interested in the money bags and make it rain emotes but I have no idea what they look like or their sound effects, will we get previews closer to time?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T03:26:04.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lately, we've been trying to provide all the info up front so that people have time to prepare, so I'm assuming this would be no different.

Btw if its not too much trouble to ask, I saw in another thread you were able to see how many games someone has played; I was also curious about my time spent in LoL for the free emote, would you be able to see how many games I have? I sent in a support ticket so I'm hoping in another day or so I'll have an accurate answer of my hours but a general idea would be nice. (But if its too much work for you don't worry about it).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-10-02T04:58:25.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm looking through the BE shop list now:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908\n\n...and what are the \"Make it Rain\" and \"Money Bags\"-emotes?\n\nWhat do they look like, and how can they be a whole 50K and 75K BE?\n_Because those values seems extremely Sparta to me, to be honest._","replies":[]}]}]}
