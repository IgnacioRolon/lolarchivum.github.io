Not sure if I should shell out the money for a MacBook, or buy a cheaper windows laptop. Do writers even have a preference?","replies":[{"poster":"Dinopawz","date":"2018-07-09T16:11:55.794+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"At work, I use a Macbook Pro, and at home, I work on either my Desktop iMac or MacBook Air. Haven't used a PC in, like, 18 years... For word processing, I'm not sure it makes much of a difference going higher-spec, so for me, it's all about the functionality of the OS, how well my docs sync between my different devices and the comfort/scale of the keyboard. I love the tactile feel of Apple keyboards (on the machine and Bluetooth one), so that's the most important part for me, something that can keep up with my typing speed and feel 'natural'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-07-11T02:08:21.998+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer my two year old, budget-conscious, Kylo-Ren-branded HP laptop that overheats very easily and can't play games or it might explode.\n\nDid I say prefer\n\nI meant hate","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2018-07-10T03:28:55.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just released:\n\n>#Surface Go\n\nhttps://youtu.be/krRRskzHWFE","replies":[]},{"poster":"big boi edri","date":"2018-07-09T21:59:08.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a Rioter obviously, but when I am writing with my laptop I like to plug in my mechanical keyboard with blue switches.\n\nThe feel and sound of the blues reminds me of a typewriter, love it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HideofTerramorph","date":"2018-07-09T21:01:14.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not a writer, just a guy that knows a lot about computers. get a cheap chromebook or something. They usually have lower end specs, but tend to rotate their features into the physical experience. Touchscreens, 2in1s, trackpad. I've liked every chromebook keyboard I've ever used.
