Anyone who reads the play is doomed to madness and despair, but more importantly, anyone who reads it becomes aware of the King, and the King becomes aware of the reader. I'll leave a small passage here from the Yellow Sign, a short story in the book:\n\n_\"The gate below opened and shut, and I crept shaking to my door and bolted it, but I knew no bolts, no locks, could keep that creature out who was coming for the Yellow Sign. And now I heard him moving very softly along the hall. Now he was at the door, and the bolts rotted at his touch. Now he had entered. With eyes starting from my head I peered into the darkness, but when he came into the room I did not see him. It was only when I felt him envelope me in his cold soft grasp that I cried out and struggled with deadly fury, but my hands were useless ... I knew that the King in Yellow had opened his tattered mantle and there was only God to cry to now.\"_\n\nIf you want to make Fiddlesticks the scariest guy on the rift, you need to use the strongest and most potent kind of fear there is- fear of the unknown. Before Stephen King, before Lovecraft, Robert W. Chambers created the original in eldritch horrors, the  Mac Daddy of them all, the King in Yellow. If you want to set the mood for designing new Fiddlesticks, to get some inspiration, I highly suggest reading this book.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-06-01T00:22:28.483+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hah! Love this book. I read The King in Yellow cover-to-cover when I was still in high school, along with most of Lovecraft's library (ironically this is when I realized that Lovecraft was a terrible human being). The kind of horror I gravitate towards these days is many magnitudes more disturbing than \"guy with a weird head\" or \"small yellow goblin man gets mauled to death by cat.\" Mostly revolving around human psychoses, but also liminal spaces, horrors of the natural world (versus eldritch, outer-space-horror), and plays on religious iconography/ritual that border on exaltation.\n\nRegardless, I have some ideas I'm playing with for Fiddle right now that I hope will surprise you in all the right ways (you pee a little). In my interview five years ago they asked what champion I wanted to write for the most. It was Fiddle then, and remains Fiddle now.\n\nI'm very excited.","replies":[{"poster":"World King","date":"2019-06-01T00:46:30.807+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant wait!\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"HopeStartsWithU","date":"2019-06-01T06:27:11.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, did you ever play bloodborne?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-06-03T18:47:05.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep!
