However, I have friends who know my account, and almost everybody who I have played against, who can testify the contrary. The only programs that were installed on my computer that relate to League of Legends are Curse by Curse Inc, and Championify, a program that makes item sets for you. Riot apparently approves and even encourages players to use these programs as tools to help in gameplay. Also, on a previous discussion on the boards, I had a friend inform me that Third Party Programs aren&#039;t something you can accidentally install, as they are fully automated bots, or some other programs are map changers or macros, which I have neither. While some argue I may be lying about the bots, I am only in Bronze III, shown on op.gg, and have an mmr that enforces that. The Third Party Programs can get players up to much higher elos- even to Diamond! On my match history, I have a decent history that reflects my level of skill. If you watch the replays, you will also see that I do react fast on some occasions, but most of the time I mess up. Third Party Programs give advantages to players that will help fix mess ups like my own. Therefore, this is why I should not be banned, because I am innocent of any usage of scripts, macros, map changers, or any other Third Party Programs due to the reasons above. Maybe the system made a mistake, as my friend was once banned for the same reason, and he was completely innocent of Third Party Programs as well.\n\nSearch up: OGBleach\nOn the NA server on op.gg if you don't believe me.","replies":[{"poster":"WildBeard93","date":"2017-02-15T00:04:07.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check player behavior and moderation. its the post with 100+ upvotes","replies":[]},{"poster":"WildBeard93","date":"2017-02-14T23:02:05.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your in a boat with many others my friend. :| There's only 1 thread currently that's gaining any momentum whatsoever regarding this huge mess so i would recommend you take your concerns there at least and try to reach out to riot in any way possible","replies":[{"poster":"OGBleach","date":"2017-02-14T23:16:31.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What post is that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-02-14T23:10:30.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had friends on your account.
