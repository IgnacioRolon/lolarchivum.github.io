This would be great for players who can position well and (probably) wouldn't make her any much different, but it definitly would make her more fun and cooler.\r\n\r\nI'd love feedback on this idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2015-01-25T06:12:45.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, the 1st champion stops and the 2nd is only moved half as far as the remaining distance when impacted\n\nIn additional every instance of terrain fix of being NOWHERE NEAR THE DAMN WALL will be fixed\n\n\nFinally her attack delay is slightly increased to remove the instant ghost shots that vayne can do","replies":[{"poster":"Byakuya Kuchiki","date":"2015-01-25T06:47:25.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know if that happened how many youtube videos would be made of a legendary 5 man condemn and the final one hits a wall like oh my god i would flip so much shit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-25T06:11:34.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wut. I don't want to be a dick or anything, but if you think Vayne needs a buff, you need to work on your mechanics with her. Vayne is in a REALLY good place right now and a buff would shoot her through the roof, even if it was just a minor buff.","replies":[]}]}
