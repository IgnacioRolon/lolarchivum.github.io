I never got to see what my offers were yesterday, because I was at work. I see that people are opening support tickets to get back what they had yesterday. Can we still do that if we don't know what we had? I'd like to, because it can't be worse than this. Last time my shop was around, I bought 3 of them. This time, I'm not even slightly tempted to buy a single one.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T03:30:12.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you never opened the first set, the offers were never generated so you will only have the current 6 skins to choose from.","replies":[{"poster":"You Are Cute XD","date":"2017-09-20T03:36:40.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So if you were able to look yesterday, you essentially get 12 offers and if you weren't, you get 6?
