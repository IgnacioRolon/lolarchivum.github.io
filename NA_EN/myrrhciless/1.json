It's a percentage based system showing you where you rank among all the players using that specific champ in the role you played. Getting a S+ means you placed in the highest percentage while getting an A just means there were players who performed better with Jarvan in bot lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RaeSacr√©","date":"2018-01-08T05:48:23.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rank you get on a champion is actually based on the community average KDA for that champion in a certain time period.

You have that, overall kill participation, cs, vision score, and the role which you were playing. A mid Annie would be graded different than a bot support Annie. They don't share the exact details of how the score is calculated, because they don't want people to adjust how they play in assumption of getting a higher chance of obtaining that S rank. If someone obtained 393 cs, that probably means this was an extremely long game. The duration of a game could also have an effect on the grading scale.","replies":[]}]}]}
