I have been experiencing resolution issues. Not only on my regular computer but also in league of legends. I have always played on 1920 by 1080 with the same monitor and ever since that patch for windows the borders have been slightly cut off. \" Well change the resolution to fit your screen\" obviously I tried that but 1 most of them still cut off the border/ are extremely annoying. And the ones that don't cut off the border cause my computer to freeze and I have to turn off via the power switch in the back. Any solutions as to how to make 1920 by 1080 fit correctly onto my tv monitor? Also any solutions to cause my computer to stop freezing if I choose different resolution sizes. ( Sorry in advance im not very great with computers)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-17T22:34:04.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if League is, for some reason, using old config settings that are causing those weird display errors.
