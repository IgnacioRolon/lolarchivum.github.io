My particular situation (and machine) may not be the same as yours though, so use this as a point of reference rather than a guide. \n\nMy Tech specs:\nWindows 7, 64bit\nIntel i7 @2.80GHz\n12.0GB RAM\nAMD Radeon HD 5700 \nDriver: AMD Catalyst Control, 15.7.1\n\nI can see this issue seems to have been around for a few months now, I only received the **\"An unknown DirectX error has occurred\" issue as of Nov 7th, 2017 after preseason Patch 7.22's release.** \n\nOn how my issue occurred; I'd just got out of a low priority queue afk penalty, one that was deserved. I'd then finally gone to start a game without the 5 minute penalty, pick and ban phase was totally normal, game client was about to launch the loading screen, then that directX error came up, and the loading screen auto closed.\n\nThe game obviously went to remake, and I got put back into low priority queue for this patch issue, now having to wait 10 minutes before each game instead. Really don't see how thats fair Rito, considering **this is a patch issue that we weren't warned about (and I'm sure I'm not the only one to lose lp for this too.)**\n\n--\n\nAnyways! I followed the [youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcwdU12Fxp0) link as well as I could,** the issue seems to be based on whether you have GPU Scaling turned on or off.** Most driver software can be accessed by right clicking on your desktop, and selecting it from the drop-down options that come up. For AMD users, Catalyst Control should be the first option on the drop down list.\n\nIn the list on the left hand side of the Catalyst Control menu, you should see your display options. I have a Flat Panel screen and a VGA Display, so both come up. \n\n**Within Flat panel, select the properties > image scaling preferences > Enable GPU Scaling. **\n\n**Within VGA Displays, select image scaling > Enable GPU Scaling. **\n\n**I also had to disable my AMD OverDrive (which I was using to overclock my graphics card). Thats under Performance > AMD OverDrive > Enable Graphics OverDrive. **\n\nAll this didn't take affect until I restarted my computer though, so I'd recommend doing that afterwards too. \n\n**Give it a test run in Practice Mode just in case once you've restarted. **\n\nHope this has helped.\n\nCheers,\n\nReg","replies":[{"poster":"klutch kobra","date":"2017-11-07T21:10:05.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nomg thank you so much for this!

There's a lot of small settings and features that could cause issues so sometimes it takes a little troubleshooting to find the source of the problem. If this worked for you, great! But others should keep in mind that this won't be a catch-all solution for all directx problems. \n\nIf this didn't work for you, feel free to reply here and I can run you through some other troubleshooting.","replies":[{"poster":"CLUTCH COBRA","date":"2017-11-08T01:48:48.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Indeed thats true.
