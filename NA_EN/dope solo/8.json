Neither form cares about attack speed or on hit damage. You shouldn't be building black cleaver on shadow assassin either. Either you or your target will be dead before you can apply full stacks of cleaver as an assassin. There is no reason for you to be building against tanks as shadow assassin, you'll never be able to \"make them cry\" regardless of what you build. Being shadow assassin means that the enemy team shouldn't have more than 1 tank in the first place, and you should be avoiding that tank when possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-08-27T05:52:30.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I'll try it out.","replies":[]}]}]}
