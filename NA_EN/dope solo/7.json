The ban feature helps to minimize this advantage. The ban phase wasn't instituted because some champions should be permabanned - because really, if Riot did their job, then no champion would be permabanned.

You can personally use your ban to eliminate a matchup you personally struggle against. However, I prefer to give my team the best chance at picking the best champions. So if the \"meta op\" champion pool is less eliminated, we will be guaranteed a chance to pick something from that pool. \n\nAgain, you don't have to agree and maybe some people are just lazy. But I do this on purpose with a solid argument from game theory.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-12-16T07:37:30.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not going to hurt your midlaner, jg, sup or top  lane if you\"re playing adc and opt to ban Jhin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2018-12-15T16:58:20.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do see your point... it's logical that you'd think the person would simply ask if their team has anyone they want to ban...\n\nbut the people who ban none are often the trolls.
