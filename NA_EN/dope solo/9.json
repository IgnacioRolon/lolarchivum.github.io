Seeing your MMR doesnt alter anything lol. THE MATCH MAKING IS GARBAGE BECAUSE THE RANKING SYSTEM IS GARBAGE. Seeing numbers, have colored borders, having cute tier names like plat or gold or master mean nothing the entire rank system is broken easily abused and hence it is awful.\n\nYou want to fix the rank system? STOP REWARDING AND PUNISHING ALL PLAYERS EQUALLY, yes we are on the same team , but no we didnt play equally. You are 0/10/0 down 100 cs by 20 minutes and 4 levels lower YOU ARE THE REASON WE LOST, you need to loss IMMENSE ratings YOU don;t below in our matches, (no its wasnt a \"Bad game\" you dont belong here.) you deserve to lose 50 lp the rest of us who ended up 4/5/3 down 20 cs because your lane then roamed and ravaged everyone deserve to lose 10lp. Vice versa for the winners You were 0/10/10 down 80 cs and did nothing you get to gain 5 lp the rest of us gain 30 YOU DONT BELONG HERE.\n\nSecondly this is a \"LADDER\" you dont get to start in the middle of the ladder. All new accounts to rank START AT THE BOTTOM you work your way up you dont get so be inserted into the middle to ruin the next 50 matches you play in. I might be a gold player but make no mistake a gold player with 600 matches is far better than a gold player with 30 matches aka your not actually gold at 30 matches you just lucked out and are in the middle of the ladder and enjoy coin flipping.\n\n\nFinally fix all of the ways to abuse ranked. Account sharing, duo q. etc... all ruin the ladder.

That's why I argue against those that DONT do well and not in favor of them like you do. Precisely because people dont understand the simple concept youre trying to use in your argument, destroying the nexus. Most people will chase kills around jungle when they oughta be staying away from deaths so the opponent doesnt get fed, while we're all pushing lanes to get to the Nexus. And in the way of course theres going to be fights, but thats when you show what you got. But the feeders usually dont play like that. They treat SR like its ARAM and fuck up the game's balance. And when they finally get back to the real game its too late and everyone else gets fucked out of LP.\n\nSo its not about whos getting rewarded for doing what, its about whos not getting screwed over for other people's mistake. Take away more LP from feeders and less from people who dont. And sure sometimes you might die 7 times by mid game.. but then end up carrying with 22 kills and pretty much leading the team to victory in every team fight. So there has to be a system that can detect that. But this whole thing about \"ooh your top laner went 0/9/2 by min 12 and now their top is ripping through your team while everyone else is averaging 1/0/1 - 2/1/0... And you end up having to FF?\"  .....What happens now?

I'm d3 and I don't.\n\nI can see sometimes when someone is not doing well but i'm far from being able to quantify it, and most of the time i'm not even able to say if someone is doing badly because he was camped or because we didnt follow him.\n\nThe easiest way of tracking the winning moves is rewarding the the winning team.\n\nIf you do a lots of winning moves in multiples games, it will average a higher winrate.

My account is Silver 3 (yes Ik I have a lot to learn) and I’m finding myself getting more and more frustrated with climbing. Or at least attempting to and not getting anywhere. What happens is when I am 0 LP S4, I go on a massive win streak and hard carry games until I get to around 50 LP S3. When I say hard carry I mean a typical game as Kat of like 20/4. During this win streak, riot matches me with ppl who may or may not feed a little bit but at worst, they realize that I’m going to carry them and play safer. However, once I get to mid S3 for some reason I then get matched with absolute r%%%%%s who will squander my 6/0 lane lead as quickly as I got it. I’m talking your typical bot lanes who have a combined 10+ deaths at 10 minutes or less, or a top lane that is 0/6 with 40 cs down and is hard engaging every chance they get no matter how many times I’ve tried to warn them. U may say that it’s bound to happen sometime but it truly happens to me every time I cross the S3 50 LP threshold. The only way I win beyond that is to play a flawless game, and obviously I’m in silver so that can’t happen all the time. Is riot basically telling me that I have to preform like a Plat smurf every game to climb past silver 3? Before you all say “if your good enough you’ll climb easily” I whole heartedly disagree. You get better from playing competitive games. But having an 0/11 Ashe and some troll auto filled support who picks something off meta, or a teemo that feeds the enemy garen to a nice 8/0 does not make for competitive games. Not to mention the amount of weird picks I see that decide the game at champ select because everyone wants to pick a squishy carry no matter what the role or comp is and everyone wants to build all dmg or ap. Or the amount of whack runes I see (ex: electrocute Braum). I figured making the Iron division would help keep high bronze and beyond more competitive and keep the trolls, hard feeders, inters, or anyone who seemingly doesn’t even care enough to check online to see if their build is right out of matches with people who actually do care and want to climb. I was wrong and I think it’s even worse now. I understand silver is low elo and if I was really good I would climb quickly. But how do u expect me to get that good when the matches are not competitive in the slightest and every match has at least one hard feeder who basically makes the game a blowout very quickly. Who can I play that isn’t at the whim of feeders? I want to play good games that make me better at the game. \nDISCLAIMER: this is my friends account I’m posting from bc I don’t care for a bunch of ppl criticizing my gameplay as I realize I have a lot to learn, my problem is I’m not learning anything from people inting in my games.\nTruthfully this is really ruining my league of legends experience and sometimes I’d rather be playing Fortnite nowadays, and I don’t enjoy fortnite.","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Wat3r","date":"2019-10-14T05:48:48.461+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition, if u look at my friends account here, you’ll see why he is starting to not enjoy the game either.

In that case, you may treat a \"team\" as a single (virtual) \"player\", assigning LP gains/losses to teams themselves (not to players). In such a case, you could have a team-ladder, completely separated from other ladders, like \"Ranked 5\". For example, you may have Team A with MMR 2000 (something like Plat) and Team B with MMR 1500. Note: the fact that Team A has MMR 2000 does not imply that every single player has, individually, MMR 2000. This is just the \"uniform\" approximation, it may or may not be true.\n\nOf course, this would not resolve the issues of ranking a player in SoloQ, since using its \"team-rank\" would basically amount to the same approximations that are made in the case of MMR, and you would be back to square one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2019-10-13T23:06:19.543+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dope Solo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mFQcnAA3,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-10-13T14:50:31.263+0000)\n>\n> The trend towards strong mismatches was very well noticed, documented and discussed on these boards for season 9.

The 2 top laners cant be both worse than each other and neither can both botlanes be better than each other. The one on the other side experiences the exact opposite.\nYou get both examples in your games or variations. Just because you recently got more of one or are impacted worse by the bad experience, doesn't mean it's always that way.\n\nThat being said, uneven games aren't something you want to play, but I doubt matchmaking is intentionally doing that for some people specifically.
