Unless they feel like explaining where they got those numbers and show previous years, it is pretty meaningless. There is not a finite amount of revenue available to games, and the entire market is increasing in size rapidly year to year - one game overtaking another does not mean the other is failing.\n\nNot to mention that dubious chart shows LoL well above PUBG, and we have a floor on how much _they_ made.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-11-25T03:29:45.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You just don't like what it says.","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2018-11-25T03:35:37.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No.. look at those sources.. \n\ncomicbook.com\naltchar.com\ndbltap.com\n\nComplete no-name websites that ALSO don't cite their sources.\n\nIf Riot was losing money, we would be hearing about it by major sources. Forbes, Kotaku, are two of the first sources that come to mind that will post the MOMENT league is losing more money. They are big name, reliable sources that post on everything gaming. \n\nThe first sign of a company losing money is closing down branches and firing teams of people. Considering Riot Games hired a ton of the people that were recently dropped by telltale games a couple months back, we have nothing to worry about.

Why wouldn't Forbes, or Kotaku be reporting on the most active MOBA losing money for the first time in years. That would signify the beginning of the end for a game that's held top 2 in viewership on twitch, has surpassed Dota in terms of players, and has completely defined the MOBA genre.. and you don't think that the bigger websites would report on it? \n\nIts quite the opposite of \"I attack the source because I don't like what it says.\" You stick to the source, even though its unreliable, because it supports your agenda.
