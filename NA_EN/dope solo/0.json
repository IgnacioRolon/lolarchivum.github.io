If her numbers were bad, she was still pretty damn good. Having great wave clear, sustain, burst (Quadra proc) mobility, vision and team fighting was just too much for the meta. She was single handedly too good, so she was reverted.\n\nNow about the 10 damage nerf. This forces Leblanc to buy Ludens as a first Item if she wants to clear caster minions with 1 W (as well as max W) instead of being able to build other items and being able to kill casters. This hurts her wave clear significantly and makes champions that can push from afar more clear counters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PirateGod3D2Y","date":"2018-11-21T10:18:42.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malah,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4eMxo8lE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-11-21T01:54:28.393+0000)\n>\n> Riot doesn&#x27;t meaningfully nerf champions anymore because it loses them money.\n> \n> They reverted LB because she was fair and that was boring for the people who played her.

Without Crysalis and Boneplating, she's much more squishy. Yes, she can take some armor/mr runes, but guess what, so can her opponents.\n\nNow, let's consider 2 things, both objective facts:\n- Her winrate is low\n- Boards cry she never loses\n\nNotice how both contradict eachother? Now, if you need to be a good Irelia player have the \"no counter\" impact, then, what about other champs who are even more stupid to deal with, just that they see less play? (Donger is an example)\n\nTop lane Irelia is squishier while most enemies get to have similar stats as before, while Mid Irelia is as well, more squishy, but her opponents are tankier as anyone can now take armor. Funny, right? You got the nerfs you wanted, yet noone sees them because they aren't direct.\n\n\nAlso, I suggest this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_7aNuCAI68 and this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-sotWTYQFU and this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b0nBycullo\n\nAll 3 give you tips and tricks on how to deal with Irelia, and fun fact, they were from before the rune stat changes, so these things will affect her even more. Such nerfs should be given a bit of time to see the actual results, as it may be enough to push Irelia out of her \"throne\".\n\nNow, not sure what you mean by \"mobily tree\". Celerity no longer gives damage, so the bigger move speed is a huge buff to Foodyr...wait no, Sonic, wait, I mean Udyr, it's a nerf to the rune for the general champion base, as everyone took it for the free ms and dmg, but both are gone now.\n\nAs for Ignite, well, that's understandable, can get a minor nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-11-21T15:17:13.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah, its called having the playerbase learn to play instead of begging for riot to change things for them.","replies":[]}]}
