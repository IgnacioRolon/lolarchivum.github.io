Also, Tencent is the parent company to Riot which is based in China. My guess is they are going to have to change some stuff in the game so it complies with China's ethics committee. It sucks, but I doubt they are going to not comply with China's demands and get it banned from the country, especially with Tencent being the parent company of Riot. Riot's hand is pretty much forced unfortunately.\n\nCould I be wrong? Yeah, it's all pretty much speculation at this point of what they are going to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2018-12-15T03:42:37.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My question to this is: Why now?
