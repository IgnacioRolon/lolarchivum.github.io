I play a lot of Support myself, Started in Season three.  Now, I can only place a total of four wards on the map, one of them always visible.  The rest of my team buys trinkets, and maybe one might place one during laning, but then the second it's over, it's up to me, with my four wards, to somehow cover the entire map's vision needs. Dragon, baron, their jungle, our jungle, escape routes, invade routes, backdoor routes, everything.  I can't do that anymore.  Do I have enough gold? Hell yeah I do! It's just a pity that I can't spend all that gold on what my team really needs, which is a babysitter to place their wards for them.  Then riot gets mad when a Support does their job too well, E.G. Sona, and continually nerfs them into oblivion.  Sona was the perfect support, then she was nerfed, then changed, then nerfed some more for good measure.  She can't go mid because she lacks damage now, and she can't protect and sustain properly, because her W's AP scaling was trashed with no good reason or QoL improvements to make her any better.\n\nThen we get into the other problem.  Burst mages who get shunted into the support role because they can do it better.  In season 3, it was Annie and Zyra, and they've only gotten worse with the new gold improvements for supports.  Meanwhile, traditional supports like Janna, or Nami have to struggle to keep up because of increasing mana costs on a low budget, and no AP ratios to Justify the hits they've had to take.  Should Nami's bubble do half of an ADC's HP in one shot? No, but it should sting, same thing with Janna's tornadoes or W, both of which feel early like they lack any power, and lategame like they should hit like a truck, but by this point in the game, everyone's got Resistances and Lifesteal for sustain, meaning that any impact that they have is completely negated.\n\nI've taken to countering the Burst-Mage epidemic in botlane with champions like Shen and Galio, both amazing in their own roles, but in bot, they can actually take the huge amounts of burst that Champions like Annie, Zyra, and even (God save us) Ahri can provide.  \n\nI don't know where in Riot's structure you happen to call home.\n\n\nBut, and this is coming from the bottom of my heart.\n\nPlease, look at Supports, look at the role, and sit down, and ask yourselves. Where do you want this role to go into the future? Because at this rate, your Traditional Support Archetypes are going to get phased out for something new at every turn, and that's honestly just a shame, because it is, and can be, the most difficult and rewarding role to play.  I love supporting, but when the game can't give me the tools that the role requires, I'm just going to move on.\n\n\nRemove the ward cap on Green wards, or at least make it bigger if you take the support role. Do like you did with Machete and Smite, but with Exhaust for all I care.  \n\nReduce the amount of Gold given for Assists and just sitting in lane with the Amulet.  Make Amulet more than just a holding-pattern item and make it a little more involved, like the Spelltheif's edge or the relic shield.\n\nBring the skill back to supporting, bring the niche back home, make it less generic and more enjoyable for everyone involved, please riot.","replies":[{"poster":"DatKiva","date":"2015-01-18T00:09:44.323+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"copypasta this into its own thread if you haven't already, I used to main support cause supports were fun, now because they nerfed all the supports i favor those bursty archtypes or the off the wall supports are making an appearance and doing the job better than other supports, it's bullshit that supports who could go mid or top get nerfed to all hell then have mids and tops that can support sit at that role without batting an eyelash. im not saying nerf or change those other roles out of the possability of supporting, but bring back some of the power so they can atleast be on par with these ap support bots","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Senfaria","date":"2015-01-17T05:49:26.064+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this.

Yes supports deserve that, it's only fair given how their counterpart exists. \nI personally never really notice this though. Because even as non-support, the people with better KDA usually aren't the only noteworthy person among them. I doubt people check how many structures they helped siege, or how much dmg they tanked regularly, because they know what they achieved. And it shows majorly in how many wins you can see in recent history. In my case the higher my recent win rate the more I feel I'm effective. \nBecause even if I have higher kda and dmg and less in this and that game, that doesn't mean I did worse or better, because I didn't have the same things to work with, my team and enemy aren't the same every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-01-16T20:09:40.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A \"damage shielded\" number would go a long way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2015-01-16T23:28:35.291+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unless you are playing Thresh, Blitz and Leona i don't think you will recieve not recieve much love at all really-unless if you are playing with friends and like 5% of the League community who are considered to be nice people on the internet.
