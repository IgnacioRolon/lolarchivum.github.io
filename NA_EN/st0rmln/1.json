Supports mostly offer a large amount of utility after all. But still your point if a very valid one. The information page needs to have a bit more added to it so we know more about the champion we are getting into.","replies":[{"poster":"St0rmln","date":"2014-11-14T21:51:54.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Certainly doesn't make you seem like a jerk, thanks for the input.
