This change has the _potential_ to bring about healthier long-term play.\n\nThe problem is interactions with other types of people who go mid.  Sustain is a very valuable resource in lane, and after lane, as it directly relates to power when getting objectives.  We don't want to be the one person who has to go back, especially when our counterparts, AD casters don't suffer those issues, deal plenty of damage, and also take objectives more easily.\n\nWhat could happen is mages lose out on the 100% uptime that everyone else has.  But then in trade for reliability, more power should be allocated.  This is one possible balance route.\n\nOr, perhaps we could get more objective-getting power for the need to b\n\nIn any case, what has to be seen is if mages still are able to play a role in the game effectively with down time.
