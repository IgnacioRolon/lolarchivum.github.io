But there is another definition that can be used, e-sport.\n\n*\"A multiplayer video game played competitively for spectators, typically by professional gamers.\"*\n\nSo league is certainly an e-sport.\n\nPeople can play soccer casually or seriously, it's their choice. I see no reason that someone couldn't play league either casually or seriously. That doesn't mean a person is allowed to harass someone for playing poorly, but at no point should a person be compelled to play the game with only a casual outlook.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2019-04-07T17:36:39.888+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of legends is a competitive game that people care about.
