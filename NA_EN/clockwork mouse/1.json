How many champs have an ability that's base damage is over 300?\n\nNot a *ton*, but most also don't have a delay of that length on their damage either. AP Cho'Gath hurts like *hell* when he hits you, but his W, E, and R are all very close range, his Q is dodge-able, and he has no mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-05-27T05:40:37.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay but is that really worth giving him so much damage?

It's the same as Ez's W, which costs 50 mana (with a potential refund). And yes, 1.0 AP ratio is pretty significant, which makes sense for a slow spell on a champion who doesn't build a ton of AP anyway.\n\nOnce again, Cho will not be one-shotting anyone with Q unless they are several levels behind. It's more likely that the Cho ulted right after the Q hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2019-05-27T08:02:11.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Clockwork Mouse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5N9eIxiv,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-05-27T05:16:57.605+0000)\n>\n> Moderate?

It is an incredibally slow ability so you need to look at other slow abilities for comparison.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The entire team","date":"2019-05-27T05:26:55.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you have two walking feet and have the capacity to dodge, those AP ratios mean nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-05-27T05:34:45.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are assuming the chogath is bad or somthing.
