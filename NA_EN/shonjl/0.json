Personally the only thing I dislike about her isn't so much her kit itself, but the players. It is getting a bit old seeing even normals people fighting over her and rage and just downright be assholes during game over her. I get it she is new but calm down :L","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-15T00:05:09.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too feast or famine. If she gets her camps and the BotRK, she facerolls pretty hard. If she doesn't get her camps and her gold isn't up to par, she'll be near worthless. Her R is the only thing that gives her a placement in a team when she's behind and even that depends since your teammates gotta know how to play around her. \n\nShe'll easily be a pick or ban in LCS after World's for sure regardless of if she gets a nerf since her R is an easier to use AoE Tryn ult and with the right communication, people will be able to get her her camps as well as play around her ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadPuddle","date":"2015-10-14T23:09:36.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As strong as vayne, you DO NOT want to ignore this champ and let them farm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MyTeamIsAwsome","date":"2015-10-14T23:06:03.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is a balanced kalista.
