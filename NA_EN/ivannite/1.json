They have reached Honor Level 5 already by only playing with our entire group. I have hit Honor Level 4 and even reached it before them, because I play solo queue and earned honors from there. However, with all of them constantly honoring me and even earning honors in Ranked, I have yet to earn Honor Level 5. I was waiting to try to vote for a charity because I seemed so close to Honor 5, but alas with at least a week more time played and honors each day, I have yet to hit Honor 5 and now have no earthly idea how close I am, if close at all. Is my account bugged? Was the system targeting my account only out of our entire group of friends who would honor each other every game, allowing them to hit Honor 5 but not me? I am just really confused here and would like some help/transparency or insight to how the Honor system really works, maybe even a progress status.\r\n\r\nI am just really confused because I was Honor 4 before my friend even got Honor 3, and he then only played with us, and we would randomly honor every game based off of performance, and with days gone by even HE got Honor 5 before me, only playing within our own premade 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Ivannite","date":"2017-11-06T23:29:02.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long is a player teetering around chat restriction then, if that is a thing, for it to affect your progress?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T22:34:01.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system definitely wasn't targetting anyone, I'm not sure it even notices who is honoring who tbh. Your honor progress might have been slowed down if you were toeing the line in getting a chat restriction, but it's good to keep in mind that everyone is going to rank up at different paces from getting different amounts of honors and playing a different amount of games. Seeing other people at Honor Rank 5 doesn't necessarily mean you should have hit it yet.","replies":[]}]}
