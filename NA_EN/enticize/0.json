I&#039;m assuming this is what&#039;s keeping me from getting the icon, so I&#039;m posting here in hope that someone could look through my transaction history and confirm that the xayah was gifted with ip so that I can receive my icon.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-18T17:02:50.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nIf the transaction date is after the event, that could very well be why the icon wasn't added to your account. That said, player support would be able to take a look at your account and let you know what the deal is and if the icon can be granted. Just [shoot 'em a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to help you out! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2017-05-18T17:48:41.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"talking about icon, any new on the poolparty icon bug(/coding?) who make it the first icon since more than a year?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-18T20:06:38.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't help but laugh since you have that exact icon equipped. :P\n\nSo, the icon IDs are way higher than that of others. It'd be pretty messy to change them, since players own the icons already, and it'd require some sneaky tricks to make it happen. We're looking at least to make upcoming IDs higher to allow these icons to move down the list as time goes on. We don't have a full on solution at the moment, it's something we're discussing, though! \n\nThanks for bringing this up!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Masked Lunatic","date":"2017-05-14T09:34:25.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw the actual gifting transaction time is usually when they receive it (I'm assuming this as the icon is received when the person receives the champion).\n\nDo you interact with that friend enough to know when he/she was logged in to receive the gift?","replies":[]}]}
