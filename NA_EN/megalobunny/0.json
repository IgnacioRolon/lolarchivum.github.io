I could be wrong, but I think this is related to the developmental disorder in which case I don&#039;t understand why it would be censored?  Some people wrongly use it as an insult but treating the term for that disorder as a slur and censoring it because of that seems wrong.  I&#039;m mostly concerned because I have that disorder so I&#039;m hoping I&#039;m mistaken about what that word is.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-10-04T22:30:14.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I suspect that user is self-censoring.

There are actual slurs for autism.  There are actual old medical terms that many of us consider to be offensive because of their origins but autism is not one of those terms.  Comparing the very name we ourselves choose to use and find acceptable to a slur, especially when there are actual slurs tied to autism, is not only disingenuous but harmful because it minimizes the damage of actual slurs such as the one you referenced.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-10-06T19:51:14.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"At this point i am convinced you are just a troll.\n\nBut it still stands: you are wrong, society is right.
