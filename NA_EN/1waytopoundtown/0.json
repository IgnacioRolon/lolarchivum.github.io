Maestro is the service that essentially makes sure you are still connected to the PvP.net Servers.  If it fails and gives an error, then it essentially recognized that you lost your connection.  I know you said that you've tried a lot of different steps already, but make sure you've completed every single step in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  There are a lot of steps there, but they are all crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nLet me know if nothing seems to help!","replies":[{"poster":"1waytoPOUNDTOWN","date":"2016-06-21T05:11:02.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The change of dns did the trick!
