Or is there a punishment to it? I'm not aware of the complications behind this issue.\n\nI played a game today with a player named \"\", a Diamond tier player. Except that he wasn't. Someone bought the account and used it to play a game. He was very bm. I wouldn't have said anything if the guy didn't say he bought the account 40 games prior to our matchup. Which I think is kind of stupid myself, why admit to something like that lmao. \n\nBut anyways, is there some kind of punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-28T16:21:45.964+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Incandecense,\n\nBuying and selling accounts is against the ToS and can result in disciplinary action, including banned accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"TacoTheKitten","date":"2015-08-28T17:05:19.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I've got a question.
