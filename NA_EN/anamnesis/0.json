One was fully functional: changing sides and colour relative to the ball position. The second one stayed blue and was always pointing to the left, regardless of the position of the ball (her shield included). I didn&#039;t notice it when everyone spawned in, so either I was dumbly oblivious or it was triggered by something in the game. The link leads to pictures demonstrating this more clearly.\n\nI have not gotten the chance to play Orianna again since, so I have not replicated the issue, but [here is a link to the game information](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2008264833/215933579) in case it had something to do with specific items or events. (We lost :c)\n\nEDIT: Second game as Orianna in an effort to replicate the issue actually garnered me TWO additional non-functioning indicators, along with the typical working one. Adding screencaps from that game to the original link.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-17T01:03:59.197+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MissFruitCat! \n\nThanks for the report.

We're currently investigating the issue!\n\nHey,\nI played another Orianna game today to see if the issue would replicate. I did not spawn in with an additional indicator, but I actually ended up with two additional indicators (three total). It was pretty ridiculous and kind of confusing. One was blue pointing to the lower-right, one was red pointing to the lower-right, and one was the typical functioning one. I can upload screencaps if it would help.\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: Uploaded screencaps to the original link in the post.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-23T21:38:06.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update! :D","replies":[{"poster":"MeÂªt","date":"2015-11-23T21:44:57.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ur welcome <3","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ThePalindrome","date":"2015-11-18T17:32:36.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me yesterday on an ARAM.
