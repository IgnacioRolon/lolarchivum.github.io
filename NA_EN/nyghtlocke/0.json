Can someone explain to me the reason for Annie being in this game? The discrepancy in average rank is absurd, with the enemy being low platinum and ours being low gold. Annie is for some reason plopped into this high gold/low platinum game with a low winrate in her current division. Is it the fact that she's only played 11 games and thus her MMR is way off from where she should be or what? It seems unfair for literally everyone in this game.","replies":[]}
