I invested money in a new PC with i7 4860k overclocked to 5.0 ghz and GTX 1070. This runs battlefield 1 on ultra at 200+ frames but struggles to get 60 on league and the screen tears during teamfights or in any fight really. This makes laning cancer and late game teamfights impossible. If somebody is having the same problem, I would really appreciate a fix. I have reinstalled multiple times and tried reinstalling the C++ files. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nwill be spending my time playing BF1 until something is found out.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T00:19:13.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two specific features your computer may be using that could be causing or contributing to your framerate issues. The first is the Windows Game Bar, which has caused low capped fps or freezes for some Windows 10 players. You can disable this feature by following [**this guide**](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nThe second potential cause or contributor is G-Sync. If you're running a G-Sync display and have this feature enabled, it could be causing havoc for your framerate. I'd recommend you disable the feature from inside the Nvidia Control Panel if you're using this feature.\n\nLet me know if either of these was able to cause a change for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Must K0 You","date":"2017-01-08T21:57:33.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just fixed it myself by turning the g-sync of now i have a contant fps of 250+","replies":[]},{"poster":"Must K0 You","date":"2017-01-08T11:47:02.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I bought a new laptop 3 weeks ago, also with a GTX 1070 and i got the same problem i am playing watchdogs and forza horizon 3 in ultra without any problems but leauge of legends i got ping spikes and a max of 60 fps, with my old laptop (5 years old) with a 6 serie nvidia card i have 100-150 fps on low. I think that rito needs to update there game so the game works great with the 10 serie nvidia cards","replies":[]}]}
