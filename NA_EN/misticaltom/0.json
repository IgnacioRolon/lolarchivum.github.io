This nerf increases the lock-out duration for reactivation while additionally weaking Early-shield health.\r\n\r\nSion is rather strong right now, but I do not believe this to be an acceptable solution.  Among over a Hundred champions, Sion possesses an entirely Readable kit. His Decimating Smash creates a huge AoE Warning on the ground with a 1-2 Second Charge up, complete with additional sound and Animations for when it hits that 1 Second mark and can now knock you up.  It has a Range of 600\r\n\r\nSion&#039;s Soul Furnace is designed to be cast as a Follow up for Decimating Smash, and the two abilities naturally sync up together. Soul Furnace has a range of 550 and lasts 6 Seconds, can be detonated 2 seconds into the Shield charge for an early detonation, trading the Shield for Damage.\r\nSimilar to Decimating Smash, Soul Furnace has a distinct Animation and Charge up Sound, making it a clear and obvious threat.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can literally see Sion&#039;s weaknesses in his Champion Spotlight. Before we saw him in the Professional Scene, people loved to bad mouth Sion and his absurdly easy counter-play.\r\nWhat makes Sion Sion is how he&#039;s an unstoppable Juggernaut, something that takes time and commitment to take down, not someone you can simply ignore.  The additional Second added to Sion&#039;s Shield exploding Duration will Cripple Sion Jungling, as the Shield can only Sustain 1 Minion Auto per rank. Meaning you can take 2 Hit&#039;s at Rank 1 before it dies, and 3 at Rank 2, and 4 at rank 3.  This means that Until Sion has a level 2 Shield, he can&#039;t even use the Damage portion of the shield if he doesn&#039;t first CC the Monster he uses it on. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s current Sion, now Sion&#039;s going to need an additional Rank(level 3) just to clear his Gromp through his Shield.\r\nWe&#039;ve not even spoken about the % nerf, and Sion has a low base health, so you&#039;re heavy-nerfing that early shield.  It is now useless at Rank 1. That&#039;s what you just did to it. There is no reason for Sion to take Soul Furnace, the move he wants to take to begin stacking Health, until level 3, and it&#039;s going to be a wasted point until level 4, or 5 if you take multiple points into any other Skill that may need them, like Decimating Smash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of other ways you can Nerf Sion.\r\n\r\nYou could change his Decimating Smash&#039;s Slow to increase per level, so it&#039;s not always 50%.\r\nYou could change the Damage on Sion&#039;s Shield to scaling rather than the Explosion Duration or Shield Health.\r\nYou could nerf the Range on Soul Furnace from 550 to 500.  I mean, Annie&#039;s spell and attack ranges are 650, so if Annie gets caught in Sion&#039;s Shield it&#039;s her fault right?  So why do we have to make the shield so much less.....Siony.\r\n\r\nBut what does everyone else think?  Do you find the shield abusive when you&#039;re fighting Sion? In lane or in Jungle?  Do you play Sion?

Did these complaints only come from squishy top laners who don't know what counter play is? You go into lane against a Garen or Darius that knows how to dodge, and it's all over. Landing most of your skills comes down to landing the previous, beginning with his e. His big combo hinges on landing that e, landing a decent charge on Q, and then blow up your shield which hopefully hasn't been destroyed. If he can't land his e, his q is going to do really poor damage and won't knock up, allowing your opponent to destroy the shield and then out-trade you because you can't detonate it anymore. This is what is know as counter-play. It exists for Sion, solid example.\n\nHe doesn't even have that much mobility in the jungle when he takes mobi boots, and his escape is also his initiate, so either you go in with it and hope that your team kills everyone, or don't use it, risking the outcome of the teamfight, but maybe you'll live. If someone doesn't stand in your way, you don't clip a corner, and you don't forget that even dead towers will still stop you. It's not that good of an escape is my point.

The reason Sion has such a high win rate is because the community as a whole does not know how to counter him.  Sion is basically Nasus, but everyone's at level 8 stuck watching the level 20 infinitely scaling champion farm over nine thousands stacks and one shot the whole map.  \n\nAnd don't tell me you just \"lol dodge the q, dummy\" because you are part of the problem.  Sion is extremely weak at the beginning of the game.  He is a champion who wants to be a durable frontliner, but can't actually frontline anything because he is so fragile.  Literally as fragile as a mage without the range, mobility and damage inherent in balance to compensate for his weakness.  However, if you let him farm up a storm, over-extend in lane and dominate early team fights then he will become an incredible force to behold, a vision tarnished only by whiffing an R.  \n\nWhich leads me to my next point.  His skill-shots are not difficult to recognize, prepare for and react to so it isn't that bad having to only dodge a couple Q's, an E and that R.  The problem begins to manifest when you have an unending barrage of Q's, W's, E's and R's to worry about in any skirmish or team fight because it takes so goddamn long to kill him.  Good players will prevent that from happening by punishing his early game.  \n\nThat's Nasus 101.  These are simple strategies.  This is easy to think about.  In fact I would encourage you to try it out.  Next time you lane against Sion try to pick a champion that has stronger all-in or better range.  Jarvan, Fizz, Swain, Riven, Xin, Cho'Gath and Irelia to name a few.  Stick him repeatedly with whatever kind of engage or poke you have and you can dominate the lane.  If he ever gets a little too big for his britches, call your jungler or mid lane up to gank.  When you see him getting low on mana, entertain some of his poke to bait his engage.  Pre-6 Sion is a gigantic walking squishy punching bag waiting for you to shred him to pieces when he commits.  And when he commits he puts his team at risk.  A team with a fragile tank is a vulnerable team.  You can snowball so hard off of Sion by picking on him in early engagements, provided you and your team have the presence of mind to run away and slow him when he comes back to life.  If he decided to invest heavily into defensive runes and masteries, then you need not worry about his damage at all.  In fact you'll probably just regenerate as much naturally as long as you don't go ham catching his axe with your face because he will go OOM long before he can actually threaten your presence and it will only take a little bit longer to shoo him out of his farm or kill him trying to get it.  \n\nSion's damage was integral to his transition into a threat, but his balance was gutted when they started picking at him and I really hope they compensate for what they've done because it honestly feels like a little kid just ran right in front of me and kicked my pretty sand castle over leaving me with a mess of frustration, disappointment and lost hope.","replies":[{"poster":"kasfas","date":"2015-04-12T22:05:31.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to double up vote this, sadly i can't, you do make some very good points though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-04-11T23:54:05.968+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really.

After 2 ranks in your Q, W is the far superior choice due to it's base scaling being just enough to push it over the edge for Jungle camps. 1 Rank in Sions shield can eat 1 shot before it gets popped on a 2nd from Gromp, while a Rank 2 Shield will stop 2 shots before it dies, and a Rank 4 shield will always block 4 shots. Add in items and by the time Sion has a Rank 5 Blood Furnace, and no Jungle mob will pop it before you. Most importantly, by the time you hit level 11 You're have a Max shield, and 2 ranks in Q and ult, making Sion a perfectly tanky Champion capable of Team fighting, which is GREAT! TEAM FIGHT AT LEVEL 11! YOU'RE AT YOUR BEST AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME.\n\nDon't listen to anybody who tells you to level Q first. It's great and all, but it's damage is mpt necessary, it's all about the CC and being able to tank towers.  For which you should be leveling your W anyways.\n\n\nRegardless ,the problem with Sion is how well he scales with Cinderhulk, not with Sion's shield being too powerful.\n\nPerhaps nerf Cinderhulk again, because Top laners taking Smite JUST TO BUY CINDERHULK isn't a good thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-04-13T12:32:47.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I said that you max Q first, I meant specifically for top lane Sion.

I am thinking the reason sion is so oppressive is that people are stupid, or peopel don't dare pick his counters to go to top lane. so rito, make it so more people will want to play the things that beat down the goliath, unless ou really are just a bunch of evil jerks that nerf champions for no reason but to remove diversity in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Misticaltom","date":"2015-04-13T07:13:17.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...they did Buff Garen's ultimate timer, and Garen easily out plays the big loaf, what with a slow removal, CC and Burst Damage shield, A silence/interruption, and a Ultimate that deals more damage based upon missing health.\n\n\nAnd yeah!

Either make the shield easier to pop with the lowering of HP percentage OR increase the time till he can burst so you have a chance to get away or have longer to pop the shield, doing both seems REALLY heavy handed for the ability neither AD or AP Sion will max first","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-04-11T14:15:57.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the %HP scaling nerf is the best way to go.  Making his early game weaker through it will make his weaknesses easier to exploit.  People also already max his W 2nd over his E, so once people get to level 13 there won't be a difference.
