The item will not interact with abilities that apply on-hit effects (e.g.  Ravage, Mystic Shot, Infinite Infinite Duress).\n\nAdditionally, effects that cause you to attack more than once will only be counted once (i.e.  Ranger's Focus, Double Strike and Lightslinger) - you cannot increase the frequency that Phantom Hit will occur.\n\n\nBolts generated by  Runaan's Hurricane even when hitting 2 additional targets will still count only as 1 attack towards trigering Phantom Hit.\n\n-Excerpt found on the League of Legends Wiki page \nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sated_Devourer\n\n\n\nThis is my thinking on Guinsoo's 4 hits for melee champs. I don't like it, but it makes sense. Why? Because melee champs have to get right in the middle of the fight.
