Downloaded the client from the website, installed it, logged in and let it patch.\r\n\r\nAfter it patches for an inconsistent amount of time, it seems to cause some sort of failure with my Hard Drives. The patches download fine, but once it switches to \"Applying Patches,\" it steadily uses anywhere from 80% to 50% of the drive's transfer rate until the rate just tanks to 1-0% and sits there. At this point, no other program on the PC will run properly, or start, and Windows itself will begin to fail. Closing the client solves nothing, as whatever it has done lingers after it has been closed. If the client is left open, after a few minutes the transfer rate on both of my hard drives will suddenly spike up to 90% at which point the PC completely freezes and the only way out of it is a hard reset.\r\n\r\nI've attempted running the program as administrator, and in compatibility for Windows 7. I'm currently running Windows 10 Home, attempting to install LoL onto a 1TB second Hard Drive with Windows installed on a primary SSD.\r\n\r\nI tried looking around for this but Google and these forums don't seem to purge any results related to LoL technical support that aren't YEARS old, so I've had no luck locating any relevant information. Is there any known solution for this?","replies":[{"poster":"TatsMcGee","date":"2017-11-26T04:16:28.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there an answer to this?

Let's take a couple steps to make sure we cover all our bases, and let me know if this doesn't seem to help narrow down the issue.\n\n- [Use the System File Checker (SFC)](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161\n) to scan for corrupted Windows files and replace/restore them\n- You can also scan your hard drive to check for any errors or corrupted file clusters.

Morover, when explorer crashed your desktop starts behaving in a strange way, impacting your application aswell.\n\n2) Uninstall **Avast **and turning off the **Firewall**.\nAvast was using a lot of CPU while downloading and it was useless work done because we know LoL's patching isn't harmful.\nAnd besides CPU's workload, maybe it was actually interfering with the client, i don't really know.\n\n3) Set PC's fans to **100%**, **cool down your room ** (turn off heating and open your windows) and open your case's **side cover**\nThis was done because my cpu was reaching >80 celsius while patching and i thought that i could be one of the causes of the problem.\n\n4) Close all **unnecessary programms** and just **go for it.**\n\nP.S.\nWhen you close the explorer your desktop's icons will go away. Open the \"Run\" window and just browse for the .exe file.\nMaybe some of the steps above are useless, but it worked out for me with this combination.\n\n**I'm no tech guy**, just your average nerd trying to reach diamond, so don't take this for granted!","replies":[]},{"poster":"RubbberDuckie","date":"2018-01-07T20:40:23.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has anyone solved this yet?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheHyperXion ","date":"2017-12-02T18:14:35.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue, Windows 10 Home.
