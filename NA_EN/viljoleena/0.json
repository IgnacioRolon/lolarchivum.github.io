Don't waste your time with these threads.  \n\nThat being said, I don't think Riot is that interested in lowering the amount of toxicity.  They are only interested in doing what's easy.  They clip the weeds instead of pulling them out by their roots.  The trolls who actually cause people to rage are never banned, they go on to troll tons of games and incite flame and toxicity exponentially.  They need to do something about trolls and people who antagonize others, or else they really aren't serious about stopping toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-03-24T12:26:43.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Trolls don't get banned in a timely fashion, imo. *\n\nThere, fixed that up nice and neat for you.

It's not.  It's being an asshole, but if I were to respond in an asshole manner, I would be looked at as 'toxic.'\n\nThis is the problem.  It's a good thing in the real world it doesn't work like this.  Also, games that self police with vote-kick systems, etc, often police passive aggressive people out.  If you are intentionally antagonizing someone, and they respond aggressively, nobody is on your side unless it's on LoL.\n\nBesides, being brainwashed into typing the same trite comment on every post on the board must be a terrible way to be.  I'm sorry you lack the critical thinking skills to make up your own mind and not just follow Riot's orders.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-03-24T13:22:04.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*shrug* Take it as passive aggressive or as me legitimately correcting your false claim. I don't really care. It doesn't change the fact you are wrong because trolls do get banned.\n\nVote-kick systems are also easily abused in some games, like CS:GO. They will try to kick someone who isn't performing the way they want. Hell, my friend recently got a competitive ban because he killed his team mates that were intentionally telling the enemy where bomb was or where he was. The team wouldn't kick because not enough votes. \n\nDo I respond to aggression with passive aggression? Maybe? Had a recent game where someone went \"Shit jungle.\" (and no I didn't report because I didn't care enough) and I replied \"Hmm? Did you say something?\" Does that make me as guilty as them? Yes, it would.\n\nI type the same comment on every post? Really? Cause I see some variety in words and even topics in most cases. The only time I usually repeat the same thing is: \n1. Someone is breaking the naming and shaming rule. Which they usually don't know its existence.\n2. When they come to the boards wishing to speak to Riot only and direct them to submitting a support ticket as the boards is public community.\n\nIt is cute that you want to try and attack my intelligence and I could easily retort. Probably with something like,~~ \"I'm sorry you lack the ability to gain information before making an uninformed opinion. Also a shame that you think people who disagree are following unspoken orders from Riot.\"~~\nWhich if the striked text as an example is breaking board rules, I fully grant mods permission to snip it even if there isn't a report against it.","replies":[{"poster":"SkullDuggery1919","date":"2018-03-24T14:17:48.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Intelligence and critical thinking are 2 different things.  I'm saying you have 100% trust in Riot, and that is not a good thing.  100% trust in institutions makes you blind.  It's obvious that they won't do anything significant about trolling, and they only ban people for words because it's easy.  You think that's ok.  I think there could be a better way if people like you wouldn't shut down any conversations on the matter.  Being dismissive isn't how you have a discussion, or how you solve problems.  If you want to protect the status quo, that's fine, but 'those are the rules' isn't valid reasoning.  \n\nYou start with passive aggression, simply because you disagree with someone.  It's disgusting behavior, and combined with your dismissiveness it prevents you from any real conversation.  So you post the same things over and over, and the same 3 people upvote you.  Good for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-03-24T15:07:48.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At what point did I ever say I have 100% trust in Riot? There are a few cases on the boards that show that trolls and intentional feeders get ban, already disproving you statement that \"trolls are never banned.\" we don't see more of these posts because they aren't disputed as much. Riot is a company and as such is prone to human error. The IFS they use is also not perfect as shown by the few false positive cases that occur. \n\nWill you seriously stop trying to shove shit into my mouth? Did I ever say that the pace they punish trolls to be acceptable? No, I didn't. However, I do understand that it is easier to catch verbal issues, which is why there are more punishment steps there. I also understand that catching every troll is difficult because mistakes happen and people want to report a single mistake as a troll. Team mate being chased by enemy? Try using Anivia wall or Trundle pillar to block the enemy, but timing was off and accidentally caused team mate to die. It was a mistake and Riot doesn't want to punish for that. \n\nIf you want a conversation, then actually make one. I am more than willing to have a conversation, but when there is misinformation, I will try to correct it. Make a post yourself, \"Why is Trolling hard to catch?\" link it and I will come have a discussion with you about it. The system can be better, I never claimed otherwise; but I do understand why it is slow.\n\nShould certain words and verbal behavior be punished? Yes, I believe so. Why? Hate speech has no place in a game, it isn't trash talk. Encouraging self harm has no place, it isn't trash talk (if ARAM, try d2b or Die to Buy). Constant harassment of a team mate? Doesn't belong. \"Not having too hot of a game Lucian.\" is fine at some point, but does it really need to be said constantly and rubbed into their face? \"Lucian keeps dying.\" \"0/3\"  \"0/4\", \"omg, you suck never play him again.\" Chances are, they know they aren't doing well and berating constantly won't help.\n\nI still disagree that my initial response was passive aggressive. The part in my second reply that I striked out? Sure, that probably is. Which is why I gave mods permission to clip that part as opposed to removing the entire reply potentially. Again, I am more than willing to have a discussion, but you have to be open to other ideas and discussion too. Before I really dismiss anything, I try to find some sort of evidence to back up why I dismiss it. The only time I usually repeat the same thing over and over is when a point is being missed and I try to explain it again in a different way.","replies":[{"poster":"SkullDuggery1919","date":"2018-03-24T15:41:54.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your first response was definitely passive aggressive.  You posted under the guise of correcting someone's post.  Do that IRL and see how it turns out for you.\n\nTrolls don't get punished as much as they should.  It takes a front page reddit thread to get them banned.  If you think correcting me by saying 'see, a minute amount of trolls have been banned so you're wrong' is opening conversation, then I don't know what to say to you.  You are indicative of a generation that has forgotten how to talk.  Thinking that snark and passive aggressiveness is the answer for everything.  Like I said, try it IRL, when someone is actually in front of you.  If you wouldn't, then you shouldn't do it online either.  I honestly wouldn't recommend it, if you did I would be concerned for your safety.  \n\nYou aren't willing to have a discussion, you're only interested in being 'right' over a minute detail.  The trolling is a problem in this game.  Following jg around and stealing camps, intentionally letting people die, etc.  I get that it's harder to look for than bad language is, but this is the root cause of a lot of the negativity.  Unfortunately the maturity level of this community is very low, all while having a very high false perception of where it is.  I've played lots of online games, and this continues to be one of the only ones that outright accepts toxic actions, and blames everything on people who vocalize it.  This community literally has people who log on just to harass and antagonize other players.  In most games, they would be met with swift perma bans.  Not this one though, they leave thousands of players in their wake, either with lost games or bans for vocalizing their anger.  This forum is a joke, because every day you have players coming on here and venting about trolls, only to be dismissed by board regulars.  Do you think dismissing their experiences and thoughts makes this game better?  Nah, you just want an excuse to be smug and condescending.  \n\nRiot needs to purge the trolls.  Reporting someone should also open you up to investigation as well.  They need to actually be active in their community for this to change.  Don't tell me it will be expensive, Riot makes plenty of money.  Don't break down inflated numbers (as I've seen before on here), because they don't have to police every game.  Take the trolling report seriously, and when someone is consistently reported for it, ban them swiftly and permanently.  There should be no place in a competitive game for people who are only there to ruin others games.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-03-24T17:35:14.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do do that in real life, or I did. I suppose different reaction because knowing audience and audience knowing me. Obviously that isn't the case for us. It wasn't meant to be passive aggressive.\n\nSince already addressed the last part lets focus on the first. Perhaps me correcting you wasn't the best way to start a conversation to you; to me it was supposed to trigger a question. I do take blame for not knowing the audience enough to guide that properly. It has taken some turns, but we have reached conversation. I will apologize for my mistake as long as you realize your own as well. Mentioning generation is a risky thing to do since ages are private. I am considered a Millennial because if you were born between 1981 and 1996 you are considered one.\n\nYou do acknowledge that trolls are in fact punished, and as we both agree on; not a timely fashion or as quick as we would like. How as community members can we make this better? This is an incredibly hard question with no perfect answer. Again, I encourage maybe making a board post to discuss (I am on mobile and things get wonky at times.).\n\nNow the discussion opens more. Before moving on, it is less that I want to be right and more that I like correct information. I agree trolling is a problem and really wish there is a better way to detect. Your example of following a jungle and doing such is good, but also risky. I believe there was a strategy on TT in which basically someone sacrificed all jg xp/gold to a carry. They would weaken the camps and let the laner take it. I admit I could be wrong because I am not familiar with TT strats and was a random post I read in passing. \n\nThere is a lot of toxicity in the community, but not all of it is caused by trolls or even int feeders. Some people trigger at the smallest thing, like a support accidentally taking 1 cs (whether a relic user who timed the charge wrong or a stray skill hitting). The flamer will usually accuse the support of trolling at that point and go apeshit. What I'm about to present is anecdotal evidence, so take it with a grain of salt. Back on CoD MW2 (I remember because xbox pissed me off), I played a FFA on Fuel and used p90 Akimbos for the challenge completion. At the time my motto for xbox profile was \"I'm the mother effin Bear Jew\" (Inglorious Bastard ref, strongly recommend it if haven't seen. Granted they use fuckin). Apparently I pissed someone off and they sent me a message using less than flattering language in German. I ignored them but they reported me and I got a 48 hour ban from xbox live. \nWhy did I use this example? Because it shows other communities can be just as bad, but since LoL has the rep already, we notice it much easier.\n\nSwift permabans would depend on the game. Games that actually cost money usually have to use other means of punishment and reserve perm for cheaters. It also depends how they work the servers. In Tabletop Simulator (fun if you like tabletop games but can't get people together) once in a game server by a host, it is their rules and they can ban you for what they want. Moderators of the game will ban you for the Global chat for crude language or disagreeable statements (Hitler did nothing wrong). Comparing to other games is interesting though.\n\nCould the forums be more friendly in some regards? Well, couldn't any place? Yes, some people come here and have valid complaints about trolls, but it seems a lot of times they want to claim someone is a troll that isn't. We have seen cases of \"omg troll support, no sightstone (rip)\", \"jg didn't give me blue, so troll.\", \"bot took my red at 25 mins. Report for troll.\", \"jeez this champ is building x instead of y, troll!\", and the oh so popular \"xyz died twice already. Report for troll and int.\". It is usually the latter that board regulars have no sympathy for. If it is a valid claim, we try directing to submitting a support ticket. If they are naming, we tell them that is against the rules, not to protect trolls; but to prevent the innocent people being accused of trolls from witch hunts.\n\nWhy should a person reporting, also be investigated? If you mean the antagonizing part that lead to flame and then the report, wouldn't the flamer have reported the antagonizer?\nI'll try to avoid overly inflated numbers, but still some.\nAssume 100k games for NA (ignoring other regions for now) (will also say that is 1 day.\n10% get reported for having a troll? I think that sounds fair. (considering some claim to have one every game) So 10k games to be reviewed.\n20 minute game because ff20. 200k hours of game to review. 480 minute workdays. So Riot would need 416 staff to review the 20 minute games (someone is welcome to double check, I may have missed a step.). That is staff in addition to the cost of their current staff, server maintenance, third party cost (like the forums), and other systems (like player support tickets and live chat.) Is it possible to do? Yes, but would the cost be worth it. I'm basing this off a game mind you, but in Game Dev Tycoon (more fun then one may think.) you can develop and build an MMO. You actually get to watch the profit and cost of the game. Eventually though the cost becomes greater and then you release an expansion to bounce back. \nThe point being, I didn't really pay attention to the cost of maintaining a MMO until I played that game. (off topic but fun fact, you can play a pirate version of the game. However, pirates will start to take the games you make in it eventually.)\n\nTrolling would have to have clear definitions to do that though, and very strict rules by Riot. By which I mean basically forcing a meta, which they don't want. Otherwise people may report me for Ornn support, or something else. Enough people displeased by my Ornn support when I'm still playing to win, I get banned for trolling. So, while yes, it is great to want to ban trolls swiftly. The problem is defining trolling past obvious troll builds (6 tears/ap zed [does he have an ap scaling ability? If so scratch that example]).","replies":[{"poster":"SkullDuggery1919","date":"2018-03-25T00:02:10.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's say that at 10 reports it triggers a manual review.  That lowers the amount of games to review, and weeds out some report abuse.  Riot does not have to view the game at game speed either, nor do they have to watch an entire game.  I really don't think the amount of labor is insurmountable.  It wouldn't happen instantly, but eventually you would see more trolls banned without needing a front page reddit thread.  \n\nIf you are just playing off meta, then you wouldn't get punished.  They have somewhat enforced a meta anyways by defining roles in champ select.  Want to duo top?  Go blind pick.  \n\nThis is ultimately in their best interest due to player retention.  I highly doubt these trolls are buying skins, and people like me are less likely to buy anything knowing I can be trolled until I tilt off the face of the Earth, and stop playing LoL for weeks at a time.  Not to mention the new players who get chased away, and people who quit.  It's a team game, and sportsmanship is key.  In solo games, you can only troll yourself by doing stupid things.  In this game, you can screw with 4 other people, so certain behavior should not be allowed.  If you were playing basketball and one guy decided to keep shooting at the wrong basket for lulz, people would kick him off the court pretty quickly.  Nobody would be mad at the guy who said 'what the f---- are you doing.'  This entire system is backwards and caters to trolls.  You can mute flamers, can't do anything about trolls.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-03-24T00:50:12.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Vilsh: lol kys\n\nSuggesting others end their own lives, commit suicide, kill themselves, etc. are all things that it should not need a warning to tell you that it's absolutely inappropriate.
