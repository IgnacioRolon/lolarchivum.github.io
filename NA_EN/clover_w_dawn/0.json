But they did call me that and did feed a lot in the game and still be fine. huh. There is a lot of games, I am done with league anymore, people couldn't feel good if they wanna be good at the game because there are too much random players that they could do whatever they want and the game system protects them so good.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-25T16:33:34.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"你在游戏里的表现不是你喷别人的借口。\n人家爱他妈说啥你就让他说，屏蔽不就完了。","replies":[]},{"poster":"IanSilang","date":"2018-12-24T01:24:42.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didn't protect you so good though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Vi Earth","date":"2018-12-24T00:18:53.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"our region is wants to have fun over winning or learning the game. thus unskilled players are at a all time high and to make it worse these \"toxic\" people engage the 4fun players and call them out causing more backlash than there needs to be. but thats the price of what we have paid and  we see it in our pro play as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2018-12-23T23:21:16.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just mute people who do that, don't respond to them, and focus on the game.

In lower elos, trolls seem pretty common. Just report them and ignore them, plain as that. They'll get what's coming to them.\n\nTrolls/griefers like griefing/trolling in Ranked games because they understand that people will be more 'mad' when they are trying to play seriously and they are griefing; so you can play normals (Has a similar MMR system just no glitter that comes along with it) if you really don't want to deal with trolls.\n\nMe playing with silvers I would say there's toxicity in about 20% of games in ranked when in normals it's more like 2%","replies":[]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-12-23T23:35:47.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The NA has a high intolerance of cyber bullying and as such regularly punish players who harass each other as a means to create harmony as well as not be subject to any litigation if cyber bullying was going on on their servers in the country region and nothing was being done to dealt with it. \n\nOther countries with lighter cyber bullying laws are more flexible in their language and how players deal with eachother in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2018-12-24T18:57:25.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is misinformation","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2018-12-23T23:05:26.343+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Indeed, NA is a sensitive region.\n\nIf you don't want to get punished for verbal toxicity and want players that can take criticism, then I recommend going back to the Korean server.","replies":[]}]}
