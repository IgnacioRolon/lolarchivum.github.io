I always see Yasuo hate in a lot of places I go regarding League of legends and as I main him I would like to know why. I know a lot of people are just going to whine and cry and be annoying, but I would actually like to see some intelligent responses. (which is why im making my own thread) If you come here just to rant then you can leave, but if any of you actually have some good arguments then I will read them as i am genuinely curious. Feel free to post opinions, stories, and tell me what you main. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-10-04T13:01:11.030+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:157}}  has an annoying kit. {{champion:17}} levels of annoying. Stupidly high mobility. Great defensive tool with his shield (that is recharged when he ults). Tilt inducing Windwall. Hard CC.\n\nBut that's not the biggest part of the problem. We have plenty of annoying kit champions. {{champion:80}}, {{champion:17}}, {{champion:86}}, {{champion:7}}, {{champion:105}}. The problem is: {{champion:157}} happens to be an hyper carry that scales extremely well into late game WHILE HAVING A STRONG EARLY AND MID GAME. He has no downtime.\n\n{{champion:23}} used to receive hate because no matter how you fucked him over early game, he would farm himself to late game and win any 1v1. Hell, if you failed to kite him he could 3v1 with ease. But that was late game and late game only.\n\n{{champion:157}} is given the double crit chance and 50% armor pen. This means that he has a 100% granted mid game power spike similar to being fed while also having Tyndamere-esque late game potential, but with a much better team fighting potential due to high mobility, two sources of hard CC and what is possibly the best zoning tool against ranged champions in the entire game with his Windwall.\n\nA good Windwall has the potential to turn a team fight on it's own. No other hyper carry has this potential to win a team fight through something other than damage.\n\nThis is why Yasuo is strong and this is why he's hated. He's an utility packed hyper carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Dárius l","date":"2016-10-04T02:38:17.671+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"He's not and if you think he is there is a reason you are in low elo =)))","replies":[{"poster":"Zykklon B","date":"2016-10-04T02:41:30.166+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"somehow silver 5 is considered High Elo for you lmao","replies":[{"poster":"l Dárius l","date":"2016-10-04T02:44:15.977+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YoungMadlife37,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2tEKZfb0,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-10-04T02:41:30.166+0000)\n>\n> somehow silver 5 is considered High Elo for you lmao\n\nNever said I was high elo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2016-10-04T02:57:33.698+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=noxus roolz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2tEKZfb0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-04T02:38:17.671+0000)\n>\n> He's not and if you think he is there is a reason you are in low elo =)))\n\nHe's cancer. \nYou're low elo. \nYou don't think he's cancer.\nYour argument is invalid.","replies":[{"poster":"l Dárius l","date":"2016-10-04T03:14:43.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"He's not cancer lmao\nI can beat Yas with pretty much every champion I understand how to play.","replies":[{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2016-10-04T05:24:07.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=noxus roolz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2tEKZfb0,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-10-04T03:14:43.196+0000)\n>\n> He&#x27;s not cancer lmao\n> I can beat Yas with pretty much every champion I understand how to play.\n\nA bronze Yasuo is different from a Yasuo with a brain.","replies":[{"poster":"l Dárius l","date":"2016-10-05T01:48:55.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So how is laning against a brainless Yas any different if I am a brainless \"whatever\"?
