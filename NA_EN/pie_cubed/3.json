I loved the thematic so much, but this was back when I was newer, around season 5-6. Her kit just doesn&#039;t inspire any sort of &quot;music&quot; feel, it just feels like braindead facerolling. While I&#039;m not a Sona player, I almost was long ago. To me, her kit has so much so potential, but it&#039;s wasted into lack-of-skill-expression bits.\r\n\r\nI feel like she could be reworked into something of a combo caster, like Riven or Ryze, where you have to weave your abilities in the right way to get the desired effects. That would really bring out the &quot;music&quot; thematic, as playing music requires playing the right notes with control and timing, and knowing what you&#039;re doing.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: not saying she needs a rework, but the thematic has so much wasted potential on what could&#039;ve been a beautiful kit.","replies":[{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-09-04T16:33:31.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I don't care what Riot does to Sona as long as it gets her out of the mid lane.

That guy's probably put in a thousand or so games with Sona mid exclusively. Possible?\n\nI never said Sona mid was never impossible, but it's just not convincing against something more meta, namely Syndra and Malzahar. Hard CC is her bane since she has no way to wriggle around without being able to move uncontested. If she gets hit by anything above a 35% Slow, she's going to be incredibly sad as she gets her tits punched in.\n\nI've played Sona mid quite a few times, mainly for \"lulz\" factor and had plenty of fun. I held my own against my laners, but when their jungler showed up, I had to either burn ult, Flash away, or try to run around like a Jesus Lizard and pray MY jungler showed up. Sona does well in even fights, but tends to struggle in uneven fights. Her ult only repairs a disadvantage so much; live or die on your positioning!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2017-09-05T00:09:10.618+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Know a guy who onetricks toplane soraka in diamond and the guy onetricking ADC Ahri got to master I think.

Then again, music doesn't tend to translate very well to gameplay (pen-and-paper not withstanding), so I'm not totally sure how they could fix it. Maybe they could add a hidden passive that she plays music for all nearby champions, changing as she casts spells and levels up. Kind of the DJ Sona gimmick, but not global and not near as the central focus.\n\nMaybe while one of her Auras are active, little music notes fly around inside and she plays part of a song that, if you combo'd abilities together in quick succession, would become complete and could begin playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snake Prince","date":"2017-09-05T15:08:43.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I tried to play her with the {{item:3504}} meta it sounded like a good call .

A good idea and good option, but not inherently the best.\n\n\nMaking her basic abilities feel more like music would definitely help. I personally suggest making them act like waves that flow out and do whatever it is they do. \n\n\nAnd, interestingly enough, the only people who seem opposed to reworking Sona is Riot.
