I threw down my Ice Wall to protect one of my allies form being pulled by blitz into the opposing team killing my ally due to him being trapped by my wall. When Blitz threw his hook it grabbed my ally and pulled him through the wall. I was confused and check Ice Wall&#039;s description and sure enough it said that it was an impassable wall. If it is an impassable wall then how can a Blitzcrank pull an ally through???","replies":[{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2015-11-05T23:30:58.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spells pass through walls.\nDashes pass through walls.\nChamps with dashes pass through walls.\nBlitz' arm counts as a dash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-05T23:29:21.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The intent is that Anivia's W functions like any other piece of terrain around the map (can't right click through it, can dash through it, can Poppy stun people against it etc). Since Blitz can pull targets through those he's also able to pull enemies through Anivia's wall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2015-11-06T00:23:10.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"impassable wall\" means made out of painted cardboard (stealing this from some other guy her in the boards).

This is as opposed to Azir's wall, where hitting it will make you bounce off so you can't jump over it, and it is also terrain so you can't walk through it (but a blink/teleport will go to the other side).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2015-11-05T23:32:02.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Blitz can pull through terrain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-11-05T23:29:08.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the description is not accurate.","replies":[]}]}
