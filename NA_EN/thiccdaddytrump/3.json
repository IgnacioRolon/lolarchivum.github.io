I for one really enjoyed this skin line and seeing as the Challenger Nidalee skin was on patch 6.1, I was hoping for a third installment this year, but I looked at the current PBE today and saw there was no Challenger Skin in the line up.  \r\nHas there been word from Riot that I missed??  I truly enjoyed the skin line and want it to be renewed.","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2016-12-18T00:35:47.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering the same thing, maybe they will put it on pbe after x-mas break when they begin getting ready to start the pro games (lcs/lck and whatever else regions) for this season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-12-18T04:19:59.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"7.1 patch is a long way ahead, they can add it on pbe during these two weeks\n\npls be challenger soraka <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-12-18T00:39:26.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Challenger skin are released on the begging of the competitive play, Championship skins are released after worlds (which is the culmination of competitive play)\nWorlds just ended not so long ago, you got championship Zed\nnew season hasn't started on pro play yet hence no challenger skin yet","replies":[{"poster":"ThiccDaddyTrump","date":"2016-12-18T04:11:14.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand how it works, but what I was saying was that the other skins came out on the 6.1 patch/5.1 patch on the PBE, but this year there isnt one on the PBE","replies":[]}]}]}
