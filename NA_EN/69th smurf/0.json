It makes me push the \"restart\" button and says it will apply a backup version of league when I restart. I have restarted about 20 times now, ran as admin, uninstall/reinstall, change location and have also tried the legacy client. Someone please explain and help me get my league to work again...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-24T00:05:31.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your files may have become corrupt during the installation, so it can't patch or roll-back to a previous version.  Your best bet now would be to perform a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) and get this fixed up.  You can attempt to download the updated client again, but remember it's currently in testing and you'll likely run into issues like this.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
