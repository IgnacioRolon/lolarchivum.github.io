I was playing ranked the other day, and whilst in the middle of it my league client bugsplat.... Now I reconnected and apologized to my teammates and help finish the game and we ended up winning.... Now I just logged in today hoping to play league and be happy, however, when I started matchmaking in ranked and started queue search... It put me in lower priority queue, despite it not being my fault and despite me apologizing to my teammates and contributing to our win.... Now I'm not asking to be taken out of lower priority queue because of this bullshit, but I do ask you fix this shit riot so other players don't have to suffer like I am because of your shit leaverbuster system... Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"DWlGHT K SCHRUTE","date":"2017-06-18T00:48:36.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must leave often I can't imagine getting punished because of one game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T03:38:23.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must have already played through your LPQ, since I'm not currently seeing any punishments on your account. It sucks that you logged in to see you were flagged as AFK, but keep in mind that the system will only flag you after multiple afk/leaves.","replies":[]}]}
