(kog maw, seriously who released this?)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"I was sure that play testing was a thing. Did nobody test this? Did nobody see the lack of skill required to succeed with kog?\r\n\r\nHe is now a single stat champ that can kill anybody at any stage in game, with any items he wants to get. But seriously only needs attack speed.\r\nThat&#039;s it.\r\nNever before has a champion been so linear.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s look at other ADC&#039;s for a second.\r\nGenerally speaking. When an ADC wants more damage, they buy AD. Which can be mitigated by armor.\r\nKog doesn&#039;t have this problem, as he is mixed damage.\r\nIf you were to buy armor, he has a built in debuff anyway, thus making armor completely ineffective against him.\r\n\r\nThe fact that kog is now attack speed, if any threat does get close to him, all it takes is any ally to put a .5 second stun out there and that seems to be more than enough time for kog to take away a massive % of any champ without any skill demanaded of them other than being able to use their ring finger to press w.\r\n\r\nNo other ADC will have this much sustain in lane, as non benefit as much from AS. This translates into doran blade being highly effective as more hits = more hp. Still not seeing the skill requirement here.\r\n\r\nMaster yi is another champ that is often considered a &quot;no skill attack speed champ&quot;. Aside from the obvious advantage range has over melee. I would argue that the hybrid dmg from kog is just as effective as yi&#039;s true damage. As one mitigation is not enough to stop his hp melt. And again, kogs debuff makes mitigation impossible anyway.\r\nEven if you do manage to escape his range with very little hp left. He still has the chance to snipe you with his ult. \r\n\r\nSo let&#039;s recap. He is effective early game. mid game. late game. close range. long range.\r\nAnd excels in all aspects by being based on a single statistic.\r\nUsually this is when you would nerf a champion. give them an obvious exploitable wekness that would apply balance to the champion.\r\n\r\nHowever to see kog released in this state. Makes me seriously question who the hell balances champions before release. Or at the very least what the hell were they thinking?\r\nI remember a day when if you had ADC X, there are AD&#039;s they have good advantage over, and some they are weak to.\r\nKog to me, has advantage over any ADC/support. And weak to none.\r\nThis is the definition of overpowered. Legit. Seriously. Don&#039;t just asy &quot;what a whiner&quot;. No, kog is broken as all hell. \r\n\r\nGraves has advantage of being that AD powerhouse. With a Q and R that are built to be those big hits, that reward purchasing AD.\r\nHe has some built in mobility, counter mobility, and is balanced with forcing the player to manage reload times. This lack of speed, is his balance.\r\nThere are some actual machanics going on here that require skill to play.\r\n\r\nEzreal is an excellent farmer. He can stay back safely, use E to escape most situations. Just take the time to grow.\r\nBalance to this would be that yes his W pierces, but does not scale as he buy&#039;s AD. Az &quot;shouldn&#039;t&quot; really be investing in armor pierce, as it doesn&#039;t help out his w e r damage. He does not excel in attack speed, and has low early damage.\r\nAgain a high mechanic skill shot champ, that requires skill and has clear attempt at balance.\r\n\r\nCait excels in range, hard hits, self sufficient. Balanced by mana cost and once you get in her face has limited escape. Pretty balanced.\r\n\r\nVayne is great tank killer, benefits her silver bolts from attack speed. Yet still needs AD to farm. Still needs lane time to CS farm and grow. Still needs protection.\r\n\r\nDraven is a powerful AD sure. But not overly so. He&#039;s just.. balanced out. well rounded.\r\n\r\nKog breaks the mold.\r\nAgain, it does not matter if you are close to him, mid range to him, or far from him. He&#039;s gonna deal the same damage to all enemies at all stages of game. Go ahead and kill him at start of teamfights, he will then do large AOE true damage giving upper hand to his allies at winning the group fight.\r\nIf he buys AD, it scales on his hits. If he buys AP, it scales on his skills. If he buys attack speed, it just procs more on hits.\r\nWhat is his weakness? Where is the sign of &quot;we tried to balance him&quot;.\r\nI see no consideration toward balance on this champ. He should not have been released in such a state, it&#039;s ridiculous.\r\n\r\naccording to elephant.\r\n\r\nChampion Rank\r\n\r\n+42 from last week\r\n\r\n50%  \r\nWin Percent\r\n\r\n+2% from last week \r\n \r\n#68  \r\npopularity\r\n\r\n+2 from last week\r\nEven looking at top tier builds. triple doran blade BOTRK tri force.\r\nWho the hell else succeeds so heavily from building pure lifesteal build? off hand I think of no others, as none have free attack speed steroid.\r\nSure yi has attack speed steroid, after he hits level 6!\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been in league for a long time, and at no point have I ever felt a champion be this broken on release. He legit is a champ that can be picked up by anyone, and have the same success. Kog is not punished by having high mechanics. Kog is not punished by improper builds or build order.\r\nHe gets speed, he benefits. he gets AD, he benefits, he gets lifesteal, he benefits. He can probably build tank and win fights simply because as he is abale to stand there longer all the free damage perks he gets from kit will carry his success. I don&#039;t see the difficulty in playing him.\r\nEven if he fails in lane and get&#039;s shut down. As soon as it comes to roam and mid game phase. He will still be able to afford some attack speed at this point and he can simply place himself on the backline where he is able to get hits out without being heavy focused and he will get kills/assists. And then use attack speed to tear down turrets.\r\nI fail to see the balance or skill required for this! That&#039;s what gets me most.\r\nIf you want to release a champ that is retard strong. Fine, at least make it difficult to play. Or have a ramp up time required for that champ to succeed. But for any kog to come flying out of the gate like this, is a joke.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve found what will help to keep kog down in early game, I&#039;d be interested to know.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t say thornmail. It&#039;s not a cheap early item to get. Armor gets reduced, and if you focus armor you neglect HP and MR leaving yourself just as weak to enemy mid AP. While STILL being hurt just as bad by the AP from kog. Not to mention, lifesteal will overcome and negate most of thorn damage anyway.\r\nThornmails are easily countered buy lifesteal and hexdrinker, so no that isn&#039;t a viable option.\r\nWith all of the item choices in game, kog simply has too much available to him to compliment what is freely given.\r\nJokes jokes jokes.","replies":[]}
