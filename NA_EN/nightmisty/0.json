In return? Tanks get 70 bonus health at level 1. WOOOOOO.\n\nThat isn't even going into fighters or anyone else that took Resolve secondary who lose out massively more. Now I get this helps AP a bit where Magic damage certainly needed a boon, so I have less qualms for the missing MR, but AD got huge buffs as well while defenses plummeted. The older system allowed for weak characters to find rune combinations to offset their major flaws, the new system's stat distribution is equivalent to those from Masteries, AT BEST. The end result is a loss in any stats gained from Quints and blue runes, as well as the variable armor reds, [scaling] health yellows, and other things like lethality reds to increase the potency of %health damage tanks could make use of. \n\nThat said, the new runes are not, entirely at least, a failure, but they're going to result in a much harder balancing act as characters that end up too weak can't have the stat variables to compensate and find the right balance of and are going to need straight base stat buffs leading to more potentially game breaking knob turns. Without the equivalent of 6/18/6 mastery pages, it further restricts the build variety. \n\nMaybe have a \"set bonus\" selectable for rune pages in addition to the bonus from the main path. For any page that has Resolve as its main path, they could chose from among the defensive stats to gain as a bonus, and their secondary path offers an alternative choice, like adaptive penetration for Domination, or scaling CDR for Sorcery. These numbers could approximate the values of the missing Quints and alternative runes from the old system.\n\nAt the bare minimum, give {{champion:78}} her missing +7.4 health per level and +5  Armor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheReal eLTwiX","date":"2017-11-09T17:39:42.088+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't like this new runes, unbalanced.
