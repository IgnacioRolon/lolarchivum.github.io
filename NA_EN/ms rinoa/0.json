Question not answer.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I have been having a miserable time playing with the new client and it is quite and annoying time. I looked at a couple of posts and came across something that Targons Blade had said. He said the way to disable it was to first go to, C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends-AIR ONLY\\RADS\\system, however there is no AIR ONLY in my settings. I ignored this and went on with the rest of the steps and finished. However when I reopened the client, the beta client was still there. anyone have any ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"gononono64","date":"2016-11-30T11:54:46.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This will allow you to load old client instead of the new one\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGo to install directory \nEx: \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\"\nGo to Rads -> system \n\nOpen: user.cfg in notepad\nChange \"leagueClientOptIn = yes\" to \n-------------- \"leagueClientOptIn = no\"\n\nGo back to install directory\nRight click on \"lol.launcher.exe\"\nCreate shortcut\nClick and drag onto desktop\n\nDouble Click shortcut to open old client\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T02:34:30.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohai~\n\nIf you want to delete the Beta entirely, you'll actually have to reinstall League completely using [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends). If you'd rather skip reinstalling the game entirely, you should be able to simply launch into the *Legacy Client* by hitting the button at the login screen, as shown below:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/215576628/Launch-Legacy-Client.jpg\n\nI hope this was helpful.
