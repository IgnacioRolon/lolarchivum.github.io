One orb of deception will do 140+170 magic damage and the same in true damage on the way back. With this item, it will do roughly 140+210=350 base magic and true damage. Factor in the item passive and you get bonus damage of 350*.25= 87.5; Taking into account the other champion's missing health, it will do an additional 40% damage: 350*.4= 140. Total bonus damage from the item = roughly 227.5 going both in and out.\n\nTotal damage: 577.5 damage both ways (keep in mind that the items provides bonus damage to just one ability when it hits a champ, so it sort of fulfills the role of the old DFG but adds a component of working for that burst rather than having in on demand- we can also have like a little glowy thing around a champ who has more than a certain amount of stacks so that you can anticipate them doing a shitton of damage.\n\nTL,DR version: Increases an ahri's q against a champ at half hp by about 65% after hitting some minions with spells.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-02-11T23:09:35.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voidheart Crown\nAP: 120\nHP: 200\nVoid's Might (Unique Active) : For the next 4 seconds, gain 15 magic penetration.\nEyes of Pain (Unique Passive) +15 magic penetration\n\nRecipe : Haunting Guise + NLR\nRecipe cost : 3500 gold (415 gold to complete the item)\n\nI wanna murder people :|\n\np.s.

Which did it's % damage right away. It's not like he's going to throw this on the nearest squishy unless he wants to do less damage to them. \n\nRemember, it cancels out all MR and penetration. If you had enough penetration to bring that ADC's 30MR to 10, it's a self damage reduction. And the %hp damage is based off bonus HP. Which wont match the old DFG's % max HP damage unless they build way too much HP. They'd have to have 2-2.5k bonus HP just to match it.","replies":[{"poster":"SwordGrunt","date":"2015-02-11T22:40:39.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how that would decrease the damage done to squishies, Magic Penetration can't bring their MR calculation to the negatives, only flat reduction can {{item:3001}} \n\n\nIt would basically make you do true damage for 6 seconds making heavy AP stacking without penetration extremely broken, especially when we're talking about heavy AOE damage in a teamfight. The 10% bonus health is a good idea though.\n\n\nMaybe I misunderstood you and you meant bonus magic resistance? If so that would be pretty interesting yeah. Amplifies your damage to tanks, but if you have any penetration it decreases the damage to squishies.\n\n\nI think the first item would quickly become a huge staple for offering all the stats most mages need in a single item plus the powerful reset passive. I do like the last item though, reducing mana cost is an interesting idea that is not utilized at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Llanite","date":"2015-02-11T17:51:30.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing Riot, there will be some weird things like 5% extra magic dmg each hit, stack 3 times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-02-11T20:37:50.003+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot talked about having a burst-friendly alternative to {{item:3151}}, e.g. an item that would allow AP assassins and burst casters to take on tanks.
