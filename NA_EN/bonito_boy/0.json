With the new client rolling out and built in replays being added, it is such a great tool ! I dont post videos of gameplays or montages or anything but I have been looking over my replays and ive been critiquing my own mistakes and noticing movements of junglers and  what not and this was such a great decision!!! Also really happy to have my questions answered now such as \"why didnt draven die? did the chain break when he was in fog of war or did he use a protective spell?\" Wanted to express my thanks for this tool that has helped me noticed my mistakes in game sooo much better , and I really wanted to know as to how to download the replays from like actual files? I want to be able to send or permanently keep in my folders the replays and any help would be much appreciated ! &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T22:36:59.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rewatching your own matches can definitely help, so it's valuable for me too.

Good luck!\n\nI went into that folder and the file was .rofl and it wont open with any program. Is there any way to watch that file? I know matches save in match history but what if you really enjoyed a game and after some time its no longer in match history, can that game never be seen again?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T22:58:12.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like we actually just posted a [FAQ about replays](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/2JWmR6sF-replays-are-live-in-the-new-client-faq-pro-tips).  Some portions can be changed to a different file type which can be played on HTML5 instead of the client through a specific set of hotkeys (ctrl+V to enable).
