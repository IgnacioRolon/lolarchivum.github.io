Always","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This jsut started happening a week ago my ping all of a sudden is stuck always at 91-93 and im the only one home, i reset my router and it's still stuck at 91-93 it never goes lower, but literally all the time i been playing league it's always been 70-83 never higher unless some random ping spike but it's usually that, I live on the west coast and before the servers were moved i was usually at 60 ping to but i mean 70-83 ping is fine, what's just annoying about 91-93 ping is that literally from time to time, my champ or whatever im doing will freeze or repeat itself for a second or two then go back to what i originally wanted it to do, and it's been annoying and i cant adc or mid anymore so i just keep jungling until it goes away or stops.  But please is there anyway I can stop this or find a way to lower my ping, nothing is running in my background, what should i do? What is there to do?

While we do have the Riot Direct Network, it is still up to your ISP to get you onto our path as quickly as possible.  Before it seems that they had you on a more efficient path as opposed to now which is taking a slightly longer path.\n\nUnfortunately, if this is the case, there is not much we can do :(  The best suggestion I have is to bring this issue up to your ISP directly to see if there is anything that can be done on their end.\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[]}]}
