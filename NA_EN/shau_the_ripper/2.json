The last reason was cause my league crashed in the middle of champ selection which caused me to quit league for three months I recently, came back to league. May I mind you three months break. But a couple days ago I got the que time because my laptop restart, so I understood, my mess up so punishment. But now as soon as i load into the game, This couldn't pop up anytime sooner or before i got into the game. Im getting so pissed and annoyed now this stupid error message popped up saying \"There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive D;.\" Like what? I downloaded the game from the internet why would it need a disk. So now even cause im in game im going to get punishment from this, especially cause it's ranked. This is not even my fault this has never happened to me before. So for one how do I fix this, and for two please if I get banned or the que time take it off please cause it's just going to make me quit league again.","replies":[{"poster":"Shau The Ripper","date":"2016-10-03T20:43:13.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T21:54:23.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnecting from a match negatively impacts everyone in the match, regardless of intent.
