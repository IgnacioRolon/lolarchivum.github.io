It's a good amount for the item, but looking at that number '40' in the shop, it really makes you not want to buy it. If they were to buff it's AP to 50 or 60, it'd be a lot more appealing by looking at the numbers.\nBut other than the low AP count, it's a good item. The passive for it is really strong for an AP jungler, but very few are AA reliant which is what the item tends to lean toward. I went in a custom game as Fizz and I was clearing the camps really quickly with an E and a Q, but other junglers have problems. Diana would work well with it because she has a ton of AA's thrown out when she fights, but pure mage jungers would have probelms with it.\nThe 10% cooldown reduction is a cool bonus. It's not the old 20% of Magus, but it's a different item.\nI sort of have a problem with the item is the mana sustain. It's not terrible, but it's not really good. 8% missing mana restored isn't terrible, it's actually good when you're on low mana, but when you're at a higher level of mana, it's not so well. I'd think a good, flat 6% max mana restored would be cool and really strengthen the item, but the 8% missing mana is balanced.\n\nSo, they should really just increase the AP it gives so it looks more appealing on paper, because the item is pretty good in itself, but it's AP isn't visually appealing.","replies":[{"poster":"Frikgeek","date":"2015-06-24T19:42:33.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They really can't buff the AP if they want to keep all the enchantments at the same price.

Plus it gives mana sustain so she _can_ spam spells, or at the very least weave them in between her auto attacks, both in the jungle and ganks.\n\nSaying that it's not good because it helps her do something she was already decent at is like saying Cinderhulk isn't good because it helps the tank junglers that had decent clears clear even better","replies":[{"poster":"UNSEENRE4PER","date":"2015-06-25T16:30:26.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dracid means that the extent to which it makes her better at what she already excells at is neglible. For example if you're an ADC and you already have 40% LS, would you really want to spend gold getting 5% more when you could potentially buy other stats that decrease your other weakness(crit,AD, armor etc). Her JG clear with AS and some AP is crazy good already. Magus is soo much better than RG.. AP+ CDR gives you much more return throughout the whole game then two amp tomes worth of damage from RG.  The AOE passive isn't that good considering she already has her passive. If they made the ratio of the proc significantly higher so that it scales well, then it would be worth it. But as it stands they should have either allowed both items to exist, simply change magus, or buff RG.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kãtãrinã","date":"2015-06-24T15:12:13.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"you have 2 spam spells for it to work?
