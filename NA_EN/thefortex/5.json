She can basically summon minions with her abilities that determine whether they are melee or ranged, and her ult empowers them. \n\nSince your champ is based entirely on leading minions, i like the idea of having different types of minions, tank v damage. i think it makes most sense for it to be decided upon spawn what they will be, but i don't know how that would work. \n\nThe abilities you have so far consist of summon, stay, empower, and come. \n\nTaken from Zyra, i would combine the summon/stay command. Plant something, and than use the ability again to summon them. The planted minions also activate when you R and come to you. I would say that the R would kinda work like Syndra's R, just a mass running towards you? But if the ult's number of minions go over your allotment, the extra would die soon after reaching their destination. \n\nYour R seems like the only thing close to a defensive ability, and since you said the champion is very squishy, could become frustrating very quickly. \n\nI think the E is fine as an empowerment ability, gives you a little bit of an edge. I would use the freed up ability as some sort of shield/dash/escape/heal.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFortex","date":"2017-10-22T08:48:05.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your support but im only giving a main idea with abbilitys to help make others understand how this champ will work. So you dont have to take everything from here and put it ingame. Its just a main idea not a finished champ. Hope you understand\nAnd about the defence for this guy: he is supposed to be very squichy and weak alone thats why he needs minions with him and around him so if he is walking alone he is basicly helpless","replies":[{"poster":"Fanta Sea Fox","date":"2017-10-22T21:35:07.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes i understand that it was a general concept, was just trying to make sense of it for myself. its still a cool idea! let us know if you ever come up with anything else for it :0","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leah Kakuni","date":"2017-10-21T16:49:26.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a much weaker version of azir","replies":[{"poster":"TheFortex","date":"2017-10-21T20:09:22.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think alot stronger and better than azir... since they get to follow you and they last for a long time","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheFortex","date":"2017-10-21T20:20:37.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"man i never come up with an idea and people think it's good but it seems great to me why is this happening to me? i mean the idea is just perfect you are a leader and have an army that fights for you if you die they all die and you lead them and stuff i mean i would be so happy if im playing a champion like this maybe its because im young i think some stuff are awesome but others just see it stupid... anyways thank you all for telling me its a bad idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"PearPearadox","date":"2017-10-21T16:57:53.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is too fucking strong. 10 Minions with 50% of your stats is basically 5 extra champions on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFortex","date":"2017-10-21T19:59:43.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i said u can change those stuff... and ur right they actually should be around 2-6 10 is too much... also remember that they also have 50% of your movment speed only","replies":[]}]}]}
