NEITHER A PUBG FAN I JUST GOT THE IDEA WHILE LIVING MY WORTHLESS LIFE\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s like you choose where to spawn like casual battle royale games, you walk around and you find chests/crates that contain items or just items thrown around that you can pick up. items that you buy normally from the shop would be just thrown around the game. the champion pool would be reduced so that the item&#039;s pool can also be reduced to fit the champs involved and be able to spread items around in a nice rate.\r\n\r\nreally this idea is just a random idea I got out of nowhere it isn&#039;t that serious and I&#039;m not begging for it to be in the game or anything I just think it&#039;s nice.\r\n\r\nplease tell me what you think politely it is just an idea here.\r\n\r\nthanks for reading ^^","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-24T19:39:14.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot already answered: it just wont work without putting way too much effort into it, the engine is not ready.","replies":[{"poster":"chubb100","date":"2018-07-31T15:19:47.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=E88rPX6V,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-24T19:39:14.506+0000)\n>\n> Riot already answered: it just wont work without putting way too much effort into it, the engine is not ready.\n\nI think what they are saying is the game would lag out when more that 10 players ar on the map\nAlso Riot wants to focus on the 'team' aspect of the game\n\nBut I do like the OP idea.  I wish Riot would make it happen as a RGM","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-31T19:51:56.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not lag so much as i highly doubt the engine is even capable of putting over 10 champions on in one session without some serious modifications.

Maybe as a timed 15 min game, most kills win or as 5 deaths and you are out (then you become a spectator) \n\nMaybe use the Ascension map and mode for this?  some objectives to get points so people dont hide in corners or sit in spawn area.  Could still use the 2 spawns and not allow attacking while in that area.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
