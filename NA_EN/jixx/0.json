(wouldn't be too hard just mainly a recolour and adding some fluorescence to the tossed kama).

As a fan of the Predator series, I didn't much like how Yi had so little in common with one of those aliens, but i was cool.\nRengar and Nidalee were great because they retained more of the traits of a Predator, Rengar more like the big Alpha Predators from the most recent movie, and Nidalee more like the female human character from older Predator comics. Each have weapons and skills more in line with a Predator, so it was a really good fit. \nCaitlyn...I'm kinda on the fence with her. The overall look is less like a Predator and more like a random SciFi safari hunter. I do enjoy the look and feel of the ult, with how it invokes the terror of the shoulder blasters, so it kinda was a mediocre fit.\nAdding Akali as a Headhunter ends the line with a whimper after the so-so Caitlyn. \nPredators from all indication in film, have been mainly males. There had been some parts of the franchise that included human women, but not to the extent of the team makeup of the Headhunters now. Akali's weapons and skills do not really reflect a hunter and don't mesh well with the Predator base. Finally, Akali already has a number of skins and sadly there are some champs who have not been getting skin options.\n\nIt was a fun line, but it could've been better.","replies":[{"poster":"TheJinxedOne","date":"2015-03-13T06:31:26.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i semi get what you're saying but... stealth and ability to rapidly lunge at you remind me SO much of the AvP game playing as Predator","replies":[]}]}]}
