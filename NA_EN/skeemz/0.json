If you dont have a fix for this bug then disable queue dodge timers and lp loss from dodge until you actually deliver a client that does what it was made for and actually get you in a game\r\n\r\nTHANKS","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T02:22:14.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That error \"failed to create dump file\" is actually an error coming from the Bugplat message because the client crashed and it's trying to tell you why. You should have seen a different more specific error message from the Bugsplat, but that ended up having an error as well which caused this dump file message. Let's try running a quick repair through the client options, and if that doesn't work let me know so we can dig a little deeper.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flyerwing2","date":"2018-02-23T11:25:16.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i get the same message over and over again...\nits hard 2 climb when u get kicked out in 50% of all champ selects in rank.\nI checked all my drivers, updated, let repair toolts work... nothing changed, the same message over and over again... frustrating, that riot made it that way for some players.
