Since everyone wants to instantly make me the bad guy for trying to find a replacement for blatant toxicity aka racism and name calling.  This experiment worked and the only true way to not get penalized in league when the match is over is to not voice your opinion whatsoever in chat throughout the entire game because at the end of the day whatever you say will be used against you . \n\n*I do not support toxic behavior , but I also do not support the banning of people that spend thousands of dollars on this game only to get banned from a few negative phrases*","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-07-02T00:37:03.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking this discussion as OP has deleted the original thread content.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-06-30T13:41:10.394+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typing out your negativity one word-per-line won't change the negativity, and the IFS will still punish you for it.

People need to practice restraint and find other methods to vent their frustrations, not try to fly under the radar while still being toxic/negative.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Viomaster","date":"2019-06-30T13:52:13.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Tjis isnt a guide to negativity its a guide to reframe from calling people names .
