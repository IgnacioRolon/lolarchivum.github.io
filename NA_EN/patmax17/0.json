If Neon Strike and Super Galaxy are more or less synonymous for the skin line of \"shonen/mech anime inspired with bright colors\" then shouldn't you just put neon strike on the ones that seem closer to the neon jump suits of sentai series and super galaxy on big mecha with more metallic hues? Like how Sweetheart and Heart Seeker lines are pretty much the same universe but you pick sweetheart for Annie just because she doesn't really have the arrow/cupid theme?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-05T16:52:22.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">  If Neon Strike and Super Galaxy are more or less synonymous for the skin line of \"shonen/mech anime inspired with bright colors\" then shouldn't you just put neon strike on the ones that seem closer to the neon jump suits of sentai series and super galaxy on big mecha with more metallic hues? \n\nAgain, it's a discussion the team had, and decided not to.

Heartseeker was never specifically explained as a champion with a bow, which is why Orianna was selected as this year's Heartseeker. Sweetheart is more light-hearted, which is why we called it Sweetheart.

But Not only I believe Neon Strike is a better name I also believe it sounds better (especially for Fizz).

Also, Annie is really young, so making her a Heartseeker felt like a weird call.\n\nThe examples you are using are like comparing apples to oranges. Concerning you're example of battleboss/ final boss vs arcade is a whole different situation... Those are skin lines that are quite different in their color scheme. Those two skin lines convey a sense of good vs evil which I find to be a very appropriate situation. Whereas heartseeker vs sweetheart and neon strike Vi vs super galaxy shyvanna literally have the same color scheme and general aesthetic feel and practically look identical. Having two identical skin lines doesn't provide any positive interaction of any kind. So honestly it just doesn't make any logical sense to me. \n\nNow to speak to your comment concerning the reasoning behind the choice of Annie's skin name you have failed to acknowledge that Annie is also a pyromaniac (practically demon child) who is \nFAR from being innocent... So actually heartseeker fits her \npersonality quite well!\n\nAnd don't pull the \"don't shoot the messenger card\". If you don't feel qualified to answer the question with real knowledge on the subject then don't post on the thread. Save us all the headache and take it to someone who knows what they're talking about and direct them to the thread so they can get us a logical answer. You're responses consist of you running around your own words and acting like you were part of the decision and defending it as if you had a key role in the decision. There have been numerous feedback threads in which you've responded to and you've recieved negative responses to your \"I know what I'm talking about attitude\". One that comes to mind is the large amount of disappointment in the lack of particle changes on the marauder Ashe skin. Everyone disagreed with the choice of not putting red particles on the skin, to which you responded saying that Riot wants to give champs a cheaper skin for people who really enjoy a champ but don't want to spend a lot of money on \na skin. Exhibit A: Ashe literally has freljord, woad AND Sherwood Forest. 3 cheap skins!!! 2 of which (woad and Sherwood Forest) have particle changes. Imagine that! So you can make a cheap skin and give it particle changes. Prime example of you're logic. We would rather not have a response at all then be given an illogical response that clearly was thought through.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrodinium","date":"2016-05-10T17:58:24.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither Woad nor Sherwood skins have particle changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Unvictus","date":"2016-05-12T02:14:18.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pyrodinium,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=okIn4dwh,comment-id=000e0000000000020000,timestamp=2016-05-10T17:58:24.196+0000)\n>\n> Neither Woad nor Sherwood skins have particle changes.\n\nYes they do, her abilities have a slight green tint to them on both skins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-05-05T17:01:15.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tl;dr pedantics.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GUNVALKYRIE","date":"2016-05-05T00:16:30.010+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bad decision","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-05-05T05:57:35.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Katey!\nI admit I'm a bit sad on this, but I guess we can't always have it the way we'd like it :)\n\nNow I'm wondering: neon strike and super galaxy are similar skin lines, with the same inspiration and probably from the same alternative universe.
