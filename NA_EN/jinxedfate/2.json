You build Infinity Edge to get that extra 50% Crit Damage, and you build Mercurial Scimitar if your an AD having problem with CC. Do you see where this is going?\r\n\r\nWith the mid season mage update, they changed A LOT of items and added a few more. With this, they changed something drastic: Mana. It used to be where if you have mana problems, Athene&#039;s or Tear was what you were to lean to, but now with the changes to Athene&#039;s, with an exception of a few mid laners, its useless to buy for your normal common mid laners such as Ahri or Annie. So now your left with two items at your disposal: Morellonomicon or Archangels. The alure of Archangels is a _mana_ based build. Because of this, most characters do not fit this archetype because they don&#039;t spam abilities enough, however there IS another reason. So now we look at Morellonomicon. Morellonomicons &quot;Unique&quot; identity is supposed to be an item that you build if the enemy is sustaining using heals. However, its stats make it lose its identity. At 100 AP, 400 Mana, 20% CDR, Grievious Wounds, and then its &quot;restore 20% of your mana per kill or assist&quot; it makes it a great item.\r\n\r\nSo lets do a quick analysis, starting with gold efficiency. Gold Efficiency is a term used to describe how much your paying for each stat using the base values provided from simple items that provide that single stat. So for example, to calculate the base cost of AP, we would take amplifying tomb and take its 20 AP and divide it by its cost, 435g. this makes each point of ap roughly worth 21.75g. We can then plug in these values in other items to find roughly what the cost of CDR, Mana, and other stats are.\r\n\r\nSo after you do all this, you come with a gold efficiency for Morellonomicon roughly 113% WITHOUT the passives. In comparison, Athene&#039;s Unholy Grail is at 99% gold efficiency, while Archangels is only 73% Gold Efficient unless you stack mana items, finally reaching 100% efficiency at 1300 mana from items.\r\n\r\nAnd this is WITHOUT the passive. Archangels automatically loses because its gold efficiency was calculated WITH the passives. And if we included Athene&#039;s passives, the efficiency goes up to 121%, but because of its new unique identity, its useless on most normal mid laners.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, what I&#039;m saying is that Morellonomicon has lost its identity as a item solely built to counter people with high sustain, now its used as an item solely for its mana, many people forgetting its intended use. Now this doesn&#039;t seem like a problem, but being a support main for close to two years now, I prefer supports where I can actively sustain my team through a teamfight, such as Janna, Nami, or Soraka. But with Morellonomican being built on EVERY mid laner, it makes it hard for me to do so. And it would be one thing if I KNEW they built it because of sustain, but I guarantee that is not the case in 90% of the games (seeing as i&#039;m only in silver, most people (no offense!) do not have the smarts to counter build against a support). Also, proof of this can be seen whenever you play a game without any sustain characters at all. I know for a fact that whenever I play a game, the first item I see mid laners rush is Morello, it being used as a font for mana, high AP, and quite a bit of CDR.\r\n\r\nSo what is everyone elses thoughts on this?

I believe what is being argued here is Morello's should be designed as a niche item that is built specifically because the enemy's healing is an issue that needs to be addressed and the player is willing to sacrifice some base stats for a passive that justifies the trade-off; this trade off happens between mortal reminder and Lord Dominik's Regards. This trade off does not happen with Morello's. The stats are so good that many mid laner build it and when the enemy is healing enough to make it an issue, there is rarely a dicision to make because most of the time every builds Morello's anyway, even if the enemy was not healing.

It certainly didn't work against solo lane Raka.\n\n>Now this doesn't seem like a problem, but being a support main for close to two years now, I prefer supports where I can actively sustain my team through a teamfight\n\nSustain is toxic. Riot doesn't like you.\n\nGold efficiency is more of a general stat that doesn't take into account how well the champions' kit meshes with the stats given.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-10-01T23:22:54.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More of double standards; marksmen sustain all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-10-02T05:03:03.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before that, they need to finish their double full damage combos or be called Vayne.
