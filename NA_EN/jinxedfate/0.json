I go and click the button for the replay, and it says an error occurred, please try again. I clicked the \"download replay\" for the games before and after that game, and they both were fine, and they were played right before and right after the game I wanted the replay for.\r\n\r\nI would really love to get the replay for this match, because it was my first Penta on Cait and I felt that I did really well in it, but moreover I wanted to see what made me do so well that game; If I was just outplaying them, or if maybe they were doing something that allowed me to get out of hand. Either way, I really want this replay, no matter what I have to do to get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T01:46:34.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a chance that replay was never saved correctly after the game ended, but we might still be able to get that replay downloaded. I'd like to be able to see what exact error is showing, so could you try grabbing that replay again and taking a screenshot of the error with something like Gyazo. Paste it here for me to see and we can go from there!","replies":[{"poster":"JinxedFate","date":"2017-05-27T13:44:06.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I have to hover over the button to get the error, so I can't really send a screenshot of it.

Give it couple days if you can, and see if it will let you download in case it's just not on the servers yet. \n\nI noticed that you might have been playing with friends in that match, so I may have a little workaround if you still can't get it downloaded. You might be able to get one of those teammates to download and send the replay to you if you have any of them on your friends list!","replies":[{"poster":"JinxedFate","date":"2017-05-28T05:18:19.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I did what you said and asked my friend to download it.
