I get client errors every game. Fortunately, closing the client and reconnecting solves... Most of the problems. There is however; the problem of reconnecting to a game that is frozen and unable to play or leave the game. Resulting in a loss or \"leave\" on my account. I have a video sample. \n\n\nhttp://sendvid.com/qk63cd5p","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T05:00:39.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The *reconnect* issue that's mentioned on the [**Service Status Page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) definitely doesn't look related to the video you linked.

While it may or may not be related to the connection problem [Discord and Pandora were running but muted for the video as per usual], my point is as I stated before, there are points in the game where I can reconnect before the game starts and times when I cannot reconnect at all.  These particular instances are causing the loss/afk. These connection problems don't always happen but, seem to be appearing in abundance this current patch. Thus my QQ is strong.  Hope I clarified everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T21:33:50.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losses and AFKs are *really crummy* when they occur due to a technical issue with your computer or network, which is why we should continue to work together to resolve this.
