I was defending myself because they were telling me how much better than me they were.  Ditto the \"blaming region\" thing, because a player was saying everyone on NA was garbage.  The comment to the shaco was actually the exact thing he said to me in the same game, about my losing vs my top lane counterpart.  So, on all these counts, you're mistaken.\n\nIt's also very strange to hear you say that asking someone to stop being toxic when they were constantly flaming me, and priding one's self on still trying their hardest when they were losing badly up til the late game, is passive aggressive.  Or that I alone am, somehow, \"ganging up\" on someone.  And as I said before, the \"gg ez\" was ironic.  It was far from it.\n\nYour take on this is patently like tea leaf reading.  Not through any fault of your own, of course.  This is simply a problem with the report system.  There's no context, no one else's comments, no scores to be seen, all unlike the Tribunal.  I do appreciate that you mentioned that this happened the day after I returned.  Time and again, Lyte and other Riot employees have mentioned that every player is occasionally \"toxic\", that they have a bad game and say harsh things.  This is one game after a 14 day downtime.  There's literally no chance for a pattern to be established.  And all told, there's very little \"toxicity\" to it.\n\nThese reasons are why I feel this ban is invalid and unfair.  I should have been given some time to prove myself, one way or another.  This one game actually demonstrates nothing.

Sorry for the sarcasm, but I didn't know it was removed and I'm willing to bet 10k gold at the start of a game that millions of other people don't either.  \n\n2. Removing the only means by which people could see their behavior outside of punishments doesn't help. It may not detract... but it's quite obvious something needs to be done to help people understand they're pushing closer to a level that isn't going to be fun.  If the idea is to correct their behavior and not to punish people then there should be a way to gauge their \"threat\" so to speak.\n\n3. I think there's a LOT of specific suggestions tossed around. Many of them GREAT suggestions, others not so much. And the only consistent thing I see is RIOTers playing politics, sticking to policy and offering very little feedback regarding them.  Do I think you should address every post about how one guys being a jerk and doesn't agree with why he was banned? No.  But when there's HUNDREDs of those forum posts I think you owe it to us to explain how you plan to address the obvious problems that lead them to get there.  It's not merely their toxicity, it's their inability to gauge their progress and the systems inability to provide leniency for those who are trying to improve. Among many, many, many other things that just don't seem to be addressed, ever, and don't seem to be made a priority when looking at this system.\n\nReally hope to hear what you have to say about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2016-04-28T20:51:19.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I just ask why exactly players' reports lose value?\n\nI personally don't see that helping much to be honest, but of course I realise I probably don't know best, it's why I'm asking. \nEDIT: The way I see it people can and still will fake report and call for players to be reported aka causing a negative environment in game and in postgame chat.

But since they're handling player accounts, they also want as little false positives as possible.\n\nFrom the second condition it follows that when the automated process is uncertain what to do, it will instead of doing something snd it towards for manual review.\nIt follows from the first condition, that you want this to happen as rarely as possible.\nLogically, that means you want to have the automated process to be as accurate (and thus certain in its actions) as you can achieve.\n\nBut here's the thing, you can't possibly know that the system will detect all kinds of toxicity, so the uncertainty in pardoning a case is always higher. It has to, at least occasionally, still trigger a manual review, no matter how certain it is in its verdict. Just to make sure it's not missing something.\n\nThat's where report filtering come in handy, since... well say somebody literally reports every single person they have ever played with and the system's sure their newest report was bogus, then you really don't need to check that report manually.
