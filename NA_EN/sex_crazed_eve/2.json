They are spirits, they're created from a miasma of pain and emotions. So you're more likely to give birth to one stubbing your toe. {{sticker:sg-kiko}} \n\nIt might seem limiting, but sometimes it can be interesting to consider how little we understand and can relate to demons, as human beings. They're spirits, they're hunger. It makes them scarier, IMHO. Especially when this first realization falls away, and you see they were us all along...\n\nI'm sorry if this makes Ev harder to ship with Kayn. But limitations can drive some relationships; tsundere, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2018-08-14T21:01:24.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are demons able to feed only on pain and negative emotions?
