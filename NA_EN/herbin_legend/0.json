Before I begin I would like to make it clear that I am in no way bashing my teammates, or inflating my ego when I refer to future examples. I am an average player. I am in no way perfect, and I, like many other people, am trying my best to practice and solidify my play.\r\n\r\nThe main problem that I have encountered from the majority of my games played occur at the beginning. I consider myself above-average in mid lane/adc for the current ELO I am in. Because of this I tend to win my lane 7 times out of 10, tie 2 times out of ten, and lose 1 time. But before I even have time to recall for my first buy, my team already manages to have a bad start in their corresponding lanes. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the case for maybe 80% of my games. The score will be 2-10, us being the 2. Although kills don't necessarily win games they also tend to have objective control as well. So how can I spread the lead that I have collected, or prevent the enemy team's from growing? I have tried ganking from lane, after recalling, but it leads to the enemy lane playing passively because their wards weren't swept, my lane opponent shoving the wave denying me exp/gold, or both. I communicate with my team asking them to sweep here, place pink wards here, group at this time and focus this person. I know it can get annoying so I try to be as nice and concise as I can be, but it never gets anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do given the circumstances? Again I am not bashing on my team, trying to make myself look like the victim, or claiming to be in some sort of \"Elo Hell\". I just want to know what people in similar ELO's manage  to do to avoid or remedy this situation?","replies":[]}
