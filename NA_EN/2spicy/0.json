If a permanent ban is earned, that ban is not reversed -- the chance for reform was given at least once (and usually 3+ times) prior to reaching that step. It isn't a sliding scale where there is always one last chance -- the last chance is the 14-day ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-11-01T20:40:43.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.\n\nThe reformed gets to continue playing the game instead of getting permabanned again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-11-01T19:10:56.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Too bad so sad.

So I think it's accurate to say that Riot values reformed players to the same extent that it values ANY well-behaved player.\n\nIf you're asking whether or not they value the reform itself? I imagine they do, but not in a \"we're going to specifically reward it\" way -- good behavior is the *expected* behavior, so while it's fantastic when a player reforms they aren't going to get any special treatment or exemptions for doing so.\n\nThe \"reward\" for reform is getting to keep your account and continuing to receive honor rewards, or having a new account that isn't punished (if that player was permanently banned).","replies":[]},{"poster":"CreampEye","date":"2017-11-01T19:00:57.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Whosa Is Yousa","date":"2017-11-01T19:02:40.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-01T19:03:50.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't understand the question.
