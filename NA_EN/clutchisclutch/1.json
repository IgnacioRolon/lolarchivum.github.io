I think I'm too use to it usually being within the first 24 hours of the patch's release. It's not too common I see something delayed by such a degree. I'll be patient and wait though. Would love to get the skin, but Cait's hasn't been my main in a long time. Wouldn't mind getting back into her though, she's still fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Evelyn Endwise","date":"2017-05-20T15:57:22.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think part of the reason the content is delayed is that Riot wants to be sure the patch is stable before they turn any new stuff on ingame.

I do fully understand the reasoning though. I've been with the game long enough to see its ups and downs, and how problematic rushed releases can be immediately after a patch is pushed through for major content, such as a big skin or a new champion release. Hell, I still think the worst case that probably invoked the turning point that birthed the delays was Leona's special case, that happened to bring down the servers for about a couple of days.","replies":[{"poster":"Evelyn Endwise","date":"2017-05-20T18:12:51.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My memory's hazy, but I seem to recall Hecarim's release knocking the EUW servers outta commission for about 3 days.\nDamn, those were the days lol.
