I had my account hacked into for the first time in 8 years (yes, I realized I have been playing that long when I looked up when beta started). I requested a refund for the gifts that were stolen from my rp points through the wrong form. Within a week they told me that I made a mistake and within a day of correcting it everything was refunded correctly. I greatly appreciate this and I wish I had more time to give back to the community these days beyond being a civil and educational player.\r\n\r\nThanks again and feel free to respond with your thanks.\r\n\r\nKing {{champion:33}} 4 life, It is good to be king.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T15:11:53.155+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was really nice to see your post this morning, and I'm so glad that we were able to help out.
