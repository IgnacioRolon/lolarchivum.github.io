I am currently running a repair on the client to see if that will fix it but please look for a better answer than it is our connection, the only thing that has been changed on my computer since yesterday when i played last was your patch. something is corrupting/corrupted not allowing me to connect or even get to the loading screen to start a game.","replies":[{"poster":"IISevyII","date":"2016-07-13T01:22:40.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"went under the help option in the client and ran a repair to the client... took about 5-10 min and seems to be working now got into the game no problems this time.. somthing on the file needed to be corrected from the patch.","replies":[{"poster":"PoppyPleb","date":"2016-07-13T03:09:26.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The repair is going to take a while lol.
