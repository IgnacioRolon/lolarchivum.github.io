The ward skin will select but what you should do is click the ward you want, and just let it run for a few minutes. If it doesn't update try reloading the store, make sure to only click it once- leaving the page will cancel the platform call to swap your ward skin\n\nLet me know if that resolves it. I was able to reproduce this but picking a different ward and just giving it a few minutes to update resolved it","replies":[]}]}
