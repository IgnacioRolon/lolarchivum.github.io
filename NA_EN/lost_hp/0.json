The new champ select however looked very nice and even better than the current champ select we have since the news and store tabs were greyed thats obviously something you guys still seem to be working on. But since you guys just updated the store on live I'm guessing that's prolly what we would get in the alpha to as it fits into that streamlined look.  \n\nOverall I like the changes 8/10 in my book. A valiant effort. \nnew champ select 10/10 really nice to see the full character portraits when choosing the champion.\nthe rest 7/10 not really much to say things are just placed differently but its not really a change or anything too special its just basic ui changes.\n\nGJ tho riot I look forward to seeing this as it comes to live instead of being alpha im sure alot could still change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zacktootall","date":"2016-03-07T07:46:07.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and are you guys actually going to listen to us? if so then sign me up i already have alot to say. if not then i hope the leaders of riot will realize(before it's to late hopefully) that the current game is broken in a way that it seem that only the players can see so plz tell you higher ups that the players(the reason why games are made to begin with) are angry and are leaving in mass until they fix it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-03-07T05:01:35.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CapnBeanFlakes, hey :)\n\nI was wondering if you could help ARAM players.
