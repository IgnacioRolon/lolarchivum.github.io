It was a hour and 6 minute long game and I reconnected during the 5 minute mark and still recieved (5) 20 minute queue ban's {1 hour 20 minute queue wait time} Please don't give me queue bans when it wasn't my fault. My internet is completely fine because it works well on paragon. After that game I tried playing paragon to make sure it wasn't my internet and it worked fine. Please remove the queue ban it really isn't fair and please fix this issue so no one else gets queue bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T17:29:41.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being gone for a few minutes from a match is enough to be marked as AFK/Leaver. Additionally, you won't get a 5x 20min penalty from the [Leaverbuster System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), as it takes a trend of disconnection to reach that penalty. Because disconnections negatively impact everyone in the match, regardless of reason, they're treated equally by the system and penalties cannot be removed.\n\nIf you can give me a bit more details about the error messages you saw or the specific behavior when these issues happen, we can work to resolve the technical issue causing your disconnections.","replies":[]}]}
