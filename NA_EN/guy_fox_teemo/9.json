His win rate for experienced players is barely 55% which is average across all champions. I would really like to see some actual stats on what makes him broken, because spouting that he's annoying and frustrating because he is good at CS'ing or being a lane  bully doesn't seem like a very good argument to me, or his \"safety\" in kills.\r\n\r\nThis is a legit question; How on earth is Zed considered OP, not frustrating but OP in the fact that he wins games just by being picked, like release malzahar rework with a 60% winrate, I honestly don't see any stats supporting Zed is OP besides Banrate which is extremely subjective and tends to skewed heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is Zed considered OP?

A good zed player can beat any champ in lane. Pretty much no one actually counters zed. No one wants to play against him because it just means they don't get to play at all but just sit there under turret waiting to die. Not because he wins games but because he's no fun to play against and your always going to lose against him in lane regardless of who you take.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ozag the Mighty","date":"2016-05-31T03:48:57.350+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed Zed isn't OP at all every Zed player I've seen goes all in on the ADC yes he may secure the kill but he's killed shortly after.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PandaTabu","date":"2016-05-31T03:44:50.187+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think zed is balanced.

First off he uses energy, which means he doesn't have to manage mana which is a HUGE advantage early game since he can spam abilities at will.\n\n**Contempt for the Weak**: Zed's basic attacks against targets below 50% of their maximum health deal 6 / 8 / 10% of their maximum health as bonus magic damage. \n\nHonestly one of the very strongest passives in the game and he doesn't have to do anything but AA someone below half health. Plus it's MAGIC damage, so it makes it harder to itemize against him.\n\n**Razor Shuriken**: Ranged ability for poking lane opponents or farming that can be double fired from his shadows making it harder to avoid and doing more damage if both hit. The main reason he lanes so strongly and well since the CD is so low.\n\n**Living Shadow**: Another great poke and farming ability that gives him great safety. He can literally swap over at any time making it very hard to predict your skill shots against him. Let's not even get into the free passive he gets that increases his bonus AD by up to 20%!\n\n**Shadow Slash**: AoE damage that lowers the CD of Living Shadow for EVERY champion hit. Plus it has a slow component as well. \n\n**Death Mark**: The most hated Zed ability. He becomes untargetable, so he can avoid CC, skillshots, tower shots, etc. Gets a free Ghost for 3 seconds. Can swap back to his initial cast spot with no range limit. All damage he does during the duration does up to 45% of the damage done PLUS 100% of his TOTAL AD! The kicker is that his passive usually gets applied during the mark so end up with a huge extra chunk of damage from that as well.\n\nSo you can see Zed has a pretty loaded kit that synergizes very well with itself, further amplifying its power. Plus his counterplay potential is thru the roof and one of the very best in the game. With all the Armor pen available now and the gutting of QSS, it's easy to see that no one wants to deal with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-05-31T03:59:13.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"But what data supports himb eing strong?

I used to play alot of Zed (been playing Azir &lt;3 lately)\n\nCurrently I can't bear to see people call Zed overpowered. I attribute alot of the complaints to low elo (yup I'm low elo too) players not knowing how to play safely against him. Now you're thinking: \"well there is no safe way to play against him etc etc, but listen. \n\nWith definitively skilled elo players (Plat+, Ranked) he has a 49.7% win rate. That ranks 34th, right behind Lissandra (and I mean we ALL know how super duper op Lissandra is right now). Yet weirdly he has around an 87% ban rate. \n\nRecently he's been hit with nerf after nerf (the increase on his W cooldown hurt pretty badly) yet people keep asking for more nerfs. His win rate has gone down 3% since around patch 6.7 and 6.8.\n\nOne of the more annoying parts of Board conversations about Zed is people chiming in with a \"he takes no skill, he's so easy wtf rito.\" He's definitely not as hard as Azir, who is one of the hardest champs to play well, for example. But having the mechanics and awareness necessary to properly duel with your shadows and outplay your opponents is really hard. I played Zed for months on end and that was something I always had problems with. \n\nSure his ult is click and point, but look at Nautilus, Vi, Caitlyn, Annie, Lissandra, Garen, Warwick, Malzahar, Veigar with their \"click to win\" ults. But certainly Zed is the OP champ here. Nevermind the fact that 7/8 of the champs I listed (poor Caitlyn) have considerably higher win rates than Zed right now.\n\nI also think a large brunt of complaints come with the fact that he's an assassin. His quick kills (all assassins have them) tilt players. Meanwhile, Swain is sitting at a 55% win rate but is only banned 4% of games. I mean seriously, Kassadin has a higher mid win rate than Zed right now people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-05-31T03:13:14.431+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"It's rare to see some one use this logic on the boards... +1 to you comrad\n\n...hopefully it'll help buffer the onslaught of downvotes you're about to get from biased board-users that hate Zed because...well...others hate Zed","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-05-31T04:10:13.498+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"ok so you play zed... have you ever had to FACE zed as an AP midlaner?\n\nas an AP mid laner the FIRST item we WANt o buy is something to give us mana so we dont need to keep backing.\n\nzed on the other hand has energy  and will never need to leave lane due to lack of resources\n\nagain the same issue is zed can use his abilities to farm freely where as when fighting zed we have to consider how much mana we can spend on killing minion\n\nzed is also an AD champ so he can last hit minions very easily where as it is MUCH harder to last hit with autos as an AP much\n\nzed can apply pressure and farm from safety, and is next to impossible to gank because of his shadow. again this is possible with AP champ but we need to watch our mana.\n\nnext is itemization\n\nzed's first item vs an AP champ will be{{item:3155}}  which gives him a HUGE advantage\n\nwhat an AP champ WANTs to get is a MANA item,, but we are forced to get{{item:3191}} \n\nwhich even after we complete it we need to stack it, and even fully stacked it pales in comparision to {{item:3155}}  because of the passive.\n\nzed will ALWAYS hit six before we can finish{{item:3157}}  AND the cooldown has been increased. so even if we use it to save ourselves once.. zed will have his ulti back before we can use it again.\n\nwhat makes zed overpowered isn't just one large issue.\n\nits not like he is broken because he has one thing that is completly OP..

Zed needs to snowball and snowball quickly or he falls off very hard, if his early game strength lacks, he doesn't snowballed, be forced to roam, let the mid laner farm more, get behind even more if he isn't successful with a roam if people are smart and ward, fall off even harder since he isn't a great team fighter, etc etc.\n\nWithout his strong laning power Zed suffers heavily which is why I think the next patchs \"nerfs\" are going to be quite a hit to any player below 100+ games on Zed, as their easy harass in lane for kills will suffer quite a bit in fact, even with the buffs to the QW combo.\n\nNow I'd also argue he's quite easily denied creeps, as are every other melee ranged laner in the mid lane, just because he has good waveclear, doesn't mean he can farm well, as it doesn't translate to much when its under tower if you can't one shot teh wave, it might hurt in fact since the tower will kill the minons in one hit. Poking Zed under tower should be quite easy in fact, since he'll have to be using melee hits to take all the minons since his Q wont be up in time, making a Lux or Azir have teh time of their loving constantly poking him, but thats very much up for debate i'd say.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-05-31T04:16:44.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please see every other assassin ever.\n\nAlso, Zed is fine at farming under tower because both his E and Q are AoE, meaning either it will kill a creep, get it low enough for his passive to kill, or have it just high enough to take a tower shot without dying.

Low ELO is Low ELo. \n\nHis Q is a skillshot. His W has a high CD early on so his waveclear is eh, and his W is his only way to gapclose toward you. His E is fine. But skillshots are skillshots. I used to swear that Lux was OP, but then I learned to just dodge her BS. \n\nNow his ult: point and click, then he has to attack you. If you're under turret, then he's under your turret attacking you. There's a time gap between when he ults you before he can go back to his safe shadow that's away from your turret. If you're getting ulted, auto'd, e'd, q'd and die under turret without him also dying, then you're doing something wrong. Sure he's a duelist but he's far from being overpowered. \n\nOk let's look at mid lane. Specifically, I'm looking at mid lane with high elo (Plat+, Ranked). Including Taliyah, there's now 51 champions that can go mid. Of those 51, 30 have winrates above 50%. Stop looking at 50% win rates like it's something every champion has, because it's not. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that among experienced players that know what they're doing, Zed is merely less than average. He has a great laning phase but he has awful teamfights (he pretty much gets to throw out 1 W or a few Q pokes before its over) and he has an awful late game. Once it hits 35 minutes with a Zed that hasn't snowballed then it's over. \n\nI currently main Azir, who gets countered by Zed extremely hard. But I win lane. Sure I use mana, but I use it wisely to CS and to poke. I don't even build zhonyas/armor first because I know how to lane safely. Zed can't apply pressure because he can use his Q once every ~10 seconds and after that he's left with skillshots that have eh range. Poke him, deny him CS, and shove his lane in (with proper vision ofc) and there's nothing to worry about. If he ults you, walk toward turret, pop potions, you're fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caítlyn","date":"2016-05-31T03:15:33.059+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Guy Fox Teemo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E48AtF5c,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-31T03:10:40.321+0000)\n>\n>  Look I main Z- \n\nDownvoted","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-05-31T03:17:52.424+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"That seems to be the logic most people have that hate Zed , \"He mains him so he's 100% biased and a shitty person.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
