In addition unlike other mid lane assassin he has no viable way out If he engages wrong. Team fight are also a massive problem for him because of the reason listed before.

In high levels of play a talon is expected to get a 1 for 1 a best most other assassin are expected and often do kill their target and safely get out. Saying that talon has no counter play is simple untrue because so many of his mid lane rivals are very effective at stopping him from snowballing only a select few are unable to had him in lane and those who can't often are more utility based. also his w range isn't that large a poke heavy mage will simply poke him out of lane if he can't all in before he's too low. The simple fact his kit might have been good for a while but with this current state of the game he isn't a smart pick if you play him it's because you want to not because your team need you too.

Talon has few counter play against others.\n\nRiot's official guidance on how to play against Talon, in champ descriptions:\n\n\"Talon has no sustain in lane, so poke and harrass to suppress his growth.\" Very true. Talon has nothing to rely on other than his trusty health potions. He cannot even safely farm, and has to face the many auto attacks from the enemy champ. Not to mention the skills he has to dodge. His weak early game is his breaking point, much like Akali or Azir or say.\n\nTalon's rake is very heavy in mana costs, and he gains little from it. Vapora Dark has it covered that Talon is forced to use W only for farming, pre 6. It is a pain to play against almost any champ that is not melee.\n\nTalon ults and stealths! So waht? Pop a pink ward or do the red scanner trinket! Talon is revealed! CC him, kill him, he's as weak as a minion in terms of durability (not exaggerating here).\n\nI am very shocked that many people in this post are still. STILL. yelling to nerf Talon. \n\nHe just got his silence removed, for Talon's sake, the one edge he had against many mages.\n\nA silence that lasts one. One. second.\n\nKeep in mind, that Talon has received multiple nerfs to his Bonus AD ratio and his dmg in his W and R. Also keep in mind that Talon's E's dmg amp has not been activated until S3, where Riot shockingly discovered was never in action (ha. classic Riot). Now S4, S5, the appearance of trinkets make it very easy for any champ to reveal Talon's stealth, his only means of escape.\n\nSome people here talk about how other champs' counter play to Talon is flash. Well guess what, Talon's counter play to escape/outplay is flash.\n\nAND NOW. with the removal of silence, Talon has no means of attacking or holding his enemy, and can only see them escape. Talon is weak on his own. Talon is a weakling.\n\nBut LoL is not a game of 1 v 5. It is a team game. The TEAM will create situations ideal for Talon. They will create the best angle for his skills, will take out enemy's exhaust so Talon can go in, will create Talon's roaming angles for ganks...\n\nIf a silence-less Talon, compounding with his numerous dmg nerfs he already received, still manages to kill you in game, I can only say that there is nothing wrong with Talon, but there is something wrong with what YOU and YOUR TEAM is doing in the game. Are you allowing Talon to split push, when he is as strong in SP as Master Yi or Sivir? Are you not using pink wards or red scanners? Are you ignoring the fact that Talon is mia, and just ignores that?\n\nTalon is all about timing now. That's all he's got. Riot and you childish haters have took away his silence, cut his dmg in half. The only thing every good Talon out there looking for is a decent timing to charge in and unleash the combo. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. You should all know that this is compulsory. Because even a level 18 Talon will only have as much as 2000 health with 80 armor and 60 MR, which any. Any same-grown ADC or APC mage can shred him to parts with their full combo/ AutoAttacks. Not to mention bruisers or Tanks. He's weak in terms of durability, that's why Talon cannot afford to be hit, thus his combo needs to be as short as possible, like the \"2 seconds\" some childish guy whined about, because if he cannot kill the enemy in that TWO SECONDS, he'd be the one who's dead.\n\nFor some thoughts, much like Tomb of Insomnia said, Talon's 2 trademark skills/dmg is split in 2 parts, both. To make the bursts healthier, he could have the projectiles slowed down, or have them return to Talon after a longer time, so he too can become like Zed to have a \"healthy burst\" (classic Rito. full grown Zed can ALSO kill you in 2 seconds, not considering the Ult).\n\nI write this on a mobile in my college class, because I felt empathy for Tomb of Insomnia who got beaten and downvoted by the haters for speaking true words.

Overall though there are quite a lot of other characters that need the work more, so he's not a rework priority.\n\nRight now, he stands as a bit of a problem through virtue of being an assassin tuned for being an assassin (ie. he can jump on a squishy and delete them without breaking his stride), yet most of his damage output is AoE (Rake and Ult)--effectively making him an assassin that kills your carry while bursting the rest of your team down because they happened to be nearby.\n\nI think a good step in the right direction could be to turn his AoE from an AoE assassin tool, to something that actively inhibits his assassination power if he's trying to take on a big cluster of enemies. For example, giving Q and R the treatment Gragas's old dash had, where the damage is evenly split among all units hit, or having Q function similarly to Zed's Q (dealing greatly reduced damage to enemies beyond the first), having blades from Q and R only deal damage once on the way out and once on the way back. Honestly, anything that gives him some interesting weaknesses to allow for equally interesting strengths rather than the whole \"either he bursts you alone, or you and your entire team\" situation he has now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SexySoapTurtle","date":"2015-09-04T23:40:26.185+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we focus on taric and poppy before we start reworking anymore champs please?","replies":[{"poster":"Chespin2013","date":"2015-09-05T02:46:47.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:83}} {{champion:19}} uh hello","replies":[{"poster":"SexySoapTurtle","date":"2015-09-05T03:08:06.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chespin2013,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HGTH43EE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-09-05T02:46:47.159+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:83}} {{champion:19}} uh hello\n\nToo bad those arent coming before taric and poppy","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jolyne Cujoh","date":"2015-09-09T08:18:11.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counter play would be amazing against him, especially something that works easily for squishy midlane mages.
