Naut is never, ever played top in my ranked games either and I'm in Plat... Fiora is pretty much a permaban because she's just too ridiculous. Sure, you can attempt to counter her in lane, but the last think you want to do is go a Cleaver against a Malphite. Your passive is 2.7% per 100 AD, going up by .1% per level. IF you rush a Cleaver, you're skimping yourself out on a lot of wave clear and costing yourself a lot of AD. Tiamat gives 40 compared to Phage's 20. Building into a Hydra also gives you more sustain since you've got the option of getting the Vamp Scepter early to make up for your own lack of sustain. \n\nThen you just play with your passive. You can walk about 1k units from your enemy and your passive will change its position because you just reset it. You then Q at them to poke them down while sustaining from both your passive and the vamp scepter if you chose to pick it up. If you don't and rush the Tiamat, you'll have 40 AD from that, 15 AD from runes, 4 flat from Masteries and .55 per level. Let's say you're at about level 9, so you got 40 from Tiamat, 15 from runes, and about 9 from masteries, which puts you at 64. Now add in the 5% from masteries as well, so you're at 67. At level 9, your passive does 3% plus 3.6% per 100 AD. Since you only have 67 bonus AD, your passive will do about 5.4% of their max health as true damage. Even if the enemy has a lot of armor, you can poke them down with the passive and using your Q. Even early on when you're only sitting on the 3%ish, you can Q to poke them down pretty easy. It's not like Malph's Q can do much if he goes with armor, Tahm's damage isn't all too strong early on top of the fact that his wave clear is near garbage tier unless he levels and uses his devour to farm, which means you can poke at him for days while letting your Tiamat push him into his turret.\n\nHer counters almost don't exist. He has to be poked down and go against some one who is actually able to outlane her, which is not a tank.
