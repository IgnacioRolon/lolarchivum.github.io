The ping from my computer to my server is ~15ms and the ping from my server to Riot's server is ~8ms so I thought it could only improve the situation (I'm pinging 104.160.141.3 btw, EUW).\r\n\r\nAfter browsing the net, I figured out that setting up a SOCKS5 proxy server would likely be the appropriate solution, since it can redirect both TCP and UDP traffic. After some time, I was finally able to setup my server using [brook](https://github.com/txthinking/brook). On the client (my computer), I tried the following software:\r\n\r\n- brook itself\r\n- ProxyCap\r\n- Proxifier\r\n- SocksCap64\r\n\r\nThe best I was able to do was proxying all TCP connections, but when an actual game starts all UDP connections are ignoring the proxy, leaving my ping unchanged. I've been spending all my time on that for the last two days and I'm starting to feel stuck.\r\n\r\nHas anyone any experience on that? Or maybe a better alternative?\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n- I'm running Windows 7\r\n- My server is running Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- EUW","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T22:37:57.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I wouldn't be able to personally assist you with this one.
