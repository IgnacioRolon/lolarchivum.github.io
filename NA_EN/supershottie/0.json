If anything, in my time playing Yuumi, I've come to learn which ADCs are decidedly BAD and which ones are GOOD. Players need to learn how to play with Yuumi to have her do well, as her kit is very dependent on your own positioning. So if you're doing bad with Yuumi, chances are you're not doing that great without her in the game either.","replies":[{"poster":"AgentSpiritWolf","date":"2019-06-10T20:33:55.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard not to agree with Ole on this one.  I liked Yuumi kit so took a stab at playing/learning support for a little while recently.  I absolutely have made terrible mistakes in the learning process, so don't assume for a second I'm claiming I'm a good support, but...\n\nSome ADC's make the process so easy it's ridiculous, I have had 0 death 40+ assist games with yuumi, on the other hand, some ADC's are just totally uncarryable.  Many with no clue that last hitting minions is important, or too likely to stand in a spike instead of shoot and move, or my favorite, so scared from beginning of match that they stand so far back they don't even get xp from minions dying.\n\nEven at my low - medium skill level learning yuumi and support, the good adcs blow everyone away almost every time, and the bad ones seem unhelpable, they aren't suddenly going to correct these errors they should have learned about in bot games.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-06-10T23:24:43.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually pretty funny - I play her a bit oddly compared to most other people who play her (I use a Guardian page instead of an Aery page, since I'm gonna literally be attached and all) but it's still all the same concept. My findings are more in the positioning and demeanor of your adc than anything - if your adc is aggressive and overextended, you're not going to have a good Yuumi game, because they're going to get caught and die, and then they're going to blame you for it. If they play too scared and don't try to do anything, it's actually *almost* better for you, since you can fire off your Q, run out and poke real quick for your passive proc, then jump back...but knowing they're not going to commit with you means you have to be *extremely* careful not to get caught. And either way, the lack of lane pressure from the adc means you're putting in A LOT more work than what you should be accountable for in lane.\n\nAnd then...there's the Ez mains. >:D\n\nEzreal is hands down the best person for Yuumi - you literally can just auto-turret on him with your Q and he'll take care of everything for you. xD\nNot to say you should slack off, and your interaction when not attached should always be utilized, but if there's one champ I love laning with as Yuumi, it's the OG of EZ.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-06-10T23:04:17.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"champs fine.

But trades off burst and cc for better poke and healing. \n\nYuumi is best when you just kind of sit back and let yuumi poke the shit out of the enemy lane and once you can just hop in and kill 1 of them do it. then back off. Dont tank long fights. take the easy kills and back off. If you greed and take an extended fight you lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-10T20:31:47.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad players, not champ.
