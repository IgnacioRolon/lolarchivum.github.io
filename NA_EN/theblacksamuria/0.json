His username was formerly \"Rivaldmans\" and he has been a top tryndamere/shyvana {{champion:23}} {{champion:102}}  main for almost 6 years by now and this person has played almost only Cass {{champion:69}} in mid for the last several months. with the new changes to the launcher neither him or i know how he could regain access to his account and change his name back without paying money for a summoner name change. they have made purchases on his account recently and that is why he is in urgent need to get his account back. if anyone could give any information as to how he can regain his account and revert the name change, I would be greatly appreciative. I have linked the OP.gg for the account in question","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2020-01-10T06:10:17.039+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They'll need to contact [support through a ticket](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

He has to be the one to file the ticket, not you. \n\nIt also might take a little bit of time to get a response depending on the length of the queue. Just have him file the ticket ASAP and make sure he doesn't \"bump\" or update it in any way _until_ he gets a response because that will just move the ticket to the back of the queue. Best of luck.

Last tryn game was 6/9/19 and then a rengar game 10/19/19 and then lots of random champs including spamming of cass.
