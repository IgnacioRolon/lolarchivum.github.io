There's a good chance something is interfering with your network like firewalls or antivirus, so be sure to disable or add exceptions for League to those as well as going through the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as some troubleshooting.
