Lux is immobile, squishy and 100% skillshots, even if her E is a fairly large one.  She has built-in ways to outplay her and a good player can avoid some or ALL of her damage.  She has to position well or she's dead, and missing her Q in lane is brutal on her if she's not hugging tower.  She can play VERY safe, but if she does she can neither roam nor pressure her lane.  If she's playing passive, roam and snowball bot.  Or fake that you're roaming and jump her in river with your jungler if she follows you.  \n\nIf you let her play the lane passively, farming and poking you at her lesiure... then YEAH she's strong.  You're doing what she wants.  If you're poking her back hard and/or brutally jumping her when she walks up to auto minions (FYI she has to, her E won't waveclear alone) she's gonna have a rough time.  mobile characters can jump her if they can dodge her bind.  If she's packing barrier it a terrible idea to tower dive her, but that means she's playing very, very safe.  Go gangbang bot lane while she sits in lane hearing her team rage for not helping them.  She has to push, roam or go aggressive to get anything done.  Dodge her skillshot and wreck her if she pushes out, and brutalize other lanes if she doesn't.  There ARE more strats in this game than \"bum rush the other mid and fite!\".  Learn what she's doing and do something to counter her.  She's only strong now because a lot of other mids who gave her trouble are in the dumpster and she can play safe enough to weather the storm of many of the assassin mids that people are fond of lately.
