Then Riot will help you get your account back. \n\nIf your account's email address is verified the hackers and future account owner will not be able to do much and you can always get your account back. \n\nI would suggest in future you use a completely different password for league, never log into any Web page that isn't Riot owned and has a security certificate. Nor should you share your account information with others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T21:53:41.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh noooooeees!
