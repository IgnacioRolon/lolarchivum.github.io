At 10 minutes my team was calling for open mid/bot and wanted the game to end. I said no just play the game because I enjoy trying to win a game, despite a bad early game. The score was 1-8 and I thought that because we had kog who scales, and myself who was a bit up top, we could get to and win late game. However my team essentially ended the game at 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nThresh afked in mid lane for a while until he died. Then he spammed wards in base. Then kog bought a sightstone and spammed wards too. Meanwhile myself and the jungler fought to hold the lanes because we still couldn&#039;t surrender. Eventually we lost at 17 minutes, and it felt horrible. I felt like no matter how well I could have done, the other players in the game would have still lost us the game. I really hope this kind of stuff is addressed because it feels like it happens so often in plat/diamond, people are just done before the game has even happened. If all 5 players agree to afk in base, sure it&#039;s fine, but that isn&#039;t what happened here. Even though I am just one person, I deserve to have players who will actually play the game like they want to win. \r\n\r\nIDK why I even wrote this, just a rant but it made me feel better. I hope other people who have similar experiences will feel the same as me and get Riot to ban people who do this.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-08-27T05:29:48.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should really take a hint from the high elo games, If 1 side snowballs and both team knows that the other rarely makes mistakes , then it's pointless to go beyond the 15/20 min mark unless you got a great comp with true hypercarrys that can shutdown theirs while cc'd locked.\nThat's the kind of game League is made to be now, 20 min unfun 1 sided snowballs, It's pointless for an adc to get fed(unless they are true hypercarrys) if they can just get 1 shotted by the 0/13 yas with 300 cs, there is no such thing as never surrender unless you account into your great comp that can 3v5 and it really hurts the soul when you are held hostage by people like you, even though you know it is inevitable.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftSwifties ","date":"2017-08-27T06:30:39.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Peritheus,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7PM9XXOk,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-08-27T05:29:48.060+0000)\n>\n> You should really take a hint from the high elo games, If 1 side snowballs and both team knows that the other rarely makes mistakes , then it&#x27;s pointless to go beyond the 15/20 min mark unless you got a great comp with true hypercarrys that can shutdown theirs while cc&#x27;d locked.\n> That&#x27;s the kind of game League is made to be now, 20 min unfun 1 sided snowballs, It&#x27;s pointless for an adc to get fed(unless they are true hypercarrys) if they can just get 1 shotted by the 0/13 yas with 300 cs, there is no such thing as never surrender unless you account into your great comp that can 3v5 and it really hurts the soul when you are held hostage by people like you, even though you know it is inevitable.\n\nIve been held hostage so many times it made me hate this fucking game.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-02T11:11:27.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to make the most of it, like say help me help me, my team's holding me hostage! doing stupid shenanigans,teasing them while giving reasonable, logical advice as u duck around for fun.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2017-08-27T02:12:51.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mmmm.\n\nI mean I'm one to rather quit early if the enemy team gets a huge lead (like 2-10 and a couple towers/dragon/herald).
