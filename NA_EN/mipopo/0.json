Is there a way to get that back since in was clearly not my faul but the clients?\r\nand is riot aware of that client-issue? It's just so tilting to lose a game like this...\r\n\r\nthanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-06T16:57:03.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't adjust LP or ranked stats.  :(  What I can do, though, is help troubleshoot this to prevent it from happening again.  Even though you can use the net or Youtube, it seems clear that your connection is really struggling to specifically stick to our game server.  \n\nI recommend sticking to custom games for now so you don't lose from a d/c again, and go over each step of our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.
