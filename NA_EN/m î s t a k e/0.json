My problem isn't really a big deal tho, but I just want to know if there is a fix on it. So here it is. My League Client (the one that we use on buying champs, etc [not the in-game client]), used to be 1200x800 on size. And now it's stuck at 1024x576. I can't seem to change the resolution at all and it only displays 1 option, the 1024x576. Is there anyway I can restore the old one (1200x800)? This really affects me as a person with OCD and I can't help it xddd. I can provide the specs of my Macbook if needed. Thanks in advance! \r\n\r\nP.S. I don't know how to attach an image file so if anyone of you would let me know that, it would be great and much appreciated.
