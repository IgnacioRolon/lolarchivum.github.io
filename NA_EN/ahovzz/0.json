I played two games, and lost both of them, but then left my house for two days. When i came back today i'm back to 65LP? in a true best of 5, i still had a shot at winning and being one step closer to getting out of elo hell, why did i lose 35 LP? i didnt dodge a match or anything so was i disqualified for the two day absence? i don't understand","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-31T21:23:42.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm...I went ahead and checked your account to see what happened and it does appear that you are still in your serious, albeit 0-2.  It is entirely possible that you simply encountered a visual bug that isn't properly showing your series progression further.  However, if you win the next 3 games, you will be promoted into Silver! :D\n\nBest of luck!  ^.^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trumanchill","date":"2016-05-31T20:36:09.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing/Winning in promos still affects your LP. Why you dropped out of promos after only playing 2/5 games is something I can't explain unless you dodged which would count as a loss.","replies":[]}]}
