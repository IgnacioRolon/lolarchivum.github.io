Garen, Gangplank, or Warwick would always engage every time they respawn and get back to we we're at. I tried to cs but then nami's damage was low (like every other support). So I couldn't cs on Nami. I get that the whole grading system is based on how  your cs is, how you help your team, damage you've done, etc. but I couldn't cs or get any kills. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ozzie Storm","date":"2016-11-26T01:44:58.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel ya.

I recommend an APC build in ARAM instead; being a utility Support that does nothing but buff your allies is not very helpful in ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Troodon06","date":"2016-11-26T01:40:17.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to get some ap, but then there wasn't really anything I could do besides heal.
