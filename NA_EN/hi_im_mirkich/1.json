The system tries to pair up those who have similar rank and MMR\n\nIf those players are AFKing early enough in ranked matches, you should be able to start a [**/remake**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686) as long as all of the conditions are met.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im mirkich","date":"2017-08-08T14:39:00.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But wait thats nor all\nIt seems like u rly want me to lose right\nhttps://ibb.co/ksrBnF\nur getting rly hard into debt to me in terms of LP btw","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi im mirkich","date":"2017-08-08T08:23:47.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well we, as a team, never had a chance to remake. I think it was becaus they would leave and recconect several times before dissconnecting forever(however, these games clearly were 4v5s). Except for the Nasus game, he just left at 2:50 or something like that and we didnt get the chance to remake.\nThanks for the answer.","replies":[]}]}]}
