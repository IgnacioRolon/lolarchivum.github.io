We can't alter LP or game stats, though, sorry friend!  Hope your next match takes a more positive turn!","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-08-06T01:18:30.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be more concerned over the fact that the remake system doesn't trigger the way it should.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im mirkich","date":"2017-08-06T11:16:48.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not rly sure how does it work, but that guy left just before the click hit 3:00, so I thought we should have got a remake.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-08-06T18:43:30.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh then it wouldn't have been possible. They had to have been dc for at least 90 seconds before the 3 min mark without a first blood happening to the one dced(meaning no requiting if they failed invade at the start of game). Once these are met then you can remake. However this is why I made a comment to the riot member here. I have seen people quit after dying and it allowed their team to remake. I have also been in games where it was a 4 v 5 the whole time since one of our teammates never loaded and we never got the ability to remake. It also doesn't work in ARAM at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hi im mirkich","date":"2017-08-06T11:15:23.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the fast answer!
