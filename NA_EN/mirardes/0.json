It crashes and gives me a bug splat error. It puts me back to the launcher with the reconnect button. When I press reconnect, it does the exact same thing with the same bugsplat.\n\nThings I have tried: \n- Clean windows boot \n- older graphic card drivers \n- updating DirectX \n- update Java \n- compatibility mode \n- run as administrator \n- turning off firewall \n- turning off anti-virus \n- uninstalling/reinstalling LoL and cleaning the registry \n- repairing LoL through launcher\n\nNone of these things in any combination seem to get me into a game. I have leaverbuster now from the ARAM games I was trying to play, so I switched to custom games to try and troubleshoot but still not luck. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm at my wits end here.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE This worked for me: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/X6sPFPu8-fps-drops-and-crashes-after-the-windows-10-anniversary-update","replies":[]}]}
