It&#039;s not perfect, but we don&#039;t get to choose who we play except by trading and what champs are available. So, why not?\r\n\r\nWhy have I thought of this, after over a thousand games of ARAM I always see the same long range champs over and over. You know the ones, {{champion:51}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:99}} etc etc, champs whose abilities extend at least a screens length. This in my opinion defeats the purpose of playing a random mode. \r\n\r\nRotating (50-60) a greater number of champs would allow us to practice champs we don&#039;t have, force all of us to play champs we don&#039;t like at some point, and to have much different line ups during game play. \r\n\r\nThoughts, comments, thoughts from Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-07-12T03:24:54.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rolls for the Roll god.\n\nSmurfs for the Smurf throne.","replies":[]}]}
