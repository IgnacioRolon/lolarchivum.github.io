Instead, he uses base Nasus' recall. I checked both the base and Galactic, and they both appear to be playing the recall animation properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rh√≤mbus","date":"2016-01-27T03:44:51.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only 975 skins and above give new recall animations. Galactic Nasus is a 520 RP skin(I think). Sorry :( .
