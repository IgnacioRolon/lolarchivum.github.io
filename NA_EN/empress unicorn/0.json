And it's just cool. Getting to play a game with the people who help make the game work. And if you've spent enough time to play approximately 2000 games (assuming 50/50 w/l ratio) it's a little Riot reward for hitting the mark.\n\nHow often do people get to sit down and play Zelda with Shigeru Miyamoto? *AND HOW AWESOME WOULD THAT BE?*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-02-24T21:06:34.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are people so obsessed with trolling threads?","replies":[]},{"poster":"lilnutduck","date":"2015-02-24T21:04:38.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well why are YouTubers so obsessed about getting to 1 million subscribers?
