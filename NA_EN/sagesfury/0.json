It doesn't seem to be internet issues since it has happened while i was at university and at home and chat seems to work fine during this bug. There also has been a few times where while clicking the lock in button nothing would happen even when hearing the noise of the button being clicked. The times that this has happened I have been on team speak with my friends and since they heard me getting frustrated in chat and said that my connection to the the team speak server at least was fine that it was probably not my internet.  Since i mostly play ranked this bug has made me lose about 12-15 lp over the course of the last few months (very small amount not worried at all about it).\r\n\r\nA simple fix would be if the client auto locked in on a hovered pick when the timer ran out but that feature in the past encouraged players to afk during champ select so I can see why we have to lock in now. I wish i had some recording of this but I don't record often and certainly not the champ select process and since this bug to me seems really hard to reproduce and not very common (like once or twice a month to me personally but i have friends who also get it time to time) I just wanted to start a thread and see if anyone can post more here to see if this is a wide spread issue.\r\n\r\nI will leave a bunch of stuff below on my computer and internet if that helps\r\n\r\nLenovo y700 \r\ni7-6700hq @2.6GHz\r\n16gb ram\r\nwindows 10\r\nGTX 960m\r\n\r\nISP(s): Google Fiber Raleigh, Time Warner Spectrum, whatever North Carolina State University has.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince some of my friends have ran into this issue i looked at possible similarities and the only ones i could see are we all have 6th gen intel cpus and lower and we all have  GTX 9XX or lower.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-25T18:53:57.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This freezing could be connection, so going through the guide was a solid plan.

So i believe this does seem to be an actual issue with the game in some form. Though the manner in which games seem to be force dodged might differ slightly from case to case. \n\nIn regards to what you replied as the issue is inconsistent and not very common I don't believe that would be a viable way to test for the problem. the fastest and simplest way to fix it would be to implement auto locking on hovered champ when timer runs out but i recognize that sort of change requires the attention of the people over at game play. \n\nFor now I will continue and try to see if i can catch the game in the act of doing said bug.\n\n\nthank you,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wendyheenim","date":"2017-05-26T09:30:45.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a similar issue too and I would really hope riot cancel that lock button as well.
