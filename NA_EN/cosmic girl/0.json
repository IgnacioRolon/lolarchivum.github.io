Well, with the club as well. I've created one, 2 months ago and everything was fine until 2 weeks ago: it won't show anymore. It is as if I didn't have a club (even though I'm the owner of said club) and my tag won't show either. I thought it was weird so I asked my club members and they still see me in the club with the tag and all... I've tried login off and on and nothing worked. Any ideas? \r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-01T23:08:13.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We' have some club issue since it was restored that we're currently tracking and figuring out.
