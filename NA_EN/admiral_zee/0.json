Recently I have spent more time in queues than I have in games, and I'm not in a super high elo. I have seen more dodges in the last few days than I have for a long time with the old system. Also people don't seem to understand that you have to lock in, which I think is unnecessary, if you are hovering on a champ it should count. I am sure that will get better as the system stays in place longer but the queue times need to change. Waiting 10-15 minutes to play a 20-30 min game is unreal. I have no idea why this is happening but I can't be the only one experiencing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Prozzak","date":"2016-01-18T17:07:04.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep hearing people saying this, but I have timed my last 5 games and average around 8 minutes to get into a game which is no longer then the old queue. \n\nThe lock in thing is actually smart, once people get used to it they will lock in quicker than waiting out the full time like they always did with the old system and it will make the new system shorter.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-01-18T17:15:33.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"8 minutes is my minimum to get into a game, averaging around 12-15, sometimes 20+. \n\nBefore, my queues took 2 minutes on average, with a very rare queue taking 4 minutes. I'm not high elo. I'm silver 4.\n\nYou can see why I hate this queue. It was shoved out way too early.","replies":[{"poster":"Prozzak","date":"2016-01-18T19:12:44.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2-4 minutes? Do people actually lock in their picks in silver or something? Whenever I did old system I was around 8 minutes. 90 seconds or so to get into a game, around 1.5 minutes for bans (prob more) the flipping full 45 seconds per pick phase for everyone so around 4.5 minutes for picks and then the one minute lull between picks being done and game load start. That would make it 8.5 minutes not counting game load time.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-01-19T02:07:03.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, there's a significant difference in time there. Picks/bans is pretty much instant in Silver. The one guy that takes the full 30 seconds to pick was a minority. First pick instantly bans whoever he thinks he's OP, everyone calls and instalocks their role, last pick begs to not be left with support, game loads.","replies":[{"poster":"Prozzak","date":"2016-01-19T03:34:54.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah weird, the difference a couple of tiers can make for ban phase.

It has nearly tripled my queue times and like I said there are so many dodges it is unreal. I am not even counting the time I'm in champ select and 3rd or 4th pick dodges. Add that all up and it is some times 30 mins to get into a game. I have never had this problem before and I have been playing for years. The only correlation is the new queue system.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-01-18T17:16:29.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh God, I'm sick of seeing these threads. I swear, if you guys had your way, we'd be in the stone age. The new champ select is fine. Never experienced long Q times since its release. A great improvement to ranked play by far. Please Riot, fix what you gotta fix but don't get rid of it please.","replies":[{"poster":"Admiral Zee","date":"2016-01-18T17:27:07.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at your match history since the new queue you have played way more ranked games than normals. I have to say the ranked part isn't too bad, people are way less likely to dodge but in normals it is horrible. When I have to sit through 15 mins of queue and 3-4 dodges to get into a game it is not acceptable. I work and take care of my grandfather so I don't have a ton of time to play league. When I get time for 3 or 4 games and can only play 1 because of the new system it is extremely frustrating. It makes me question what Riot was thinking, and I think most of the problem now is because you show your preferred champ before ban phrase. I have seen people target ban a team mate, who is taking a champ that doesn't really get banned, just because the other person doesn't like that champ. That leads to dodges in normals.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-01-18T18:05:00.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Admiral Zee,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=onQIHkcb,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-01-18T17:27:07.152+0000)\n>\n> Looking at your match history since the new queue you have played way more ranked games than normals.

I never ever play this many ranked games because ranked wasn't really that enjoyable before. If anything I hope they at least leave it alone for ranked play. If its having problems for normals then I'll concede to your points as I haven't played that many normals with it since it came out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IndianHippie","date":"2016-01-18T18:08:42.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its the same.
