Seems permanent so far","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So not long before Patch 6.16 if not a few games after my ping went from a constant 39-40 with 0 spikes at all to a constant 51. I haven't changed any settings and it happened in between games with just the queue time and champ select between them. Its by far still playable but I would like too see if anyone else had this problem as well and see if I can fix or revert it. I've already went through the support page and checked everything I knew to check (ex: router, firewall, ports, dns, isp, Up/Down speed, and so on)","replies":[{"poster":"Dopafox","date":"2016-08-25T07:13:40.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also happening to me, in the last hour it went from a solid 75 to 94.
