I like the idea of her having the ability cuz she has no immediate escape. So a long range AA makes sense...but her rockets are a little broken.

Keeping the same damage but gutting it's AS right now would gut her altogether","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-10-25T22:16:35.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't have mobility until she kills somebody. As for her rockets, the only thing I think needs to be changed is that her splash damage needs to be toned down so it doesn't always do as much damage to everything around it as it does to the initial target. Or, if they need to make it so her waveclear is intact, have it so it only reduces damage against champions","replies":[{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-10-25T22:25:57.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So what you're saying is:\n\"but muh mobility\"","replies":[]}]}]}
