This weekend it has turned into a constant 400+ ping making the game unplayable. \r\n\r\nI've noticed that it seems to be triggered by the beginning of the game once minion waves spawn. Until then, in game at fountain, i sit at around 22ms. This can't be a coincidence can it?\r\n\r\nI've done all the standard connection troubleshooting with no help. I'm not having issues with other games or online services, resource monitor shows nothing else using bandwidth.\r\n\r\nMy stepdaughter plays from this location as well, and she is -not- having these issues. This would point to it  being my computer, but again I'm seeing nothing else hogging network or other resources.\r\n\r\nThis occurs in both the beta and legacy clients.\r\n\r\nI have a support ticket in, but with the holiday weekend I've gotten no response, and I literally can't play the game right  now. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Im that DUCK","date":"2016-11-28T05:21:00.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well considering packet loss and the fact that it happens when actual gameplay starts to occur and information is REALLY being shared between players and the servers with locations and the map and whatnot, since your stepdaughter is able to play alright, I'm assuming that it's whatever you're using to connect to the internet. If you're using a router, I suggest buying and trying a new one. If you're using Ethernet, it's either your Ethernet cable or the modem itself (more likely to be the modem, so I'd replace that) although considering your stepdaughter's works fine, it's probably just your router.\n\nNot 100% but I'd recommend trying it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Halcyon0","date":"2016-11-28T02:15:03.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick addition, I used Riot's network log reader on a couple test games and it's showing 3%+ packet loss. I've run through all of the standard fixes for this  but nothing has helped. I've also done both kinds of reinstalls to no avail.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T05:58:08.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that there's something wrong with your specific network adapter. I'd recommend updating the driver for the adapter from your computer manufacturer's support site, or try using a new adapter entirely to see if anything changes.\n\nLet me know the results.","replies":[]}]}]}
