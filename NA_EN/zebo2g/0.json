So I closed league, waited a few hours, noticed the status was back to normal and decided to log back in. Now it's constantly trying to reconnect me to that game and WON'T disconnect or let me browse another game >.&lt; \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-11T20:59:22.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not currently seeing any issues with the game or logging servers, but there could be a problem causing your network to fail reaching us.

Having maintenance finished hours later, logging in presents me with an automatic reconnection to the game I was in PRE-MAINTENANCE. All it has is the reconnect button on the client.\n\nConnection isn't the issue, it's the fact that the game I'm in still doesn't think it's ended.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NZOddity","date":"2017-04-11T20:43:11.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have the same problem, no idea what to do :(","replies":[{"poster":"zebO2g","date":"2017-04-11T20:44:32.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NZOddity,realm=OCE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=aKiHcy7n,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-11T20:43:11.568+0000)\n>\n> Have the same problem, no idea what to do :(\n\nyeah, it's frustrating as f**k xD","replies":[]}]}]}
