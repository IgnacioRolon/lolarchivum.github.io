This is a special case as the toxicity in these games were just unbelievable. I can't in good faith let players who insult, harass and all around cyberbully this hard to go unnoticed. This is against the law.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-21T23:41:11.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Rineyy said, your best bet for reporting is to utilize the built-in report feature in the after match lobby. If for some reason that report won't work, hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with a screenshot and we can take a look into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kayle Intervened","date":"2017-04-22T19:31:49.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game is 7 years old and a lot of the trash starts in champ select and eventually ends with someone dodging that person or the other player trolling in game but giving no evidence in the in game chat logs, so why is it that this archaic, 2005 style reporting system doesn't allow people to report the toxicity that occurs before the game and relies on you not instinctively hitting the play again, or quit buttons after match just to get out of the shitty environments that has plagued this game since it's release?\n\nJust curious why there's a 10x10 pixel button available to report for about 10 seconds and only affects in game actions while Champ select is constant cancer? Just feels like you guys pump out new content and Esports narratives but haven't dedicated adequate resources to actually improving your product or community or features.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaosedge","date":"2017-04-22T05:46:31.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would but I honestly have no idea how to fill in a ticket for reporting someone.
