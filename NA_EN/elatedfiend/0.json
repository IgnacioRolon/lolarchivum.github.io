Whenever I press a button on my headphones (which happens often but accidentally), my iTunes opens up. This has happened twice while playing LoL. When I press this button, my screen shifts from being locked on to the LoL match in fullscreen, to iTunes in fullscreen. My computer is locked into iTunes until the LoL game is over, and I just got a warning about afking during matches from my last match due to this bug. Do I just try to not press the button, or is there anyway to be able to get back to the league screen?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-09T21:53:31.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like this issue is with the configuration you have on your Mac launching iTunes when the play button is pressed.
