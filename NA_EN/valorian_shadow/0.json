I am actually kind of excited to see what they do with it.  The only cool thing about Warwick right now his is Lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-15T11:57:36.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think an active should be added to his current E because that would remove the option to toggle it off which can be crucial in pulling off ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2016-10-15T11:19:00.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are already reworking him...","replies":[{"poster":"Valorian Shadow","date":"2016-10-15T11:43:06.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and this could go towards that","replies":[]}]}]}
