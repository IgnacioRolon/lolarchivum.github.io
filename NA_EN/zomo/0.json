Punished in losing LP and 2. A low priority queue???? How is a summoner not being able to connect to the beginning of the game impacting the game at all if the option for a remake is possible? \r\n\r\nI don't see why this a thing to people who may have a connection issue once.. to be punished in such way.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-10-29T05:42:23.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you couldn't connect to the game from the start and your team has to /remake the game, then you wasted the time of everyone else in that game, both allies and opponents. This is why you are punished for being the \"leaver\" in a /remake.\n\nPlus, if there was no punishment, then people could \"leave\" the game during the loading screen (before it starts) and have their team /remake it to avoid any unwanted situations. This would essentially just be another form of queue dodging, but you waste more time of everyone else and you don't get a punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"zomo","date":"2016-10-29T14:32:50.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that, and i understand the need for punishment but its basically overkill on how it is given out. 5 low priority queue's, and you lose lp? That's a ridiculous amount of punishment for something so minuscule...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T02:19:20.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 5-game penalty only shows up if you have a *consistent* and *recent* trend of disconnections.
