You can only earn tokens in these game modes. Regarding your question about chests, you can only earn a *single chest* on each champion per season. The chests haven't reset just yet, but they'll reset for the new season.\n\nCheck out our [Champion Mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) and [Hextech Crafting Guides](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) for more info on these systems.
