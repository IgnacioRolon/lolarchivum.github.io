It seems like your network might be getting blocked from reaching the authentication server, so you can't log in.  Try out the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this.\n\nYou can also grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto-configure your firewall settings in case that might be the culprit.

I guess you can try reinstalling as well, I'm pretty sure something in the game files has changed to cause this to happen since completely uninstalling the game and deleting league folder with fresh install fixed the issue.
