That is what I’m an interpreting from your statement.  Plus the higher level you are the less likely you are to roll 1 cost units.  I’m not saying your wrong, but I do not think it should be that easy to get that many 3* units.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-09-10T14:51:42.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is.
