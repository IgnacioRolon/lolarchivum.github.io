Had to restart my entire game, but by the time I reconnected I lost to the last two minions rounds having 91 health at the start of player round. I also lost the game and lost 24 LP because somehow I got matched up with a silver and 2 irons when I am Plat 3. Riot needs to fix these bugs asap or I would suggest to boycott the game till they understand that we as a community will not take this anymore. Let them hear us loud and clear. They care more about the amount of money they gain from the game rather then the state of the game. They also spend more time on art, skins, and other things while neglecting the game.","replies":[]}
