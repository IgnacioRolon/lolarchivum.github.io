I've asked many different people in game to see if this was a problem on my side but many have the same problem. I tried everything i could to fix this problem, even the full repair available from the settings but nothing seems to work. This is clearly a server-side error that needs to be fixed, ty.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and some free RP would be nice :). jk...plez\r\n{{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"Azlureon","date":"2016-12-06T01:16:26.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this exact same problem, It won't let me buy anyone that is around the amount IP I currently have.
