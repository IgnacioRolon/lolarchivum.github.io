I'm not gonna complain about the excessive time-outs it can lead to but a flaw in the entire system and determining what counts as a leave or not. First of all, why do remake games count as a match, it's not my team, it's the enemy team, after they remake i should be able to continue searching for a match without then being sent back to the lower priority queue. I wait 20 minutes for a game, i'm in the game and after 1 minute the enemy team remakes, sending me back to the queue screen and giving me another 20 minute wait, although it removes 1 of the match made games in the LPQ i still waited for 20 minutes for pretty much no reason. If LOL Leaver Buster is going to operate like that, they should just allow an option to wait out all 5 match made lower priority queues, for 1 hour in my case, instead of wasting 20 more minutes of my life.{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T21:58:49.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because a /Remake isn't a full match (victory/defeat needs to happen) it doesn't count towards working off an LPQ. I can imagine that if they did count, players could abuse remakes to skirt around LPQs or leaverbuster. \n\nCheck out our [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) for a complete rundown on how it works.
