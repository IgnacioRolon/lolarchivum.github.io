(Please Read)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's get straight to the point, Leaver Buster punishes you for leaving a game or being AFK and ruining someone else's game experience, right? As long as that statement is true, players SHOULDN'T get leaver buster if your allied teammates remake, you're not ruining their game experience since they don't lose or gain any RP/IP/LP/EXP, or any other P's i don't know about,. This time, though I have left games in the past and I'm trying to keep a clean sheet now,  it is not my fault. During the in-game loading screen I get to 100% and my client disconnects[](http://i.imgur.com/ZTj8CQK.png?1) (right now i am unaware that it has done this). It does not close on it's own to let me reconnect so I am currently unaware that I have disconnected, after a few minutes I realize that something isn't right, I then manually go back to my desktop (using the windows key), hover over LOL and it shows an error box ([](http://i.imgur.com/ZTj8CQK.png?1)) hidden to users currently running the client. After I find out the problem, i attempt to reconnect, however my teammates have already issued a remake and then i get punished with a 20 minute leaver buster that clearly ISN'T my fault!! This was so frustrating i threw my laptop and it broke, i had to rebuild it afterwards. Look at my match history if you don't believe my story.\nLink: http://i.imgur.com/ZTj8CQK.png?1","replies":[{"poster":"Chibi Deviljho","date":"2016-10-28T03:42:00.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, just got that exact same error, exact same situation. I just wish /remakes didn't affect your MMR. I mean, why should it? disconnecting does not in any way indicate a lack of competitive skill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T03:03:43.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Regardless of intent or if a remake occurs, disconnecting from a match still negatively impacts everyone in it. This is a big reason as to why the system treats all disconnections equally and why penalties cannot be modified for any reason.\n\nThis disconnection error typically results from your PC not being able to establish a good connection to our servers.
