After i waited the 20 minutes, i was gonna type something in chat, someone dodged mid-type and after another \"found a match\" thing showed up it automatically declined and stopped me from finding a match, then i had to wait 20 more minutes because of this. The Leaver Buster system doesn't even feel like a punishment, it just frustrates the player. Please fix the auto decline bug or just remove Leaver Buster entirely.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T04:59:25.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The person who dodged wasn't in your premade at all?
