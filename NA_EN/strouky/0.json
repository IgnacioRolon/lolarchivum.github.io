I think its time so realise that nasus{{champion:75}}  is TO op. First a tank with life steal is TO much. Second a Q that one shot while being a tank is TO much. Third a 99% slow is TO much. Fourth a I aoe that have a magic domage burst while being AD so TO much because you don&#039;t even know what to buy versus a nasus{{champion:75}}  and finally an ult that make him almost invinsible is TO much because you cant kill him and he one shot all team.
