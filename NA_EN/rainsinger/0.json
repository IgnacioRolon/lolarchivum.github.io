I&#039;m very happy with it and it was a ton of fun writing :) I&#039;m very excited for the PROJECT skins and I decided to do a concept for how the projects came to be. I head cannon that some champions who would have died are given new life within machines. I also based this concept off of the official Fiora lore itself. Think of this as a sort of alternate universe for the champion, enjoy!\n\n\n\"Precision at its finest.\n\nThat is what my family has strived towards for generations. House Laurent was once a family of duelists held in the highest regard, before my father&#039;s treachery was revealed to everyone in Demacia in the midst of a duel.\n\nVincent Laurent, the man who had taught me everything I know, had been bribing the competition with favors and connections in order to be the victor without a challenge. His actions ruined the Laurents when the truth came to light. \nOther notable houses would no longer accept us as competitors.\n\nI remember walking the streets of Demacia with disgust painted on the faces of every citizen I saw. This was not the way someone of my social class should  be treated, and the only thing that could be done was deal with the heart of the problem-- my father.\n\nHe had holed himself within the walls of Villa de Laurent, which housed a large training facility. The Laurents had used it train in privacy, away from the masses. \n\nIt felt odd. Seeing the place where I had trained and grew as a duelist seemed so... Sad. It was like you could feel my father&#039;s shame from within. The feeling became stronger with each footstep closer, and most of all, when my eyes met his. Such depression and sadness had taken its toll on the man. He was weak, I expected it, being a fraud for such a length of time can turn someone into what they fear most.\nHe had no choice but to accept my challenge, his last mistake as the head of House Laurent. The battle was quick and simple. My blade had found its way into several of his joints, eventually making it too difficult for him to stand-- let alone wield a blade.\n\nIn truth, it was a pitiful display. The man I had once called \"father\"  had fallen far, and this was as low as it got-- or so I thought.\n\nHe lay on the ground, weeping, crying for a rematch. I left him to wallow in his self-pity, but before I had made it to the door, a peculiar sound came from his direction. When I turned to face my father, he lie dead on the ground, his own blade had made contact with his throat.\n\nA cowards death, a suitable end for such a person.\n\nAt the time, I felt only disgust towards the man, and left his corpse where it was. \n\nThe deed had been done, and the title of \"Head\" fell to me.\n\nFrom that day forward I did what I could to redeem our family name. I dueled with honor, and started to show the entire city of Demacia that the Laurents were still a family of fierce duelists to be feared and respected. I showed them that we had no need for tricks or foul play. I suppose I was foolish to think my challengers would fight with honor as I did.\n\nHow could I have foreseen the trap that lie in wait for me when I entered the ring?\n\nI remember... Heat.\n\nI stepped on a magical trap of some sort. Flames exploded around me as I went in for a lunge. White hot magic licked its way up my legs and concentrated on my face. I truly thought that was the end, that my time had come.\n\nAfter that...\"\n\n\n\n\ntwo_step_auth_command.bui\nUsername: ######\nPassword: ##########\nACCESS TO SYSTEM\nVersion 5.17\nInitializing...\nPROJECT: 34672\nMEMORY SEQUENCE: COMPLETED\n\n\n\n\n\"Interesting.\" A voice made its way past the darkness, \"And how do you feel?\" it asked.\n\nA robotic woman stood tall, motionless. Technology covered her body, everything about her seemed metallic and robotic. Her face was white as a sheet, a few cracks shot up her cheeks, a dull pink light pulsed up and down them, through her body, a sign that her body was functioning.\n\n\"What I feel does not matter.\" A robotic voiced came from her, an almost distorted version of a human woman.\nThe mysterious man chuckled, admiring his creation before addressing the robot again, \"System override number two six five seven, sensory and emotional transponder activation code seven seven two.\"\n\nAs soon as those words were uttered, the woman&#039;s body made several strange noises. The woman started gasping for breath, her robotic face was unable to contort itself into any expression, \"Please...\" she begged, \"No more... I can still feel the burns. My entire body aches. Help...\" She found herself unable to move, helpless in the position she was in.\n\n\"I see...\" the sound of a pencil to paper could be heard before the mysterious man said, \"Computer, deactivate pain receptors, access code nine seven two four.\"\n\nAs soon as the pain came, it left the girl with a simple series of numbers, disappearing along with her cries for help.\n\n\"There is one more question I pose to you.\" the man said, \"Who are you?\"\nThe woman took a moment to process before responding, \" Project three four six seven two.\" The steel around her face molded and put together various parts that combined themselves to make a pink visor that obscured the upper half of her face.\n\n\"Codename?\" the man asked.\n\n\"Fiora.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-09-04T05:06:31.540+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty neat!  \n\nThe introduction appears to be so neutrally set that it could be set in both the canon League universe, or the PROJECT universe.  It was an interesting twist to then get to the PROJECT setting near the end.  In fact, if you hadn't told me it was a PROJECT story in the introduction/title, I'd probably have been taken completely by surprise!  Was that your intention?\n\nGoing from first person to third threw me for a second.
