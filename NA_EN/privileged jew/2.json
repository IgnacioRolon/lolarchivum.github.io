As Zyra support, it has been my observation in Season 7 that it is tough.  And I'm not the only one to have had trouble with carrying bronze matches from the support role, so get off of your high horse.  How some diamond+ player managed to easily get out of bronze is irrelevant to how the majority of support players, who belong in silver, or gold, or even platinum fared in the same task.","replies":[{"poster":"Ad Vitam Aeterna","date":"2016-12-28T17:09:18.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You said it's a coin flip when that's false.

Again, a ton of bronze matches have players roaming around the map all game.  You're gonna make the laning phase utter hell, get your ADC fed, and then it's going to amount to nothing because again - adcs at this elo lack the mechanics to be effective.  And if you get fed, good luck being able to utilize it when your primary strength is AOE damage and disruption for teamfights (that aren't happening no matter how much you beg your team to group up).  Unless you're playing something that can both be there for, and win, the skirmishes, or splitpush, or secure objectives, you're going to have a hard time with an unresponsive team.  \n\nAlso, when I said it was a coin flip, were you honestly taking that in a literal sense?  Ever heard of hyperbole?  I know there are other factors, but a lot of it is just shit you can't control for.","replies":[{"poster":"Ad Vitam Aeterna","date":"2016-12-28T18:03:42.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats total bullshit. I've played in bronze, they team fight. I had a 20-21 game win streak in bronze last year getting my friend out of it. That was top lane but I guarantee I would have had the same success as a support like Zyra and I know how Bronze play. \n\nYou keep saying people run after kills and shit like that has anything to do with anything when you are good enough to solo carry. newsflash, it doesn't. As a Zyra you should 100 percent shut down the enemy bot lane, if they arnen't 0-5 by 10 mins and down 30-50 cs you failed as a support Zyra. Even people in high elo have trouble against Zyra's pressure/poke in the bot lane, bronze laners are going to fair much worse. Their bot lane being 100 percent shut down means the game is at least a 3 vs 5. Zyra can instaburst any carry with her when she gets ahead so mid game if you arne't instantly deleting the carries thats on you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2016-12-28T15:19:21.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support carry isn't an IN YOUR FACE carry, your teammates won't even notice you carried them, but when your brain dead team all walk away alive after a fight YOU know it was because of your shields/healing/peeling/warding. \n\nI can't count how many deaths I've kept from happening these last couple weeks, deaths that = gold in the enemy pocket and down time for my team.

Skirmishes are even better for you as a support though, because being at bot lane and having decent movement speed from the roaming masteries (since you don't need the one for damage against minions), and you can opt into the talisman of ascension, you can often catch up before your teammates overextend and the fights go sour. That also lets you use your supportive skills, which often offer movement speed (lulu, nami, bard, sona, etc) or cc (morgana, janna, thresh, ivern, etc) to help end the skirmish quicker and with a lower failure rate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raije","date":"2016-12-28T14:23:25.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to play champs I'm bad in flex queue and ended up in gold 3, now I can't play with my friends.
