Kog shreds resistances and has %hp magic damage. Vayne has %hp true damage. Sivir has nothing in her kit that labels her a tank buster. \n\nAhri's source of true damage is certainly not enough to qualify as a tank buster. No tank in their right mind is scared of Ahri wasting her single target burst on them, especially after the loss of charm amp. \n\nThrow out Irelia because her ture damage isn't enough to scare tanks and much like Ahri is better against squishy targets she can assassinate. Add Fiora who has %hp true damage to that list. \n\nAnd ironically enough, In a meta of tanks being \"literally melted\" The only champion you listed that is actually popular is Vayne and she is doing terrible, the others are doing average  with average play rates.","replies":[{"poster":"Elros Thranduil","date":"2016-08-12T04:46:25.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude what?

He asked for people who shred them.\n\nIrelia can duel tanks but she does it relatively slowly, and she's not a good pick if you want to focus a tank in a team fight and kill them.\n\nMaster Yi for example has everything you just said and then some. He as well as bigger on-hit true damage, more attack speed, and is better able to itemize for tank shredding items like Bloodrazor, BotRK, and Black Cleaver. He's much better than Irelia at dueling tanks, and he's better at dueling in general.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2016-08-12T15:00:08.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say what you but Sivir is one of the best ADCs into a tank heavy team.  Throw a last whisper item onto Sivir and she can shred a lot better than you guess.\n\nI don't comsider Fiora a tank buster.  She has one source of that damage that is %hp and that's her ult.  That's not nearly sustained enough to be a tank buster.  Whereas Irelias true damage is off of her W, making it much more consistent damage.\n\nAnd dude...you realize that Malzahar is not only heavily picked but has a fairly decent win rate.  Gnar also sees quite a bit of play.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-08-13T03:19:09.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.playPercent&order=descend&roleSort=Middle \nhttp://www.champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.playPercent&order=descend&roleSort=Top\n\nNothing special about Malz pick rate or win rate.  Same can be said for Gnar. \n\nFiora's ult is %hp true damage, as is the more the health they have the more damage she will do to them. It's nice you don't consider Fiora a tank buster but that is exactly what she is. Which is why if you use the same sight I provided for Fiora you will see her best match ups are tanky champions.  \n\nAny ADC can kill a tank with a last whisper, that's the point of the item.","replies":[{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2016-08-13T07:58:19.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You fail to see the 40% ban rate on Malzahar.  If they calculate play rate off of total plays when not banned I bet that number would be much higher.\n\nGnar is the 8th most played top laner on that list.  And while sure their win rates aren't the best, they aren't that bad.  \n\nBut hey what do I know, I'm just reading the charts you provided. \n\nAnd I don't know, for my idea of a tank buster, Fiora really isn't it with te sustained damage to shred.
