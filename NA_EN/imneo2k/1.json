I don't want to see a list of thousands of high-ranked players sorted by their rank; I want to spectate a match. The former requires scrolling through these lists and hunting for a live match (if there even is one).","replies":[{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2019-03-17T00:17:52.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup sure, it could be on the front page (instead of 8 different fucking esport topics which idgaf about).\nBut in this thread it looks like nobody knew it does exist in the new client in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-17T00:28:24.128+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ﬂoo,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T54MXvEf,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2019-03-17T00:17:52.628+0000)\n>\n> Yup sure, it could be on the front page (instead of 8 different fucking esport topics which idgaf about).\n> But in this thread it looks like nobody knew it does exist in the new client in the first place.\n\nYeah, it doesn't help that it's buried in a place with nearly no other purpose. How often do people want to see that listing per se? Nothing tells the user that live matches occasionally show up there. I wouldn't be surprised if Riot is intentionally making it difficult to find and use so that people watch video streams instead, for tracking, ads, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2019-03-17T00:44:38.548+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, considering there now are ads for featured streamers and especially esports, that is probably the truth.
