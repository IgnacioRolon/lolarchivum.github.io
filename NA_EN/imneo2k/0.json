Riot should try and implement a new way to match players.. Maybe with the honor level, like in CS GO with trust factor or idk.. What is this freaking game? Also they must be more restrict with the acc registration, like in Korea.. So dumb to have 12yos playing with you.. All they were doing it was spamming in the chat after every kill \"OMG\", \"1v1 me you broken champ play me is good than you\" etc.. Lmao.. \nBtw, i could solo win the game as i was split pushing and all they were doing it was team fighting, but they surrendered.. and Xin especially must get banned for negative behaviour as he gave up since minute 6'... He was spamming FFs.. xd lol\n[Removed by Moderation]","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-03-01T01:26:45.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking up this necro, please remember that sharing details of accounts you believe should be banned or naming and shaming individuals is not alright on Boards.\n\nDunno why we missed this one in the first place, but just a reminder with this lock.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnnieOnlyTRick","date":"2018-10-25T18:21:46.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"you're in silver 4, please don't act like this.
