Communicate with us and we will make sure you&#039;re comfortable with both your role and your job.\r\n1. The type of player you are\r\nThis does not mean the roles you play, but the jobs you have to do as a player\r\n- Main/Head shot caller: This is the person who calls the shots, for example if they say &quot;lets fight&quot; you fight, &quot;back away&quot; if it&#039;s too dangerous, &quot;setup here&quot; if need we to secure something. Important calls is what this person does.\r\n- Basic shot caller: Similar to the head shot caller, but this person tends to call smaller things such as &quot;let&#039;s take dragon now&quot; or &quot;attack mid inhibitor turret&quot;. Now if this person says to focus the top laner but you hear the head shot caller says to focus the mid laner, you should listen to your head shot caller.\r\nWhat we need on our team\r\n- Having Fun: we need people to understand that this is a game and we need to treat it as such. Have fun we may lose game&#039;s but don&#039;t point finger&#039;s for somebody&#039;s mistake and lose morale on the team. We&#039;re all a team and we should act like a team.\r\n2. Communication\r\nTeams need communication. Without any communication our team will fall apart and will have us get many many losses. Communication is right up there to having a shotcaller without either of these roles into the team we will setup ourselves to failure. Communicate with our team plans and idea&#039;s in and out of our game will help us not only win our games but make us improve a lot as well as a team.\r\n3. Friends\r\nFriends to know and to trust each other without a relationship and trust everything will be worse, even if it&#039;s just by a little. If you don&#039;t trust your team you may begin to take on other people&#039;s roles. This will confuse your team and you will become someone who people don&#039;t want to play with. Another risk is that someone tries to do too much themself and then stops communicating. When that happens, they stop doing their role for the team, either by not telling others what they are doing or not listening to the team&#039;s plans.\r\nWe&rsquo;re a serious team and we want motivated and serious players for us to play with. Don&#039;t expect to be on the team right away it takes time to learn your playstyle/who you are as a person. We&#039;re a brand new team so expect uncoordination, misplays, etc until we grow and become better players. Be able to take criticism you can&#039;t imrpove if you&#039;re just going to rage out on somebody telling what you did wrong and how to improve yourself.\r\n\r\n(Optional) Age:\r\nTime zone:\r\nRole:\r\nSolo Queue Division:\r\nTeamSpeak Communication Application and Microphone Accessible (Y/N):\r\nList; Your Top 3 Champions for Role Applying:\r\nBriefly describe your play style:\r\nYour strongest attributes:\r\nYour weakest attributes:\r\nWhy you would like to be a part of a tournament team:\r\nYour past experience on a tournament style team or ranked team (If Applicable):\r\nCan you shot call?
