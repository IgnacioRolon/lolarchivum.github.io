I've been trying to read up on how to earn chests, but even the hextech crafting guide doesn't seem that definitive. \r\n\r\nP.S. I posted this as a bug first but then thought it fit better here.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T21:30:48.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are guaranteed a mastery chest by getting an S on a champion you own, but only once per champ per season.  You are also limited in how many mastery chests you can receive, and 1 chest will refresh each week.  There should be a line of chest icons on your profile, and mousing over should tell you your next refresh.\n\nRegarding teammates, you'll only get it if they are in your premade before the match starts.  Any random teammate receiving an S will not reward a chest.  More info is also available in our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, but I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
