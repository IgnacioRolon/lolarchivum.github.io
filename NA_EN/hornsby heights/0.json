If these tips don't work, then, unfortunately, I won't be able to assist further.\n\nFirst, you may be able to simply change your region to Oceania after the patcher comes up. Seems pretty simple, but I thought I'd mention it just in case. Secondly, you may be able to hop into your RADS System folder and make some configuration changes that will give you access to Oceania. Bear in mind, I've never used playonlinux, so I'm not sure if this is possible.\n\nIf you're able to access your the league install folder, you can find the RADS System through **Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\System** and you can make the following changes:\n> **Edit LAUNCHER.CFG**\n \n>* *change* the first line to **airConfigProject = lol_air_client_config_oc1**\n\n> **Edit LOCALE.CFG**\n>* *change* the first line  to **locale = en_au**\n\n> **EDIT SYSTEM.CFG**\n\n>*  *change* the third line to **Region = OC1**\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
