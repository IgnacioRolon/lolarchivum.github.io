If your crashes are specifically happening while trying to load then you may actually be having game file and driver issues that's failing to render the game.  The steps in the video guide are not close to resolving that problem.  Instead, go over each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide.  You should also download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help with some of the steps.
