So, I kept my chin up and did the next best thing, make a comic. So, enjoy the first part of Rito Towers. A story that takes place in an parallel universe where the champions manage Riot (Rito) Games and the rioters have become the champions. I'll try to pump one part out every week if people end up wanting more. Tell me what you think of part 1!  \n*(edit: Damn dood! Didn't my stuff was THIS good. Well, I'm honoured to be on the post of the day twice. More will be coming soon.) *\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/75AyMLm.jpg  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/UUmsD39.jpg  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/5lqm05k.jpg  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/uV3Ar5g.jpg  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/xqkpdrs.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/zfDcv5U.jpg  \n  \nPart 2:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/An1fAwNY-rito-towers-issue-1-part-2-comic  \nPart 3:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/rna15B3c-rito-towers-issue-1-part-3-comic  \nPart 4:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/ATgwiwUi-rito-towers-issue-1-part-4-comic  \nPart 5:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/Lur1c6cP-rito-towers-issue-1-part-5-comic  \nPart 6:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/BllT9pbh-rito-towers-issue-1-part-6-comic  \nPart 7:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/577f8bi6-rito-towers-issue-1-part-7-comic  \nPart 8:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/GGpEzvez-rito-towers-issue-1-part-8-comic  \nPart 9:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/GIKkOA2y-rito-towers-issue-1-part-9-comic  \nPart 10:  \nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/r48ijRnw-rito-towers-issue-1-part-10-comic","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-05-22T11:25:40.893+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion's speech was so emotional.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2014-05-23T04:42:40.021+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"*sniff*...it touched my heart.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Catisfaction","date":"2014-05-22T03:58:36.103+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"LMAO.
