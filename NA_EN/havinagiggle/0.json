I do apologize if this turns out to be a repost.*\n\nAnyway, I'm just reporting a bug I found while playing a game. I was counter jungled at my blue buff which is as normal as ever. However, when I walked over to the blue buff, the icon on the mini-map indicating the camp was still present, despite my buff being clearly gone.  \n\nI took a screenshot for proof. However, there's a ward that sorta blocks the view of the buff icon. I zoomed in to make it easier to see.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6BIDiax.jpg  \n\nI don't know which camps are affected by the bug or how often it appears. This is my first time seeing it so I assume it's rather low. However, a bug like that can be a major pain for junglers and other teammates who want to keep track of camp timers.","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2014-07-09T22:36:03.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bob, thanks for reporting.\n\nDid you have vision of the camp when they snagged your blue, or did you put the ward down after it was already gone?\n\nAlso, did it ever clear, like the next time that blue spawned and was killed, did the icon function as it should?\n\nOne more question: when was this game?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"HavinAGiggle","date":"2014-07-09T23:15:51.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only gained vision of the camp after it was taken. I was confused because I was still seeing the icon so I assumed they were in the process of counter-jungling. I checked the surround area, bushes, etc. but the entire camp was taken.  \n\nThe next time it spawned and was taken, the icon disappeared as normal.  \n\nAnd this game was yesterday (07/09)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tamat","date":"2014-07-09T21:55:53.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCan you post any bug reports in Help & Support? That's where we'd like bugs to live. I will however respond to you here this time though.\n\nI can't confirm or deny this as a bug, but this happens to me from time to time as well. Personally, I've ruled it off as not having full visibility of the camp. If you look at the screenshot you uploaded, there is a portion of the camp that isn't visible. I'm not sure if this is working as intended, but I'll pass it over to a Designer or QA pal to see what they think.","replies":[{"poster":"HavinAGiggle","date":"2014-07-09T22:08:45.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My apologies. I didn't really know where to post this as I figured Help & Support was more for forum related stuff. As far as full visibility, I don't think that's it as I wandered around the camp area in my confusion for a good while. I only placed the ward after checking the surrounding area. But hey, maybe I'm wrong. Thanks for letting me know where to put future bugs!","replies":[]}]}]}
