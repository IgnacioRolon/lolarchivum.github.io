I can&#039;t even turn on the television for 3 damn minutes without a crime being reported in Zaun! Call the governor! You tell him I said get it together!.... What? What do you mean it doesn&#039;t want to talk? Hello? HELLO?&quot;\nA disturbed man slams the phone down, missing the hook as he angrily puts one hand on his forehead. The quiet in the room is broken only by a single dial-tone. &quot;Ever since Jinx and her obnoxious gang had their uprising there has been no peace in this place. Everything in the city is overshadowed by pain and darkness. And to make matters worse, Piltover is killing us in the latest technology. Zaun, what have we done to your once warm streets? I remember a time where being in this place was glorified beyond measure. Now it&#039;s just a place a filth.\n\nA beautiful woman walks into the cold office where the man is sitting. &quot;Zaun, can be restored sir,&quot; the woman said confidently. &quot;Take a look at this.&quot; The woman threw a stack of papers unto the desk, eagerly awaiting for the man to read.\n\nAfter 5 minutes or so, the man smirked. &quot;Hex-Tech Gear huh?&quot; He uttered with a confident smile. &quot;So Hex-Tech finally returned my e-mails. About time.&quot; The man leaned back into his chair with a sigh or relief. The woman, looking confused, descided to inquire; &quot;This is state-of-the-art equipment sir. What do you plan on doing with such powerful merchandise?&quot; The young man said earnestly, &quot;I&#039;m going to bring order to this retched place. I&#039;m going to stop the plague that has been spreading from Zaunite to Zaunite and run this place with an iron fist! With this equipment I, will be able to stop anything that comes my way. I, will be the new law of the land, and all will abide by my rules! And all will know, the name Titus!&quot;\n\n**STORY BEHIND THE LORE**\n&gt;Titus is intended to be an Anti-Hero. His intentions are just; but as a Zaunite himself, he is starting to become consumed by corruption and power.\n\n**ROLE: FIGHTER/TANK**\n\nSTATS:\nHealth- 540 (+ 73 per level)\nHealth Regen- 10 (+ 0.75 per level)\nAttack Damage- 60 (+ 3 per level)\nAttack Speed- 0.625 (2% per level)\nArmor- 25 (2.6 per level)\nMagic Resist- 32 (1.25 per level)\nMovement Speed- 340\nMana User/Melee Range\n\n\n**Passive:**\nBOOST- While a non-ultimate spell is on cool down it will be replaced by a skilled called BOOST. BOOST allows you to dash in a targeted direction of the mouse cursor, knocking aside all units and slowing them by 50% for 1 second. BOOST can only be used ONCE PER SKILL, and DOES NOT share cool downs with the abilities already on cool down.\n\nNOTE: Since Titus is a Fighter/Tank I gave him this passive as a means to have decent mobility. Though he ultimately has up to three dashes, skills have to be used in order to do so, meaning you cannot dash at will. However, BOOST can be a great tool to use in combat because it could close a gap or even disrupt opponents. BOOSTING can also be a great way to peel for an carry in mid-fight.\n\nRange: Up to 450\nCost: None\n\n**Ability 1:**\nCOUNTER- Titus raises his guard, becoming IMMOBILE, but granting a temporary SPELL SHIELD for 1.25 second. If a spell is absorbed, you will gain 8/10/12/15/16% of your Max. Health over 3 seconds and your next BOOST deals (75/125/175/225/275 + 0.2 AD) physical damage to all units he passes through.\n\nNOTE: Counter is a great defensive move used to anticipate the opponent and react. Absorbing a spell gives your BOOST 2 features. You have a great way to recover health, or a decent follow-up to Knock-aside. Options are what make a champion fun, so why not have a few.\n\nRange: Self-Cast\nCost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana\nCool Down: 22/19/16/13/10 seconds\n\n**Ability 2:**\nDOUBLE IMPACT- Titus empowers his next basic attack with hit twice. The first blow will be a quick jab with his tonfa, dealing 100/125/150/175/200% of your BASE Attack damage as physical damage, while the second attack will be a powerful right elbow doubling the damage dealt from the first attack.\n\nNOTE: Titus&#039; main damaging ability, this move can be very powerful when equipped with the right items (TF, IG) but can easily be countered by champions such as Jax or Pantheon. Even attacking a tanking support such as Braum (when his shield is up) would reduce the damage output of this skill significantly. The plus side is, if you deal good damage to a target from the first attack, you&#039;ll defiantly love that right elbow that&#039;s sure to follow!\n\nRange: 125 (Melee range)\nCost: 50 mana at all ranks\nCool Down: 8/7.25/6.5/5.75/5 seconds\n\n**Ability 3:**\nTONFA PUNCH- Titus releases a powerful Punch to the stomach, dealing (50/85/120/155/190 + 12% of your BONUS health) as physical damage and stunning an enemy unit for 1.5 seconds.\n\nNOTE: This is a basic Crowd Control/Damage ability. It&#039;s nothing too fancy but is great for additional damage when going all-in or for stunning a champion for disengage.\n\nRange: 175 (Single-Target)\nCost 70 mana at all ranks\nCool Down: 12/11/10/9/8\n\n**Ability 4 (Ultimate):**\nHEX-TECH SURGE- For the next 8 seconds Titus gains (40%) Armor and Magic Resist. While in surge mode his attacks deal 10% of the targets missing health + (8/9/10% of your bonus health) as bonus magic damage. Targets below 15% of their Maximum Health are executed On-Hit, and restore Health based on the health they had before death.\n\nNOTE: Titus&#039; Hex-Tech gear at full peak! This gives a tank some clean-up potential on low health targets with his execute, while also being able to deal great damage to tanks in team fights. The cool down is long though, so use your ultimate wisely!\n\nRange: Self-Cast\nCost: 100 mana\nCool Down: 200/180/160","replies":[{"poster":"Winddrake101","date":"2016-05-12T00:47:01.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the ult is too strong. other than that the design\n and lore is amazing good job!","replies":[{"poster":"LilStacey87","date":"2016-05-12T02:39:11.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You right, I had to take off the last part.

Come on!  I was practically salivating over all the crazy possibilities I thought I was about to read through.  The BOOST idea is incredible but it's weighed down by boring punches and circa 2010 Champion design.\n\nI HIGHLY encourage you to go back to the drawing board and build an entire kit around the BOOST passive.  Because if you don't, I will.  >_>","replies":[]},{"poster":"Senteth","date":"2016-05-12T04:42:04.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm...
