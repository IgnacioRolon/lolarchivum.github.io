I'm not to savvy on making game reviews or posting youtube videos, but I just want to say as a fan, thanks for all the time and work you guys put into making the game as balanced and fun as possible. As a gamer I usually jump from game to game for the thrills, but Im getting up there in age so I got to make good investments with my time. But I can honestly say I want to stick with League of Legends, the game is simple enough for fun and complex enough for competitive play. If there's a link I could go to to give positive feedback please post it here.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-14T17:33:42.023+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank *you* for playing, and for sticking with it!
