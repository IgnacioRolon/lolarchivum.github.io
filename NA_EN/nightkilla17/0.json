The ban said I used a third party program. After just submitting tickets and waiting, my friend logged onto his account and check my history and say I played 5 games today. I didn't play a single game today at all. Is there anyway riot could check where my account was logged into because I've only played on this account in two places and thats it. If anybody has any suggestions or anything that would be great because I've spent a lot of money on this account ( as most people who play league do) and I have had this account for years. Thank you very much.","replies":[]}
