Let's troubleshoot that first before you try queueing back up to make sure the timer doesn't eventually get increased from you being forced out of champ select. \n\nFirst, go into your client options and turn on low-spec mode. That will give your client an easier time dealing with the background animations and you should be able to get through champ select. Make sure to test it in a custom or practice match before queueing back up, and let me know if it helps.","replies":[]}]}
