Why is the gifting center down? I bought a nice chunk or RP figuring it would be resolved by now but it's been a couple weeks. \r\n\r\nChristmas is almost here and if it's  not fixed, Riot will lose a lot of money. I gift skins as presents every year. I know I can't  be the only one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T16:15:07.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to discover any problems with gifting.  If you are currently on the updated client, keep in mind that it's not available for testing.  You can gift through the legacy client in the meantime:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
