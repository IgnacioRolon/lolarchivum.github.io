This will make it so that you know how your internet is and it won't unexpected when you join a game and realize you have bad ping, decreasing the gameplay experience for others.  I think overall this would really help decrease the amount of games where you meet a dc.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiphess","date":"2014-10-19T05:28:11.945+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait\n\nchinese actually have more functionnality like this than us ?\n\nw0t","replies":[{"poster":"DaejinTye","date":"2014-10-19T06:13:38.026+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> wait\n> \n> chinese actually have more functionnality like this than us ?\n> \n> w0t\n\nDude, the U.S. has **the worst** functionality and support right now.
