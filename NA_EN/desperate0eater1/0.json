Nidalee, in my opinion is strong right now and I used to main Nidalee mid before her rework. She was OP back then because she could eliminate someone before a fight. But her team fighting ability is still weak. I think Nidalee jungle should not be nerfed what so ever because there are other stronger junglers such as Vi, Lee Sin, J4, etc. Yes she is strong but nerfing her would only make jungling less fun. And instead what Riot's Balance Team should be doing is changing off-meta junglers to make jungling easier with them. The jungle pool right now consists of 8 champions. I am not saying there are only 8 champions that you can jungle with, but I am saying that there are only 8 legit junglers right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2015-02-27T16:18:50.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://champion.gg/champion/Nidalee/Jungle\n\nPeople are slow to realize she was bug fixed in a way that dropped her jungle win rate by 4% to 5% the patch after it became a thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-27T16:09:16.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just think her cougar form should cost mana.
