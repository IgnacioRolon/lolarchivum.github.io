I attempted to reach out to your support site, however the tickets I made do not appear to work. I was emailed the ticket numbers along with the links to view them. Upon trying to view them, I get _Opps, the page you are looking for does not exist_. It has been three days since I made the first ticket. I don't understand why I can't view it unless there is something wrong with the support site. My ticket numbers are #23596233 and #23620276. The second ticket, #23620276, has the updated info as requested by the support site. I made the account in season 4 or 3, which I know is not really too long technically, but I put a lot of work into my account. I just need to know that the tickets are being worked on and workable. I hate sitting on my hands.\r\n\r\nThank You","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T20:50:34.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and verified that all your tickets have been received.
