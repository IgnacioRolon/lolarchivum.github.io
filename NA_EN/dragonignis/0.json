Qiyana is the 145th champion and Riot is supposed to  expand the free champion rotation, as per [this dev post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Exl3sEaO-expanding-the-weekly-free-champion-rotation).\n\nRiot has forgotten to do this as Rioter \"BUBOBUBO\" made a post stating that the free champion rotation will be staying at 14.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/u4RtWAc.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-02T00:08:00.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"10% of 145 is 14.5.

You are absolutely right. It even explicitly says that it'll be increased to 15 when we hit 145 champs.\n\nMy only remaining theory at this time is that the plan changed in the intervening two years since that thread was posted.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
