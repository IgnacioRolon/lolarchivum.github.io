I went into a custom game and tried multiple times to get more information and I believe I&#039;ve got most of the details.\r\nWhen Yorick kills a minion with his Q or E (this bug happens more often with his Q, but I&#039;ve got it to happen with his E), and there are no enemy champions nearby, the ghoul will just not move for about 1.5 seconds. Afterwards, however, it will normally function and go to attack other minions.\r\n\r\nHere is how you can see this in action for yourself:\r\nStep 1: Well, you have to pick Yorick and get into a lane (without an enemy champion in it), so...\r\nStep 2: Last hit a minion with Q or E\r\nStep 3: Repeat Step 2 multiple times, as sometimes the ghoul will not hesitate. It will also get you more trials which is always good in an experiment.\r\n\r\nI guess that&#039;s it. I know this wouldn&#039;t matter too much in game, especially since hardly anyone plays Yorick, but it&#039;s always nice to improve the game as much as possible ^^","replies":[]}
