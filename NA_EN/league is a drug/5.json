Say these are the votes of a team:\r\n{{champion:81}} \r\n{{champion:81}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:9}} \r\n\r\nNow, Ezreal and Fiddlesticks have 40%, and Lux has 20%. This makes it go down to a tie breaker.\r\nNow, lets say that Lux is the one who wins the tie breaker. What? The thing that I think should happen in this situation, is Lux should be eliminated from the tie breaker, and then it should be between Fiddlesticks and Ezreal.\r\n\r\nI've had this problem happen to me several times while playing One for All, and it's really starting to get on my nerves when 1 vote gets picked over 2 40% votes. I don't know if they know this, or if it isn't even a glitch or something. I just had to say something about this, as I really don't like this thing, and I'm sure others don't either.","replies":[{"poster":"easily too","date":"2013-12-01T23:38:00.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a complete troll pick Lee Sin, the hardest champion to play in all of League.
