The game is getting unplayable for me, but it's not my ISP. No other game or service loads slowly or has anything close to latency issues. Is this happening for other people too?

Essentially what this means is that part of the data your network is sending to us (data about what the game is doing) is getting lost of damaged along the way your ISP is sending it. There might be a damaged node along the route, or your ISP may just be having some small issues at that moment. Reach out to them to confirm any issues, and if there aren't any, hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for some extra troubleshooting!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T02:21:57.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been seeing too many reports of lag around Ontario today, but that doesn't mean that you aren't having issues for some reason. I'd like to go ahead and rule out packet loss as a possibility since that might be why League's connection is being affected and not anything else. \n\nUse our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to scan some of your games network logs that had this ridiculous lag.
