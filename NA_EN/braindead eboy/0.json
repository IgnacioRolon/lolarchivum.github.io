The problem comes from when no one speaks up, that leaves a person feeling helpless. I think this is the main reason people argue for the \"counter flame\" method of dealing with trolls. Nothing hurts more knowing that 3 other people are watching you suffer and won't do anything about it. At that point the game really is a waste of time, that troll wont get banned and you still lose and have a bad time AND have to sit there for the full game just to suffer. I think anyone would be annoyed at this situation so counter flame is fine. If it gets their stress out right then than what is the problem. It really is there only defense physiologically from such a HELPLESS situation.  The other 3 people obliviously don't care or they would speak up. \n\nI also think counter flame is a attempt at highlighting the trolls actions. If a few other people aren't saying or doing anything about it then one way for them to notice would be to make a big deal out of it. \n\nThis is something I have noticed and my thoughts on the subject. I think a solution to this problem would be to add a report player option in game as many games have, that way people do not feel so helpless in game. Making it visible to everyone like the surrender vote would be good as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-12-30T10:09:02.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Spooky when long dead threads come back from the grave!\n\nWhile the art of thread necromancy can be useful in some cases, this unfortunately, is not one of those times.

However i believe if everyone reports this should increase the chances of the game getting looked at more closely. \n\nOr maybe riot has a lazy system set in place that only bans people using profanity.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-03-02T00:58:29.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system only requires a single report for the game to be flagged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-03-02T02:33:55.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[And I have evidence that this is not the case:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/9VrUtrJo-being-solo-and-having-a-team-report?comment=0000000000020000000000000000)\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9VrUtrJo,comment-id=0000000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-27T18:28:29.209+0000)\n>\n> Reports haven&#x27;t lost weight since the instant feedback system was put in place.\n> \n> It&#x27;s actually really simple.\n> \n> if (reports &gt; 0) {\n> review();\n> }","replies":[{"poster":"braindead eboy","date":"2018-03-02T07:34:02.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fair, still 5 reports should get the player reviewed or something","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-03-02T16:50:54.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if (**reports > 0**) {\n**review**();\n}\n\nUnless we've had it all wrong and it's 1-2-3-4-0-5 instead of 0-1-2-3-4-5, 1 counts as a report > 0, meaning it triggers a review.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-03-02T04:21:48.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with the premise that flaming back makes the person feel better. I don't think it does. They still feel bullied and miserable and want out. Counter flame does nothing but add more fire to the flame. That's why they need to just mute. Why do people constantly bitch about getting flamed, yet they never seem to use the mute button?? Now THAT is some complex psychological shit.  I don't wanna play a match and listen to someone get bullied the whole time... But even more so, I don't want to play a match and have to feel the repercussions of two people arguing, saying the cringiest shit (insulting video game skills? Fucking retarded) and not focusing on the game cuz they're busy trying to verbally one-up eachother. That's where mute doesn't help so much. Idiots arguing throughout a match don't play well at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-03-02T04:15:03.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counter flame?
