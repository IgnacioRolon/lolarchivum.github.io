A person dcs at the beginning of the game, but it doesn't let us do /remake. It just says \"remake is only possible when one or more people disconnect from the game\" or something along those lines. They weren't just afk though, they DISCONNECTED from the game, it showed the message. Anyone else having issues with this? I don't really care about games in preseason, but if this doesn't get fixed, well, I guess we'll have a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T05:38:18.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [/Remake System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) will only flag a player if they are *Inactive* for 90 or more seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match. If they were *inactive* outside of these confines, they would not be marked by the system and a remake would not become available at 3:00 gametime.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
