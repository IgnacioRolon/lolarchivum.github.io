However, did Riot try to fulfill understand the problem? \r\n\r\nIt's much easier to just go and throw a chat restriction and other punishment towards these players, but what were the reasons that led them to behave that way? \r\n\r\nI've played this game for the past 2 years, so I went from a rookie that couldn't play a twitch to a player that freaks out about wards (and I still have a lot of things to learn). I got offended and I offended. Recently, I'm under a 500- game chat restriction (Yes, you can say i am pretty much toxic). \r\n\r\nLet me tell you why a few reasons why I \"rage\" at players:\r\n\r\n1) When I'm playing ranked, I expect the same commitment from all my teammates - Winning > Fun\r\n2) If I'm in rank X and I've X skills, I expect at least the same skills from my teammates.\r\n3) If we ping and warn and the player persists on the mistake, he or she deserves to receive a \"f**k you\"\r\n4) When I'm looking for fun, I go for normals, aram and showdowns. People should behave the same way\r\n\r\nSo here is my problem, Riot seems to deny all these points and just apply the easiest answer \"ban the guy who says 'f**k you, garbage,...'\".  I do understand that people should be more mindful about others; however, when we're sitting on a match that is 10x40 and the team denies to surrend, you start feeling annoyed and you cannot go afk or you will face a harder punishment - you are stuck in a limbo match that has no beneficial outcome.\r\n\r\nRiot should try to balance both sides and try to understand what is happening on solo queue. MMR by itself isn't the best way to place people, it doesn't consider many other variables that are relevant. \r\n\r\nWhat you think? \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGustavo.","replies":[{"poster":"Soybean16","date":"2014-12-22T01:39:19.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can easily understand how this is true, \"If we ping and warn and the player persists on the mistake, he or she deserves to receive a \"f**k you\", It does not always end well (both players start swearing at each other and spend their time typing as opposed to playing the game). Usually the best way to solve these problems is to make sure they know what the pings mean, and to tell them that if they do not obey the pings, they will die. If they continue to make the same mistakes, just mute them and know that while they may cost you this game, they will contine to lose their team games and drop to an elo where they can learn the game better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2014-12-22T02:03:23.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone has bad games, but how does you saying \"f*ck you, you suck\" make that player start playing better? You are the reason that players on your team do poorly if that is how you communicate. When you Queue up for a game in soloqueue you know what you are getting into. You are going to get a wide variety of players from very strong players smurfing to very weak players who were carried to their elo, that is just how it works. If you don't like the SoloQueue system and want to make a 5s team that may be a better option for you, although I for sure would not want to play with someone that toxic.\n\nIt is a team game, you cannot win games on your own no matter how well you are doing. As someone who has carried games and had bad games where someone else had to pick up my slack, you never know what is going to happen and having someone yell at you the whole time will not make your team play any better. If you make a mistake and you know it was a stupid mistake then how is me saying \"wow you are trash, I can't believe you are that stupid, F*ck you\" going to make you play any better? It will probably just make you mad and play worse.\n\nYou will never climb being toxic and I hope that players like you are removed from the playerbase because at the end of the day this is a game and it has become a horrible playerbase to play with and have fun with which is the point of playing a **Game**.","replies":[{"poster":"Guto Mancer","date":"2015-06-25T06:01:47.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cry me a river and get over it.

It has a wide variety of people that are in different phases in their lives (parents, college/university students,...), so time are valuable for these people. When you get team up with someone that doesn't respect this key factor, verbal abuse becomes a way to relief the pressure. \n\nSoybean: If you are playing a Ranked match, you should have been aware of how the ping system work. Dropping elo isn't a punish compare to what happens to the rest of the team - time is valuable and they don't respect it and they're not punish for doing that.\n\n90% I just not trash talk people, I usually evaluate their performance, my own the enemy's. Sometimes, I'm terrible and I take the offense. \n\nLeague is a team orientated game; however, you don't see a lot of \"team-mind\" on this game. I suspect that one of the reasons is the fact of we don't truly connect with the people we are placed with. Most of the toxicity comes from solo queue, not from built teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cupkek","date":"2014-12-22T01:42:01.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm inclined to agree that MMR doesn't dictate a player's true rank or skill level. \n\nFor the past few months I was where I belonged. Silver 5. I didn't move up or down. I won games and I lost games. However right as the last month of the season came around. Bronze players scrabbling to get Silver rewards began to flood the queue. Being bronze, they lacked concepts of basic teamwork and proceeded to throw tens of matches with me stuck with them.\n\nWhile I churned out positive KDA, most towers destroyed, objective control, we still got obliterated. Now I'm among in Braindead 1 with the rest of them. \n\nThough League of Legends is a team oriented game, when players who clearly still belong in Puppy League invade ranked matches and bring everyone else down, there's a serious problem. \n\nRanked isn't a measure of a my skill in League of Legends when 1 or 4 other players decide to towerdive a {{champion:7}} while they're at 20% HP. Furthermore, the solution to this shouldn't be \"can't win? carry games\", it's a team game. Currently, my MMR suffers due to players who make incredibly foolish mistakes or will unwittingly pick their favorite champion even if the enemy laner completely walls them.","replies":[{"poster":"LuluInWonderland","date":"2014-12-22T01:56:09.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While true that it being a team game does have this effect sometimes, I can easily \"carry\" most bronze-level matches even as a non-damage support (via teamfighting, objective control, vision, general decision making, etc.). There's not a huge difference between b1 and s5. It's all incremental changes and going up or down a level is normal. If you went from a long-standing s5 to b4 or g1, then there's an issue as that gap is significant.\n\nI completely agree that things got really wonky at the end of the season due to rewards. You had people who avoided ranked play coming in, people who got a lot better since they last played ranked, a lot of smurf accounts rushing for rewards, and a heck of a LOT of MMR boosting. The MMR boosting was insane at my level as people rushed for gold rewards. Every match was either somebody on my team or somebody on their team hyper carrying the whole match...it was pure luck if you would win or lose any random match. I probably annoyed several Riot staff with all people I reported via support tickets. I'm not sure how to fix it, but something needs to be done because that was crazy.\n\nOne idea I had previously was adding an \"MVP\" vote at the end of a match. Whoever got the most votes (among both teams combined, min 3 or 4 votes for a single player for it to count) earned extra LP. That helps them advance faster through solo queue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LuluInWonderland","date":"2014-12-22T01:39:11.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Agreed. But how do you enforce such a rule? I don't think it makes sense for a report type of \"not playing at full effort/try hard\". However, the issue affects both teams so as long as you're not doing it, there's a 4/9 chance somebody on your team is like that and 5/9 chance for their team (assuming 1 person per match).\n\n2) Yes, but that's what MMR is for and it *will* put you in your \"proper\" place over enough matches with a very high confidence level. Riot looks at literally millions of players with many more millions of matches so they have the data to do so pretty accurately. Just keep playing and if you're higher skilled than your teammates, you'll eventually get to a point where you are the same skill level. That said, there's much more to the match than laning or teamfights. It's difficult for anybody in a match to measure everybody's contribution towards the total match and determine skill. We've all had people with really bad matches, bad lane matchups, etc. Again, as long as that's not you then there's a greater chance the other team will have it than your team.\n\n3) Nope. You may feel differently, but the community as a whole feels otherwise and that's why it's not welcome. You just have to deal with that one or not play the game, really.\n\n4) Agreed. Again, enforcing this is the hard part.\n\nEdit: As for the games where the team won't surrender, it's likely over soon anyway. Just play it out and try to learn something along the way. Or maybe there is a reason why the team won't surrender yet (i.e. a super-fed champ fizzles off and can't carry into late-game). It's rare but it happens. Or if you have a very late game oriented team comp. Either way, just play it out.\n\nI'm not really sure of ways to properly match people outside of some form of ELO. The whole idea of ranked revolves around comparing your skill level to somebody else's skill level.","replies":[]}]}
