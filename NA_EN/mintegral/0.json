Even though this is all owned and created by Riot, the systems do not directly interact with each other. This is why you can be level 30 in-game, but it won't display as such on Boards.  By posting in Boards you should force the system to sync-up and you should be able to post in other discussions in the near future.\n\nIf you aren't able to in a couple of hours still, reply back and let me know!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
