However, clicking the link that says \"CREATE YOUR PBE ACCOUNT\" never works and just sends me to the Error: 500 page. I'd love to become a tester, but it somehow won't let me.

The 500 error is an issue that some player shave been getting, and an issue we've been investigating.  We don't have a fix right now, but some players have been able to workaround this by using a VPN.  Additionally, make sure that you're using the correct url to get in.  See if[ this one](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe-signup) works just in case.
