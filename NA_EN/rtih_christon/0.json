We have Blitz and Thresh grabs, Nami with her Q knock up stun, Jana with her team fight disrupting ult, alistar with his headbut/infinite sustain and yet somehow Sona is the most broken support. Not saying all the champions I mentioned need a nerf but they simply offer more to the support position than Sona.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hard Penetrator","date":"2015-01-07T00:42:32.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ppl will just throw her away because she is weak and it would be much better to take nami over sona especially that Knockups aren't cut by tenacity where sona ults is (at least give her galio treatment). \n\nI see Thresh every game and his last nerf was a joke. Is there any rational explanation why THresh is balanced and Sona isn't?","replies":[]}]}
