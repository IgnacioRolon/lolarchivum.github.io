Almost immediately after it happened, I remember emailing riot basically begging to prove myself that I won't be toxic anymore. The rioters who emailed me back knew that was just panic in me and there really was no way I could prove to have changed by a simple ban. They did their jobs correctly by, in other words, telling me that I have not demonstrated to deserve an unban for any reason. So, after a back and forth with them, they put an end to me and I was forced to let it go. \r\n\r\nA month passed by and I couldnt stop thinking of league, to be completely honest. What I ended up doing was really taking time off and reevaluating how I respond to people who get on my nerves, in real life first, then online. I'm not saying it's a perfect change, but after a total of 3 months, I felt I had actually reformed. \r\n\r\nSo naturally, I emailed riot support again last night. I explained to the rioter this exact situation, understanding full well that it is much more likely to remain banned then getting my hopes up of making a comeback. The rioter brought up a good point about how they do give players a 2 week suspension warning before actually giving you a permaban to give you time to really rethink your behavior. I did get a 2 week suspension before my ban. However, how j explained to the rioter was how it's difficult to change being in the mindset of a person that got that point in the first place, especially in only 2 weeks. Now, 2 weeks is long, I'm not saying it's a short time, but I dont think the idea of being able to come back really let me grasp the consequences of the situation at hand. \r\n\r\nIt took me almost 3 months for me to come back to riot support asking them to reevaluate their decision with confidence that I have reformed. \r\n\r\nThe rioter I talked to said I made some good points, and to bring it up in the boards, which I'm doing now. Thanks for believing in me Peacemaker. I just need the rioters who can really help me to tell me if it's sufficient evidence to reevaluate my ban from how I am 3 months from the day it was rightfully placed.\r\n\r\nAlso, dont you find it funny how when you're trying to make a case for yourself, all of a sudden you feel like an English expert? \r\n\r\nTrying to end it on a light hearted note, thank you for reading through and responding if possible.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-05-18T06:45:29.518+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"In your particular case, I feel like the Rito-er you talked to just passed the buck onto this board.  No one here has any power whatsoever to unban you.  There's not even a Rito employee frequent this board anymore.  Sure, they may or may not read this board, but they sure are not participating anymore.  You sound like you understand and agree with your ban so there's not really much value in discussing it.  The primary function of this board is to help you understand your ban and how to not get penalized further in the future.  It doesn't seem like you needed either of those.  I fail to see what is the purpose of the Rito-er in sending you here (other than to pass said buck) because you're not here to understand your ban or discuss changing policies.\n\nI'm sorry to inform you that no matter how much you demonstrated that you've reformed to this particular board, no one here has any sway in changing your ban status and there is no Rito here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-18T07:31:05.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the ban was rightfully placed, it won't be lifted. Telling you to post on Boards is a canned response. If you start another account and prove beyond any doubt that you've reformed (no punishments, no valid reports, no restrictions, no arguing, actually muting toxic players rather than saying you will and then not doing so, accepting that usually a dying teammate isn't doing it on purpose, etc.), then you will be allowed to retain that new account. The permabanned one is permanently banned, which is permanent.","replies":[]}]}
