I'll be putting a sticky post up shortly, but so far players have been able to perform a workaround by tapping Alt+Enter in-game.  This will toggle you out of fullscreen and into a windowed mode to restore your resolution.  I'm also trying to find the origin here, possibly a resolution setting.  What resolution are you currently at in-game?  What happens if you lower it?  Thanks for the info!","replies":[]},{"poster":"OneInchPete","date":"2017-05-03T16:06:05.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same thing happened to me.
