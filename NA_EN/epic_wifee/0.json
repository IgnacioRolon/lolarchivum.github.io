Unfortunately that does not help. Although I did want to play ranked 3v3, the whole game mode is unavailable. I can't play bind pick to practise or play for fun whilst ranked is down!\n\nOn another note, why has ranked been restricted to specific timing? I work from 7-9am and 3-7pm every day. This means that I can only play ranked for 3 hours each day, if I start as soon as I get home, and that's if I stay up until 11pm (which I don't as I have to leave at 6am for work) Will this be changing in the New Year or is it a season long thing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T17:50:02.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked Team matches roll on a specific schedule depending on it being a weekday or weekend.
