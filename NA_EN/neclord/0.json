You just shoot a camp and let your jungler finish it like normal and you get stacks, and make sure you're there for every drag attempt.  The only things you really take are occasional gromps/krugs or scuttles when nothing is happening(not too bad to scoop up one camp if the junglers on the other side of the map anyway).  When I tested it, my jungler let me take gromp and scuttle between bot waves and I followed them around a few mins getting jungle camp assists between ganks or after fights, and it was finished around the 25 min range.  We did have 2 dragons, so that helped a ton, but it's really nowhere near as hard to finish as an adc as i would have imagined.","replies":[{"poster":"Tutajk","date":"2015-07-11T10:39:54.095+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, you get stacks even when you aren't delivering the killing blow?
