Basically although I admit my misdoings, **I believe Riot GREATLY mishandled my case.**\n\nEx:\n\n>It is also why we give rather light penalties for first time offenders\n\nI was a first time offender and I was hit with a zero-to-permaban punishment which is reserved for the most extreme cases... a fraction of a fraction of the comnunity.

How far in the past was it when perma-banned players were given additional chances? I don&#x27;t remember hearing of this.\n\nIt was very far back, I think in either Season 1 or 2. It was called the Level 20 Challenge where they hand-picked some players to give a second chance to to try to get to lv.20 without being banned again (I believe that's how it worked but don't quote me on that though). The result: Absolute failure. From the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**Why can’t you give permanent banned players a second chance? You will receive a better player. **\nActually, this is the unfortunate problem. Allowing permanently banned players another chance is an extremely damaging cost. Do you know what the success rate of the Level 20 Challenge was? 5%. Do you know that for each person, they clearly outlined the toxic behaviors and had 1 on 1 conversations with the players to try to improve their behavior? These are players that were hand-picked by Player Support staff because they felt the pleas from these players were genuine. The success rate was still 5%. \n\n>Do you know how many games on average these players played? 100 games / month. When a permanently banned player fails to reform, they are creating miserable experiences for hundreds, maybe thousands of players a month. That's not a cheap cost or a low risk and we cannot consciously justify that, for the sake of the rest of our players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GankRiven","date":"2016-10-12T17:08:41.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yeah babe spit that how firey justice out on em. love ya babe keep up the good work! <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"notsohotso","date":"2016-10-11T00:07:03.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, can you review a post I made about my punishment?

Premade reports only have the weight of a single report altogether. Also, reports merely flag a match for review; when a player receives too many reports in too few games a review of those matches is triggered; if negative behavior is found to be consistent and/or extreme, then they player may be punished. If they have done nothing to validate the reports then it won't hurt them, and the players making false reports will lose value in theirs. A match is flagged just the same whether it's 1 report or 9.\n\nAs for them saying 100 things and you saying 1, it doesn't really matter; all you do by retaliating with the same behavior is perpetuate the negative environment and make it worse. If someone is being a jerk in chat the only useful defense is muting and reporting them.\n\nEven though players can mute and there is a filter, that is no excuse to be toxic. By the time a player is forced to use them you've already created a negative environment. It's up to you to control your behavior, not them.\n\nAn account ban is also not going to happen because of one game;  14 day and permabans are the 3rd and 4th steps in the [4 tiers of punishment](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions).
