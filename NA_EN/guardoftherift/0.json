I bought this skin back in season 2 with it being advertised as a _**LIMITED SKIN**_, which I thought Riot said would never become available again. Its marked as an event limited skin, meaning, you could only get it then. Yet, here we are, with the skin released and RIOT making god knows what kind of money off of it. So, what did they do for the people who bought it way back thing? Slapped a crown and a non-fancy border and said, sorry. Honestly, I feel like more should be done. I feel as if maybe the 2016 edition should be changed more. Like, season 2 removed from the back or maybe the OG is given gold armor or something. This is just me ranting at this point. The thing that I really wanted to get off my chest was, when I played the game and used my skin, literally nobody cared. It was just another championship riven skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T20:16:50.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This type of post is better suited for [Miscellaneous](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), where other suggestion-type posts get far more visibility.
