The first couple times I thought I was lagging or something was going on I didn't know about but the last few times I've noticed my E becomes inactive for a long period of time. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what brings it back but about after around a minute or two of no E, I can cast it again. \r\n\r\nI've included a screenshot from the last game. I dove a Teemo and Annie (Fiddle joined the fight) and I was stunned and then maybe blinded and/or feared, and after all that I still couldn't E and died to the tower. \r\n\r\nWhen I resurrected my E was still a little darker in color than the rest of my spells and when I clicked to use it, it read \"You cannot cast that right now.\" \r\n\r\nI ran around for a little while and eventually noticed it was back up. If I had to guess I would say it's time based or you need to Q a minion or something.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I can't be more helpful.\r\n\r\nHere is the link to the game: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1757704201/207307297?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"KryBabyKev","date":"2015-03-23T18:39:55.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just happened again:\n\nFighting a Cass and Kalysta, attaked the Kalysta, was holding my E cause my team was almost there, killed the Kalysta, and went for Cass but when I tried to E... nothing. I really have no idea what's causing this.\n\nI was thinking about when I see it trying to log in on another comp and watch it and video tape it. But when I went to do it my other comp didn't have the updates.

I don't think it's caused (at least not solely) by Q'ing someone and then they die, but I can't remember anything else distinct that happened in that fight. \n\nI think I ulted Syndra, she slowed me or whatever she does, maybe Graves dropped his sprinkler thing so that could again be my original theory of getting multiple CC effects at once or something. God this is frustrating. \n\nBut I did check the Q something method Wittrock (and I) mentioned and it worked again.\n\nPlease someone else chime in so we can get more info.","replies":[]},{"poster":"happystik","date":"2015-03-12T22:37:54.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS JUST HAPPENED TO ME IN A FUCKING RANKED GAME SMH I LOST BECAUSE I COULDNT USE IT FOR 10 MINUTES>( I WAS CARRYING THE FUCKING GAME AISHDJLAKSDJLAKSJDLKASJDLKASJLDKJASLKDJALSKDJLASKJDLASKDJ ANGER","replies":[{"poster":"KryBabyKev","date":"2015-03-19T20:00:32.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you recall what happened when it started?

Maybe it has to do with hitting E right when you get feared/silenced.","replies":[]}]}]}
