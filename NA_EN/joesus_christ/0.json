But a win is a win, even if its sloppy :p","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-02-22T23:11:59.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I think whenever Bjerg is at his best is when he's on a control mage like Xerath or Ahri.

It's not that he played bad, but he looked uncomfortable on her. TSM kicked into gear too late in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-24T14:15:07.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I respectfully disagree. While he wasn't on a play-making champion which may have helped.
