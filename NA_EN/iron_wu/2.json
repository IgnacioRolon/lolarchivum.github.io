They have tech now to do great floating fire/smoke effects in their engine. And yeah, his skins are really simple...\nnew effects would be nice too, just a good vgu would do noc good.\n\n(we may see an update for him in the diver update, rumored to be the update after tanks this mid-season.\nhopefully some minor game health update to him and a good vgu)","replies":[]}]}
