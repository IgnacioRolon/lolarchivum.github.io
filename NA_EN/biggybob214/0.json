When blitz hits ez with a hook, and ez uses his e to escape, this simply stuns ez wherever he blinks to. \r\n\r\n2. I just finished playing an aram in which I was blitz and the enemy team had an Ezreal. I landed a total of 4 hooks on ez during the game and every time he would use his e to escape, even when my hook had **hit** him, he would flash away from me (overriding my pull). The stun associated with the hook set in once he landed, once again, **further away**, and then he could just run away. \r\n\r\n3. Not really sure if this is an intended result of his e but the fact that he can more or less cancel a pull is kinda ridiculous. Not like he&#039;s easy to hit in the first place. \r\n\r\nCan&#039;t find a reference number for the game but this is the readout info I could get.\r\nNormal (All Random)  28:20  8/9/2015\r\n\r\nLet me know soon please.

If timed properly, Ezreal can Arcane Shift away to safety from Blitz's hook. A similar instance can happen (and is intended) with Tristana.","replies":[{"poster":"biggybob214","date":"2015-08-21T17:19:43.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katey,\n\nI completely understand the shift being intended as an escape or engage move but it does seem a bit much to let it or a trist jump basically stop the pull from working if they are actually hit. Obviously I can't pretend to know what goes into these decisions and I'm sure you guys have a viable reason for this specific interaction. It just seems to make two of the more elusive champs even more difficult to catch. \n\nAnyways, still love the game and little things like being able to interact with you guys makes it even better!","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-08-21T17:25:49.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets put it another way: if their dashes didn't have delays, the hooks wouldn't have landed in the first place, since the same reaction time would have gotten them out of the hook's range.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-08-10T17:40:35.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Not really sure if this is an intended result of his e but the fact that he can more or less cancel a pull is kinda ridiculous\". Then what's his E suppose to be for?? Decoration?? His E is made to be an escape from Blitz grabs, Thresh hooks, etc O.o It's there for him to juke your grabs and hooks and stuff. So yeah. It's very normal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2015-08-10T01:59:17.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an intentional interaction.
