Someone in another thread said:\n\n_That would be a really cool reveal. Azir's blood manifested in a cold blooded killer who values gold over her friends and Xerath's blood manifested in an extremely good hearted individual who values her family and friends above all else. I think it would be a really cool contrast and I wouldn't mind if this theory turned out to be correct.  -Czeslaw_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-05-31T10:25:45.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooooo... still chances for \"slave\" blood?\n\n_<hints at {{champion:101}}>_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tract","date":"2016-05-31T00:14:21.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw :P although Fasmodey's theory makes more sense now that so think about it, Xerath was an amazing Mage, she's a natural Mage, that would be awesome!","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-05-31T00:20:09.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tract,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5l0KpJhA,comment-id=000100000003,timestamp=2016-05-31T00:14:21.213+0000)\n>\n> Aw :P although Fasmodey&#x27;s theory makes more sense now that so think about it, Xerath was an amazing Mage, she&#x27;s a natural Mage, that would be awesome!\n\nWell, that's not my theory though.
