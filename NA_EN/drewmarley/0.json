And the results, to me are, clear. WIthout saying anything in game I added a person afterwards and purposely flamed him. He sent a screen shot to the support group as in exhibit A . Took less than 30 mins to get a response. NOTE: i could care less for the account It&#039;s not my main this Account isn&#039;t my main neither.\r\nNow I&#039;m not too sure about you guys, but it takes more than a day even weeks to get a response from support group when my friends or I genuinely need help. I think its just disgusting how they probably had 1000+ tickets before respond to that person. \r\nExhibit A http://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gyazo.com%2F045a7d42614a15d5fc3f233f4aef0c45.png&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-03-10T21:08:37.088+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's a lot of very convincing evidence you have there, my friend.

Things like purposeful flaming etc are easy to look into and take less time, seeing as im assuming they are sent to a different place than, for example, there being a glitch with Zzrot portal blocking minion waves and then having this swarm of minions go down lane.\n\n2) You just admitted here you purposefully flamed someone who you added outside of game. Are you saying within 30 minutes of you flaming your account was banned? Seeing as you had said the N word if im reading that correctly, if someone reports that, its again, much faster to be banned.\n\n3) They do have many tickets, and they try to get to all of them, and the 1000+ tickets before that is likely your assumption and not even close to actual fact. They work hard to get through their tickets.\n\n4) Are you making this thread just to complain you got banned for purposeful flaming and trying to say your not upset about it?","replies":[]}]}
