I won&#039;t be making a TL;DR, because I am preaching/venting; furthermore, I don&#039;t expect upvotes. I just want this to be seen.\n***\n\nNow I&#039;m not asking Riot to fix this community, I&#039;m asking us &quot;The community&quot; (If you can even call it that) to fix &quot;the community&quot;\nI get shit-talking for the sake of just fucking around, and I understand getting pulled into the game but telling people to get cancer, off themselves, racial slurs etc, are obviously uncalled for. It&#039;s just as easy for someone with a &quot;stone&quot; mind to tell you to &quot;shrug it off&quot; or tell you &quot;it&#039;s just words&quot; or &quot;you&#039;re too sensitive&quot; when they or others are the ones actually causing the issues. \n\nBut let&#039;s flip it around.\nIf you take a look at the discussions in player behavior, for the most part, it&#039;s people **bitching** about how unfair the ban they received was. These people are literally in the boards posting discussions on a game they were banned from about how mad they are, or how long they had their accounts, the money they put in, fuck this game, and whatever else these ironically sensitive players are fuming about.\n&quot;get over it&quot;\n&quot;It&#039;s just a game&quot; \n&quot;this doesn&#039;t have any actual impact on your life physically&quot;\n&quot;**stop being so sensitive**&quot;\n\nI don&#039;t care. You, and/or anyone else with a fake sob story on how &quot;You quite literally told a kid to kill himself in chat, but question why you were banned&quot; can stay banned. These are the people that:\n\nflame you when you don&#039;t go in with them to 1v5 with them sitting at 10-20% health.\nGet mad that you fed the enemies a kill when you were dived by three people under your own turret.\n**ignore reason!** You can&#039;t say shit to them, because when you have a God complex, why would anyone else&#039;s help/criticism matter??\nquite literally believe that this game is &quot;Team Death-match&quot; first, and objectives later.\nact like they&#039;ve lost a paycheck over a bad match. (Fucking get up and do something else if you&#039;re going to be that angry, and &quot;sensitive&quot;)\n\nI suffer from sal syndrome\n(Save-A-Life Syndrome has carried with me since the days of Nazi Zombies. Running in to help someone who foolishly downed themselves in a crowd, and I go from doing fine to getting game over&#039;d because I tried to be helpful without thinking clearly)\n\nSo if the enemy team is putting your coffin together, and I&#039;m near, 9 out of 10, I&#039;m going to be asking them if they finished putting mine together as well.\nI can&#039;t even break this habit, because if I let you run in alone, due to {{champion:11}} {{champion:157}}  apparently being &quot;UNSTOPPABLE!&quot;, and I just run, I get blamed for why you do it every other time thereafter. I simply become your damned scapegoat. WE want our allies to know that we are on your side, but once you get to the stabbing, you start truthfully being the reason the team is falling apart. \n\nThere shouldn&#039;t be any reason for a person to get so pissed off at how bad a game, or how bad a person is doing. Fucking reinforce them!\nShoot them tips, not bullets! The minute you light a fire on that ship, the enemies only need to watch. Some of the people in this community are so fucking defensive, and ready to lunge at everyone&#039;s necks, I&#039;ve caused pandemonium on enemy teams just from turning them against each other!\n&quot;Why isn&#039;t your jungle ganking for you?&quot;\n&quot;Wow, our [INSERT NAME OF FED ALLY] is pretty stocked on kills rn&quot;\n\nEven criticism gets them going, and asking for reports on each other, it&#039;s stupid!\n&quot;Your tank should stop lingering in the back, and be the front line.&quot;\nSo many of the people asking Riot to &quot;fix their damned game&quot;\nThat expectation is about as magical, and out of this world as expecting the community to stop being so terrible. If you&#039;re one of those people:\nYou want change? \nStart with yourself.\nNo one&#039;s ever willing to &quot;/mute all&quot; when they&#039;re mad at someone who may have a reasonable explanation for why they died.\nBut they want the one they flame to mute **them** so they could keep flaming without being told they&#039;re wrong. Take your own damned advice It&#039;s nice I promise!\nI&#039;ve told people I was &quot;muting all nothing personal.&quot; If I do bad, for the most part, post-chat is tame, and the sensitive hot-head snapped on someone else who responded because they&#039;d be able to help him with his flame addiction. \n\nThen we have this:\nIntentionally- deliberately; on purpose.\n&quot;I didn&#039;t do it intentionally&quot;\nsynonyms:\tdeliberately, on purpose, purposely, purposefully, by design, knowingly, wittingly, consciously\n\nI know these types of people aren&#039;t ignorant of the meaning, but posting it will quite literally mean nothing to them!\nInting, or *Please refer to the above term pulled from the Merriam Webster Dictionary* isn&#039;t:\nSomeone who dies too much\na bad match\nbeing unskilled\nbeing dove on by the enemy under their own turret\n**trying something new**\nand even rushing objective, although that&#039;s a debatable topic, as they are quite literally intending to take out obj, the byproduct of their failure is death.\n\nIt&#039;s so easy for some people to sit behind their monitors, and talk shit to someone completely random, and all the candy-ass players that do this, and respond with:\n&quot;it&#039;s just words&quot; You&#039;re hypocrites in the sense you believe it to be nothing serious, yet you lose the sticks up your arses over a banned account. \nIf that&#039;s you, be mad, it&#039;s only words remember?\nI genuinely want this game to be in a better state, and I&#039;m not asking for kumbayah on the battlefield, just some sense. We can&#039;t even get new players to pick the game up, and hold on to it without some pyromaniac running them off. Help them! Add them as friends, and offer to assist them in voice-chat. give them tips, and even ask them to watch you play. Explain why you do what you did. give to them the importance of objectives, and cs over trying to kill every champ that is just walking out of their fucking house. The reward is so much sweeter I promise! I guarantee Riot would be more willing to listen to disgruntled players that are at least on board, than toxic players running up the walls, and spitting fire. \n\nThis discussion will most likely disappear into the abyss of others, but I just needed to get this of my chest. \nWhen you&#039;re toxic, you&#039;re one-sided.\nYou want change? Change your narcissistic views first.\nYou want to win? Lift the stragglers up. (And no, I don&#039;t mean on your back, but with enforcement to let them know you want to win ie-if they need help, try walking with them, instead of just pulling them up from underneath the bus you threw them under, then throwing them over your back.) Carrying your team isn&#039;t always the best way to win. Being thrown over an asscheek with your face being draped in what&#039;s being spewed out doesn&#039;t better that person, it only paints you out to be an account that person or team assist on moving to the trash.","replies":[{"poster":"MuminsAreGreat","date":"2019-01-19T04:12:20.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So much focus on stop being angry etc.\nI will be very honest here... I would flame Riot for what they do or don´t in a heart beat becouse it is very different to attack a company and to attack a person. I would however NEVER EVER say ANYTHING negative about someones gameplay even if they are flaming me for the same reason.\nI will however refuse being forced to stay and try to do my best with these people. If my ADC flames me... I will mute him/her and go do what the hell I want.\nIm extremly angry with Riot however to the point where Im not playing the game becouse I would flame Riot so hard they would perma ban me in a few games.\nSo why did I rant on about this?\nBecouse the community cant be changed like that, the community is not a hive minded unit. The commuity comes in ALL ages ALL genders and so on. The demands and dreams for and in this game is as many as there are players.\nI grow more and more convinced every day that to stop what you are mad about will take a complete removal of the entire chat system or extremly enforced rules by Riot.\nAnd I really wish they do not decide to go in any of those directions. With the chat removal thing being most likley I think. Im still furious that we were robbed of a game that used to reward team work and even demanded it the first seasons (can´t remember when they removed \"Refuse to communicate\" report.\nEven though I do not think people should be punished for that I really miss the days of teamwork.\n5 players that actually picked team oriented picks, someone actually played a tank or what the team needed and not just YASUO OR FEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nEverything now seems to be built around pro players and LCS and that comes with low marginals, alot of anger from \"normal\" people AND 99999999999999 dps / on most champions to keep it exciting and make sure players die to the left and right.\nThe only thing this accomplished was to turn every player into either a feeding machine or a champion so snowballed you die from just knowing that champion is on the map.\n\nAnd here we are. I suggest if you want to change the community you should start with Riot.. the community in itself holds no organized power or common goal it is a unit that by numbers over time can give hints and clues of the games health but I think thats about it.

There is a lot of anger, and disdain towards players from players. I myself am also taking steps to better people in a match. I may get the occasional \"stfu\" from an ally, but if I can get my team to work with me, that player ends up ostracizing themselves, and afk farming. They earn their report, and we all move on. I guess I'm hoping to see a community that helps players grow.\n\nSome of us have had accounts for years, and have plenty of experience to teach/give newer players. If people aren't on board with winning, (And by that, I mean enforcing their loss by turning their match into debate class about how he said she said) then they get banned. Honestly, no one loads a game up with paperwork in hand, ready to begin a session in court. \nI play this game to win, yes. But the one thing toxic players seem to forget to do is remember that it is just a game. Enjoy!\nI don't play ranked, and it baffles me how triggered these toxic players get over a loss in CASUALS! it wasn't just 20-30 minutes of that persons time, but everyone. We are all affected as a team.","replies":[{"poster":"MuminsAreGreat","date":"2019-01-21T07:06:00.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completly see your point and agree with you... can´t say win/loose ever been important to me but to play off loosing games where you can´t really do anything makes me so bored. angry and tilted to the point where I want to leave the game instead of trying to motivate or mute and play on with toxic players (this is what I think in game, not what I do btw) is probably more the product of me playing the game too much and too long rather than my actual oppinion on how you play LoL honorably and fair. Over the years we have all picked up so many tilting memories that is so easilly triggered in game I think.\nI mean some situations makes me insta snap not becouse it is called for but becouse a very bad memory of the same or a similar situation.\nAlso I dont claim to be better than anyone else but from experience in the end of a season when you really know all the math and mechanics well the meta and the items you kind of develop an ability to read what will happen in the game and when that plays out like you predict and the game is going poorly I really feel like a hostage. Especially since I play support with a rather heavy focus on enchanters I usually do not have enough power to turn it around no matter what I do so. That is a huge rage factor for me... not that my team wants to win or think that we can but becouse it gives me a feeling that Im being punished by everyone for nothing. Like if I leave I will be punished by Riot but if I stay I will be punished by the game itself.\nAs I said that is a played too long factor.\nFor the flame part I think it is in many cases an evil cirkle that just goes round n round.\nSince I dont flame team mates for mistakes or their plays or decissions myself I cant tell what causes it from the beginning but I know that people that do not flame but rather focus on what they CAN do in the game and not what the team mates CAN`T do will climb so much faster and easier than the person who flames and blames someone else. But since that person is angry already he or she will not climb or have a very positive impact in his/her own games and will have a probably rather bad experience even in the games he or she is winning. And that will cause the person to keep going round n round n round xD\nI think it is an extremly difficult thing to give up flaming... its like smoking or any other behaviour or habits.\nIt could even take long theraphy sessions and proffesional help to break such learned and trained behaviours even if the person really wants to quit.\nThere are ofc no way of making people stop flaming as a community becouse of alot of factors but we can however learn to play around it and avoid it and stuff like that so I request more in game solutions for it and more education on the subject maybe even a helping program to break this habit of flaming becouse a ban only tells you that you did something wrong not how that person should break the habbit. If punishments helped people to rehabilitate prisons wouldnt be overpopulated either. Not that I wish to remove the bans just saying it´s something to think about. Also I think Riot reasons like we cannot stop flame so we ignore them and ban the obvious and try to make a game for the people who doesnt flame instead. Which is the right decition if this is the case, it is only a speculation so I don´t know how they reason exactly.\nOne thing that works well for me versus flame is to play with someone who makes me laugh and talks to me in chat or in headphones that keeps me distracted from automatic negative thoughts about the game or other players and that leads to less anger even if other people flame.\nCame up with just about the only thing that could possibly cause me to flame another player to the point of viable reports against me, I cant stand when flamers gang up on someone in a very cowardly way.

If you have played for a while, you know this will happen. It is extremely quick for you to experience this in League of Legends.\nIf you refuse to change that behavior, you are trolling your team.\nMuch the same as if you are a support and repeatedly steal your ADCs CS.\nYou can say it is only a game or only norms but that is a toxic statement. You are causing toxicity because it is an antagonistic statement to those that want to actually win. Keep in mid, this might be a game but it is a /competitive/ game. The goal is to destroy the enemy Nexus, not to make your teammates not have fun.\n\nThat is not to say that people should tell you nasty stuff but if you are doing this repeatedly it really is deliberate. It does not take more than a cursory check of a video online or even playing a handful of games to figure out these things are not what you do in the game. It is the same as if your tank is so afraid of dying (because of their KDA obviously), they hide in the JG to pick up kills rather than tank damage and try to CC for the carries.\n\nThese traits, along with a variety of things that Riot has done to the game causes a lot of the toxicity in the game.\n\nThere is no collective \"we\" when it comes to wasting someone's time. For you, it might be a game that does not matter at all. I suggest playing a non-competitive game to be honest if this is the case. However, for some, they want to win. That is the point of having a game with Victor and Defeat. Especially when you receive better rewards for Victory. And some people only have time for a few games. Say you waste 45minutes of their time by saying \"its only norms\" while you play Morgana and steal CS from the ADC while using Spellthief and constantly feeding a lane that you cannot safely trade in any longer but you keep going in and dying for literally no reason. And that person had enough time for two normal length games. They try to forfeit at 15 or 20 because they know they cannot win with players on their team like this. But you refuse because \"its only a game.\"\n\nYou are deliberately (yes, this term is used correctly) wasting their time. Time is not just League of Legends. For some people it is a lot of money. For some people, it is everything. For others, they have all the time in the world to waste. But if it is only a game, and only norms and does not matter and you only enjoy playing to be playing, why not immediately ff at 15 because you will be playing another game immediately?\n\nNot saying you specifically do that. This is a generalized \"you.\"\nBut the point remains. League of Legends is not beginner friendly and is not made for truly casual play. Maybe ARAM and Nexus Blitz but definitely not Summoner's Rift (though it is headed that way if they keep up). There are too many things to learn and know for this to be a game that could ever be truly casual.","replies":[{"poster":"Stand Alone Wolf","date":"2019-01-24T11:28:43.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with a few of your points, but not all. \nSome players are actually just ignorant, and rather than others help them get better, players will rely on just being outright toxic to them instead, then wonder why the player they were flaming went from not understanding/doing poorly, to straight intentionally running down lane, and standing under enemy turret till gg.

They then proceed to feed intentionally and/or start flaming all game.\n\nAs for wasting the trolls time. No, that is their intention. They have fun with it.
