It would be replaced.  The power comes from her connection to Nagakabouros, the Eye of God just helps her focus.","replies":[{"poster":"Stand Alone Wolf","date":"2015-11-26T03:18:29.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH!

Christianity is a community-oriented religion, so it needs a strong central figurehead to unite that community; with that in mind, it has a lot of built-in reverence for images of Jesus. Illaoi's religion, on the other hand is much more individually focused; because of that, it's all about the individual's relationship with Nagakabouros. If that relationship doesn't require reverence for a physical object, so be it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2015-11-26T08:09:46.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stand Alone Wolf,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Go5ya3eE,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-25T10:46:02.561+0000)\n>\n> Okay, I&#039;m not a religious nut, nor do I feel some negative way about this, but If she worships her God Nagakabouros, then why is she captain morganin on an Idol of him?
