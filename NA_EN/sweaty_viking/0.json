I do not get bugsplat reports, it simply puts the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" bar on my screen and freezes me there. I had to manually exit the game and then reconnect twice in one match. I was able to reconnect no problem, but could not nail down what was making me crash. It is not my internet connection; I was able to run youtube music and a discord application in the background. This appears to be something to do with riot servers, so anything you can do would be greatly appreciated! \r\n\r\nAny others who have had this issue RECENTLY, please comment below so the RIOT staff can get us all in one swoop. :)\r\n\r\nYour friendly sweaty scientist, {{item:3071}} {{champion:36}} {{item:3071}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T05:00:18.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Checked our records and our servers are just fine! Bear in mind that servers for each site or service you visit are in different geolocations, therefore routing issues to one server may not show up to another. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings on your network are good before we check your route.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
