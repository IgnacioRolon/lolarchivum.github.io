People can be way to negative and even int or afk, and that deserves punishment. but banter with another person, to then take away what myself and MANY others have been working for, seems so incredibly stupid. and naturally the only people to agree with me is level 1 and below honors, and people to disagree is any one above that. The honor system to me, is just stupid, and a useless mechanic which helps nothing,  at all. People will be toxic, and thats how its going to be.","replies":[{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2018-10-11T02:36:42.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"i feel like getting punished for verbal toxicity should only lower your honor 2 or 3 tiers down, not all the way to honor 0","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-10-11T02:46:06.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't first offenses for chat misbehavior drop your Honor to Level 1, and then afterwards to Level 0?

Always been above 2 since last year.\nBecause I enjoy all the rewards.\n\nAlso, I really dislike seeing a game ruined due to someone's attitude.\nI've been playing this game for 10 years, I've learned from perceptive, the game is a lot less fun when you get into the negative aspect of the game. That's dealing with players intentionally feeding, not being productive, not being active to help the team because they're far too busy fighting with other players. When an argument starts in the game, players tend to give up and much rather end the game just so they can report people. \n\nSo yea, not only being toxic leads to nothing but ending with a ban, it can lead people to lose a lot more games. Double negative. Not worth it. So I much rather see players follow the rules as I do, so we can just enjoy the game. I'd much rather encourage players to win or keep any negative thoughts to myself in games. So I can take any advantage to win and make the game enjoyable for myself as much as possible.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2018-10-11T04:22:06.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://imgur.com/CpYvMeW \n\nas beeing honnor  lvl 5 (for  all of  the s8/s7) \n\nits pretty easy getting it  !!\n\nJust dont give up ! \n\nBe positive  !  \n\n(if everybody honnors  random people  u still get the  xp   from it    ,,,, soo take it  and  move to the next game  ,,,, most of the times i play all alone cause more  honnor  xp )\n\n\n>I'am toxic  \n\nLets changed thaT !~   \n(u mast become  positive  ! :D)\n\n\n> but sometimes keeping your mouth shut to people isnt possible for me\n\nwhy not ?
