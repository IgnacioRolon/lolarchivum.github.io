It's really frustrating because it forces me to play draft pick just for me to have a chance to get the role I want. My friends really like blind pick and want me to play with them but if I do, I'll always end up joining late in champ select, not even seeing who called what lane because the client freezes for so long before I can do anything. Does anyone else have this problem? If anyone knows how to solve this issue or have any ideas to how it even started, please send feedback. I don't lag in game or have any other issues with the client except this one where it freezes up before I enter champ select. Thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T23:19:17.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you accept a match, the server is grabbing everyone together into the same group.
