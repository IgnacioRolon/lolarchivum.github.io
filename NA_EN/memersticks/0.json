Tell them to wait for your ult. You can't tell me your team ALWAYS fights in a less than ideal location for your ult. There are very few locations where you can't get a good fiddle ult off. Just don't group with the team. What I mean by that is if your 4 team mates are pushing down middle lane, stay off to the side and ult in when someone on your team engages, or if you have zhonyas, wait for the team to group up tightly and ult in. Ult in throw a silence and a fear and once they focus you, zhonyas. They have no idea what to do and their team goes into chaos while your team just cleans up. I can't tell you how many team fights I've won with that tactic. Just practice your ult positioning and you'll get good at it. Add me in game if you'd like and I'll play a normal with you and give you some tips.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gallium Yttrium","date":"2015-02-23T08:23:54.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to vote fiddlesticks from personal experience. I was placed into bronze 3 this season and carried myself back into silver with fiddle. I've got a 70% win rate with him right now and am on a 7 win streak. Fiddle can literally 1v5 if you get a good ult off and you're fed. I had multiple games where my team fed but I did well and managed to carry my team until they caught back up. One big key to my success is that I would get my team to group early since fiddle has an awesome team fight. Especially once you get your zhonyas. When it comes down to it though, the easiest champ to carry out of bronze with is the one you're best with. Try out fiddle, vi, j4, and any of the champions you'd like and see what fits your play style.","replies":[{"poster":"Memersticks","date":"2015-02-23T21:36:19.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a Fiddle main, problem is most times i play fiddle my team either tries to fight when my ult is on cd or try to fight in an area where i cant get a good ult off.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-02-23T05:56:28.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi, J4 and the old standby of \"stomping bronzies\" dunkmaster Yi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"COWmanLord","date":"2015-02-23T07:17:27.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi is an ideal pick here because she can snowball when fed, be tanky and have damage, can pull off very strong ganks easily, and isn't banned as much as J4 is. Fiddle and amumu are also both good, just more teamfight oriented rather than engage and carry on your own. J4 is very strong right now, but his incredibly high ban rate makes him difficult to actually get to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-23T06:53:09.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:254}} \n\nMy winrate skyrocketed once I started using her in ranked, she's just so damn versatile.\n\nEnemy overextended?

What if you mess up? Lol then it reverse snowballs and you are useless.\n\nYou need a good jungler that snowballs, but also has strong utility when behind. You need to be both tanky, and do high damage to solo wreck carries. You need gapclosers, wall jumps and CC.\n\nThe only champs that fulfill those conditions are Vi and J4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frank The Dank","date":"2015-02-23T04:54:09.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you just want a straight up get 20+ kills a game carry than play kha because he snowballs very well but that only works if you know what you're doing of course.","replies":[]}]}
