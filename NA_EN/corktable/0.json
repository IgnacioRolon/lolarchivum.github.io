Again though \"they started it\" doesn't work here. From the [IFS FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-): \n\n>**WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!**\nSimply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\nReports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nUltimately though I must ask you to post your entire unedited reform card if you truly wish to discuss your punishment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-06-20T13:20:52.059+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are only punished for what you say, not what others say.
