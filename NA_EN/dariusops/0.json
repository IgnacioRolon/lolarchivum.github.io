Essentially, packet loss means that some of the data is getting lost between your network and our servers. Sometimes it's just caused by your ISP sending your connection through a crappy route, so it can't get to our servers all in one piece. \n\nIf you goto our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and toss in your latest game logs that had that moonwalking, it will tell us for sure if you've got any packet loss. Take a screenshot using something Gyazo or Imgur and link it here for me to see as well!","replies":[{"poster":"Ultima Weaponz","date":"2017-05-08T08:52:37.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since last patch i also noticed some sort of packet loss lag , thing is that i don't have any packet loss in my log & my ping is stable at 38. feelsbad","replies":[]}]}]}
