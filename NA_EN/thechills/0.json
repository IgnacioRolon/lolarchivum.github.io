I do play mostly ARAM, but I&#039;ve also been playing League since shortly after it released and I have a plethora of champs in all different capacities (I got the collector&#039;s starter pack a long time ago, for example). I see people downvoted into oblivion mostly on these baseless assumptions and dismissive arguments, I&#039;d like to hold a proper discussion. Anyway, to the meat.\n\nI&#039;m going to take a long hard look at Mark/Dash, what I think Riot&#039;s goals were for the summoner spell and why I believe they&#039;ve missed the mark (no pun intended... okay maybe a little). First, let&#039;s start with some history, you can skip ahead to the next paragraph if not interested but I want to cover all bases. ARAM started as a custom only player made mode of gameplay where people would queue up random champs and agree to not leave the center lane in SR, after it gained popularity Riot eventually added more support for the mode, eventually turning it into an official game mode with the inclusion of the howling abyss and some balance changes to the game to better suit the mode. For a while now the mode has existed and had a few balance changes over the years but nothing really radical that would change the whole mode. Ranged champs for a while have had an advantage against melee champs if they were unable to survive to the point that they could get enough tank to wade into fights and initiate. Heal and sustain champs also continue to be something of a problem in the mode as well. Riot recently added a new summoner spell, Mark, and a few more items to try and give melee champs a better chance at surviving the early game poke barrage, an attempt to level the playing field a little more.\n\nNow let&#039;s take a look at Mark/Dash and compare it to other similar summoner spells, just the facts and no spin:\n\n* Mark/Dash- 20s cd, range 2500 skill shot, speed appears to be roughly 1200 (I have no hard numbers so I will use Morganna&#039;s dark binding speed), if a target is hit with mark they take 200 true damage (max rank) and the spell user may activate it again within 3s to instantly teleport to that target. Ignores spell shields.\n\n* Ignite- 210s cd, range 600 targeted instant, 410 true damage total (max rank) over a 5s duration, cuts healing in half for the duration of the spell.\n\n* Flash- 300s cd, range 425 smart cast, moves the target in the direction of the cursor instantly.\n\nWell, let&#039;s get some comparisons here. In the time it takes to do a second ignite, assuming all mark skill shots hit, you have a potential of 10 marks dishing out 2000 true damage to an ignite&#039;s 410, I can even be generous and say you only hit a third of your skill shots and that is still roughly 600 true damage- mark also has 2500 range which is 1900 more than ignite. As for flash, you get 15 mark attempts in the span of flash coming off cd and the range is 2500, which is 2075 more range than flash and it deals damage. That doesn&#039;t seem very balanced? Does it? Even as a skill shot that can be dodged there&#039;s a pretty good chance you&#039;ll land at least one mark in 10-15 attempts.\n\nNow let&#039;s compare mark to some other champion abilities:\n \n* Piercing Arrow- Varus has the longest range non-ultimate damaging ability in the game (I believe, I did some research but please correct me if I am wrong)  clocking in at 1900 speed, 1625 range when fully charged- From base to max level: 16 to 8s cd, costs 70 to 90 mana, 10 to 157 (+100% AD) phys damage.\n \n* Javelin Toss- Nidalee is second I could find with a 1500 range Javelin toss, had trouble finding info on the speed though it appears to be about 1300- From base to max level: 6s cd, 50 to 90 mana, 150 to 450 (+120% ap) MAX magical damage (50-150 (+40%) minimum damage). \n\n* Mark- has a range of 2500 and rough travel speed of about 1200, 20s cd, costs no resources, 30 to 200 true damage.\n\nIt beats the best damage range ability in range by about 875 which is more than half the total range of Piercing Arrow and doesn&#039;t cost any resources. Mark is, however, also significantly slower than Piercing Arrow and deals less damage (more than likely, only the most extreme amount of armor would mitigate enough to tip the balance, which is unlikely), the 20s cd is also still more than double the time of a Piercing Arrow cd. Mark isn&#039;t going to be beating Piercing Arrow for poke or anything, but it does have some advantages over it. Not sure Riot ever intended summoner spells to be close to the power of champion abilities, but this one is so far the closest we&#039;ve ever seen.\n\nA few other notes I&#039;d like to add: \n\n* Mark makes for the safest bush checking in the game, out ranging all other abilities and costing no resources. Sure, a poke champ could just poke into a bush but at the very least most champs had a chance to be poked back as they approached- the only thing that can counter a mark check is another mark or moving out of the bush, mark has a modest hitbox (I don&#039;t have any stats on it, sadly) but still decently sized enough to cover most of the bush from my experimenting (especially at the right angle) and can even cover both bushes because of the range. \n\n* The counter to being mark/dashed is either avoiding the skill shot, champ escape abilities (if you have one), or flash- however you can mark 15 times in the span of a flash cd. It becomes increasingly difficult to avoid Mark skillshots if the whole enemy team has it and even if mark misses you, it can still hit a minion allowing the marker to close in and initiate. \n\n* Mark gives champs balanced around initiating (champion kits that are focused on their ability to close in to maximize their potential or ultimates that require them to be close) a 20s cd free ability with range greater than any other champ normal ability to do so- for a good number of champs (fiddles, alistar, kennen, galio, amumu, for a few examples) this imbalances them. Their kits weren't built around having an extra gap closer of this range or cd.\n\nAh, speaking of balance, this is a bit of a side track but I&#039;d also like to address the attitude that ARAM is not competitive and is a goof off mode. First off, it is a game of a team of players fighting against another team of players which already means it is inherently a competitive game. Secondly, if it were truly intended to be a goof off mode then why would Riot ever go through so many attempts to balance out the mode or make it more balanced so most champs stood a better chance against each other? Healing got nerfed, ARAM specific values have been adjusted several times, items are allowed or not to promote balance, melee champs (at the base game level, not ARAM specific) are given extra survivability and typically some abilities to their kit to allow them to wade into a fight (there are also many items that they can get to aid them). It is not impossible for a non-poke team to beat a poke team in ARAM- it is hard, pokers have a slight advantage, but a smart team with good tank can roll a team with no tank. Anyway, I&#039;m ranting a bit now, moving on.\n\nI agree ARAM melee guys could have used a small boost. Something to help them out when facing an overwhelming poke advantage. The problem with Mark is that it went too far- the cd is too low, the damage not really needed, and the range greater than most champ abilities. It completely outshines the other summoner abilities AND can be combined with other ones. Here are some suggestions to help bring ARAM back to a healthy more balanced state:\n\n1. Increase Mark&#039;s cd, lower or remove the damage, decrease the range. It will still be a great ability, right now it just has too many awesome things going for it.\n2.  Make Mark ARAM a separate mode. This is less likely, as it will involve more work, but those who really like mark as it is now would be able to continue to play with it in the game. ARAM has been a long established game mode now and is fairly popular, to suddenly throw in a new summoner that radically changes the way the game is played was a bit extreme.\n3. Change mark to an item. Make it an item that you have to purchase and something you actually have to make sacrifices for, this would be a huge step in making it more balanced- but also, again, more work for Riot.\n4. Remove mark, create some other way for melees to counter poke. Not ideal, I think a lot of people like the idea of mark, it just needs to be balanced better. As it is now it is All Random All Mark.\n\nWell, I think that&#039;s about it. Thanks for reading! I just want to see a great and balanced ARAM for everyone. I switched over to mostly playing ARAM after I got tired of the 10-15 minute last hitting grind of SR. I really like the instant team fight action, getting into what I feel is the meat of the game faster. I also enjoy the difficulty of playing new champs and trying to beat the odds of a random selection. I don&#039;t want to see the strategy of ARAM reduced to a giant snowball fight :)\n\nEDIT: Here are a few other threads on the topic discussing the matter-\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/kXUYYvh8-feedback-for-snowball-implementation-in-aram\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/rdp3JhX4-markdash-feedback-from-a-2600-aram-player\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/TjUAJgrj-poll-markdash-snowball-survey\n","replies":[{"poster":"MiniJunkie","date":"2015-05-03T04:46:25.157+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"~ 3000 games of ARAM here, and a ton of money spent on skins to use in it as well.

I think what's more reasonable is a 20-30 second cooldown if you don't dash, and a 60-90 second cooldown if you do.

Riot doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same either. The same goes for a lot of people who play ARAM a lot, but simply aren't you. You can't presume to speak for all dedicated ARAM players. Sure some agree with you, but many others don't.\n\nWe don't feel Mark/Dash is a new evil. Nor do I personally feel the poke way is the old evil (except Fiddlesticks, seriously Dark Wind is so not ok in ARAM).\n\nAs to which champions got better/worse I feel like honestly all win rate data on such things aside from massive outliers is pretty useless. There are so many factors involved obviously, but another key is that for a lot of players the point isn't just winning.\n\nWhen I get a champion that's bad at ARAM (even with Mark/Dash) that's a challenge. It's a chance for me to learn how to fix that through play and/or my build. Can I talk my teammates into working better with my champ? If a certain champ is bad at ARAM, WHY IS IT BAD? I wanna know and understand that and see how I can translate that knowledge into winning more, in ARAM and SR. And of course the opposite too. Why is Lux so good in ARAM and yet not in SR? How can I use that?\n\nPlus all that challenge is fun! The uphill battle is a challenge you can rise to. The champ you've never played before? A new opportunity to learn. The perfect ARAM god comp vs random bad stuff? A chance to show off and see just how hard you can snowball! I don't own Varus, I haven't played him but once in months, but because he was free recently I got him in ARAM and got a pentakill.\n\nAs a picture I love says.... \"Fuck your shit, fun things are fun!\" Know what else is fun?

Mark/Dash is an attempt to balance them somewhat within ARAM while being a lot of fun.\n\nIf you stand by your turret and/or allies and only one enemy hits with their Mark and goes in, you destroy them. It's not hard. Respect that the mark is on you if you get hit. It's really not that hard to deal with most of the time. Sure sometimes it'll catch you where you can't do anything about it but die, that's the point. Other summoner spells do that too.\n\nSome people are trying to act like it doesn't exist until someone kills them with it (in these discussions). That's not the reality. When I Dash sometimes it works out great, sometimes it was a bad dive and we're punished. I try to only do it when it's the right time but sometimes my team all turn around and run just as I hit Dash and then I die and then they're screwed because they're down a person.

This does give advantages to certain champions but when you put 5v5 in that one lane this can change quickly depending on group comps.  My point is that each champion has a set of abilities that make them unique and work to one whole style of play.  For example, there is a reason Yi doesn't have a ranged attack.  There is a reason Varus is squishy.  ARAM on it's own doesn't change these principals.\n\nFirst step would be taking the damage of Mark/Dash out.  Second would be to have the Dash automatic after n seconds if not activated.  Then put the CD up to a reasonable level.  Or, if fun and excitement is the key, make all of the summoner skills short CDs.\n\nTruth is, any change made can come with a \"just learn to play with it and adapt\" mentality by the players.
