It's the age old scenario of, A kid hit me at school. So i defended myself and hit him back. We both get suspended. Was I wrong to defend myself? \n\nDave Chappelle said it best in his new standup. He wants to quit comedy because the world has become a bunch of pussies. Everyone is so ready to get offended at the slightest shit. \n\nBy making this a closed forum you not only discourage actual teamwork, you reward people who play with friends and clearly bully other players. \n\nThe fact that I sometimes get an \"instant feedback report\" letting me know that my reports resulted in a player getting punished, but dont always (apparently) but every report gets looked at (apparently, but lets face it, we both know thats an outright lie and thats the real reason riot fails to provide any transparancy in the matter and instead cites \"private information\") \n\nRiot literally makes it so that the only way to not get banned is basically just to mute all and be silent which makes it feel more like playing with bots....really terrible bots....than it does with actual people. Eventually you find some people that aren't completely uncarriable and you add them as friends and switch to third party apps like Discord or Curse to use VoIP because you're terrible game has no VoIP like almost every other platform which makes for another case and point. Why? \n\nIt seems like the only reason not to have VoIP built into the client is A) to save on bandwidth for your servers which is basically just Riot being a bunch of cheap bastards or B) so that people are forced to use text-chat which is traceable and easy to build a penalty algorithm on. Which means more dishonor points. Which means no loot chests. Which means players have to spend more money to get champions/skins/etc.. \n\nWhich, I mean lets face it. Riot's ultimate goal is to make this the least FreeToPlay-FreeToPlay MOBA ever made. \n\nThe company has been run terrible from its inception and whoever leads their community management team obviously cares nothing for people and hires some of the shittiest human beings on the planet to be moderators and then just overwhelms them with bullshit until they become apathetic ban-hammer-happy rage bots waiting to fuck over someone for that time they got picked on in high school for being a nerd 10 years ago. E-Thugging at its finest.\n\nIts a garbage system and anyone that steps back and looks at it agrees.\n\nits the reason why the LoL community is LITERALLY the worst of any game I have ever played in the last 25years.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-05T03:16:54.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are not required to notify you whether or not a player you reported was punished.

Like you're just making shit up now. It's clearly an automated message. And if it was true that even 1 report \"triggered a review\" a lot more people would have chat bans. A LOT MORE. so what you're saying seems like a clear lie.\n\ntell me im wrong","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-01-05T03:55:16.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Who review these? if at all? or is it simply, 4 people report someone and they get a ban and it does it automatically?\n\nYour punishment is based on the *content* of your chats, not merely the fact that you were reported by one or more people. All it takes is one report to trigger a review of your chats in a game. Yes it is automatic. Not it is not reviewed individually by Riot.\n\n> I report people every time i get flamed and rarely do I see a \"an action has been taken against a player you reported\" pop up. when they literally flamed me for entire game.\n\nThere is no guarantee that you will receive any notification for punishment related to your reports.\n\n> please review and lift ban. Definitely didn't say anything to deserve it after going through chat logs.\n\nIf you wish to have help understanding the most likely reason(s) why you were punished, feel free to post your unedited chat logs in the [Player Behavior board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) and the regulars there would be happy to review it with you.\n\n> and if you're NOT going to give me an appeal and take off the ban.

You, and you alone, are responsible for what you say. What others say has no bearing on whether or not you are punished. If you reported them, it would trigger a review of their game, and the IFS would handle their behavior accordingly. If you didn't report them (and no one else did) the IFS has no way of knowing that it was questionable behavior. You can send in a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to report someone in a game. Riot support will not confirm whether they took action or not based on your ticket, though.","replies":[]}]}
