So how about a Support Only Mission?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, ok Riot, you've given the midlaners, toplaners, junglers and adcs a nice mission for the World's Championship event: Courage-Seize Your Glory (get a double kill, get a killing spree, win a game on summoner's rift with 15 kills and/or assists).  \n\nSo are you going to giving us support mains a mission?  How about something like: place 15 wards, buy 5 control wards; heal or shield for over 15k; take under 10 minions in a game; and avoid going crazy while the damage carries go and kill chase while the turrets fall, objectives get ignored and the waves lay unclaimed, etc., etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T01:42:26.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the 'support mission' you were asking for is.....\n\nCourage - Vision Master\n- Get a killing blow on 3 enemy wards\n- Win 2 games where you placed a control ward in each game\n\n\nIt's maybe not as difficult as you were hoping, but you did already complete it!","replies":[]}]}
