This leaves a certain amount of consistency in the game and still allows for diversity.\n\nAlso, the majority of the player base do not play marksman so of course most of them will want to nerf them. In a game of chess there is a piece that is the strongest, the queen. Marksman just happen to be the queen in league. Other pieces either want to protect their queen at all costs or take out the other sides queen. Once one side loses a queen they typically win that fight as should be the case. There should be annobvious goal in a team fight, and if everyone in a team fight is of equal strength and value the game devolves in random crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-07-14T16:47:32.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mast3rShake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EEE8K2Xy,comment-id=0003000300000000,timestamp=2018-07-14T14:11:08.779+0000)\n> \n> I think there are two classes that should be mandatory, tanks and marksman. \n\nwhy? because **you** believe so?\n\nmarksmen are just one type of carry next to skirmishers, ap carries,  juggernauts, certain divers. they all have the same role of dealing sustained damage with different advantages and disadvantages attached to their playstile.\n\nthe fact that marksmen took and for the most part are still taking a permanent spot on a team severely cripples other carry types viability.\n\nwhen marksmen are strong enough to be mandatory, teamcomps built around one marksman are typically more successful than teamcomps with one marksman and a second carry in another position. because its easier to enable, protect and support one carry with 4 people, than 2 carries with 3 people.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-07-13T20:20:51.297+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Now hold on a second here.\n\nSo, you say that marksmen's only job is to be tank killers.

And bruisers initially were not in the beginning supposed to be able to overcome tanks that easily - hence, the jungler's role was to help them win lane.  (I like to think it is one reason why the complaining toxic Riven main meme came into being.)\n\nBefore the Cleaver, lest we forget, it was a case that a tank could beat a bruiser if the bruiser was stupid enough to go toe to toe while they were in lane.  The jungler rose in significance in getting the Rivens, Dariuses, etc., out of lane so they could wreak their havoc on other lanes.  But when the Cleaver was introduced (see https://www.thescoreesports.com/news/13511-how-did-this-happen-league-of-cleavers for more), nearly all elements of tactics and strategy were thrown out the window - LoL became a game run by a single item.  (And to be honest, we are nearly in that state again - except it is not one item, rather it is the same effect caused by that item - the rise of a \"true damage\" meta.)\n\nUnfortunately, that brief interval brought in quite a few bruiser players who love their respective champs (and I can't blame them really).
