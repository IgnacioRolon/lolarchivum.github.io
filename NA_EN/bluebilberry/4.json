I've been using the new client since the Alpha release and it has hardly had its bugs fixed. There are bugs on the client that have been here since its release, almost 3 years, and hasn't been patched one single time. I'm not surprised the client always crashes every other patch now. They honestly need to cut their losses and remake the whole client, because they clearly cannot fix this one.\n\nWelcome to Season 10, y'all.","replies":[]}]}
