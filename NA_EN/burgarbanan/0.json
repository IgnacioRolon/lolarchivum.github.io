I just had a day off work and i thought it would be great to play some league. But as soon as i wake up the next morning and turn on league, the login is stuck on \"authenticating\" I have had this problem in the past, but it solved itself, this time its not. Is this something that i can do something to fix? Ever since this problem started to occur it was always me who suffered from it. All of my pals were on league, playing and having fun while i was just not able to play since the login screen was stuck at \"authenticating\" It just happened on the EUW servers since i was able to log onto my other accounts on differet servers like NA and EUNE. Id just like to know if i can do something or if it just is a server error or something like that and ill just have to wait it out. \r\nBurgarbanan\r\nEUW","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T23:44:17.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Getting stuck on that authentication step can be a pretty good sign that something could be blocking your connection to our login servers. Take a few minutes to check up on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) just to make sure that everything is set up in the best way. Let me know if that doesn't seem to be helping.","replies":[{"poster":"awildedoge","date":"2017-07-19T19:07:36.470+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"it didn't help\n{{summoner:6}}  use this and help me asap\npls\nim addicted","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Max Sutari","date":"2017-07-16T00:20:38.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yooooo!! Try this!!! \n\nOpen up your firewall.  There should be an option to see apps with permissions etc. Open that window and you should see a \"add app\" or something to that effect.  Upon clicking you'll be asked what app/programs to add permissions for etc.  Click brows and find the Lol launcher.  Select it and hit add. It'll take you back to the list of programs with permissions etc. Lol should appear in that list. \n\nHope that helps :3\n\n~~Max Sutari.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PepsiMontana","date":"2017-05-22T17:57:22.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fix pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plogbilen","date":"2017-05-22T17:40:22.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem on EUW and I've had it for about 6 hours now.
