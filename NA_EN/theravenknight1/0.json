The most toxic and most common kind of asshole is the sonovabitch who does dumb shit just to spite his team.  The odds of someone being \"forced\" to afk or leave are next to zero when most people would rather run down mid and int to make sure the people on their team lose just for \"stealing\" a kill 20 minutes ago.\nThe average league player is a fucking idiot.
