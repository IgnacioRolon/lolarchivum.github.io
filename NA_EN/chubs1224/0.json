He gains some from killing minions so why not some from neutral monsters?","replies":[{"poster":"Turkey Meat","date":"2016-07-27T02:17:26.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they just want to deter bad junglers from messing him up since he looks relatively complicated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EMeta","date":"2016-07-27T03:19:59.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you make his jungle much easier--give him a bit of sustain, courage on monster kills, etc.--you wind up pretty darn close to {{champion:56}} .

Then I read about his passive and realize he woudl be a crap jungler since he would need to recall so often. Without his mount his abilities are crippled to just 2 (one of them is actually a passive) so no mount means insanely bad clear speeds and since he can't recover the mount on the jungle he woudl be crippled after a few camps.\n\nHis CC is also weak, the only thing woudl be his pull (delayed and mounted only) and his burst is also delayed (4aa) so the amount of dashes woudl be more usuable on lane similarly of how renekton does it. as for his ult.... youc an use it to roam or gank mid game similarly of how taliyah, pantheon and TF uses their ult and late game is a better version of sion since is not a skillshot anymore (you click and he autopath to the destination and dashes towards the closet enemy at the end)","replies":[]},{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2016-07-27T02:18:26.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont see him as a jungler.......but just like every champ in this game people will try it........I see him as top, mid and even as support........the stuff you like that makes you think he could jungle you can use roaming to mid from top or roaming top and bot from mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2016-07-27T02:10:39.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Nightblue is definitely playing him as jungle so far.

His Q works great for setting up ganks in his own lane, and you can use his ult to try ganking mid after the other top dies/recalls.","replies":[]}]}
