Good to know for trivia sake. Was half hoping it'd turn out that super minions are just super seige minions and share the damage boost, but I suppose they are pretty distinct units.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-10-13T00:53:12.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could.

It's not aoe like I initially presumed which would be hilariously game warping.\n\nYou can supposedly use all six on the first 6 cannon minions to never miss those and get 9% dmg versus \"siege minions\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ka√¨ju","date":"2017-10-12T20:08:04.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe.
