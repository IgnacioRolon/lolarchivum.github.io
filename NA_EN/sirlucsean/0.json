Yet for 1 game i didn't feel like playing and played it out due to wasting another 20mins on LPQ. Riot you have disrespected most players who hand feeded you money. Looks like i may have to make an new account over again and the cycle will repeat itself. Out of 2 Games i didn't care for, yet you obviously hit me with the hammer in my recent game. So all 9 kids reported me by the looks of it, yet my reports do nothing of the sort nice caring \"Fuck You Riot\". If you cannot \"clear\" the 14 day banned I'm done with your twisted game.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-03-28T00:02:09.961+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.
