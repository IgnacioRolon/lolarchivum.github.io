It said 100 for every regular rune and 300 for every quint, I only got 4000 BE. For having every single set of quints which is about 35, then times 3, then times 300, which is 31,500 essence which is nothing close to what I got.","replies":[{"poster":"Reminiscense","date":"2017-11-10T01:39:45.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This happened to me as well, I'm really hoping Riot just messed up on the conversion, I nearly owned all the runes, I skipped out on the energy ones; and after conversion i had a little more than 8k Blue essences. If i remember correctly the conversion thing said i would have about 81k blue essences; so I'm missing out on 73k blue essences.","replies":[{"poster":"Reminiscense","date":"2017-11-10T02:19:14.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"alright figured it out, you just gotta play a game then you'll get a Blue essence orb in \"loot\" open it and bam you got your essences","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T02:24:55.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like your account didn't actually have many runes that qualify for more of a BE refund.
