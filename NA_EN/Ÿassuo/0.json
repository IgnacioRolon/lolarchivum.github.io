Well, back then I wasn't level 30 so I wasn't able to signup for a PBE account. After I finally reached level 30, I went to the signup page and it told me that I can't sign up right now. So I was like, \"Ok, I guess they're not taking any signup responses right now.\" So I waited for about a month, and I checked back and it still told me the same thing. So I checked the date since they stopped taking signup responses, and it turned out that it was submitted about 7 months ago. Riot, I know you guys are busy trying to make the game as good as possible, but I would love it and same for anyone else that wanted a PBE account if you guys would open the PBE signup page back up or if not at least could you tell me why you guys aren't taking signup responses?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHyunjae1118","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-30T20:48:00.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're eager to sign up for the PBE, but it's still down for maintenance.
