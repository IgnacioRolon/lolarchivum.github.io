So therefore if I were to have 25867 IP, I would have 25867 of the new Blue Essence when preseason comes. \n\nHowever what exactly will happen to current (old) Blue Essence?\n\nI have heard it will become also  - at a 1:1 ratio - the new Blue Essence. However i have also heard of a 1:6.5 ratio, a 1:6.8 and a 1:17.5. So if i had 1 blue essence I have 1 blue essence in the new season, and if I had 2 blue essence I would have 13 in the new season.\n\nIf it is possible could a riot employee clear this up? Or someone who knows for sure...\n\nThank you! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-26T16:32:30.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not sure about these ratios.  :o  Your Blue Essence you have now will remain the same and simply merge with the converted IP.
