I only just got home now to return to find that I had gotten a leaver buster AFK (I don't even remember the last time I AFKed), of 5x 5 minute bans.\n\nI want to know if I am now unable to receive my season ending rewards... Because when I got home I saw a message in the end screen that said: \n\n\"You are ineligible to earn loot due to leaving or AFK behaviors.\"\n\nThese circumstances were completely out of my control, and I really hope someone can understand my situation if this is the case...\n\nAdditionally if the ineligibility to earn loot can be removed by simply playing 5 games to remove the ban, I will happily do so.\n\nThank you and kudos to the Riot team.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T16:41:03.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your loot eligibility has been restored as you've completed the required [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) matches.
