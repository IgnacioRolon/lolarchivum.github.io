Didn&#039;t feel impetus to change it (was exploring some iterations where it was used as a sieging tool (attacks slowly, but has high range and low in-combat value to nuke down turrets). \n\n**Big Rockets (RW)**\n\n* Still feel like this spell is usable on follow up CC and sometimes off a grenade stun hit, but didn&#039;t feel comfortable increasing its damage. \n\n**Big Grenade (RE)**\n\n* Base Damage: 150 / 200 / 250 &gt;&gt;&gt; 150 / 250 / 350\n* AP Ratio: 60% &gt;&gt;&gt; 90%\n** RE on live is usable, but given that it consumes your E cooldown, it COULD be more powerful. \n\nWould say candid feedback is most helpful.

Are you implying Heimer's bar changes colour when it's charged?  Isn't that going to end in the awkward situation where a Heimer puts down a 'surprise turret' as the beam is done charging to get a guaranteed one or is that part of the change?  And once he does that a couple times they'll just wait out the beam and then go in since he does 1/2 dps now early?  Unless that's the intention.\n\nI'm very worried about the health regen changes in particular.  Not only is his regen almost halved, but the regen on his passive is gone as well, along with the turret repair mechanic.  Idk if this will make him played more mid (He doesn't see play there due to them instagibing the turrets; this doesn't help) but it might make top less viable.\nIn testing (if this was tested) does the 3 turrets early even this out?\nIdk if 20%ms at 300 range of turrets is equivalent.\n\nEdit: Forgot to comment on the RE changes.

All he got was some movement speed? What even is that? The one thing that you don't care about THAT much with Heimer is 20% more movement speed, which realistically isn't going to be noticeable to be honest. Any time you need to be faster, will be AWAY from turrets and towers, not near them, so it seems a bit of a wasted passive 100%. \n\nI think this could be something better put into his Grenade to reward you for hitting it like, movement speed stealing. They are slowed, and you are sped up. His play style seems like it should focus all on his pushing, lane dominance (much like Renekton is a lane bully, why shouldn't Heimer be the mage version?). He is immobile, and I think his playstyle should reflect that, but that passive isn't going to make him more mobile, and just feels like he is losing power.\n\nFrom what I see of these changes, none of this is making him better in any regard. Huge nerfs to his turrets, which alone makes it pointless to play Heimer over another mage. You are removing his passive to give him basically a barely noticeable speed boost in very specific situations.\n\nThe change to his E is the only change I see that will actually be felt in a positive way, but the Turret nerfs are a bit silly in a negative way, and only are going to force him to be played even less. I see nothing here that made me go \"yeah, this will make me need to be more skillful so people can play this at a higher level\". All of this made me go \"why do I want to even bother playing Heimer now, let alone in mid lane?\" He already had a million bad matchups against the meta mages, and this will absolutely make him worse in mid.\n\n---------------------\n\n\"We know that Heimer players enjoy playing him for the turrets and so, we are trying to find a way to make the turrets have better gameplay without isolating Heimerdinger players.\"\n\nYou did nothing but nerf the turrets. You nerfed the base damage for a ratio that won't matter until laning phase is almost over, and with the nerfs, he won't make it through laning phase, because people won't be afraid to just out right kill his turrets now, and any junglers will laugh off the early damage, making him completely unsafe, and again, a bad idea to play. The only reason he isn't a free kill in mid is because junglers don't want to just dive him like every mage, so he can play safer. If his turrets are weaker, then the rest of his kit does nothing to help him. Unless you get a perfect stun, the grenade isn't stopping a gank, and his rockets aren't great unless you have the follow up or they are the follow up.\n\n\n\nI see zero \"skill\" injected into his kit, and it just looks like hitting all the points that make Heimer, Heimer, and no gameplay or \"skill\" added.

I was figuring he would get hit with the nerf bat too hard.\nI'll link my original post:  [Here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Y5wTqAQw-meddler-andor-heimerdinger-team-for-710) Where I talk about what can be done.\n\nI made a Heimerdinger guide over a year ago that's still strong and the best for him. Give it a read to see my thoughts on him in laning. [Here](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/s6-14-top-mid-heimerdinger-the-revered-inventor-of-lp-70-469381)\nInitial impressions is it looks like it's a **LEAP** in the right direction. \n\nA lot of what I mentioned to shift some power is incorporated (Lower Turret Recharge, Lower CDR on W/E while adding some damage).\n\nI had an 80% win rate last season from P5 -> D3 with 200~ games as Heimer. That number fell to 65% and ending of D5. \n> Heimer is generally more performant the lower MMR you go (or worse the higher you go), meaning that when Heimer is \"viable\" in higher MMR's, he will \n> usually be absolutely destroying lower MMR.\n > In this sense, it is desirable to inject some skill into his kit to allow him to be more viable in higher MMR without breaking lower MMR.\n\nThat's the reason I stated my Win %'s. Heimer is strong in the right hands. I understand wanting to make him easier for people.\n\n\nNow I'll discuss the changes:\n\n> Passive: Hextech Affinity (P)\n > Moves 20% faster around turrets (SR turrets and his own turrets) - 300 range.\n\nThis will piggy back into the Turrets but some of the power (in terms of how much to be shifted to each ability) that Heimerdinger had was that he healed his turrets when around them. Turret health is low early and will die to random minion attacks. (I think the Minion AI needs to be looked at as they will sometimes target the turret over creeps).\n\n> Turrets\n > Base damage down with double the AP scaling late game.\n > 3 Charges at all ranks and a 20 second recharge rage\n > Beam attack tripled+ (but abilities will have recharge on beams\n\nI see this as a good enough approach. I personally would like to have the bonus (50%) damage that melees get to the turrets removed if they are going to have the damage cut in half. \n\nHeimerdinger won't be building a lot of AP early at all. (Even mid lane he has to go Rylai's first or Morello). With their damage effectively neutered until you get 3+ items I would like them to live a little bit longer (they already die fast if people actually attack them, **ESPECIALLY** early).\n\nI don't see any mention of the beam damage? With the beam attack being increased and you having to rely on hitting spells to charge it (because that's pretty much the gist of the matter there), is the beam damage being increased or staying the same? \n\nWould it be possible to have a faster cooldown on his turrets? Since we are staying with that as his core/theme then I feel that a 20 sec recharge (12 sec with 40% cdr, which you would probably never do) is still high for late game. I'd like to see an 8 sec (with 40% cdr) late game recharge rate. The main thing being even an 800 health turret dies REALLY fast late game and not being able to use them neuters you, ESPECIALLY if you are behind.\n\n> Rockets\n > Mana down, scaling CDR\n > Charges 20% of nearby turrets\n\nYou have 5 rockets that come out. (Each additional is 20% of the first). \n\nWhat happens if the beam is at 80% charge, and all 5 rockets hit? Will it now be at 80% again? (100 ->20% ->40%->60%->80%) \nWhat if it **JUST** fires? Will it immediately fire a second?\nAre all 5 rockets coding seperately so that I will not lose a 20% charge on a point blank rocket?\n\nI like the rocket change, the scaling and mana cost really gives him poke for mid lane again and MIGHT make him competitive to meta champs (Mind you take a look at that post because he still has a lot of hard counters for turret gameplay).\n\nBeing able to only put one point into Q for 3 charges and work around my W/E is very nice and opens up more playstyles.\n\n> Grenade\n > Hitbox increased slightly\n > Flat 12sec instead of 18 \n > Full beam charge on champion\n\nIs the hitbox increasing the slow/aoe? \nIs it a STUN charges turrets to full beam?\n\nI think you could probably make it so that a STUN charges all beams rather than the AOE. The aoe is rather simple to hit and seems like it would be too strong.\n\n> Upgrade!!!!\n > Lots of talk I'll just discuss.\n\nSo I think one of the misconceptions everyone is having is that the H-28Q Apex Turret (The UPGRADE!!! R/Q) is stronger/used more than it is.\n\nPretty much the only time I use R/Q is like this:\n\n - Still in laning phase and drop to have a 4th turret/slow/damage during a jungle gank 1v2\n - Dropping to harass/take first turret\n  - When Canon minion is taking turret aggro, drop so it last longer, zones and does damage.\n - Doing baron at 20 minutes\n  - Tanks aggro and does a lot of early damage so 3 turrets + me and another can duo it.\n - Solo'ing Elder\n \nOnce I am out of laning phase I very VERY rarely drop my ultimate turret. It dies to smite + a couple of attacks. It can be moved (Sion E, Syndra E).\n\nRocket damage should NOT be increased. If anything a very minor drop off in damage would work for it. If enemy has no MR a stun + RW will kill most carries.\n\n> Big Grenade\n\nI separated this because I feel it should be talked about more.\n\nIncreasing the damage and the aoe is BAD.\n\nI personally really love it but it will be overtuned. I pretty much engage/disengage all fights after laning with my ultimate grenade. It's what makes him shine in team fights. (Kiting through Heimer turrets isn't beneficial late game in higher ELO because they die super easy and are outranged by ranged ADCs). \n\nWhile it is true it consumes your E cooldown it SHOULD. It's an AOE slow + stun. I feel that probably 50% of Heimerdinger power and 80% of his teamfighting late game is R/E. You can Slow + stun someone with your ultimate grenade. Adding more AP ratio makes it stupidly strong.\n\nI think the base damage increase is fine but if everything else stays then the AP ratio can NOT be increased by that much.","replies":[{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2017-05-02T07:50:26.058+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you land multiple rockets on somebody and the turret starts firing its laser attack, it won't go over the cap until it fires off the laser beam.","replies":[{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2017-05-02T07:53:35.694+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fizz Enthusiast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jIEZxfck,comment-id=001a0001,timestamp=2017-05-02T07:50:26.058+0000)\n>\n> If you land multiple rockets on somebody and the turret starts firing its laser attack, it won&#x27;t go over the cap until it fires off the laser beam.\n\n:( Out of all that I spent typing and addressing as a main that understands the good and bad and that's what you get back with :( \n\nI'll take it but was actually hoping for more discourse. \n\nThanks for reading it atleast.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2017-05-02T14:28:51.767+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's probably reading and taking notes, it seems like sometimes they are doing this whilst also working so they probably don't have time to respond in great detail.

I love to play Heimer and I almost have my Mastery lvl 7 with him. I dont have time to play Ranked and I play only one game a day or so. Heimer lets me relax after my day and now, because of SOME people, I cant play him anymore. His early game is difficult enough, but in a good way. I have to play around weaknesses and focus strengths. Now though, I dont have an early game and you say by powering him up late game, I would win? But if i dont have an early game, how would i get to late game? or mid game?\n\n\"Make Heimer less oppressive against melee, which gives us room to buff him (specifically, reducing the amount of punishment melee champs take when being ambiently in range of turrets and tagged by the \"pheromone\" mechanic \")\n\nSo you are saying, if i complain about other champs, I can nerf them? Okay then, Yasuo moves too much, i want less movement speed on him so i can land a skill shot. Brand has too much AOE, I want less AOE on him if the spell lands near a Champ. Syndra's Ult shouldnt target Champs because she can melt Champs too easily.\n\nThe point of Heimer is that i can set up a \"base\" and push the lane. SOOO many champs can kill my turrets with just their Auto Attack and ALL the champs in the League of Legends can use Spells to kill my turrets. Now, champs are being REWARDED for early Ganks against me cuz now i have no Damage. What the Hell is the logic. Give Heimer no laning phase so he is killable, and push him out of lane so he cant level and then he never levels to go to mid game and never reaches late game. I can already hear my teammates yelling at me for having no gold and items because my early game is gone. Gangplank is gonna destroy me even more. And i already have trouble with Darius, Nasus, Riven, ETC. \n\nthe point im trying to make is, just cuz ONE SINGULAR champ counters some champs, doesnt mean you nerf the one champ into the ground. that is unfair, illogical, and makes no sense that cuz i can counter some champs, i should be punished for it.\n\nI will post more if you want to hear more of my side \n(sorry if i sound angry, just trying to get a point across...)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BIAKaboose","date":"2017-05-02T09:32:27.912+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, and I don't play a ton of Heimer mind you, so this may be entirely invalid, I think that buffing turret HP is way better of a step in the right direction than love tapping his base damage and doubling his scalings. Otherwise you're going to get turrets that hit like trucks, and die to a stiff breeze. If Heimer's turrets are supposed to be a major influence on his gameplay then we should stop making them so expendable.\n\nHeimer already has problems fighting pretty much any ranged poke mage which is why he is sent top to bully the melees because his turrets die so easily to one or two cheap spells that are usually AoE while the enemy laner is just wave clearing, or you have to put your turrets so far away from minions that they are way less effective.\n\nI would say make turrets scale harder at longer ranges and give them more HP, this makes him actually viable against ranged mages, and gives melees the option of getting in close to him without getting shredded once they're there and he throws literally anything at them. It would make certain matchups top lane with melees really tough as compared to now around my elo where he just sort of wins for free against everybody but Nasus and Renekton, and make him not be countered by... every popular mid laner except like, Talon who still does relatively well against him, and Fizz who just destroys him at level 6.","replies":[]},{"poster":" Jar Jar binks l","date":"2017-05-02T08:40:05.962+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thats a nerf.

Got from silver to diamond with Dingdong, wrote a guide that's top tier, played thousands of games with him and made a lot of videos around him which are popular on youtube for their Heimer plays. Right off the bat riot doesn't know what Heimer needs, they show they just known what outside sources need (melee champs). \n> \n> \n> www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/s7-ready-a-true-saiyans-power-s5-diamond-player-226279\n\n\nThe passive is contradicting and makes no sense. When Heimer faces melee champs his biggest asset is his MOVEMENT SPEED because most melee outside of Riven have very little gap closing abilities. When a jungler comes one, all it takes is smite and his big turret is gone, an auto and so is his mini turrets. High elo players know this. Heimer has garbage cs and his ability to kill turrets are really bad, I find myself never getting first turret anymore no matter how aggressive I play. You people are living in the past with outdated notes about Heimerdinger.\n\n**Solving Melee / Turret ignorance : **\n\nYou ruin Heim's early for no reason other than to cater to melees? You want catering? Force a fight or flight mechanic. For every nearby turret he gains a small AP-Scaling shield and bonus scaling AP. When outside of it, he loses the bonuses and is weaker than live Heimer, make it apparent that he needs his turrets to be strong and players will attack it, look at Yasuo. Even Yorick has the same mechanic, you can tell his Ghouls are the source of his damage. If he is damaged his turrets take a % of the damage depending on the turret closest to Heimer, this way the enemy can focus on the other turrets.  This mechanic forces players to manage when to stay or leave, it also encourages players to stay and place turrets to survive, in stead of simply popping Zhonyas when you see someone. This rewards saving your turrets for ganks but rewards enemies for clearing his turrets or kicking/pushing him away from them. Which is what melee like to do, gap close you into a corner. Maybe for a passive make it so anyone near his turrets gets the shield but maybe a reduced version. Make the shields regen ONLY if a new turret is placed, allow the regen to scale off his regen. This is healthy for supports and for showing players what to attack.\n\n**QoL : **\n\nIncrease heimers attack speed or rotation animation, seriously this is an issue. I'm moving around a lot with heimer and his rotation kills csing. His turrets already are terrible at csing because they don't factor in minion MR and when csing under tower you need turrets to damage but mid game they end up making it impossible to cs under tower. This is a QoL to make him feel less sticky.\n\n**Ultimate Grenade : **\n\nMake his RE stun range wider, give him something akin to Sona, RE is usually a utility spell and used to execute fleeing players. Reduce its base damages and make it deal more to low champions (execute champs). This gives support Heimer some return since you dropped his passive. It also makes his ult feel like an ultimate since Heimer is basically a poke champ through and through without his ult, he's basically the poke version of Sona. Usually RE either starts fights or picks up fleeing kills.\n\n**Ultimate Rockets :**\n\nRW feels bad that's why everyone resorts to RQ, why RW with diminishing returns when you can exhaust and let your turrets beam finish them off and even continue working on others. When you fully land a Velkoz ult they die, fully land ANY channel spell the enemy dies. Fully land Heimer's rockets? Only 0 Mr dies. Drop his base damage again, give this % damage based on HP and make it so if fully landed it deals 30%-40% hp depending on AP. Make it so it starts bad (0.02%) but each landed rocket deals more of their base HP, so second would deal 0.05 for example. This rewards well-timed RWs and gives him something to deal with tanks. Seriously my turret shouldn't be the close range option! This also makes him viable when the enemy is just stacking HP against him like crazy. Aka tank meta, which is another reason to drop RQ, so you can bypass the tanks and hit the backlines in teamfights, since you can't do anything against tanks yet every other AP mage can.\n\nMake both castable like RQ as they now play fundamentally differently.\n\nThese mechanics raise Heimers skill level by rewarding what Heimer is good for: tactical team gameplay without turning him into another assassin, it also increases his skillcap by nerfing poor ability usage (using his grenade to execute but miscalculating, and prioritizing squishies with rockets instead of tanks) but rewards well placed, strategized abilities.\n\n**Another QoL : **\n\nAlso lower his ult animation before he can cast an ability or remove it OR make it so R abilities are free or make it so you can't cast during the animation windup, way too many times I end up ruining my combo. Making RW/RE not dependent fixes this. So does my other suggestions. Using your abilities by reacting quickly to cc shouldn't be hindered by a simple animation.\n\n\n**Final Thoughts : **\n\nWhy do you keep forcing this beam mechanic when illaoi already has it? Why is it always the beams that everyone turns to? Ever since his rework it's been beam this, beam that. Beam is too OP, Beam needs to start at 70% oh wait 0%, Beam does too little, Beam is the only ability to proc rylai's / Liandries, \"Beam is your main damage source\". I hate them!\n\nHeimerdinger is THE team champion, every Heimer main will tell you this, to pretend he's not is ridiculous, when you play Heimer people look to you for answers, they look to you for Baron calls, Dragon Calls, Split pushing, Team fighting. When you play Heimerdinger, you play the leader, you setup fights and take down threats. You lower the enemy to raise your team....TO RAISE YOUR DONGERS! This is why you play Heimerdinger, not to assassinate, you play to raise your dongers, you play to help your teammates because when your teammates are stronger, you get stronger. \n\n\n...Also it would be nice if Heimerdinger got Chromas...Others will probably disagree and I'm probably really biased but a yellow blastzone heimer, red or even blue would be really cool, like a flame look or Saiyan look for yellow.\n{{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2017-05-02T09:29:31.005+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nooooo, my regendonger is nerfed :(\n\nHaving a ludicrously high base HP was so fuuuuun when you built nothing but items that scale off HP regen.
