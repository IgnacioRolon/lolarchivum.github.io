If the enemy buys it he can completely negate all kill pressure you had except for like 2-3 mages that can play around it.

Yes you outscale him but it's always a he can kill me but I can't kill him situation which is kinda sad.\n\nIf you rush seekers to negate his all in it's actually not a big deal for him and you sacrifice mana which also makes hexdrinker stronger in comparison since you don't have the mana to burn through. Also you lose out on lane pressure since you can't clear the waves efficient enough.

He is one of the few champs in the game that doesnt NEED cdr to work. Also with the removal of catalyst from the build path, Aurelion Sol will struggle with mana sustain early game. GLP is the perfect item for asol and this change is going to hurt him pretty bad.

I think you could stand to make Morello's cheaper, 3000 gold for average stats and the 15mpen is a bit overkill. I know it has GW too but the rest of the GW items are all also very cheap, so it seems fine.\nAlso, I don't know how you guys could do this, but I wish you would keep GLP good for Aurelion Sol. The lost catalyst passive + health really sucks for him.\n\nSpellbound Orb stacks a bit too slowly in my opinion, even after the buff. It doesn't seem like a great first item rush because of how long it takes to stack, and it doesn't seem especially great in teamfights either due to the active cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuyinTheX","date":"2018-02-08T20:42:31.835+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"The only change I feel Liandry's needs is to revert back to current HP, the rest is fine as is, you can even revert it back to 2% from 1.5%.\n\nChampions that deal max HP damage like Brand and Mordekaiser work far to well with this item as is.\nBrand's passive tics for 4 seconds, standard damage has Liandry's tic 7 times, for 10.5% of a champion's max HP, 14.5% if you add in Brand's 4%.\nIf he buys Crystal Scepter, it jumps to 21%/25%. None of this counting damage from other sources and just 1 stack of Brand's passive.\nWith Mordekaiser, his rank 3 ult takes 35% (+4% per 100 AP) and tics for 10 seconds, this causes Liandry's to take 19.5% by itself and 54.5% with Morde's ult. Add in Crystal Scepter here too, it becomes 39%/74% if Morde has 0 AP (which isn't going to happen).\n\nJust **revert to Current HP** and everything will be alright again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2018-02-08T20:38:23.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"_(But PBE is on maintenance monkaS)_\n\nHello!\n\nIn the Mid Lane, I'm a Kennen player.
