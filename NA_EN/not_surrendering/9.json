Target is 8.13 and the changes are intended to be relatively low disruption (not particularly noticeable, but have good impact). \r\n\r\nWe have seen early snowball increase slowly, but steadily over this season. As I pointed out in a reddit post earlier this week, this could be due to any number of factors that our data analysts are picking apart and will hopefully share when we have stable results. \r\n\r\nSome of the tactics we&#039;re looking at: \r\n\r\n1. Re-introducing the bounty on 2 kills and potentially a small increase to bounties 3 and above. \r\n2. Early death timer reductions from levels 1-7, while keeping an eye on what this does to teleport summoner. \r\n3. Outer turret global gold reduction 100 &gt;&gt;&gt; 50. \r\n\r\nWhat we&#039;re not looking at for this pass:\r\n\r\n1. Towers getting more tanky, especially in laning phase. \r\n\r\nI know this is a common complaint, but we have reasons to believe that elongating laning phases is not the best course of action right now. This is partially because having elongated laning phases means more chance for lanes to snowball out of control without meaningful chances for other lanes to intervene as well as just reducing the amount of game variance (through interaction with other champions). I personally think the average length of laning phases is about right at the moment, but the standard deviations (the length of the longest laning phases or the shortness of the shortest laning phases) are too large. This can result in some unsatisfying laning phases where the first turret goes down as early as 7 minutes. \r\n\r\nIt also has the tendency to make games stall out even longer when already won, so I would want us to have a more robust (and flexible with game state) solution. Examples here could be: killing towers doesn&#039;t grant as much gold (which is frontloaded snowball), but instead grants a deferred or distributed bonus of some sort. Tower fall times could also be regulated more strictly (ie. very hard to drop before a certain time and easy to drop after a certain time).","replies":[{"poster":"lol you wild wyd","date":"2018-06-14T20:07:14.871+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tower changes should be looked at in general in my opinion. The reduction of health of base towers was not needed so was the change to Baron damage. I think Baron iteration before the damage reduction was literally PERFECT, dangerous and rewarding at the same time. Fast games are not League of Legend's identity, being able to execute multiple strategies is (like scaling comps). I hope this increase in snowball was not an attempt to cater to the casuals as they say. It feels amazing when you can win in multiple ways like stomping or a LONG intense  strategic game of League where meta tactics come into play.","replies":[{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2018-06-14T22:53:50.645+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also towers do shit for dmg.

Towers having more base damage? Give towers bonus armor penetration? Making damage ramp up faster, so that taking 1-2 shots still isn't as punishing (and one can dive to secure a kill), but getting 3+ shots gets really dangerous (and one has a harder time to engage a 50% hp target under tower)?

The game could be about territory and strategy, just like football. Playing against and around turrets should be much more meaningful. The lead should come FROM THE MAP not just from gold, items, autopushing minions etc. That's basically just \"oh hey, I'm stronger than you and you're useless haHa xD. Come \"outplay\" me while several levels behind and down in gold!\" It just leads to stomps. It should be about map control, map pressure, turrets and so on. Our team is ahead because we have 2 more turrets and it's not just the gold that matters, it's that the turrets themselves are HUGE objectives and difficult to take. The lead becomes external to raw stats and the game becomes richer adn more strategic... more about experience, more about understanding, more about knowledge.\n\nShut down gold is artificial and randomizing and so are autopushing minions. They are unearned leads/comeback mechanics imo. Just make turrets much stronger and much more gold. That way, you won't need so many of these snowball and anti snowball mechanics to begin with. It will feel more earned. Right now, almost no objective feels that rewarding to take in terms of difficulty. Baron is still really easy to take. I'd add at least 2000 HP more to it. It's good that the damage was reduced though.\n\nAlso, I think the ADC buffs on PBE might be a bit much combined with this. Twitch more or less switched to BoRK first anyway. Vayne is scary enough late and might also be gravitating towards BoRK first. The other changes seem OK. These 2 might be overbuffed if the snowballing is reduced though and the meta hasn't settled down enough to notice how strong or weak they are. I might be wrong on this though. My impression is that Twitch will become the strongest ADC in the game and the meta will revolve around pairing him with a great defensive ardent support.\n\nOne that I don't see on PBE though is Corki. He got severely nerfed (both abilities and AD growth) and his build got hurt a lot too. His core build was TF-Sorcs-RFC-Shiv-IE. He's essentially down 600g and even his late game isn't performing well because he has no self-peel, no CC etc. in an assassin meta. Tanks are too weak overall and he doesn't get a frontline to allow him to be useful outside of when he has package.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ANARMYOFOVER100","date":"2018-06-15T06:40:32.239+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something that may help is reverting the longer ward cool downs.

It also makes it so a team that devotes resources and plays around keeping a turret alive can actually be rewarded.

The problems are the low chances of that working only as imagined.  The game is accelerated and snowbally because the game keeps getting more stats,  more gold, more numbers and more ways to nullify others' numbers so they **can't** turn it around.  Adding more gold lets you get to those points faster.\nIn clowny blood bath games where teams are just trading kills every minute it's just adding more gold and accelerating the game.  And in games where people are playing carefully, better or not making mistakes to give freebies, that turn around isn't likely to happen.  I'll place it a different way, what's more likely, a 0/2 guy taking out the 2/0 guy who's playing the way it takes to go 2/0, or the 4/0 guy taking out your 2/0 guy?

There are two main areas I think you guys need to watch... First is the impact early kills have. Second is the rate/way towers are falling. \n\nHonestly, kill gold I think is in a decent place. A small bounty at 2 kills might be fine, but I'm not sure it will do that much.  I'd be worried about the first teamfight, where the enemy team's 3/0 carry is trying to shut down your team's [last hope] 2/0 carry. The enemy team kills your team's only strong person and gets a shutdown for it? Rough. But hey - shutting down my team's last hope is the right play for them, so maybe they deserve that bounty.\n\nIn regards to TOWERS... I think there are some problems there, and that's the real thing that is causing the snowballiness. There are a number of factors that are working together now to make games end faster and more decisively. (FIRST) Last season (?) you introduced the rift herald as a way to break through the tough outer/inner towers early, which were stalling out games, especially against high waveclear comps. Fair, and we all love the big guy. (SECOND) But a few seasons earlier (again not sure of my timeline, but doesn't really matter), you changed Baron as a way to give teams lategame - and especially inhibitor turret - pushing power. (THIRD) Right now, laners are barely punished at all for leaving lane/roaming. As long as you shove your wave and don't miss a cannon, you're fine. \n\nWhat does all of this mean, when you put it all together? Well, with laners (esp. mid) not being punished for roaming, it means more early-game grouping. Not inherently bad! But it means that it's not uncommon for a 4 man to wind up tower diving bot at 7 minutes, because towers don't deal much damage, and oh look, then the tower is gone. Meanwhile, the mid who didn't roam got to do what? Push two non-cannon waves? Probably two lanes lost in one decision, if the roaming midlaner got any kills. \n\nGoing back to \"more early game grouping\" - this is also how you take rift heralds! Early grouping and forcing a tower is pretty common now, so the natural next step for the team up a tower is [take mid tower, unless it's down or you can't siege, then] Rift.  Rift was originally introduced to provide an incentive for early game skirmishes, but also to help deal with outer turrets. Early Grouping is already happening though, to take towers and get kills, so in the current environment Rift almost as often takes out an inner turret. It's VERY common nowadays to see, at 20 minutes when Baron spawns, a team that's behind have at least one lane down to the inhibitor turret. And then it's just a matter of taking baron and pushing THAT tower down. We all know what a team's chances are when they're down towers, kills, and an inhib - next to nothing.\n\nAll of the problems I've stated are just things that are slightly overtuned - first baron, rift herald, towers being weak, and most importantly roaming being more valuable than farming.

I think it's a problem an enemy can get super fed by repeatedly killing his opposing laner over and over and over.  If the enemy top laner gets 4 kills on his enemy laner should he get moderately fed?  Sure.  Should he get extremely fed to the point where there's not much you can do?  I don't think so.\n\n**I suggest completely overhauling the bounty & gold decay on deaths system.**\n-Slight bounty even after 1 kill (maybe 350 gold)\n-Further reduce gold value after 1-2 deaths. (Maybe on 2nd death a champion gives 225 gold, and 3rd death gives 150gold for example)\n-Decay of gold reduction over time and/or gold gained. (Prevent proxy Singed.  If you died 3 times a while ago but then manage to survive for 10 min and farm 150 cs then you are worth more money again).\n-Hit Tab to see bounty value on all enemy champs so you know who's juicy and worth killing.\n\nThe benefits would be\n1: Be able to control snowballing to moderate level\n2: Reduced frustration.  Currently if you are having a bad game and are 0/3 it makes sense for the enemy jungler to kick you while you're down and gank you again.  It's low risk (gank is likely to succeed, and likely to win 2v2 if countergank occurs) and high reward (since you almost give full gold and they can get a tower afterwards).  Right now the game encourages ganking your winning lanes and ignoring your losing lanes.

Make the bounty lvl go down to lvl 0 when at lvl 1-3, to lvl 1 when at lvl 4-6 and to lvl 2 if 7+.\n\nDeath timer reduction is likely ok if it is just ~1 second. The TP problem should solve itself if TP gets reworked.\n\nThe gold reduction is HUGE (-250g). I agree that this could solve a part of the problem, but why not make turrets finally decent again?\n\nInstead of giving turrets scaling armor/MR over time, let them start at full Armor/MR and remove the scaling. That way early turrets are more durable but they are still easy to cut down later. It would make it harder to just take a turret at 8 minutes but not significantly at 12+ minutes.\n\nTurrets need an overall overhaul. Slightly more dmg, more protection in the first ~5 minutes againts dives and more durability early on (base turrets need more durability overall).\n\n\nThe long version:\n\n* ALL: Turrets now have 70 Armor/MR up from 55-70.\n* Mid lane (outer/inner/inhib): turrets now have 80 Armor/MR up from 55-70. Why that? Because too often you start to grp mid lane and run down the turrets for the gold. Or after a won teamfight you rush mid and taket 1-2 turrets. They are closer together and faster to take because getting minions there needs less time and they are closer to the teamfight most likely. This should reward people trying to splitpush more often and take the side lane turrets.\n* Nexus/Inhib/inner: +10 dmg. They lack power right now.\n* Nexus: HP up to 3000 from 2700. They are way too squishy\n* Nexus: Gold up to 100 global from 50 (more rewarding and helps finishing the game)\n* Nexus/Inhib: Now have markers for the 33% and 67% HP values (for the HP reg)\n\nOuter turrets (all 3 not just top and mid):\n\n* 40/25/10/0% dmg reduction till minute 0/5/6/7 changed from 50% till minute 5. This makes turrets harder to get down too early. Reduced in power very early due to the increased Armor/MR\n* +10% dmg reduction (50/35/20/10% combined with the upper) agianst ranged champs if an ally is close to it. This is to make turrets last longer when the enemy can defend them. Mostly to reduce the poke ranged champs can easily get in early on while melees can't take that risk at all most of the time.\n\nNow this would reward lane swaps again because all outer turrets get that, which we want to prevent:\n\n* Outer Turrets gain +20/10/5/0 % bonus dmg against champs at minutes 0/5/6/7 per enemy champ extra over allied champs. So at a 4v2 turret dive at minte 5 the turret would do +20% dmg (2 times 10%). Or in a 4v1 top lane turret dive at minute 4 +60% dmg. Due to it scaling with numbers and and falling off pretty early already it doesn't really prevent turret divesv like a 2v2 or a 3v2 or a 2v1. The +10% dmg at minute 5 then are something to consider but nothing too major if the dive is executed well, but also a larger risk.\n\nThis would prevent the 4v0 lanes we saw with lane swaps most likely because they can't just shove that guy out from under his turret so early that he can't get to lvl 2 or 3 and at that point his jungler can start to help out. So I hope this would prevent 4v0 lane swaps but enable possible 2v1 lane swaps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-06-15T00:07:59.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you want to reduce early snowballing you need to give players worthwhile defensive choices for the early game.
