The exact details are still in flux; don’t want to get caught up on “this number is too big/small” (feedback is still welcome), but am curious to see what you all think and are excited about (either in this post or not) as well as general thoughts. \n\nNote: None of these things are guaranteed to ship. \n\nOur current goals for this project (which are subject to change): \n\n* Crit users have an item path they are excited about. \n* Crit users have defensive options that aren’t way off curve. \n* Crit users are more satisfying in solo queue for all levels of play. \n\n\nWe're considering some potential directions (see below). Direction 1 is more known, direction 2 is a bit more adventurous and at the end, there are a few ideas that can go in either pitch. \n\nLet me know what you think either in thread or on twitter @RiotPhRoXzOn, I'll be around to answer questions and participate in discussion for a bit. \n\n##IE Direction 1 - IE Reversion\n[IE Reversion]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7Ea7lkjl.png\n\n##IE Direction 2 - 5k Gold IE and Zeal upgrade changes, Energized Changes\n[5k Gold IE]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/uWDJlsWl.png\n\n[25% Crit Zeal Items]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JDqgQtbl.png\n\n[25% Crit Zeal Items]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Q5gR1OAl.png\n\n##Flexible - (Can go in either pitch)\n[Hexdrinker]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pyNGcMgl.png\n\n[Defensive PD]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8E15VBzl.png\n\n[Essence Reaver Broadening]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/thvRieDl.png\n\n[Energized Stormrazor]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kaEXdrcl.png\n\n[Multi proc Stormrazor]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0nb8SwEl.png\n\n[Buffed Last Whisper]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2KlxUlAl.png\n\n[New Maw]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OlF5FANl.png\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the feedback everyone.

You can make as many items as you want so don't force one item to be accessible. Black Cleaver should be preferable to a mana item for fighters. If fighters are grabbing ER instead, it's because the passive is too strong.\n\nThe old ER was used by more champions. ER was an alternative to Infinity Edge. Marskmen like Sivir and Ashe regularly picked it up. Without crit, ER won't be viable on champions that used to buy it.\n\nThe current iteration of ER is too niche.

I'd like to see something like (Zeal + Pickaxe + Pickaxe) or (Zeal + BF + Pickaxe) to increase viability. This way Zeal is a little more diverse with it's build paths but is still viable as a first item. \n_________\n# {{item:3086}} Zeal Crit Items:\n\n I think giving Zeal items a bit more upfront damage would reward DPS based ADCs and bring them up to par with burstier ones. Building a Zeal as a first item versus a BF Sword is a death sentence most of the time, it's just not worth it anymore. Giving a cheaper cost or some more upfront damage (like the proposed 80+ magic damage) would make it more viable in comparison. \n_________\n# {{item:3508}} Essence Reaver: \n\n Essence Reaver has always been a subject of debate for the ADC community. I'm not too sure how I feel about the item, I just know it could use some love taps for mana-hungry ADCs and casters. This suggestion is probably best left to people other than myself! \n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}} \n\n____________\n# {{item:3155}} Hexdrinker: \n\n Adding the Stasis ability from Stopwatch is a poor idea. It's already hard to land kills against AD champions who still gain decent damage from the item, but Stasis has always been the AP champion's niche/way of survival. I don't think spreading it across more items would be healthy for the game, especially for immobile, slow laners whose one engage can decide the rest of their laning phase. Also, Stopwatch on it's own is already infuriating to play against, making it more prevalent seems like a poor idea as well.\n_____________\n# {{item:3046}} Phantom Dancer: \n I can't see Phantom Dancer granting AD in addition to it's current stats making the item any more desirable for any champions. All I can imagine is that adding more stats (at the cost of the % damage reduction) removes it's utility of a dueling item and would buff champions who already purchase it. \n\n_____________\n# {{item:3095}} Stormrazor: \n\n I'm a little biased since Stormrazor is my most hated item in League. I dislike the free burst damage that synergizes too well with most ADCs, it's very strong with a good build path and I'd like to see it changed to be healthier. \n\n I really like the idea of the Multi-Proc Stormrazor, though. It seems like a smart way to play harder lanes, taking good trades with full stacks of Storm's Edge would give weaker ADCs a chance to win fights while not being too overbearing (like it is now) on more commonly picked ADCs. \n_____________\n# {{item:3035}} Last Whisper:\n\n With a bunch of the damage floating around + Conqueror, I think Last Whisper is better off untouched for the moment. If it had to be buffed, I'd say 15% armor penetration or 17.5% armor penetration would be alright.\n_____________\n\n# {{item:3156}} Maw of Malmortius\n\n AFAIK Maw is already a very cost efficient item (even more so when it's passive is activated. Adding more flat danage in addition to the item's strong defensive passive seems overkill IMO. When an AD champion has a strong matchup, it's usually _very good_ so I don't think buffing it is a good idea.\n\n\n>Disclaimer: I'm unranked, these are just my opinions based off of norms / watching high ELO gameplay","replies":[{"poster":"Sh4d3","date":"2018-12-22T00:34:48.336+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hotarµ,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=oA7EoIrf,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2018-12-22T00:14:50.408+0000)\n> ____________\n> # {{item:3155}} Hexdrinker: \n> \n>  Adding the Stasis ability from Stopwatch is a poor idea.

Resistances are great, but without even a decent option for HP, it makes dealing with some situations absolutely impossible. Also as a side effect, it makes Ignite absolutely ridiculous, since it will deal ~25% of your HP in the mid to late game while reducing your main defense (lifesteal).\n\nSomething designed kinda like Black Cleaver, but with stats more fit for ADC, that rewards a constant DPS, would be a huge step-up. Frozen Mallet is also an option, but it's too weak because of champions like Gnar abusing it. Even something that can be stacked through farming, would maybe be good for ADCs since it fits this scaling idea, but I'm throwing ideas at the wall right now.\n\nNot having access to this stat for most of the Marksman cast makes it nearly impossible to deal with hybrid damage sources from the enemy team, due to the fact that you are limited in terms of slots (which I guess this would help fix, especially the 5k IE), but also because due to the multiplicative nature of ADCs damage, you can simply get something like early Tabi + early Hexdrinker without being as useful as dead. It gets even worse when you are vs champions that requires a QSS, it becomes finding the \"less worse\" options, and you feel really hopeless.\n\nOther roles don't have this issue because they can get HP which will act as a bridge until they get the proper situational resistances items they need. The argument can be made that enchanters are there to provide some form of \"pseudo-HP\" through shield, but this doesn't fix the problem ADCs are facing right now, which is the accurate feeling that your personal choices and actions have a minimal impact on the outcome of the game.\n\n\nOverall, glad that you're willing to take a good look at that. I have this belief that crit as a mechanic will always be problematic and that on-hit is easier to balance due to the lack of RNG and burst (both issues, one of them even leading to this 8.11 patch), even if Phantom Hit makes it volatile, but I guess at this point removing it would be a lot of work, so I just hope you can manage to fix it.

I worry about the trough that puts ADCs in a bit; 5k is A LOT of gold and time. But at the same time, it would be nice to have everything you needed in one item. It would make build paths feel less constraining. And no one could say ADCs have the cheapest 1st item powerspike if they're shelling out 5k.

Please, for the love of god, so I'm not wasting a huge chunk of gold in stats that are already over capped. \n\nPD is already pretty defensive. However, with it building out of Hexdrinker, would it give MR instead of just flat damage reduction instead...? And if it did, you would have to definitely change Storm Razor from what it is *now* to something different. There were so many changes to the current Razor to prevent assassins from using it; giving assassins a relatively good option to stat into *some* crit so that they can go back to abusing storm razor just sounds terrifying. \n\nI'd rather avoid making Storm Razor energized as well. It already feels like you get shoe horned into RFC/Shiv a lot as a crit builder. :( If SR was also an energized attack, the best option for damage would always just go energizer.\n\nCould you expound on what Multi Proc means on Stormrazor??? Like... a shiv multi proc or...? What I always thought would be cool for Stormrazor was if it ramped up the damage of your crits for each consecutive crit you made, starting at like... 100% and working its way up to a max of 250 or something. It would be rewarding for extended fights, which is what ADCs want, and it would make it still a viably good item in the late game. \n\nAlso, some expansion on what you mean with ER would also be nice; that just seems like the same build it currently has which is problematic since most of the ADCs that used it still also built crit; it still has no crit in that iteration, making it less viable on champs like Xayah(who really had old ER as the core of her build, maybe more than ANY other ADC), Crit MF, Ashe(who you guys have moved away from crit with changes to her passive but I still like crit best on her), Varus, etc.  I honestly would just like to see ER reverted or for it to even build out of something like Caufields+Zeal+Mana Crystal; give it less AD in exchange for crit and CDR and some kind of mana regen.\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot and just realized that not all of the picture is showing. Yes to the PD change; it sounds amazing. I don't care for either of those iterations of Stormrazor, however. And seeing what the passive of ER is, I'm a little more okay with that idea though I still want some crit in there.

Crit items were changed so they would be better against tanks and less volatile against squishies. With the consideration of reverting IE, has the crit item changes not panned out as Riot had hoped? What problems does reverting IE solve? Crit items were also changed because they were too strong in combination late game. Ad carries were considered mandatory because of the sheer power they brought later in the game. As a result, crit items were made more expensive so the power levels remained the same, but came online much later. The IE changes in direction two would make late game carries much stronger. Does Riot think mandatory ad carries are a problem, and if so, how would this IE change help or hinder the issue? Have you considered lowering the maximum possible power level of ad carries and putting that power somewhere else?","replies":[{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2018-12-22T01:59:59.239+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":10,"body":"There are a few issues we see with Crit items being effective against tanks and less useful against squishies post the changes. \n\n1.

Not to mention how tanks overall has been essentially removed because of conqueror and bruiser items being strong so the new IE passive feels useless.\n\n2. This was always going to be the case because of how adc will always be better in pro compared to regular play (coordination to make ADC effective). On top of how tanks is never going to be as popular in regular play because they generally are not as fun to play and neither do they have the same \"carry potential\". I can't believe you did not know about this before implementing the changes.\n\n3. Agreed, it is hard to get a feel of how impactful true dmg is when it is not as obvious. \n\nI have a short question that I haven't managed to find answer to:\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind making new rageblade passive the same as LW/Void staff? It doesn't make any sense to me, because you would not be able to buy both until very late game and then you will suffer from being forced into only having 15% penetration.
