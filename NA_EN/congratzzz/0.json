I'd recommend running a traceroute log with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) so we can determine where this may be happening along your routing. After loading up the app, simply plug **185.40.65.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, you can export the results of the trace to TEXT and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-03-05T18:40:52.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't lag on the Turkey Server, use the Turkey server.
