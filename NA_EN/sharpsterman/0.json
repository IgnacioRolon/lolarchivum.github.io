Challenger cannot just go against other challengers since then it'll take forever to find a match, same with Masters and high diamond players. The higher up you go the less people are in that particular rank. It'll just make queue times for those people be insanely high. It would not make sense to have a group of players only play against those with the same rank but then suddenly throw all that out the window the higher up you go. It would also create insanely lopsided matches since you will just steamroll over everything until you hit a massive wall where everyone in front of you is so much better than you in every single way possible. It would only create more frustrating matches than ever","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-07-23T20:47:24.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The infrastructure required to run the extra code just to _calculate_ all of the extra info needed to forcibly give people winning or losing matches would be far too expensive to maintain as a business. For a single player it wouldn't weigh on the system too much to run the few extra lines of code, but multiply that by every user concurrently logged in and playing on your region's server at any given time. That's a lot of times to re-run the same lines of code. And besides, it would double queue times because the pools of players available to matchmaking would have to be split in two (people owed wins and people owed losses). \n\n50% win rate is the outcome of the system, a byproduct. It's not a setpoint that Riot uses. With setpoints, you can tell the system what you want, in this case, to match players so that everyone has a 50% chance of winning, but it leaves out all sorts of important factors. So it fails to be accurate, and tends to over or under estimate players' skill levels. This leads to unintended imbalances in matchmaking, aka win and loss streaks. If you're playing at your actual skill level with people similar to you, you _will_ have a 50% win rate because your chances of winning against people of the same skill level as you are 50/50.\n\nIt's the same as a control system, the system attempts to correct for the changes in your MMR by matching you with people it thinks are at your new skill level, but because your MMR is still changing (be it from a win streak, or a loss streak), it messes up and can over/under shoot, and then wind up putting you in a match you don't belong in. Now multiply that by 10 because there are 10 different players who's MMR may or may not accurately reflect their true skill level. To be honest, I'm surprised matchmaking works at all since things can get ten times as wonky.\n\nRiot should be using PID control to more accurately predict people's skill level instead of whatever they're doing with MMR.\n\nSee here for an example of what your MMR would look like compared to your actual skill level. The colorful lines are examples of MMR as it changes over time, and the flat reference line is the setpoint (your new skill level / MMR) after a change has occurred. In reality your skill level is constantly changing and it won't look as flat, but the idea is to show how a system's outputs oscillate when responding to a change.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/PID_varyingP.jpg/320px-PID_varyingP.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Sharpsterman","date":"2018-08-10T01:52:01.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a perfect description; thank you. The over or under-estimation of skill is exactly what I feel during games. I will think of this when I play: The oscillation, as you describe it. It's just so frustrating that I can almost forecast my losses after my wins... That's just a system that is broken in my opinion. If you're right and there is no algorithm, just an MMR that makes up the whole team, then I think it would highly benefit if there was an algorithm that looks at time played, champion mastery, and game ratings (S, A, B, C, etc.), and determine what each players skill is. This math could be done passively on the account (like every 24 hours). Until then, I dispute my right to be furious at this 50/50 nonsensical system, forcing people to play like madmen and snowball or never climb the ranks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2018-07-21T21:28:26.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so question... if people like TF BLADES , and other high high elo players can get to master/challenger again and again regardless of their teammates and this so called \"forced 50% win/loss algorithm \" then why do you think it exist?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharpsterman","date":"2018-07-21T22:32:17.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Players get placed in a similar elo that they had last year.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2018-07-21T22:33:03.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TF BLADES constantly does unranked to challenger","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2018-07-21T21:06:59.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It matches you against players around your skill level.\nEventually you should lose as much as you win, because the players you're playing against are as good as you.\n\nIf you constantly improve you will have a higher win rate than loss rate.\nIf you think it's your team's fault and can't adapt to problems that occur, you will stagnate or fall.\n\nYou are silver 5.\nYou are placed against bronze players with silver players because have a history of losing to silver players.\nYou win a lot against bronze players.\nSo.\nYou are placed against silver players because you're beating lots of bronze players.\nYou win a lot still because something improved.
