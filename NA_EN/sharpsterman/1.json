I feel compelled to let everyone know that one of my favorite champions has seriously something wrong with her. For anyone that doesn&#039;t know, Kalista {{champion:429}} was undeservingly nerfed earlier this year. They lowered her base attack speed into the ground and gave her W a passive that gives her only a fraction of that attack speed back when she&#039;s nearby her support. Riot also nerfed her damage, and worked it into a passive that when the support and adc attack the same target it deals % damage, but only procs every ten seconds or so.\r\n\r\nI find it nearly impossible to win with this champion now, compared to before, when I was getting Pentakills. She&#039;s like a slower, weaker Kogmaw {{champion:96}}. I found a build path that somewhat makes her viable, but is only obtainable by heavy farming and lucky kills. The only way that I can even remotely keep my head above water is to buy Cull {{item:1083}}  and farm until late game. After Cull {{item:1083}} I go{{item:3153}} then {{item:3085}} then {{item:3031}}. Assuming the other adc has no kills and has been farming, this puts me on equal ground (capable of killing other champs). This build is usually finished at the 30min mark and at that point, it&#039;s usually too late because the other lanes are destroyed or well-fed. \r\n\r\nI played nine games today with Kalista and I lost them all, but one. I&#039;ve been playing Kalista off and on because she&#039;s fun, but I almost always lose.\r\n\r\nPlease, Riot. Just give her a little something to make life easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2016-09-16T02:24:39.091+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's in a weird spot right now, if they buff her she's too strong but nerfing her is gonna make her unplayable, she needs a rework to change abilities and make her not so susceptible to nerfs and buffs","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-09-16T03:50:58.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"she doesn't need a rework. there are probably 20 champions in line infront of her for a full vgu she needs a small little adjustment. like they did to illaoi. such a mini scale rework.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-16T02:07:41.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i played riven support with a Kalista ADC and we destroyed lane.

Kalista is a mistake champion that should never have been released, let alone be even remotely viable.\n\nShe needs a rework, not buffs\n\nAlso, comparing Kalista to Kog'Maw, of all champions, lol? They are completely different.","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-09-16T02:41:57.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Matezoide,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=exwoz8YN,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-09-16T02:21:17.759+0000)\n>\n> No, she wasnt.

I just think she was too good at too many things. But their is a lot of good in her kit, so I don't even feel like a complete rework is needed. \n\nOne of the bigger issues that people complained about his her passive kiting ability. Her kiting is probably better than Ashe with her frost arrows. I'm not actually sure about this one. Is this oppressive? is their a compensating weakness? (maybe out of combat movement)\n\nThe other Quirk, (which I actually like) is her neutral objective control. She has the best objective securing ability of the game. (But it does require a bunch of AA to set up, so it's not unconditional) This is most certainly a unique niche for an ADC. (especially for a non jungler) But is it a healthy niche? (if not, it would be a quick and dirty fix.)\n\nOther issue may have included the spear stacking mechanic's synergy with Hurricane. Not sure what Riot's opinion is on this.\n\nBut here's what I feel needs to be preserved. Her synergy with her Support. Her W passive and her ult offer great power when she is with her Support. This is counter balanced with the fact that her support is more so required to stick with her. (limiting the effectiveness of roaming supports like Bard) That alone would make her a unique ADC, and it also plays strait into her fantasy of being \"The spear of vengeance\" where her support takes up the oath. \n\nTo that end, we might be able to bolster her Utility. (a shorter cooldown on her ult, or maybe her W)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharpsterman","date":"2016-09-16T02:37:04.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's my understanding that Kalista's niche is that she can engage with 1 or more enemies and at the exact moment they realize they can't win, Rend takes their lives for epic multi-kills.
