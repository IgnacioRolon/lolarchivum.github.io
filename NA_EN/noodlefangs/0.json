Pros are not immune to the rules, and in fact many have been punished-even banned-for consistently acting up: http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/List_of_Competitive_Rulings\n2. Context doesn't matter since you were the one who chose to respond in a way that you knew was wrong. Only your chat log is shown because \n\nA. Only your behavior is being judged.\nAND\nB. Your behavior caused your punishment.\n\nCould they give players more info as to how to reform? Yes. Would it still be up to the players to use that information wisely? Yes.\n\n> Good riddance.
