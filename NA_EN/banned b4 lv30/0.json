He ended up with a score of 1/14/2 in a 20:46 game. Will he get in trouble for this? Or does the 1 kill and 2 assists reset the \"INTing detector\"? He stopped INTing towards the end of the game which leads me to believe he knows his limits to stop before getting punished. But the whole lobby saw it and I believe he got at least 5 reports that game.\n\nEdit: Since I've already had someone say \"He was probably just having a bad game and couldn't do anything!\"\n\nAfter dying many times top lane, he went to bot lane as a level 4 (while everyone else was around lvl 8 at this point), then ran into their bot lane 3 times in a row. Even the enemy was in /all chat saying \"Wow I feel bad for you guys I hope this guy gets banned.\" This was CLEAR intentional feeding.

I'll have to rethink about that one for a long hard while...  \nLike let it sink in that, creep waves/minion waves start at like 1 minute and 30 seconds in. By this the guy would have to die almost every 45 seconds to maintain such an insanely hard k/d to achieve this. There's effort being put into a timely death of perfectly managing to get back to lane just to die within like a 5 second span, from walking to base to the middle of top lane. \n\nI'm pretty confident that he'll get away with it because I'm more than confident throughout the years that reports are based on merits such as how many times a person is reported it adds up to a total to then later trigger a punishment to the said player.  (This being said, it doesn't get manually reviewed or inspected, which wouldn't be too surprising or alarming to many). \n\nIf you have concrete evidence as you say, you should probably go to the \"Support Tab, Submit a Ticket\" so it gets manually inspected, you can A) Provide your own evidence such as the ability during replays to record and highlight clips of this individual doing what they were doing, in this case intentional feeding. Provide it, open and close case. Player will most definitely be punished in this way.

If a person intentionally feeds they aren't going to be straight up the most basic textbook run it down the lane as you would imagine. In this case, it's pretty close if you ask me. 45 seconds per each death seems quite remarkable. Also the whole study can be pretty plausible but can have flaws such as all champions have differences in their base movement speed when they start the game. Expecting an intentional feeder to have a perfect flawless k/d/a such as a death a minute, seems too detectable, too obvious. You gotta keep in mind many people know how to easily work around this.
