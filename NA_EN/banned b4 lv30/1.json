We were down 7 turrets, 28 kills, 2 dragons, an inhibitor, and a rift herald at the 20 minute mark. It was 6 vs 34 kills at 20 minutes. Why would you refuse to ff that game situation?

Dies saying pff this game is lost ff15 , when 15mins came none of us wanted to surrender he actually said we are from these never surrender people and he start giving free kills on enemy team so they can end. The ff people are the most tilted people in the world. A person that is 0/8 thinking this game is over and trying to surrender like 10 times but the rest of the team can comeback... Yesterday i had a game in which my support wanted to surrender , cuz we were down 15 kills but i was fed so i split pushed so we can comeback. We cameback and support said you are bunch of idiots and left the game. Leaving us 4v5 but we still won. These people that want to ff , they dont want to win. I really dont want these type of players in my games but hey it is what it is , i cant choose my team before every single game.","replies":[{"poster":"Banned B4 Lv30","date":"2019-12-20T07:28:22.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, look.

The 4th dragon or baron (probably both) can't be contested due to inhibs down, and even a bronze team ahead that far should have the sense to ensure no steal- at least making it very difficult due to their JG being ahead in levels and hare-brained warding. At best the JG could take dragon while they grab baron.\n\nEven if not going for dragon/baron, the massive advantage in sheer muscle will allow them to simply dive the turrets with siege minions able to do the work even if they don't. Even Iron players would have to be spoon feeding themselves by wandering in the jungle solo while the rest of the team struggles to pick their next item... but if you're at that level, SO ARE YOU.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zyniya","date":"2019-12-20T06:48:39.776+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I always assume the \"Never FF\" people are so tilted they want to tilt the rest of their team by wasting their time lol","replies":[{"poster":"Banned B4 Lv30","date":"2019-12-20T06:57:24.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao, thats a very plausible theory you have there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-20T07:26:19.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because the second you start thinking about surrendering is the second you're throwing away a winnable game.

Idk why I would tilt on LoL. Splatoon is really fun tho, you should try it if you haven't.\nAnyways, the reason I barely surrender is I almost never pay attention to the surrender box and the reason for that is every single match someone wants to surrender and majority of the time, the surrender makes no sense. I only click yes if I see others not really enjoying the game or there's like 3 yes. If we're premades, I will always go yes. \nThere's too many surrenders. I really just want to play a full match. Its so hard to get those nowadays. Its not over until the Nexus explodes. It's easy to overextend in the end of the game and one teamfight decides it all because of how long respawn times get. Surrendering is just locking in that defeat.","replies":[]}]}
