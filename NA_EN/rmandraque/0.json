So I got that 20minute delay thing now, any way you could help? it really wasnt my fault, the lag was not on my end as far as I could tell (I know enough be really certain, I checked various things). For the game crashing I lowered the quality a bit and it should be fine I hope, but it had only happened once before.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T16:57:50.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even though the disconnection wasn't intentional, an account can receive a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) after leaving multiple games and not just one.  Leaving still causes negative experiences for players, and the only way to remove the lower priority queue is to stay in your game consistently.  While we cannot remove that, I'm happy to help with any connection issues.
