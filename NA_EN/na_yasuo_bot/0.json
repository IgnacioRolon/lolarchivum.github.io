If it's still not wanting to work, hit up our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can help walk you through the process!","replies":[{"poster":"Na Yasuo Bot","date":"2017-05-07T21:34:10.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help i guess i have to wait but its fine","replies":[]}]}]}
