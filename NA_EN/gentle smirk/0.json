Been only playing ranked for the past few days now, and every day I get a couple of queue&#039;s where somebodies champ gets banned on accident and they decide to troll and go draven top, or people are just fed up with previous games to begin with, and then choose a troll pick and flame the team before we can even get into the game. Since I refuse to play games with such trolls, I&#039;ve taken to dodging when nobody else will, and doing such has cost me hours of time in wait for the queue block to be over. I&#039;d rather dodge a queue though, since playing with said trolls would be almost torturous. Anyway, does anybody have any advice on how to get others to dodge when I&#039;ve already dodged several times in a day?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-14T03:44:17.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont play ranked, easiest solution.
