My only question is, once worlds is over will we be able to still flash the team icon or is it now just a summoner icon afterwards ? If anyone could help me out on this that would be great :)  {{item:2052}}","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2015-10-20T00:28:33.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah, I see that you're interested in representing your team while in-game! The 2015 Worlds Championship Team Icons will only have the in-game animations available temporarily. You can find more information about it here:\n\n- http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/welcome-worlds-shop\n\nSpecifically here:\n\n> If you have a World Championship Team icon equipped during Worlds month, you can display a **special in-game emote** of your teamâ€™s logo by activating the mastery emote binding. After Patch 5.21, the emotes will retire as we clean up the confetti, but the icons will stick around.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-10-20T12:26:35.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why remove the in game effect? I don't see the harm in letting them remain. It's pretty cool, and it's actually why I bought my icon in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}
