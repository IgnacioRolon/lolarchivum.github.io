The issue with these scripting programs is that when you right click to tell your champion to move it sends a ‘WAYPOINT_UPDATE’ packet that both the client and server can see. The scripts where you hold down a single key that does everything for you? They send 50-100 updates a second. Not even the Korean overlords are right clicking that much. All Riot need to do is put in a filter that detects who is sending updates at that speed and they’d catch every single scripter.”\r\n\r\nOK. So why doesn't Riot stop this from happening? Are they afraid of having the servers ddosed?","replies":[]}
