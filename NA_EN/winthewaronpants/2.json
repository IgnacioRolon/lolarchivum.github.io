I forgot if his ult was magical or physical but if it's physical i'm pretty sure that he can get all procs with just a few hits of that ult and can hit multiple people. Same deal with Mf ult. I remember when Lucian first came out, building triforce first or early for proc harass was the meta, now people want the shred and cdr to get more spells and passive procs in a fight. I think they geared black cleaver too much for juggernaut/top laners who want as FEW damage items as possible to maximize their high AD scaling abilities and then only have to go tanky afte that, like garen, darius, illaoi, wukong and so they can BEAT tanks and not just get out-tanked and out-damaged by absurd tank champs and their high base damages.

If they have low base then they won't exist, not in lane, not in the jungle, not even as supports. \n\n>also not all ADCS are abusing cleaver\n\nADCs should not be incentivized to build Cleaver at all. at least not without a sacrifice of damage. It was reworked to have a clear purpose as an item for Fighters and Juggernauts, not so Lucian and MF could shred entire teams with monstrous ranged AoE. It should have low AD to compensate for the strength of % shred and the stronger Phage passive. Juggernauts should be able to get by with Cleaver and 1 more AD item just with their high scaling and base; ADCs should have to accept low AD in exchange for the team-value Cleaver gives.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkomantis","date":"2016-09-23T16:20:20.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1EczTFMB,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-09-23T13:08:41.793+0000)\n> what we need is for flat armor pen to be less effective against tanks. making it apply before % pen/shred would go a good way to remedying it. \n\nNobody wants to go back to the Season 1 or 2 penetration.

Depending on whether or not it is total armor penetration or bonus penetration all these armor penetration apply accordingly to base armor and total armor. Also note the difference between armor penetration and armor reduction. Armor reduction actually reduces armor so it increases physical damage dealt by everyone on his/her team while armor penetration \"artificially reduces\" armor for the wielder of armor penetration so only the wielder deals increased physical damage.\n\nIf someone builds these items {{item:3142}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3006}}, and is able to stack up armor reduction from the Black Cleaver to 6 times on an enemy champion (which is tough on most adcs because they have to focus whoever is the closest, unless you are {{champion:21}} {{champion:236}} , etc...). That enemy champion will have both their base armor and bonus armor reduced by 30%.\n\nTotal armor= 0.7x + 0.7y, where x is base armor and y is bonus armor\n\n7% armor penetration comes into play, but this time only the wielder benefits from it:\n\nTotal (artificial) armor = O.7(0.93)x + 0.7(0.93)y\n\n45% bonus armor penetration from whatever Last Whisper upgrade we have:\n\nTotal (artificial) armor = 0.7(0.93)x + 0.7(0.93)(0.55)y\n\nAnd then flat armor penetration comes into play:\n\nTotal (artificial) armor = 0.7(0.93)x + 0.7(0.93)(0.55)y - (20+10+10)\n\nIf we use your example, someone with 100 base armor and 200 bonus armor, his/her resultant armor should be\n\n0.7(0.93)(100) + 0.7(0.93)(0.55)(200) - 40 = 96.71\n\nStacking multiple percentage armor penetration and percentage armor reduction items/abilities/passives together would only result in diminished value compared to the hypothetical situation where they stack up additively. Sure it still reduces a crap ton of armor, both literally and artificially, but the wielder has to damage the same target 6 times. Having 200 bonus armor late game means that this enemy under attack is most likely a bruiser (ignoring the fact only some of the true tanks have 100-ish base armor in late game and they will most likely build more armor than that anyways and have some sort armor/defensive steroid even if they build only 200 bonus armor). If someone with these items/runes/masteries is allowed to burst bruisers without getting retaliated by gap closers/cc/peeling/escapes from the enemy team to prevent them from stacking the Black Cleaver, it's utterly unrealistic unless you are talking about extremely low elo players and new players. For true tanks to get armor shredded by the Black Cleaver 6 times (with also more armor than that), the wielder of these items would most likely be eaten alive by the rest of the team, given how the tanks are most likely on top of him/her. On top of that, the less bonus armor an enemy has, the more diminished the value of this build is. You only most often see this build when the wielder is facing a very tanky enemy team ({{champion:201}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:44}} ), you won't see someone build  both {{item:3036}} / {{item:3033}} and {{item:3071}} against tankish bruisers because it's not very effective against them.\n\nAs for your magic reduction/penetration formula (the relationship between magic reduction and magic penetration works just like that between armor reduction and armor penetration), I will just do a quick calculation (counting runes in a realistic view and masteries and assuming the wielder of {{item:3001}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3151}}  is level 18 and takes Cunning tree in their mastery page and unrealistically someone has 100 base magic resistance... <on a quick note, the highest base magic resistance a champion can have is 53.4, which is way lower than the highest base armor obtainable>):\n\nTotal resultant (artificial) magic resistance = (100 - 8.333)(0.65) + (200 - 16.667)(0.65) -  7.83 - 8.4 - 30 = 132.52\n\nIf we have {{item:3091}} as well and it's also fully stacked on a target,\nTotal resultant (artificial) magic resistance = (100 - 16.667)(0.65) + (200 - 33.333)(0.65) - 7.83 - 8.4 - 30 = 116.27\n\nIf the wielder takes Ferocity tree instead ({{champion:63}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:30}}),\nTotal resultant (artificial) magic resistance = (100 - 8.333)(0.93)(0.65) + (200 - 16.667)(0.93)(0.65) -  7.83 - 30 = 128.4075\nIf the wielder have {{item:3091}} fully stacked on a target and take ferocity tree,\nTotal resultant (artificial) magic resistance = (100 - 16.667)(0.93)(0.65) + (200 - 33.333)(0.93)(0.65) - 7.83 - 30 = 113.295\n\nHonestly even if we don't include Wit's End, the numbers of magic resistance and armor are not that far off from each other, not to mention how most mages have more burst damage than AD champions (some are more so than others like {{champion:45}} ) and CC to allow them to deal even more magic damage and do more spell rotations. Many mages are more CC-packed than ADCs and some bruisers as well. It's also not plausible for one to stack 200 bonus magic resistance unless they build 4 or more magic resistance items  (which makes the only ones capable of doing so tanks) and it is also practically impossible for one to have 100 base magic resistance. Also having more magic resistance means percentage magic penetration will be more effective on them, compared to bonus armor penetration from {{item:3036}} {{item:3033}}, as it penetrates both base magic resistance and bonus magic resistance. Mages also stack more AP than AD champions stacking AD. Most FOTM mages either have high AP ratios (for burst damage) or consistent magic damage packed with more CC to allow them to actually deal more damage in a spell rotation than an ADC/bruiser will. If they aren't focused down or they are pseudo-tanky mages ({{champion:68}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:50}}, etc...), they are more destructive than an ADC with their (AOE) CC and damage once they get into range, hence there are more armor reduction/penetration options than magic reduction/penetration options.\n\nThere are always exceptions to the above statements, but all in all I think armor penetration is in a good spot right now.\n\n##TL;DR Please understand how armor/magic reduction/penetration work before commenting on the issue.\n\n\n#(Realistically speaking, magic resistance should be treated this way,\n\n\n#For mages who take Cunning tree,\n#Total resultant (artificial) magic resistance = (_53.4_ <highest base magic resistance obtainable> - 5.268)(0.65) + (200 - 19.732)(0.65) - 7.83 - 8.4 - 15 or 30 = _117.23_ or _102.23_\n\n\n#For mages who take Ferocity tree,\n#Total resultant (artifical) magic resistance = (_53.4_ - 5.268)(0.93)(0.65) + (200 - 19.732)(0.93)(0.65) - 7.83 - 15 or 30 <most likely 30 because most mages using Ferocity tree make use of {{item:3151}} as well> = _115.2378_ or _100.2378_\n\n#The numbers are not as far off as you think they are compared to armor...)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kyovulpes","date":"2016-09-24T11:09:50.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No more Raid-boss tanks please.

Essentially, if an ability damage-focused champion doesn't have % hp damage, they're only gonna be useful killing squishies, since tanky targets would survive their burst. If that's the case, they have to be REALLY good at reliably killing squishies, since that's all they're good for. This is not fun to play against as the squishy, since it often means an instant grey screen with nothing you could've done to prevent it short of not being there at that time. Talon and Rengar are primary offenders of this sort of champion; any time they're viable, they're incredibly annoying to play against as an ADC because one-shotting from stealth is the only thing they can do. \n\nGiving a champion % hp damage means they can be useful at something besides bursting squishies, so their upfront burst damage to squishy targets doesn't have to be ridiculous for them to be viable. \n\nFurthermore, champions with % hp damage aren't all the tank slayers people make them out to be. With three exceptions, all sources of % hp damage in League are physical or magical, so building armor or magic resistance will reduce the damage you take. So a tank who's itemizing properly should never fear a champion with % hp damage, as long as the tank isn't super behind in gold. The three exceptions? % hp true damage, found exclusively on Fiora, Vayne, and Garen fighting the villian. These champions ARE tank destroyers; this is something the designers intended when creating their kits. They have weaknesses elsewhere in their kits to compensate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SteelMankind","date":"2016-09-24T04:33:46.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol at the people complaining about tanks here. The counter to flat armor pen is actually to buy armor, believe it or not. Not going to take my word for it because I'm Silver? Let me explain, with math. \n\nEach point of armor pen you buy causes the physical damage the target takes to be calculated as if they have one point of armor less. However, point for point, armor is MUCH cheaper than flat armor pen. Like, a lot cheaper. Rengar can buy Duskblade, Ghostblade, and a Serrated Dirk for 7k and get 40 armor pen. Shen can buy Randuins, Tabi, and Sunfire for 7k, and get 140 armor. Rengar will then do damage to Shen as if he only had 100 bonus armor, but guess what? 100 bonus armor is quite a lot, especially when you consider that Shen still has another 60 base armor. \n\nBlack Cleaver, Last Whisper, and its upgrades are a different story entirely. Yes, they do kinda shit on armor stacking tanks. From the perspective of a tank player I'd imagine they feel no fun to play against, but I'm sure every AD champ who builds damage would like to be able to solo the tank.\n\nTL;DR: Flat penetration and percentage penetration are different statistics entirely. I believe the OP, and most of the posters in this topic, are saying they're complaining about armor penetration in general when they're really complaining about percentage penetration.","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-09-24T05:46:50.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the whole concept of full armor pen builds are stupid.
