I had around 85k IP before preseason and that's supposed to be multiplied by 6.5 to convert to Blue Essence. Just logged in today and it seems my IP did not get multiplied at all and I have about 85k BE. Not sure if this is supposed to happen :/","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-11-07T03:50:47.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"85k IP is 1:1 converted to BE, it's your old BE that's multiplied by 6.5 before being added. (Since it sounds like you were expecting your 85k ip to be multiplied by 6.5 to give you around 550k ish BE, which isn't how the conversion works.)","replies":[{"poster":"Jonezkin","date":"2017-11-07T13:30:18.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't it only suppose to multiply the blue essence from loot and not your ip that you had? Or that was what I understood from this:\n\nWhat will happen to my existing blue essence?\n\nTo ensure your existing blue essence is not losing value during the transition to the newer, bluer essence, it will be multiplied by 6.5 and added to your IP balance to calculate your total blue essence value.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-11-07T14:57:00.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I said yes.\n\nIP is converted 1:1 (which is the same as not being multiplied), and old BE is multiplied by 6.5, then those numbers are added.\n\nOP seemed to be asking about why their IP wasn't being multiplied.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T03:27:17.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, I can't believe you just made me do all of this math this late at night xD!!!!\n\nSo, this is probably a small visual error right now. I can see on the backend that your BE was multiplied, your old runes were converted to BE, and it was added to your 85K ~ IP. Do me a favor and try refreshing your client and let me know if you see the new grand total!","replies":[]}]}
