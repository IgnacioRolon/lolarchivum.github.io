I survived though. I came back to lane and beat his ass. But I did learn that, if nothing else, you have to respect Yasuo's early damage, even if you counter him in lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-06-10T09:35:36.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SYS Navie,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7TchMJck,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-10T09:28:49.874+0000)\n>\n> I&#039;ve been playing yas for a bit now and i cant decide wether he is op compared to other champions take fizz, shaco and ekko for example, i think they are all more powerful than him.

His late game is stronger than all three of theirs save maybe Ekko's, but he's such a little bitch early on that it makes up for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Nifsti","date":"2015-06-10T18:06:38.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E+E\n{{champion:157}} {{summoner:4}}{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:3}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Jamž","date":"2015-06-10T18:11:07.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Nifsti","date":"2015-06-10T18:12:31.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:114}}   Reported {{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jamž","date":"2015-06-10T18:14:54.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"GG AFK {{champion:92}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nifsti","date":"2015-06-10T18:19:13.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nvm honored \n\n{{item:3060}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3023}} {{item:3056}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LegitBacon66","date":"2015-06-10T11:30:16.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His kit has come to the point where it is so awkward to play him.
