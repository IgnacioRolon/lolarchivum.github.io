Here are a few tips I&#039;ve learned to make it more efficient \r\n\r\nWhat it is: Walking up to get free harass or zone when YOUR minion is about to die. This will force the enemies to chose between taking damage or missing farm\r\n\r\nDo:\r\n-Get in a free auto while they&#039;re in animation for their auto\r\n-Use a strong poke spell for guaranteed damage, they will not be able to dodge without missing cs\r\n-Transition into an all in if the enemies are low enough for you to completely kill them\r\n-Try to capitalize on them going for the cannon. They won&#039;t want to miss this one and you can usually get a ton of free damage\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t:\r\n-Stay in minion range if you use an auto to harass. This will soak damage back to you and negate all the free damage you got on them so you&#039;re equal again.\r\n-Use spells to harass on every minion, if you do you won&#039;t have mana to all in them later. Use autos sometimes instead, it racks up.\r\n-Force the use of trading stance when you know minions you can cs are low. You will miss cs this way, and unless it transitions into a big zone or cs lead you not gain much out of it.\r\n-You don&#039;t have to all in every time, this is something I see a lot. It usually pushes the wave if you don&#039;t have all single target and then you are open to being ganked.\r\n\r\nWith all these things in mind, you should be able to use trading stance more efficiently.","replies":[{"poster":"Gary B Enkelis","date":"2016-08-17T22:07:57.402+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is awesome information!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-08-18T04:59:59.375+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1\n\nThis is stuff it took me quite a while to figure out when I was learning LoL that doesn't seem to be discussed as much as other skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-08-18T18:09:10.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sticky then? \n\nAlso what exactly is zoning, and how does it different from harassing?","replies":[{"poster":"Camp Top","date":"2016-08-18T18:15:29.579+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chromatic Eagle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ugkXjzeq,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2016-08-18T18:09:10.148+0000)\n>\n> Sticky then? \n> \n> Also what exactly is zoning, and how does it different from harassing?\n\nZoning is when you position yourself between the enemy champion and the minions. It will keep them from farming because they are scared you will damage them if they walk up. You can move up to zone when you have the upper hand on the enemy laner. If they walk up, punish them and maybe get a kill. If not you are free to last hit their creeps and they get none. This is sometimes dangerous because you are further up the lane, so the enemy jungler May gank you easilySorry this is a wall of text I'm on mobile.\n\nEdit: shend ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gary B Enkelis","date":"2016-08-18T18:14:38.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zoning is like using the imaginary Circle of Threat around your champion to fear people from moving close. You can use it to keep them away from minions they want to CS, or use it in other creative ways. You can zone them away from even getting experience.\n\nIf you don't want to get grabbed by {{champion:53}} and you stand further back, then {{champion:53}} is zoning. He doesn't have to throw his grab. Once he does then his zone of influence goes down. Kind of imagine an imaginary zone of death around the champion when it's possible for them to hurt you.\n\nUsing {{champion:51}} 's autoattack range to scare people from walking close is zoning.\n\nI think harassing is like attacking them. Getting good trades.\n\nUsing {{champion:51}} 's autoattack range to hit them when they can't hit you is harassing.

Good list.  \n\nThis is one thing I learned as support is to look at my minions health and the drop harass when one is low.

Especially helpful on a low health Soraka cause you know they want that cannon so you get free health on it.  That and you can zone quite effectively by just waiting for one minion (cannon or melee prefered) to get low and go for poke then instead of just poking the minute your spell is up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-08-17T18:29:18.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a S4 support main, I knew some of this but not all of it.
