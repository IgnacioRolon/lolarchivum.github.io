He leveled a new account over a few months and typical of new accounts it got placed into silver 5. He was so excited not to be in bronze so he started to play more ranked. Lo and behold, he began to climb pretty fast. Somehow he managed to climb using sona despite seeing a lot of yasuos everywhere and zeds. I thought he&#039;d just be able to climb a little but infact he didn&#039;t. He made it all the way to platinum 2. Looking back he says he didn&#039;t really improve at all.

Oh, and flanking is just one of the ways to get free kills/freelo with him in bronze. With rylai's, you can more often than not go the whole \"front door\" strategy where you r/q/e/w directly onto them and nab free kills that way.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-01-01T14:55:41.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now let you inform you why you're wrong about {{item:3123}} . And no, I'm not being cocky/belittling you. \n\nTank Vlad (Protobelt, Visage, etc) is exactly why Vlad is considered weak right now. The core of that build is the combination of sustain+tankiness to simply stat-check most champions. Yes, GW heavily affects that build. \n\nHowever, any Vlad main knows that full AP (Abyssal, Zhonya's, Ionian, Rylai's, Deathcap, Void Staff) is the way to play him. Average (between CR and non) 182.5% AP on a 3 second CD late game; more than enough 1-shot any non-tank. \n\n___________\n\nFull AP Vlad is all about his absurd damage; not the healing at all. The healing is just a superfluous bonus to me. \n\nGrievous Wounds does little-to-nothing to Vlad for this reason. Outside of all-ins, you won't have GW consistently applied, so if you don't 1 shot him, he will sustain up anyway. \n\nIn addition, full AP Vlad heals more than Vlad with Visage, though it seems ironic. The healing you get even through GW is enough to turn most 1v1s either way. \n\nIf Vlad times his trades/engages around Crimson Rush, you simply don't win vs him unless you counter him as specific all-in champ AND outplay him. Why? Because he simply won't let you engage on him and can out-trade you unless you're Irelia/Riven with hexdrinker. \n\n_______\n\nA well played Vlad is good at consistently solo carrying games anywhere below plat because he's almost immune to aggression while having windows where he can heavily out-trade most champions. Even if you get camped, you can out-play and can't be safely dove. Even if they send 3-4 top, in many cases you can get out; sometimes even turn. This makes him an extremely strong split-pusher AND teamfighter. \n\nHowever, you can't do that if you use the tank build. You must play AP if you want to be consistently successful on Vlad. \n\n___________\n\n#I honestly love it when people buy Executioner's Calling vs me because its over-priced AD vs a Vlad that's being played properly. \n\nI'd be much more scared of {{item:3044}} or {{item:3133}} early, or another defensive/offensive component that would actually make a difference post-9.

Most plats are good with 2-3 Champs, and only play them. Silver players are usually good with 2-3 champions, but they BELIEVE they are good with 15-20.

Also it's impossible to get them to go for objectives if they get some kills they think they are god and just go around chasing kills.  \n\nAfter couple weeks of dealing with this i started to look up my teammates for 10 straight games and i kid you not average kda if you take me out is less then 2 on my team or people just set on losing they pick champs they don't know how to play.   And most of them after they die they say gg and wants to give up or they feed and want to give up they refuse to believe anyone but them can win the game.  And then blame game  starts happening and it's never there fault always someone else's then the flaming begins this is just about every game even on games you win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"M4Shz","date":"2017-12-09T16:21:46.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm all this. I'm stuck in bronze atm due to afk'ers almost every game and team mates that feed insanely. Only games I have alot of deaths is when i've been trying to save an ADC that goes solo against 3+ players. Been playing mobas since Dota 1 :) \n\nSo i know very well what I can do better and not, but when i play with friends that are Diamond5-2 i manage to outplay them and they are freaking out over me only being in bronze. So ELO hell does exist. Probably in all leagues not just bronze, but I can definitely say that a shitty team of trollers and ppl that just rage and afk is a huge problem from what iv'e seen so far. And its my main reason for not being higher.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-01-01T07:24:04.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I started playing league in season 3. I was bronze 5 - bronze 2 the first 6 months, I managed to get to silver 3 at the end of Season 3. After that, I had a constant climb.

You're the only one holding yourself back. You may think it's your allies, but it is you. If someone plays bad and you get toxic or tilted, it is partly your fault, because you have a weak mind. Sorry, but that's the truth.\nYou can learn to accept it and change your attitude. a good attitude makes you play better, carry more games and win more often. That's a fact, I do not need statistics or conspiracy theories to say that.\n\nStart every game with the will to win, do not even think of losing. If you lose anyways, than swallow it, it happens. Just keep going and try as hard as possible. Do not flame and blame your team, because what has happened, can not be undone. It doesn't matter who is at fault, because you cannot change it.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-01-01T08:33:16.379+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He didn't change at all.
