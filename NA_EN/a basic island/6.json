I'm pretty sure riven and yasuo have some harder mechanics than lee sin does. \n\nHowever, lee sin's combination of being hard to play, relying on a single target skillshot (that's not even that big) for damage and mobility, and falling off late game, in addition to not even doing tons of damage like yasuo or riven is what puts him above other champs in terms of difficulty. \n\nIn lower elo though you can build damage and one shot adcs.","replies":[{"poster":"billking123","date":"2020-02-24T15:16:44.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the basics of lee congratulations!!!

Hardest thing is timing ward hop with 120 ping. Guess its just how I work, but I find yasuo and (especially) riven mechanics harder. \n\nFor yasuo, using his dashes was more difficult to actually master. Without ample knowledge of almost exactly how far his dash goes, my options are limited. Waaay too many yasuos give first blood dashing under tower by accident. Then controlling your movement to dash the correct way, while keeping in mind if you spam dash you wont be able to get out in teamfights or trading. That's what you gotta do to use yasuo in high elo I've heard. Over my head, honestly. \n\nOverall though yasuo can be pretty braindead just because he can be a mobile bruiser with twice the damage of an adc. Kinda bs in low elo. Such a pain in the ass since I main adc now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-04T20:20:23.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could not jungle lee sin even in bronze its just too much to keep up with.
