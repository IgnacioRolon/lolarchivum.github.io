If you are losing lane you aren't going to buy a tiamat now because it pushes your wave and you are losing hence the enemy is just going to freeze it at their tower.\n\nIf you are winning your lane then yes free pushing so you can make plays elsewhere, that's the point of winning your lane, tiamat will help with that.","replies":[]}]}
