I play immobile mages obviously, and it is so hard to do anything during the laning phase against Zed. His harass is stronger, his passive lets him farm more easily, you can't follow his roams well because of the high chance of him turning around and engaging on you, you can't out push him since he's manaless, the delay on his ult's damage will often cause some players to burn their flash in a futile attempt at survival, he can tower dive with ease thanks to his ability to shadow swap, and even if you go even with him in lane it is likely that he just roams bot and picks up a kill or two there, and then just become absolutely oppressive. He can build Hexdrinker/Maw without really harming his buildpath, while a mage needs three items (mana/regen, zhonya, boots) before they can even co-exist within 1000 units of him. \n\nHow would you feel if they were lee sin or yasuo pick levels\n\n-Since I can play all five roles equally well, when Zed is picked often I will switch to another lane for awhile until he is brought back into line.
