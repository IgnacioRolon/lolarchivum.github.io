So Item sets are part of a known bug with macOS Sierra. The current workaround is to create/edit your item sets on another computer not running Sierra. The item set changes will be visible on your Mac, since item sets are stored server-side. Runes can be added by double-clicking on the Rune, but the issue with dragging them is related to the same issue with Item Sets at the moment. \n\nWe're currently tracking the bugs for macOS 10.12 Sierra on [this post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/bJx6P0hX-known-bugs-in-macos-1012-sierra).
