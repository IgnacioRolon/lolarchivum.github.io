A game I have been playing for around two years now and it has really made me think about Riot and how they &quot;care&quot; about the casual PlayerBase and there Community. Forwarning I do not intend to say that I hate Riot Altogether or that they are a scummy corporate business with zero cares for consumers(Note I DID NOT SAY, PLAYERS). Just to introduce myself, I main Rengar {{champion:107}} and like I said I&#039;ve been playing for quite a while. Onto what I was temp-banned for was simply communicating the way I do. In the game, I lost my mid farm because my Jungler decided that I would not have gotten it. I called him an idiot because he refused to realize that the wave was freezing and or slow pushing so I would have gotten it. Already I know that if a Rioter were to respond to that they would something like &quot;No form of &quot;Verbal Abuse&quot; is allowed no matter the situation&quot;. This here is the problem too me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE(*** MY PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN SET TO CHAT BAN BUT I&#039;D LIKE TO CONTINUE MY DISCUSSION***)UPDATE thank you, Eric\r\n\r\nIn my opinion and probably a lot of others. I as a Citizen Of the U.S.A should have the freedom of speech to say whatever I want as long as I do not endangers someones life Ex. Giving out personal home address, IP, Phone number, ETC. Trash talking and disrespecting players in many forms is common throughout mostly all Multi-player Games and is allowed and unpunished because all in all its just a game. there is no reason for you to want someone banned from a game because they said something mean to you as we are just strangers on the internet and what we say has no impact on your life. The mute button is there if you do not like seeing the things people say to you but some people like me don&#039;t care and may see it as sport to argue with someone because it can be entertaining.   To end it all off I think the Riot should let us players say what we want unless it is giving out private information. Thank you","replies":[]}
