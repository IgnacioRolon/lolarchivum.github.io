Like aspects are these powerful entitys who entrust people to be gifted an immense amount of power(unless its pantheon and then that aspect is just a bitch) , so far we have the backstorys of the other aspects but people are kind of jumping to the whole she&#039;s a child or she looks unrealistic(even though league is the furthest thing from realistic). I think people are forgetting that in the case such as Taric even AFTER the process of climbing targon, the aspect of the mountain still looked into his soul to determine if he was truly worthy right? Despite the whole absurd amount of aspects within this time period. Twilight is defined as the &quot;soft glowing light from the sky when the sun is right below the horizon&quot; and taking into mind of that definition, it makes you think of being on the brink of waking up and just overall gives you a comfortable safe warm vibe. People seem to think twilight has something to do with stars and thats more of aurelion&#039;s specialty but, point of my ramblings is that Zoe was probably chosen because an ideal child perfectly embodies the feeling of twilight(even though children are monsters irl) Innocence, whimsical, bright, comforting, and the border between night and daytime/sun and moon. I think it was a genius idea to create a child aspect, give the people of runeterra some joy and truly emobdy the wonder of twilight! Besides its not as if we dont have three other grown ass serious aspects. Thanks for stopping to read my ramblings, just my thoughts!\r\n\r\nAlso (Star Guardian Zoe im calling it now)","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-11-04T05:00:19.098+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"All the aspects are bitches.  Pantheon is just the biggest bitch of the lot.\n\nBut, anyway, I think the problem that some people are having is that, at present, Zoe doesn't really fit the tone of the Targon lore thus fare provided.  Leona was rewritten to go through a whole murder zealot phase. All the aspects became complicit in the enslavement and betrayal of their friend, Sol.  Diana is still a murderer.  And Taric, who is the good one, still had to go through the backstory of being a complete and utter incompetent as a military leader, and was exiled from his home.\n\nThey all have this theme that plays on the old Greek Tragedies, in one way or another.  \n\nThen, there's this girl who looks like she jumped out of a cartoon and sounds like she's about to start singing a song out of High School Musical or something.  She doesn't quite fit the tone that the other champions seem to be pushing toward.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean she doesn't fit the story.  As of now, the Space Targonians have no personality, no clear motivation, no understandable criteria for how they pick Aspects, and no actual explanation to how their powers work.  So Riot can do whatever they want, and it will make as much sense for the Targon story as anything else.  It just means that the Greek Tragedy theme is no longer prevalent, it may never have even been intentional.  That's really it.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-11-04T13:55:05.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Dienekes,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5w2ZQFAN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-04T05:00:19.098+0000)\n>\n> All the aspects are bitches.

Sol makes everything we’ve seen an Aspect do utterly pointless by comparison. \n\nIf they haven’t visited in eons (seems unlikely since people have stories about Aspects appearing at separate times, meaning the legends have to be early enough to not have been meshed together as happens with actually old legends). Then they have no purpose being on the planet anyway. Get out and let people be people. By the very least, if that is true, they are incompetent strategists. Always learn about the terrain of where you’re going to be fighting. That’s literally in one of the earlier chapters of Sun Tzu. \n\nLeona and Diana were legitimate believers in the divinity of the Targonians before their fusions. Hell they were only set on their current path because of their religious beliefs that we know are inherently wrong. \n\nThe Aspects do actually seem to care a bit, because of how Diana post transformation goes right back to change the religious beliefs of the Solari to include worship of the moon.  Not to say “Hey it’s all a lie made by some aliens. Ones literally inside me now, here, they have the power to create visions and enslave space dragons, I’m sure they can just convince a bunch of old people.”\n\nNow, sure. The Aspects are so vague and their magic is mostly bullshit to make the plot move. Maybe once Riot explains them it will all work out.

Many of them are actually kind of contradictory. This means they’re going to have to leave it vague, and have the mystery itself be the point. Which is a terrible idea when it is so tied to very physical champions identities and the fate of the world.\n\nOr, it will have to be explained in a way that successfully answers every question and tangentially makes it so the path they chose (to infest normal people) was actually the smartest decision available to them. When done this has the potential to not hit that mark and it makes everyone involved look all the dumber. Or it feels completely contrived that it’s set up exactly that specific way that allows them to infest some people and grant visions but not just tell everyone on the mountain what to do, and a host of other problems. \n\nI have never read one that actually succeeded at being a satisfying answer.

Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Líf (identical with the Old Norse feminine noun meaning \"life, the life of the body\") and Lífþrasir (Old Norse masculine name from líf and þrasir. Lexicon Poëticum defines this name as \"Livæ amator, vitæ amans, vitæ cupidus\", \"Líf's lover, lover of life, zest for life\"), sometimes anglicized as Lif and Lifthrasir—female and male respectively—are two humans who are foretold to survive the events of Ragnarök by hiding in a wood called Hoddmímis holt, and after the flames have abated, to repopulate the newly risen and fertile world.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRagnarok is the event that kills a lot of gods in Norse mythology (and night can be used as an analogy in literature for death). The two survivors, Líf and Lífþrasir, repopulating the world would bring about a new age of life (and dawn can be used as an analogy of life in literature). \n\nZoe is the aspect of _TWILIGHT_ (which twilight can be the time between night and dawn). Zoe is also \"at the _end_ of childhood\", which for females could be a twilight between youth and motherhood.\n\nDoes this mean that Zoe is Líf, and her purpose as an aspect is to survive some impending ragnarok event in Runeterra so she can repopulate it? Also, does this mean that there will be another champion that will come out at some point that is a male Lífþrasir, and is in love with Zoe?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-11-04T13:56:38.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general I hope that we'll get some insight into the aspects with her.\nFor most champs the whole \"aspect\"-thing seems more like an sidenote,it doesn't really feel like {{champion:44}} {{champion:131}} or {{champion:89}} share their bodies with another entity(I mean at least in {{champion:80}}s case it is kinda justified)","replies":[]}]}
