When champions like Shyvana or Renekton exist in the game, who are both naturally tanky and deal good damage, why do we need other tanks--who trade their damage for utility--to be...well, not as tanky?\n\nMao and Shen having the MR weakness seems excessive, considering they have quite a few other weaknesses. Also Banshee's Veil is bought by nearly everybody these days, particularly tanks/fighters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SmashGizmo","date":"2014-06-21T10:06:49.812+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Currently, there are 7 Melee characters in our game without MR/level:\nKassadin, Kayle, Maokai, Poppy, Shen, Singed, Yasuo\n\nI can tell you the general thought process behind why we consciously have omitted MR/level on Kassadin and Yasuo, and I can wager some guesses that I'm nearly sure are right for why they were left out on all the others as well.\n\nKassadin's passive provides passive defense versus Magic damage.  While it's not terribly interesting, it is still more interesting than a base stat, so basically any power budget we could spend on making this guy better vs. Magic Damage is better spent on the passive than on base stats.\n\nYasuo's passive is mostly meant as an anti-burst mechanic to prevent him from getting gibbed by mages.  Again, the passive's purpose was already aimed at solving the character's needs in terms of mitigating the damage mages do, so any power we could've given him on this axis is once again more interesting being spent on his passive than on base stats.\n\nI'm guessing Maokai was not originally given MR/level because his ult is such a potentially strong mitigation tool vs. Mage AoE.  He was also made in an older time where a larger % of the tanks didn't have MRes/level (most fighter tanks weren't around and of the original tanks, many of them had no MRes/level at the time).\n\nKayle almost certainly doesn't have it because she is functionally ranged most of the time.\n\nPoppy probably doesn't have it once again because of the passive's ability to mitigate burst damage.\n\nSinged likely doesn't have it because of the insane amount he gets from his ultimate, so that mages can actually feel effective vs. him when his long duration ultimate isn't active.\n\nShen likely doesn't have it because of the precedence set by early tanks and also because his W is a strong anti-burst mitigation tool.\n\n\nNow I know this all sounds kinda silly because you can point out a lot of similar abilities on other characters who do have MR/level and the whole thing starts to just sound arbitrary.  And there is some truth in that; the decision isn't totally arbitrary since all of these character have other tools in place to service their defensive needs, but they just as easy could have MRes/level and be balanced around that as not.\n\nWhen looking at these guys and working on buffing/nerfing them though, it feels like a cheap and easy way to give them a power buff by just tacking MRes/level, but it's not always the right answer.  Take the Maokai changes I've been working on this patch.  It would be very easy to just inject power into the character by adding MR/level, but at the end of the day what this change says is that the character is currently working in a healthy and satisfying way but just needs some raw power against mages to succeed.  And in some cases, that might be spot on, but on Maokai that just didn't seem like the right approach.  Theoretically, there's only so much you can buff a character before they become imbalanced, so it's most interesting and exciting when you can spend your buff budget on impactful actions that the player is making rather than increasing their stat line.\n\nSo all in all, I will agree with the sentiment here that our MRes base stat system feels kinda arbitrary, but when working on a character by character basis, we frequently forego just adding the MRes/level to them so that we can try to give that same amount of power to them in a more satisfying and/or interesting way.  Hope that helps understand it.","replies":[{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2014-06-21T18:54:31.719+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand smashgizmo, but as you said yourself a lot of this is inconsistent. For example, a while back Cho'Gath was modernized. He too has anti-mage mechanics (silence), built in anti burst(bonus health from ult) and can be used as a CC tank or AP fighter.\n\nWhen Cho was modernized, he received MR/per level has one of his modernizations. I saw the changes to Maokai on PBE, and I have to say that it's great that you're modernizing an old champion, but it sticks out like a sore thumb when 2 arguably per tanks lack what is considered a basic per tank stat. \n\nTo be honest, in at least Maokai's case, he isn't doing too well in solo queue or professional scene. Lacking MR/per level means he has to allocate more mastery points, more rune slots, and more item slots to receive the same tankiness as other tanks and fighters that, as you say, have similar tools to Maokai.\n\nI see this update as an opportunity to do what you guys did to Cho a while back. Along with the  changes you have already made, I don't see the harm in maybe adding it on Maokai while he is on PBE to see how he fairs. If it's overbearing, it can always be removed. Just like when Nidalee got MR/Armor added to her cougar form during her rework, but it was then removed. It's possible to do the same with Shen too. At the very least, I think it's worth a try.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dyloslawer","date":"2014-06-23T19:59:32.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol but yasuo gets double crit chance from his passive\n\nohright nevermind he has 2 passives :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crimson Mutt 2","date":"2014-06-23T19:00:09.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, most of that would be valid if AD burst hadn't become a thing a LOOOOONG time ago.  \nBurst isn't exclusive to mages nowadays, and neither is sustained damage exclusive to AD, so saying it is is just uneducated and a copout.  \n  \nOne of the reasons Mao and Shen and some others don't fit the meta currently is because junglers tend to rush health (SotAG) and armor (Randuin/Sunfire) early and rely on base MR to carry them until they can get a Visage.  \nMao and Shen cannot do that, lest they be rolled by any AP who even scratches them.  \n\nAdd to that the fact that MR itemiziation is kinda sorta terrible right now, and you get very weak tanks.  \n\nVisage and Banshee are the only good ones right now and you can't rush them otherwise the top/jungler/jungle itself will roll you.    \nLocket is meh and niche vs AoE teams.  \nWit's has a terrible build path.\nAbyssal is hardly a tank item.  \n  \nThat, and the fact that you pretty much NEED armor early, and you removed Locket's armor, means these characters are weaker because of it.  \nKassadin works because passive and can build abyssal relatively early if vs AP.  \nYasuo works because he's building glass cannon anyways.  \n\nThe rest just DON'T.
