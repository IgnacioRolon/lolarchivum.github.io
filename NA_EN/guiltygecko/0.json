I saw in the patch notes that it was fixed, so I tried it out. Turns out, the animation doesn&#039;t play when it&#039;s supposed to. Right now, her Run 2 animation (see previous thread for link), is being used as her homeguard run animation. Lulu doesn&#039;t have a homeguard run animation except on her Star Guardian skin. The run speed to animation **is supposed to play when she gets at least 370 movespeed.** Please take a look at this video for reference: https://youtu.be/yj0h43TqRGE?t=20m11s As you can see, as Lulu is roaming around warding, her Run 2 animation is playing with only 370 move speed. Currently, she just uses Run 1 all the time unless she homeguards and it looks really strange. I hope I was more clear in this Bug report about how this is actually supposed to function.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-11T20:37:04.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThis should be resolved in the most recent patch (6.22)!

I followed up with the QA on this particular skin, and it looks like this may need some animation and design help, making it not the easiest fix in the world, as compared to some other things. He did say it's on their list of issues to resolve, though. :)","replies":[{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2016-11-14T19:26:34.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad it's being looked into.

[As you can see here](https://gfycat.com/ClearcutSpanishArieltoucan) I have 450 movespeed on Lulu, and her Run 1 animation is the only one that's playing. If you look in the youtube video in my original post, you will see that Lulu's Run 2 animation plays **once she has 370 movespeed.**\n\nThe \"fix\" that went out, turned Lulu's Run 2 animation into her homeguard animation, which isn't what it's supposed to be. Hope that clears things up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2016-11-12T04:04:57.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this. The problem is that her Run 2 animation was turned into her homeguard animation. Her Run 2 animation is supposed to play when she gets over 370 movespeed. Right now, it doesn't. I'll see if I can make a gif of what I'm talking about after my current game.","replies":[]}]}]}
