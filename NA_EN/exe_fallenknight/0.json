This isnt your typical &quot;carry me out of bronze plz&quot; post, I have a silver-gold playing level (peaked at gold 2 last year before a large drop to silver 1) and I just need people I can count on to play their role and not feed. \r\n\r\n\r\nIm tired of being 5/0 through lane and then running into the 12/4 xin during the mid game while my 2/8 ryze cant handle the 1/6 vayne I have been pummeling all game, so not only do I get shut down even though Im fed but vayne starts coming back into the game because she gets a few kills mid game. God forbid I have a less than godlike game and I simply go 2/2 in lane then I have to fight the nocturn with 8 kills every time he dives on me in mid game teamfights. We wont even talk about my bad games where a 0/2 lane phase turns into 1/7 by the end of the game with the enemy jungler telling himself &quot;adc in 2016? lul&quot;\r\n\r\nyes I am tilted, that is why I am done playing until tomorrow. sorry for the whining Ill be over it by the time we play, I main adc and I dont care what role you are as long as you are trying to win and you know how to play the game without feeding uncontrollably.\r\n\r\n\r\nplanning on playing a ton tomorrow (December 23rd) and then again the 26th really need to grind to silver so I can practice with my team in a ranked setting.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-23T07:35:30.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DM me on something and we can talk about getting you out,hope your a adc main since im a support main since s3. ill be adding you on league.","replies":[{"poster":"EXE FallenKnight","date":"2016-12-24T16:04:11.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=jpQM7zab,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-23T07:35:30.029+0000)\n>\n> DM me on something and we can talk about getting you out,hope your a adc main since im a support main since s3. ill be adding you on league.\n\nadded you in league, yeah I am an adc main.
