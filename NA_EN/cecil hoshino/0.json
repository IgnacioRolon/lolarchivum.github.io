I think human conflict is fractal - you can zoom in or out to any scale, and still find it.\n\nNot just in between humans, recent studies have proven that even preganancy one of the most symbolic symbols for love, intimacy and boundless giving between a mother and child is somewhat sociopathic, with certain immune cells in the mother body treating the fetus as a pathogen or \nparasite and regulating the amount of blood flow and nutrients it can steal.\n\nConversely transplanting an embryo in mice anywhere other than the womb (in the brain, liver what have you) every time the embryo went wild. Placental cells rampaged through surrounding tissues, slaughtering everything in their path as they hunted for arteries to sate their thirst for nutrients.\n\nIf conflict can be found even in maternity than perhaps it's just an inherent part of our nature.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lanceworks","date":"2018-12-13T06:38:01.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If there is a significant amount of interesting things happening in those unknown parts of the world, it makes me wonder what exactly has kept the regions we know and love from interacting with them (if they even know what's beyond their lands).\n\nI'd like to think that Targon has left a more significant mark on those parts of the world.
