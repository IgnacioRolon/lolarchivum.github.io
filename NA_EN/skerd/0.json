The first few seconds of the fresh download downloads around where I would expect it to (20-30 MBps) then it suddenly plummets to around 1-2 mbps for 5-10minutes and it continuously drops from there (We're around 150kbps right now). If this ETA on the download is correct I've got another 6 hours to downloaded the other 1200 MB. I live in New England so I did a speedtest to an east coast, central, and west coast server and all of them showed me getting normal download speeds. I uninstalled and reinstalled a Steam game to see if I would get similar results but I didn't, I downloaded a 12G game in a few minutes. Any ideas as to what's going on or a possible fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T03:23:57.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might just have something to do with how your connection is being routed to *our* servers specifically.
