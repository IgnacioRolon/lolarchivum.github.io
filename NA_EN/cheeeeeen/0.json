If the route they assign you takes longer than the one that Frontier used, it will result in higher latency (ping). I'd recommend running a traceroute log to confirm where the latency starts to rise and where this may be resolved. You can do this by grabbing a network app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/), opening the app, plugging **104.160.131.1** into the host field, then starting the trace. After 5 minutes has passed, export the results as *text* and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEEEEEEN","date":"2016-12-07T07:39:34.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the long reply.\n\nIf it was their routing problem then is there no solution?\n\n\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    0 |  420 |  420 |    0 |    0 |   19 |    0 |\n\n|                             10.90.104.1 -    2 |  396 |  390 |    5 |   81 | 1051 |   18 |\n\n|acr02crtsca-tge-0-0-0-2.crts.ca.charter.com -    2 |  396 |  390 |    6 |   83 | 1057 |   19 |\n\n|dtr01lnbhca-tge-0-0-0-15.lnbh.ca.charter.com -    2 |  400 |  395 |    7 |   82 | 1091 |   20 |\n\n| crr01lnbhca-bue-290.lnbh.ca.charter.com -    2 |  396 |  390 |    8 |   86 | 1061 |   27 |\n\n| crr01mtpkca-bue-201.mtpk.ca.charter.com -    2 |  396 |  390 |   10 |   86 | 1061 |   25 |\n\n|   bbr01mtpkca-bue-2.mtpk.ca.charter.com -    1 |  404 |  400 |    9 |   88 | 1060 |   25 |\n\n|   bbr01snloca-bue-1.snlo.ca.charter.com -    1 |  404 |  400 |   16 |   94 | 1065 |   29 |\n\n|   bbr02snloca-bue-4.snlo.ca.charter.com -    2 |  396 |  390 |   13 |   95 | 1070 |   35 |\n\n|   bbr01snjsca-bue-6.snjs.ca.charter.com -    2 |  392 |  385 |   22 |   98 | 1076 |   39 |\n\n|   prr01snjsca-bue-5.snjs.ca.charter.com -    2 |  400 |  395 |   27 |  102 | 1062 |   39 |\n\n|            eqix-sv1.riotgamesdirect.com -    2 |  392 |  385 |   26 |  100 | 1077 |   41 |\n\n|                          104.160.130.35 -    2 |  396 |  390 |   26 |  101 | 1072 |   38 |\n\n|          ae30-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    2 |  396 |  390 |   66 |  140 | 1105 |   83 |\n\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    2 |  392 |  385 |   67 |  139 | 1103 |   81 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    2 |  400 |  395 |   72 |  150 | 1129 |   90 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T22:17:39.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sending this traceroute.
