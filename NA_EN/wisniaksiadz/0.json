Not so long ago changes towards Nidalee (and jungle items) make her great jungler. And this is fine, as she is a sneaky hunter, that traverses jungle and catch these careless victims. It&#039;s how she appear in her lore, and it&#039;s how she is in game.\n\nI readed some discussions about junglers, tanks, and some1 posted nice idea for teemo.\nSo. Acording to lore, he is a little scout, that is way ahead of his team, gather informations, sabotages his enemy. But currently in game he is more like ap magish, defensish, kinda nothing concrete. Blind and back, put maybe some autos and hope some1 step into mushrom. Either you force enemy back to base, or you fail early and your shrooms are useless. It&#039;s kinda boring playstyle, at least in my opinion.\n\nAnd here is some ideas to make him more viable. Teemo main position should lie in the jungle. He gather his poison there, his real alterego show there. He thematically should be here\nTL:DR\nmain change is for W and we start here\nW\nActive: Teemo change his weapon to either his dartgun or knife.\nDartgun - Gain 550 range. while he is back to the opponent, he gain movementspeed buff\nknife - Lose range. Gain 20 flat movementspeed(counterstrike players will understand), 20% attack speed. while facing opponent he gain movementspeed buff\nPassiveW: Killing big monsters (in the jungle) give him a mushroom\n\nPassive:\nStanding in 1 postioin give teemo a stealth. It refresh as teemo is standing and last 1.5s after he moves or until he do action.\nQ\nDartgun - no changes, maybe make it on hit\nKnife - Blind every1 around him and proc passive.\n\nE\nRemains as it is with 1 change - attacking monsters cause double the dmg. (numbers are needed to adjust)\n\nR\nless dmg, more shrooms, teemo gain movementspeed buff towards poisoned target (stacking with W).\n\nThat changes would shift Teemo more in to jungle position, where he should be (according to lore). He would become great sneaky counterjungle scout, that appear from nowhere, kill and disappear.\n\nWhat you think about changes like these?.","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-03-29T16:53:32.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Teemo is fine the way he is . if nothing else extend his aa and q range and some ad scaling on his q would be nice","replies":[{"poster":"Wisniaksiadz","date":"2015-03-29T16:56:40.678+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"i don't say, that he is actually weak, need buffs or something.

Soraka - gosh, she is soo cool now, maybe reduced cost of heal to 8% imo, all she need. Rengar same as trynda - rolfstomp or get rolfstomed then. Now he is ok imo. Old kata w was just weird. Nida changes are cool, she is now, what i expect from lore. I prefer old Karma, but new1 isnt that bad. New master is now fighter as he should be from start. Same with heimer. I prefer old grag, but he was a little too powerfull. Viktor changes was just what he needed. New zilean zoning is just too powerfull, but you need more skills to use it. no longer broken kassa, but wait for that 1s cd on ulti. Morde is weaker, not sure. And wait for veigar buffs, but yea, he is weaker.\n\nDon't say, that riot destroy every single champion they touched becouse this isn't true.

I love his character to death, but lets be honest, as fun as his ultimate is, its annoying as hell for the enemy team.  It causes so much grief to his enemies, he becomes the target of everyones wrath.\n\nI think a rework would't hurt.\n\nJust change his move quick to something else. I was never a fan of his passive, but whatever...it kinda fits into his \"scouting\" theme.\nMaybe just change his R to place a limited amount of shrooms, like 3-5.\n\nMake him a roaming support/jungle where he has to collect mushrooms like bard collects chimes. Increase the vision range to maybe 3/4th of a regular ward. \n\nGive him 1 reliable cc on his Q - maybe a skill shot stunning dart? And no, I dont think blind counts are crowd control (especially with its paltry duration). IMO only disables - taunt, fear, stun, bind, count as cc. The rest - slow, blind are \"soft cc\", if you may.\n\nChange his poison to do bonus damage on jungle monsters/creeps and you have a solid jungle, or a roaming support. Hell, you can even do top with him, but not as effectively, since you wont have an opportunity to \"scout\" as much.\n\nI wish I get the opportunity to use the many skins I've collected for him without being a liability for my team or annoying the enemy team...maybe some day....","replies":[{"poster":"Wisniaksiadz","date":"2015-03-29T18:23:01.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the blind dart would no longer be blind.\nAbout shrooms, that;s why i prefer to have more shrooms on map, with less dmg = more vision on map, but you won;t be soo angry about ,,fck this shit, 2 mushrooms and i need to recall\"\nAnd exacly, movequick, as theme is great spell, but in game it's just weak.
