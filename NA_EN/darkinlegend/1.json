On the other hand they are squishy and need to know how to kite and position themselves because they are often the main target. Even if he has a great team that peels for him, a bad ADC that can't kite or position himself will get deleted by an average team.\nI see nothing wrong with a champ like Jhin having a kiting passive. He's easy to catch and when he ults he's a sitting duck.\n\nWhat would you do about Vayne's tumble/ult/condemn?\nWhat would you do about Ezreal's arcane shift?\nCorki's W?\n\nThey all have something to kite and move out of trouble.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2016-03-16T16:16:31.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he took a Vayne thread from ~2 years ago, replaced the word Vayne with Jhin and Tumble with Speed boost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-03-16T16:14:34.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are now in a generation where Jhin's bonus movement speed from crits are considered more mobile than {{champion:238}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:64}} .\n\nExhibit 1: OP's thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-03-16T16:09:58.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hateboner for a champion, bad reasoning, **and** a yes or yes poll?
