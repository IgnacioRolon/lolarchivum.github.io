But hear me out.  As in, read the whole thing. You are going to have a knee jerk reaction to the things I start with, so its important that you don't start this with a hostile attitude towards it.\r\n\r\nHow much does Riot make off the game itself, as in RP?  \r\n\r\nI think their revenue last year was 1.6 Billion.  But are we not all tired of Riot leaving new champions strong so they can sell that champion and skins, just to nerf them in a few months?  \r\n\r\nI don't think Riot has a business model that involves making money WHILE keeping the game balanced as possible. \r\n\r\nThere are...what...66 million people who play league? How many of them play regularly? But just for illustration, lets say that if you charged a monthly fee to play, of like $3 a month, 30 million would be okay with it. No lets say only 15 million. So that's 45 million a month, or 540 million a year.  But lets say that Riot needs more revenue from the game.  I would say that the people who play ranked will pay up to $5 a month without question if they \r\n\r\n1)have access to all champions, skins, runes and as many rune pages as they would like\r\n\r\n2)believed that Riot would make balancing changes with RP purchasing not being a factor\r\n\r\n3)would keep out players who really don't care enough to pay and therefore probably shouldn't be playing in ranked anyways.\r\n\r\nThat's $60 a year. We all pay that for Xbox live and such without question.   At $5 a month that's 900 million a year.\r\n\r\nBut what about the players who don't wan to pay? Well, since the subscription would be yearly like Xbox live, Riot can allow players to play Aram and Normals for free, restricted to the champions on rotation. And the number of champions on rotation should at least double in the amount.  At anytime they can purchase a ranked pass for money, if they don't want to commit to a yearly membership. This would be for people who like to play hear and there. They could by a 1 2 or 3 day pass, or a 5 or 10 match pass. Once the pass has expired, they will lose access to ranked  play and all the unlimited skins and rune pages and champions, but will retain their rank.  Eventually people who buy a pass will decide, okay fuck it, what's $5 month for a game that is fun and that I like? Also if they like the game they will quickly figure out that it costs more to keep buying passes at their rate of play (as the addiction grows). So they will just by the pass, and chalk it off to all those other small reoccuring entertainment expenses like xbox life, netflix an hulu.  \r\n\r\nSo, maybe only 10 million worldwide, initially would be willing to pay $5 a month. Well then it would be 600 million a year from membership fees, PLUS whatever Riot makes on the sporadic temporary passes, plus whatever revenue streams they have from league, which I assume is calculated into that 1.6 billion I initially mentioned.\r\n\r\nThey are a business and we need to stop kidding ourselves. As long as their existence is tied to people buying new champions, new skins, more rune pages etc, any decision to change the game will be done so in consideration with how it will affect sales. To think otherwise is delusional. \r\n\r\nLet just get all of that out of the way so Riot can drive their revenue by making changes that are 100 percent for the benefit of the game--more fun, more balanced, more diverse champion picks...and then let people WANT to pay a measly $5 a month to play ranked. \r\n\r\nLets stop with the whole free to play gimmick. Its a quality product, we love to game, we pay for entertainment without question in every other facet of life. Why does it need to hide behind the whole free to play concept?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-30T04:26:11.945+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would kill the game, almost all players would vanish overnight.\n\nThink about how popular league is in developing and second-world countries, where the average gamer does not have a lot of money, or where exchange rates to US$ are quite bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkinlegend","date":"2016-12-30T19:08:14.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=vZ4AFvZA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-30T04:26:11.945+0000)\n>\n> This would kill the game, almost all players would vanish overnight.\n> \n> Think about how popular league is in developing and second-world countries, where the average gamer does not have a lot of money, or where exchange rates to US$ are quite bad.\n\nWhy would it kill the game.

If a champion isn't popular people won't buy it or buy skins for it. What makes a champion popular? Well usually it is how effective they are--their ability to produce victories in a wider variety of team comps.  If a champion is too powerful but Riot sees a huge increase in purchases with RP towards that champion or its skins, do you really think they are going to apply the appropriate nerfs while sales are surging?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-01T05:33:14.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, they can and will.  i can think of quite a few recent examples.\n\nSeriously, just go salt someplace else, nobody cares.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkinlegend","date":"2017-01-01T17:01:35.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=vZ4AFvZA,comment-id=000000000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-01T05:33:14.184+0000)\n>\n> Yes, they can and will.  i can think of quite a few recent examples.\n> \n> Seriously, just go salt someplace else, nobody cares.\n\nApparently you do.
