Well, here&#039;s an idea.\n\nMaybe her E could be an auto attack modifier (like Jinx&#039;s q). Her first form would melt armor/magic resist while applying poison effect while her other form would slow attack speed and reduce attack damage.\n\nHer Q and W would stay about the same, and the poison&#039;s effects would be more potent, dealing more damage to compensate for the e spam.\n\nHer ult maybe could, instead of being used as a mass stun, be a way to double the poison&#039;s effectiveness and slow the enemies. Yes? No?\n\n\nI hope I can help.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- This would get rid of her E's centricity; it would increase the damage of her poisons, make her much less spammy, and it gives her the option to build around her E only if she feels like it with a Nashor's tooth or whatever. The damages from her poisons would be enough to support her if she built AP, and the shreds would be helpful if her auto attacks got reworked to be more smoothly incorporated into her spells (increased range/smoothness).","replies":[{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2016-01-19T13:39:38.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No thank you, honestly, people complain about her e's central point in her kit, she needs a passive update, and scaling update for people to stop whining(i do want her old passive back in a form though)\nThis idea sadly makes her into a disable support, debuffing enemies and offering not much else, in terms of hard carry potential that is. \n\nI dont think cass needs much honestly(and i dont want her old q ap ratio)","replies":[{"poster":"CorruptedScythe","date":"2016-01-19T13:45:09.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would get rid of her E's centricity though; it would increase the damage of her poisons, make her much less spammy, and it gives her the option to build around her E only if she feels like it with a Nashor's tooth or whatever.

It's what a small vocal minority of players want who miss being able to max Q in lane to bully people out without relying on Twin Fang. There are plenty of players who love Cassio's gameplay update. Her kit didn't even change from what it used to be, they just shifted some values around to force her to commit a bit more to trading in lane rather than landing Q and then running away with 30% move speed. In return, she scales much much better than she used to.\n\nShe has always been a single target dps mage through Twin Fang spam even before she was updated and, regardless, changes of this scale are probably not what Riot has in mind for her.
