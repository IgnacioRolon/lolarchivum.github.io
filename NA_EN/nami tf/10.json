In practice though, it was a lot harder than one would think. A Yorrick could engage and punish that Nasus the moment he tried to get a stack or wait until Nasus already q'd.

Percent health added on top of his sheen procced Q.\n\nPoppy can take Yorick early. Although her kit is very cc into oblivion. But after 6, she'll have troubles. The chances of a Yorick saving their maiden to start 1v1s, although low, is still existent.\n\nNasus is all about late game. So his laning phase against Yorick is difficult. Since Yorick, now with a Spirit Visage, is healing that 200 stack q you just used on him.  But suddenly he spawned his maiden and now you're also taking 6% of your health in damage, on top of that q healing,\n\nYorick himself can actually force his minions to despawn by walking far enough away. It's an easy way of harassing Nasus, who also has no gap closers while Yorick has 2, while reducing the amount of stacks Nasus can achieve per set of ghouls.","replies":[]}]}
