But my team is never on the same page as me. But currently I'm having an issue where I can win 2-4 games get +12-16 LP per game. But then after I lose 1-2 I lose everything I've earned. But where's that logic I clearly should have earned more than I lost, and if I did score highest in vision score/damage/and damage taken had more Kill Participation than deaths and more Creep Score than most of my opponents and tried to carry the teams I get and tried to communicate with them but they refuse to understand whats going on, how would one climb?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T04:01:03.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentially, the system will look at the match you're about to go into and take all factors like the others players skill levels into consideration. It then determines whether or not you should theoretically win or lose that match. If it thinks you should win and you do win, then you get a small boost in LP. If it thinks you should win and you lose, you will actually lose more LP than what you would have gained if you had won. \n\nThat might be a little confusing, and you can always refer to our [**ranked play faq**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760) if you've got any other questions on ranked mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"xMyst","date":"2017-05-21T16:15:35.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How come it happens almost everygame?

Only way to actually work around this is intentionally throw until you get back to where ranked games actually give you LP instead of take it away, but of course I don't want to do that due to the fact that its against summoners code. But I am really tired of 1v9ing and losing all of my LP.","replies":[]}]}
