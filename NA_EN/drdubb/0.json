I'm a mid main, and I wont even go into how efficient LUDENS ECHO is and how it's the Black Cleaver of mid lane... if you're a burst mage you ALWAYS build it first no matter what because it gives you EVERYTHING a mage needs unlike any other item (extra scaling burst dmg, wave clear, 20%CDR, mana item, HIGH AP) Damn, I said this wasn't about Luden's Echo ( or Black Cleaver...)\r\n\r\nAnyways. It's DIFFICULT to not have a build that goes over 40% CDR. It's a crappy feeling every game. Absolute Focus being weaker recently, and 10% CDR in the rune stats, compounds the situation. Although I often take Absolute Focus over Transcendence, I can't see myself trading 10% CDR for 9AP...\r\nLudens ECHO plus the 10% CDR from runes is already 30%, so pick your 10% item carefully. Zhonyas? Banshees? Hextech item? Twin Shadows? Lich Bane?Maybe you're a AP bruiser who wants Spirit Visage. I find it ridiculous an optimal build can't have more than one these item's and Luden's together.\r\nAfter boots, your other 3 items HAVE to be Void Staff, Rabadons, Liandries, Rylais, Morrelonomicon, or Mejais.\r\n\r\nMaybe you're playing ARAM and want some weird itemization but often can't because it's ALWAYS over 40% CDR.\r\nTanks have it EVEN WORSE. Pretty much CAN'T build Black Cleaver and Frozen Gauntlet together, because your MR item will put you over the cap. And I don't think you're running Transcendence as a tank, so you dont even have the chance to benefit from the extra adaptive force. \r\n\r\nWhen looking for an optimal build, often times I find myself tiptoing around the CDR cap instead of building the items I would have liked to build initially. Overall... ALL the CDR feels bad. And I'm not even coming at it from a power creep/game pace perspective, I'm talking about it from a pure itemization perspective.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel similarly?\r\n\r\nP.S. Why are Ionian Boots even an item any more? If it wasn't for the summoner spell buff, they'd be COMPLETELY obsolete. Even the traditional support characters that would RUSH these boots don't because of excess CDR in every item. They're just better off with literally any other item. (Sorcerer boots for brand lux ect. Even tank boots are better than Ionian boots for beefier supports. Swiftness/mobi boots are almost always good on supps)","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Knight","date":"2019-09-24T11:04:55.126+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost every AP CDR item has Mana. Meaning any non mana AP mid has to pay for a stat they cant use. On top of that the items with CDR and no mana are lower AP and defensive in most cases, ie: Zhonyas and Banshee's. The highest AP no mana with CDR is Nashor's Tooth at 80 but then its so niche most wont want to build it.\n\nMy issue with CDR items is not the number but HOW MUCH they give mana champs. Archangel's Staff is the 2nd best AP item in the game and it gives 20% CDR and an assload of mana. Thankfully the ability haste on it and Luden's means you cant nab Luden's for a quick 40% CDR, but with the 600 Mana getting Ludens even with that ability not stacking doesn't suck and still gives you 30% CDR. And then you get wave clear, a shield, and enough mana to not really worry about spamming that much. Two items and suddenly its like you don't have mana if you play even a little bit smart. \n\nI don't mind the presence of CDR. I mind the way its stacked for mana based champs to easily have 40% within like 2 items but others have to sacrifice to hopefully meet 40% CDR with 3 or 4 items and typically with building something with stats you don't need and at a loss of AP.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-09-24T15:36:33.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"And heres the thing: You mention all that CDR, and Transcendence hasn't been mentioned once.

Adaptive Helm could receive increased MR for example.]\n\nNo more Haste passive on {{item:3802}} or items built from it.\n\n{{item:3070}} gives 5% CDR.  Items built from Tear of the Goddess grant stats from both mana and over-capped CDR (replacing Transcendence rune).\n\n{{item:3110}} builds out of {{item:3070}} + {{item:3024}} + {{item:3082}} and transforms into an upgraded version when Awe is fully stacked.  Awe grants bonus health.  The upgraded version has a stronger, ramping-up aura which can be toggled on, costing mana each second.\n\n{{item:3004}} builds out of {{item:3070}} + {{item:3101}}, gaining its Shock passive (reduced to 1.5% mana on-hit) before upgrading to {{item:3042}} (allowing the full 3% mana on-hit after upgrade).  Because it would no longer build from {{item:1037}}, it would provide less AD, and the recipe change would make it somewhat more expensive.  Manamune would offer a way for mana-gated AD champions to continue building CDR, while resourceless AD champions would have considerably less access to CDR than before.  CDR capping doesn't need to be a super common thing for every champion class, and compensating some items with other strengths, like increased defensive stats, could help improve the game pace.\n\nTranscendence rune is removed (now part of Awe passive) and it is replaced by a Spell Weaving or Expose Weakness rune (just give it a 'Sorcery' sounding name, like Blighting Curse, and give it synergy with DOT and AOE).\n\nAlso if Magic Resistance is increased on many items to compensate for reduced CDR on them, there will be room for a new Sorcery keystone tailored to DPS APCs.  Deathfire Touch can make a return as a rune that reduces immediate ability damage dealt in exchange for a larger amount of delayed damage over time.  This will allow players to give up instant burst potential in order to deal DOT DPS.  For example, the keystone could convert 30% of damage that would be dealt by abilities into a burn over 4 seconds that deals 55% of the original ability damage.  This would result in the ability doing 125% in total but spread out over a longer period.  Squishy targets would normally die within 4 seconds of fighting, so this mostly impacts fighting frontliners, hence why this addition to the game would fit with increased availability of Magic Resistance on frontliner items.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2019-09-25T11:27:45.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> {{item:3110}}  builds out of {{item:3070}}  + {{item:3024}}  + {{item:3082}}  and transforms into an upgraded version when Awe is fully stacked.

In fact, people did math on a reddit thread trying to find the highest non-Thresh/non-Viegar/non-Victor AP possible, and they could barely get over 1000, at 1009 using Kassadin who was the champion with the highest base mana at level 18.\n\n> \"It can depend on the champ since Seraphs gives AP based on total mana (which takes into account base mana). I just did REALLY quick calculations to see where I think it would be. ROA+Seraphs is .5 less AP than Rylais+Seraph (rylais gives 100, ROA with Seraphs passive gives 99.5) I am also omitting Victor because though his passive IS an item it gives a MASSIVE amount of AP... so its an unfair advantage.\n> \n> So my guess here is Kassadin (highest base mana) with 1537 base Mana at level 18 plus 1000 from seraph is 2537 so Seraphs is granting him its base 60+76.11 AP.
