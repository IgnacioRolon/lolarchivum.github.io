She doesn't have a 1350 skin. She received a very poorly worked on visual update. Karma has received the most unfair treatments in regards to reworks. Why was a champion who fits the skin series better than Jinx, excluded? I'm not saying the skins are bad or the story is bad. Karma should have been part of it more than Jinx or even Poppy, even though I adore the Poppy skin. It's just another realization that no part of Riot cares about Karma or the community that likes her. It's very disappointing. Good job on the Janna, Poppy and Lulu skins though.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-20T00:10:43.185+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":12,"body":"Hi! \n\nYou're right Karma is an awesome choice for a Star Guardian!

She's received for Order of the Lotus and Warden Karma, both fairly close together in terms of release. Warden being released in September of 2015. So, it's been about a year, which, is about average for a champion to not receive a skin.\n\nCounter-point to *those* arguments for \"we do care\":\n\nJinx received Slayer Jinx in November 2015, which means it's been ~10 months since her last skin. This was also a 1350 RP skin. Her other skins are Mafia and Firecracker Jinx, priced 975 and 1350 RP respectively. Mafia Jinx has new particles, model, animations, new sounds and VO. Same with Firecracker minus the VO lines. Slayer Jinx also has a lot of changes, on animations, particles and sounds. \n\nJanna's current catalogue of *available* skins is 975 RP Hextech Janna (model changes), 975 Frostqueen Janna (model + particle changes), 1820 RP Weathercast Janna (legendary). Tempest and Fnatic Janna are only model changes but I will charitably not count them since legacy.\n\nPoppy has 975 RP Scarlet Hammer Poppy (model changes) and 520 RP Battle Regalia Poppy (model changes). (You could unfairly argue they have particle changes on R: those aren't particularly huge).\n\nLulu's catalogue includes Bittersweet and Wicked at 975 RP, with Dragon Trainer and Pool Party at 1350 RP. New models for the first set, everything new for the second set. \n\nKarma has Sakura (520), Warden (750) and Order of the Lotus (975), of which all are model changes with Lotus Order getting the whole shebang of goodies. Her legacy skins Sun Goddess (750) and Traditional (975) are model changes with the latter including Karma's old VO.\n\nComparatively, Karma and Poppy have equally poor skin selection if you discount legacy skins. Include them, and Poppy ekes out a win over Karma in terms of what her skins offer.\n\nI'm not going to argue that the skins created for Star Guardian are bad. They're not. But if you compare Karma's skin lineup to any of the four new Star Guardians, you'll see that only Karma and Poppy lack 1350 RP skins and offer a mostly vanilla skin of model changes with no further additions. Poppy has Lollipoppy and Karma has Order of the Lotus to offer some different particles, but Lulu, Janna and Jinx have received superior skins in terms of how they offer to change the playing experience for that champion.\n\n---\n\nI don't think you guys \"don't care\"; considering Evelynn, there's champions who have it worse in the skin department. Far worse. (Hi, Urgot. Yorick, Warwick.) However, I think fielding that argument doesn't hold water because demonstrably Karma's skins have been far less inspired and offer far fewer changes to their character fantasy than the other skins do for the champions that *did* get some goodies this time around.\n\nNow, if the rumour for an Elementalist Lux ultimate skin is true, it'd mean that Lux, with her wide plethora of skins and numerous particle-changing skins, would be set for an even stronger fantasy change.\n\nBut Karma fans just don't have an immersive fantasy to indulge in for alternate interpretations of Karma. As a spiritual and religious leader, Sun Goddess Karma and Order of the Lotus Karma offer a mostly \"same\" take on her fantasy: in both cases she represents a faith or an order at the forefront of battle. Warden Karma offers the best departure from Karma's classic skin, whereas Sakura Karma just... feels out of place? And considering she only wears a kimono top, it doesn't even offer the fantasy the splash art promises. It's also similar in theme to Order of the Lotus Karma, which is a fan-wielding (but not really) woman with a flower theme in light garb.\n\nIn summation, I disagree with the original poster's assertion that you \"really don't care\", but I honestly believe you can step up the game with regards to Karma and giving her a skin that offers a markedly different approach to her character, and that offers a different gameplay experience beyond \"different model.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-09-20T03:22:12.328+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":11,"body":"No they don't care.

With all respect, of course, I understand your reasoning on why she was not included in the Star Guardian line-up. If anything, I'd agree with you. However, I don't think that mentioning Warden and Order of the Lotus Karma does your post any justice. Considering the fact that with her rework, Karma's other skins (Sakura, Traditional, and Sun Goddess) were, if anything, downgraded (quality-wise) and the models attempt to resemble the splash art, but miserably fail. I do understand that her rework happened a long time ago, but I can't help to feel ignored when I see the high-quality art and model changes that come with the newer reworks. \n\n_That point could apply to every champion that was reworked around the time of Karma's rework. Why does it matter?_\n\nI, and many other Karma fanatics, feel that her rework, among the completed reworks of her time, was thrown out to live in an unfinished way. I feel like it is unfair that Karma's core problems with her rework (from the art and thematic side) have yet to be addressed. \n\nI see no hope for these fixes either considering that I cannot recall the last Riot-produced event that focused on Ionia...and I most definitely cannot see any in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2016-09-20T01:00:31.266+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"To be honest Katey, both Warden and Order the Lotus look budget.

I will say that I think all of the skins are amazing and I am going to buy the Lulu one. I may be very upset that Karma is not part of it, but I do think the skins are good quality. It is again, the same as the Project Skin choices, certain champions being picked for high-quality skins over and skin lines where another one . . . who has no high-quality skin or fits the theme better . . . is overlooked for . . . . an Ekko skin. It's getting really old.\n\nI have to disagree with your comment that Riot cares about Karma. Your department might care about her, but I am not thinking that with the recent selections for Star Guardian Skins. Karma is a champion that fits the line and theme of the skins . . . . to a T. Yet we get \"popular\" and more \"worked on\" champions who are part of the skin line. Lulu, Jinx, Lux, and even Janna . . . all have high-quality skins with frequently worked on kits. Karma doesn't get that. She has the same skins being made on her . . . that lack any character, direction, or stands out. Warden looks good but it offers her nothing . . . and it is a low budget and hardly worked on skin. It's unimpressive compared to the skins Lulu, Lux, Janna, and Jinx get EVERY year.\n\nUntil I see the company actually listen, communicate with fans more about Karma, actually WORK on Karma . . . and do more for her . . . then what you have never done, I will say Riot cares. No Department in Riot cares about the champion and it has been three years. When Karma was worked on her  \"relaunch\", Riot removed her kit, her fans, her dress, her lore, her theme, her identity, didn't complete her animations, gave us a half worked on visual update, only care enough to giver her a number buff that they later nerf, and has used almost every excuse a Developer can use . . . . to basically say \"we don't want to work on Karma right now. will just ignore her.\"\n\nNo department in the Riot Games company cares about Karma. You cannot say to me and all of her mains, fans, and tons of players that come on here . . . . constantly asking for changes, to get communication, and to have her worked on since her relaunch . . . . that you care about Karma at all. All of you know what her problems are. It's been three years and she is the worst worked on champion with a directionless kit and lazy and sloppy visual update.

Its not her age, her character could've been the same as Poppy's or Janna's and it wouldn't have been strange at all. Is it her look? Why? Your second statement is an opinion\n3.  How many bloodthirsty magical girls are there? Not many because gratuitous violence when it comes to magical girls if often used as the offset. The unexpected and rarely done thing.  They did change Jinx's personality in a major way, she is quite clearly SANE in this skin.  Violent yes, but she understands her actions and morality.\n4.  It could be said every champ has an aspect of what the skin lines offers, an aspect doesnt mean they are the most suited or deserving of the skin.\n\nedit: AS SOMEONE ELSE BROUGHT UP Jinx is older than Vi according to the reds that answered questions about her after her release, age has very little to do with the choices here  -_-","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2016-09-21T05:56:44.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, being Japanese does come in to play as the skin line theme was inspired by my culture.

Just saying you're Japanese isn't enough with no proof or extra qualifiers, for all we know your grandparents are Japanese but everything you know about Japan is from anime (most likely this).  It is possible to be Japanese/African/Irish/whatever ethnic BACKGROUND and know nothing about that culture.\n\n1. No I don't see how they fit as weird children, and that's not an argument.  \n2. Cost/effort are irrelevant they can still be made, and you are shifting my argument.  There is nothing wrong with Janna getting the skin, Karma and quite a few other champs would've been better candidates for the skin than Poppy and Lulu.\n3. Karma doesn't fit in personality wise?  She could've fit perfectly with either Janna or Poppy's current role.  Karma's entire schitck is she does what is necessary despite the cost to her.  Self-sacrifice is a good theme.\n4.  Does Poppy/Lulu have more than say Diana? or X champion?  Not really, Poppy and Lulu were picked because someone on the skins team thought Yordle guardians would be cool/cute not because they were more fitting than anyone else.  As far as I'm concerned they were horribly mistaken.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2016-09-22T04:59:29.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, I'm half Japanese and my mom's side of the family is Japanese.

As for poppy and lulu it might be hard to understand why they're there as you have no experience with the Japanese culture including even that of anime (or so I believe) but if you could state another champion and why they could and should replace poppy or lulu I could explain to you why not even if they have some aspects that may be good for the skin line","replies":[{"poster":"Sincarnation","date":"2016-09-22T06:00:38.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DLTD Stuart,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jOEejhwE,comment-id=0007000000000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-22T04:59:29.797+0000)\n>\n> Look, I&#x27;m half Japanese and my mom&#x27;s side of the family is Japanese.

I didn't ignore anything, you didnt say anything.  You just make broad statements, like \" I hope you're educated enough to see my point of view\" that's not an argument. Its thinly veiled ad hominem, that only furthers to weaken your argument.\n\n2. You are so rigid in your mindset, clearly if there were different champions they don't all have to have the same niche they are filling now.  Janna could still be the quiet and reserved one, but split from wisdom to make Karma experienced or wise.  Its not cut and paste replacement, things can change and shift.  In such case its perfectly fine for Karma and Janna to exist on the same team occupying different roles. Japan loves their shy quiet girls and they aren't all wise, polite, or even smart.\n\n3.  Karma doesn't necessarily have to be the leader, the leader is rarely the wisest person in a group.  The leader is the one with charisma.\n\n4.  Yes because it is such a huge jump from one Celestial body to another.  Clearly her canonical lore loving the moon couldnt possibly be shifted in the non-canonical skin lore to something different. Riot have never done that before, oh wait thats the entire point of skins.  Re-imagining a character in a different light, hey what if syndra/aatrox/varus were good?  What if Trynd was devoured by his sword? What if Diana was apart of a group celestial beings that protect the universe? Oh wait that's not a huge leap from her current story now is it? Diana was NEVER evil, at her core she was always a curious outcasted young woman who searched for the truth and acceptance only to be scorned further upon finding what she was looking for.  She killed the people who were going to execute her under false pretenses, hardly evil.  Her original lore had her going around killing people who did the same thing the heretics did which is deny her existence and worth.  She can only be considered more \"evil\" than Jinx because Jinx canonically is insane and doesn't know morality, but through actions Jinx is way fucking worse.  So its hardly her personality or character that prevents her from being in it.\n\nI'm done with you, you apparently have no experience writing characters or having an actual argument. \"As for poppy and lulu it might be hard to understand why they&#x27;re there as you have no experience with the Japanese culture including even that of anime (or so I believe) but if you could state another champion and why they could and should replace poppy or lulu I could explain to you why not even if they have some aspects that may be good for the skin line\" This is basically you think they fit because you like them but you cant explain why you think they do so you resort to again trying to use your supposed understanding of Japanese culture as a cop out.

First off, how do YOU with NO experience with Japan know what my people like and dislike? xD Anyways, that aside, Riot doesn't have to cut and paste what's standard. Yes I do realize that but Karma's personality conflicts with the other candidates (not only Janna but also with Poppy and Lux)personalities too much not to mention she isn't a good fit for the role in the theme of the skin line visually as well. (Her in game model, clothing, etc.)\n2. Again, I love how all the sudden you're now an expert on Japanese culture. Did you binge watch 10 episodes of puriquwa before watching this? Anyways, -look at Karmas position, lore, and personality. She is part of Ionia's council, a leader in her homeland. You can't just strip off the leadership aspect from her or else she won't be herself. You keep saying you can just adjust her but by the end of all \"adjustments\" you make, you'll just have another Lux, Janna, Poppy or lulu.\n3. Yes they have cases were they change a character from good to evil or evil to good and in some cases from sad to happy (Amumu's skin). Diana on the other hand you're saying to change immensely. Her lore completely revolves around the moon. Taking that and changing it completely changes her as well as how her abilities will look like. (Such as her W, e, and q)\nSeeing as how this affects her so much the only way to change her to a star guardian is to make her an ultimate skin where they start out all new concepts. (As a rioter previously mentioned not of just this but as how ultimate skins work) Yet again making it an ultimate skin wouldn't work either due to it being a pointless change to only allow a single champion be a part of a skin line. All ultimate skins tend to be starts of new skin lines such as Ezreals ultimate skin being the start or inspiration to create the Project skinline (and other ones if you find the rioters post).\nAll ultimate skins also bring out what the champion is more and none have been what they wherent. Udyr had his abilities and his spirit animals amped up, DJ sona was literally \"amplified\" (haha get it) to further show her musicality and to be the staple musician of league.\n4.( I guess 4?) I only said it in that manner because it was 1AM at the time and I felt sleepy. I guess I can't do that in arguments due to people picking up on it in such a manner. Anyways, please do tell me how how you know the Japanese culture and the \"magical school girl\" themed anime (for that matter). As for Poppy and Lulu being there Lulu is portrayed as the random/derpy/peppy character who's usually the good morale of the team and is shown in a way where the viewers can laugh at her clumsiness outside of battle and good/team morale during battle in which she's serious. Poppy I don't know much about personally (as I don't play nor was interested in her) but I can go look up who or what she stands for just for the sake of the argument and will update my post later (#spending my time wisely). Understanding of the Japanese culture actually does happen to be a big part of it as that's where the slimline got its inspiration from.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-09-22T09:41:39.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sincarnation,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jOEejhwE,comment-id=0007000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-09-21T09:58:02.804+0000)\n>\n\n> 2.
