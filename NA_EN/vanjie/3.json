Very Sad :(","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I just found out that Lunar Wraith Caitlyn is a legacy skin and will be gone soon. I really want the skin and will have the money in a few weeks, but wow. I wish Riot would not do that with skins . . . I mean I know some skins they need to do that. It is very sad. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Lindts","date":"2016-02-06T19:45:25.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, they kinda announced it well ahead before it was released that it would be a legacy skin. If you want a good amount of time span for a heads up, surrenderat20.net is a great site for you to check out the latest skins on pbe. E.g. Heartseeker Orianna and Heartseeker Sona are most likely coming out near Valentine's. They're not legacy, but the when they announced the Lunar skins on surrender @20, they listed that those 2 skins would be legacy, but not the wukong one. \n\nOtherwise, Riot always gives a little heads up.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-02-06T20:01:24.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah a friend told me they weren't.
