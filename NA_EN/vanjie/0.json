Is it the green one or the gold one . . . .and will that give them two skin chances instead of one? I don't see an option for the double one . . . so I am assuming they just get it when I gift them.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2015-11-05T23:19:34.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Arachne,\n\nThere's no option to double mystery gift a player from what I can tell. From what I can gather, I think you're referring to the Zombie Slayer promo page. The Mystery Gifting portion of the promo doesn't double your mystery gifts, but doubles the chance to gift a Legacy Skin. You'll still only send one skin.\n\nAs such, it means that if you Mystery Gift a skin to one of your friends, there will be a higher chance that it'll be one of the legacy skins listed on the promo page. I hope that clears it up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2015-11-05T23:40:33.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty","replies":[]}]}
