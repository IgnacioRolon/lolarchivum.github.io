When I play him, I feel like I am demoing a new champion concept, not playing a champion who has been available for a year and whatever months.\r\n\r\n1st, his passive feels like it was picked out of a bin titled &quot;we don&#039;t know what to do about the passive&quot;. I think his passive is really lame. I often find I cannot utilize it at all. Jinx has a passive that gives her great movement speed when she kills or assists, allowing her to catch stragglers or run away. Her Q passive gives her bonus attack speed just for attacking consecutively. Varus has to kill something for this bonus to last for a couple seconds. It really feels like it was just slapped in there.\r\n\r\n2nd, his &quot;hail arrows&quot; ability feels pretty useless, too. I find myself often only using it to kill minions that are out of reach. Obviously I toss it down in teamfights, just because. I have tried using it to make a desperate escape, but that hardly ever works. It has a delay before it becomes active, it&#039;s a very small spot, and it doesn&#039;t really help that much. It&#039;s supposed to desecrate the ground, so what if, when champions walked over it, it spread and the slow would increase over a second or two before clearing away?\r\n\r\n3rd, I&#039;ve never liked his ultimate. The thing that annoys me the most about it is the width. I&#039;ve tossed it and missed by 0.25 inches and it hit no one; meanwhile, Morgana and Graves, just to name a couple, can kill you with the very tip of their skill shots.\r\n\r\n4th... I think I can totally forgive everything (except the passive because it still blows), if Varus got some MOBILITY. Anyone, especially someone like Riven, can just jump on Varus and slaughter him. He can&#039;t escape, no way, unless he blows his flash. Flash should be a last resort, not &quot;oh crap Riven is on my ass&quot;, only to flash and someone jumps on you. So many champions have mobility, but Varus is slow and has nothing. His ultimate and the lame slow in his hail arrows are not enough to compensate.\r\n\r\nChampions like Jinx, who don&#039;t have real mobility, have a lot of damage, and a burst ultimate, to make up for it. Vayne can tumble and disappear. Graves and Trist can jump or slide away from you. Kalista.... don&#039;t even get me started. In fact, releasing Kalista is like bitch-slapping all the people who love Varus and have been begging for some mobility.\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re welcomed to disagree, but I feel Varus is incomplete. It&#039;s a shame, I find him really interesting and his Q is a great, unique ability for him. He deserves more love.","replies":[{"poster":"Stealthless5","date":"2015-04-30T18:05:07.696+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I somewhat agree, he doesn't feel incomplete he just lacks mobility.
