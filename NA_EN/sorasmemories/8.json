I wanted to address a few things; this isn't necessarily reflected at you, but it's a sentiment I see in a lot of Rioter posts on the Boards.\n\nThere will *always* be a minority of people that are angry or complaining about something, and this is an unfortunate truth of the internet.  That being said, the idea that it's scary to communicate with the community is really concerning.  I understand the minority is difficult to deal with, but avoiding that minority avoids the vast majority of the community not being that way.  \n\nSomething we all seem to be forgetting here: The community's gut negative response is almost always directly correlated to a previous or perpetuating lack of communication on a given topic.  One of the big reasons Rioters can end up getting eaten alive by the community, in my opinion, is that people are just trying to be heard and thus dumping everything they care about onto the poor Rioter that has ventured out into the forest.\n\nPeople naturally take the past of least resistance/greatest reward and appeal to the highest relatable authority.  If a Rioter that works primarily as a NOC Technician has a chat with the community and no other Rioters are perceived to be around, that NOC Technician is going to be swarmed with requests that he or she is unable to answer.  The only perceivable authority in this scenario is the NOC Technician, so there is nowhere else for the community to go with their comments.\n\n---\n\nPeople aren't intentionally deciding that you (or any Rioter) should know the answers to all their questions; they are taking the path of perceived least resistance to try to feel heard.  No one wants to go out of their way just to talk to the clearly wrong person (unless they can't follow basic logic), it's just not efficient.  If there's a clear way to directly appeal to the person to which a concern should be directed, that is the most optimal choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Fairy Flan","date":"2015-01-09T23:36:30.716+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There will always be a minority of people that are angry or complaining about something, and this is an unfortunate truth of the internet. \n\nWe definitely keep that in mind!

Fix the Servers!'\" at you, and it's not your area of expertise. But the people whose area of expertise it *does* belong to **do not engage in legitimate discussion with the players** these days.\n\nPhreak is the closest thing we've gotten to balance discussion in *ages*, and he's not on the balance team any more, he's a shout-caster instead, and even he left the last thread once the discussion went into more depth than his \"Win rate = balance\" defense (shortened version, no disrespect meant).\n\nWe finally after ages got some insight into the server roadmap, and that was great! I'm sure a lot of people were glad to see the discussion come up.\n\nThe point is that the Rioters who *will*  talk don't work on the issues that are infuriating the playerbase **and need talked about and fixed**. The ones who *do* work on the issues, however, insist on either completely ignoring the community, or writing off anything they say as \"nah, I work at Riot so my opinion > your logic\" and hop out of threads after a few short posts.\n\nI'm well aware the community is full of anger sometimes, and much of it is unfair anger, but the *frustration* is certainly reasonable.  I think many of us are just tired of the same balance issues, and the people responsible plugging their ears and shouting \"LALALALA\" and running out of a thread  the second they see an argument that more strongly supports a claim against what the people responsible say is the case.  \n\nIf you don't work work in Balance, Design, or Systems, I can (almost) promise you that you have nothing to fear **because the issues that NEED talked about are all in Balance, Design, and Systems**. But those people don't come talk about them. As long as you're working on skins, chances are nobody (at least nobody who knows you work in skins, anyway) is going to rage at you, because everyone is happy with the skins (I think? I know I am, though I'm still waiting for my Dragonmaster Swain and Jurassic Kha'zix -sad face-). The topics people *aren't* happy with are the ones that are vital to a healthy game state and balanced upcoming ranked season, yet the Rioters who *could* speak with us about them won't do it either out of fear or spite or just plain apathy. \n\nYou know we went through almost an entire preseason (*y'know, the thing where sweeping balance changes can be made to adjust for the upcoming ranked season?*) without Rioters coming to discuss major balance/design issues? Like, at least Warwick got noticed, thank god, but I think a blind person who doesn't even play League would've noticed Warwick was broken. Anything *less* obvious than that got *no discussion*, and that's why people are mad. Sure, we may get a post here or there, but I'm talking about **real** *discussion and debate* over balance and design issues, that extends beyond reds coming in and saying \"Nah, what I say is fact, your information is irrelevant, peace I'm out betches\". \n\nWe usually hear the \"sorry, those guys are just working too hard to post\" (which, and I'm well aware I don't work there, but I think is a super lame excuse and probably an unfair one after a whole preseason), or the \"we read your threads! We value your input!... as long as it's in line with what *we* believe\" responses.  Suffice to say, that's not.. uh.. ideal...

Furthermore, the mentality there seems to be that the community just \"doesn't understand\" balance changes that do/don't happen, and that we just need enlightened to Riot's superior way of thinking, which is.. well, arrogant as all-get-out. We \"*understand*\" just fine, but sometimes we disagree, and as you pointed out, the ratio of community-to-rioters is *super* huge.\n\nWe play the game a *crapload* more than you guys ever could, there are literally millions of user experience cases versus what a single Rioter knows. Many of us are higher ranked than you guys, many of us have very thorough understandings of game balance and design, and many of us have given *very* thorough and reasoned arguments for balancing (with of course plenty of one-line \"Nerf X OP\" threads too, but..), and yet the Rioters on the teams who could actually join these discussions and debate the topic either don't, or end up leaving the thread with a \"I'm right you're wrong bye\"-like post once it becomes apparent that maybe balance is doing something wrong. I mean, hell, literally the highest ranked players in the game frequently vocalize problems with design and balance changes that are in line with major community arguments and we're still ignored.\n\nI have to reiterate this one thing though: Believe it or not, it *is* possible that we all \"understand\" the decisions Riot makes damn well fine, sometimes we just think the decisions are wrong and have a ton more user experiences and arguments opposing those decisions, and in some cases have been presenting these arguments for exceedingly long periods of time without response. \n\nThe attitude seems to be, consciously or subconsciously, that you guys are just plain smarter and better than anyone in community when it comes to design and balance 100% of the time just because \"Riot\" is in front of your name, which honestly is naive as hell. Most of us \"understand\" balance changes just fine, we just have strong/stronger arguments against the changes being made and feel like we're being given the finger when they're ignored or a Rioter leaves a balance thread the second the thread doesn't agree with what they're saying (aka plug your ears and shout \"LALALALALAALA\"). I'm not saying \"balance/design by vote\" is a good idea, I'm saying the assumption that you guys know better than us *literally 100% of the time* is kinda bullshit.\n\nI want to ***seriously*** stress I'm not personally attacking anyone, especially you NurseFlan since it's not even your subject, I'm just conveying what the situation looks and feels like to myself, who has been playing since forever, and I'm assuming many others.

Is the intent to stay with less frequent but higher quality releases over the year, and are any other cool things coming out of that team?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Fairy Flan","date":"2015-01-09T23:30:17.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Is the intent to stay with less frequent but higher quality releases over the year, and are any other cool things coming out of that team?\n\nOur goal hasn't been to \"create the most amount of skins possible in a year.\" I'd say our aim is to \"create as many interesting and high-quality skins we, as a team, are capable of creating without skimping on the awesome cool stuff.\"\n\nAnd yes, there are cool things coming out of this team. But that's about all I can divulge! Questions like that are a bit tricky!","replies":[{"poster":"L7xLoTek","date":"2015-01-10T00:20:06.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quality has really been going up lately, so good job on that.
