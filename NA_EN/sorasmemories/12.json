Basically these people exploit the report system in a way that actually makes them toxic.

At the start of every week, you get a set amount of reports. Every time someone you reported gets punished, you get your report back.

They try to make their employees bigger than they are through the framework, but it won't be perfect. And personally, I'd like the report function to stay, no matter how useless.

Whether one's report is justified or valid is irrelevant, because one reports based on what they consider jackass-ery, which is rather objective. You, me, anyone stepping it back a bit would mean pricks that deserved to be reported won't be, in fear someone finds your report(even if you were right) invalid and renders your future reports worthless. \n\nThat's a major flaw in the system, not the players. Reporting someone for negattive attitude because they said \"gg izi\", albeit completely justified, might be considered worthless by a clown that thinks disrespecting your enemies like that is cool, and make your reports invalid. That way the next time you report someone for negattive attitude because they flamed all game nobody will give a fuck, \"your reports are worthless because you report people for the slightest of reasons\".\n\nSince muting is the only way you can deal with someone that ruins your experience in this game(you can't do anything to stop intentional feeders, trolls, and prevent bastards from disconnecting), the form of reporting someone based on atittude is the most common use. But since the system itself is flawed and insufficient, having your opinion diminished in value because a prick decided that someone calling you a faggot is not really that big of a deal thus rendering you worthless is an actual issue. \n\nBack when the tribunal was still running, in my short service span I got to judge multiple cases of people getting reporting for either flaming or negattive attitude. Players who would get frustrated and lash out on other players. You know what those reports had in common? Feeders, trolls, and premades. People that would go 2/18 with 64 cs at 20 minutes, players that built 6 boots of mobility, players that intentionaly fed. People wo just ruin everyone's experience causing anger and frustration, trolling no-life kids, premades(2,3,4 players) that would group to troll in normals wasting everyone's time by rendering the game unplayable for everyone else, making it a breeze for the enemy team that would sometimes disrespect those who tried even when they were given a free game. And they reported those who called them on their bullshit, players who had their games ruined, and their nerves racked. I was the only one that gave pardons to those players, everyone else punished them, DESPITE being completely justified. That'd be the equivalent of someone being mugged,knocking the theif out cold, and then be sentenced for punching someone despite it being self deffense.\n\nWhy would those kinds of reports be decided legitimate? Why isn't the cause of frustration tackled with, and instead the result of the frustration got dealt with? Reporting and/or banning players that have their games fucked by trolls is the stupidest possible thing, instead of banning the trolls who cause toxicity in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-06-14T17:31:11.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish I knew what my report weight was so I could know to keep up my current rate or if I need to step it back a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snakezzy","date":"2015-06-14T17:01:55.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did you hear this?
