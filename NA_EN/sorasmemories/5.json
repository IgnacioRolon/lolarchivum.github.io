I played Miss Fortune and my score was 11/0/4. I rocked that game; however, for whatever reason, my support complained at me the entire game. Every team fight was followed with: &quot;MF I hate you. You just stand there and do nothing. You&#039;re useless.&quot; Um... I was attacking. How am I useless...? This teammate also used all chat to express what garbage I was. I think the term &quot;ball sucker&quot; was used too.\r\n\r\nI never retaliated or insulted or even cursed at this teammate. Not once. I said, &quot;I think I&#039;m doing well... But if harassing me makes you feel better? Go for it.&quot; This was followed with &quot;Um. I&#039;m sick of dying because you won&#039;t attack.&quot; But... I was attacking. I used everything. Hell, I obviously got kills.\r\n\r\nNone of my teammates expressed their distaste for my support&#039;s words. No one stood up for me. I&#039;m an adult and I don&#039;t need anyone to help me when I&#039;m getting bullied; HOWEVER, the fact that no one said anything while I was getting harassed is pretty sad. Actually, the fact that this person was harassing me IN THE FIRST PLACE is absolutely atrocious.\r\n\r\nCall me wrong, but I make an effort to stand up for people getting harassed in league, even if they were playing crappy. There is no excuse for calling people garbage, especially in a GAME!\r\n\r\nWhy...? Just why? Tell me... Why do LOL players want to fight so much? Why can&#039;t we just have fun?\r\n\r\nThis is why people leave this game.

And let's be clear, even relatively immature 30+ year olds are generally far more mature than 14 year olds.  As an older gamer myself I'm never not having to mute players who are obviously pubescent boys as they crack endless homophobic and scatological jokes, because when I don't it pretty much always devolves into flaming if the game goes bad.
