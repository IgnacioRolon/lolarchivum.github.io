I suffer through the lag and disconnects and hope a day will come when someone helps me.\r\n\r\nEver since the last patch, League of Legends has become a lagfest that disconnects me nonstop. My internet has not changed; yet, in game, I'm getting an average of 300 ping (it used to be 90) and I disconnect constantly. My ping will occasionally drop to 150, but I will experience lag like no other. I'm talking unresponsive champions, zero animations, enemy champions not showing up on screen....\r\n\r\nI guess I'm not important enough to get any help.","replies":[{"poster":"ImaCopUIdiot","date":"2015-02-04T22:11:07.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having huge ping increases as well.

I wonder if something major was changed in the recent patch (something more technical that would not have been discussed) that would cause League to suddenly use much more bandwidth (or something along those lines) than previously. The best speed I can get around here is 2mbps; but, I've been successful in playing League with that speed, and I've been playing for a year now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vasxazard","date":"2015-02-04T17:46:14.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same exact problem, but no where online can I find a solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tintinchi","date":"2015-02-05T13:27:39.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue, my net is perfectly fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Southsun","date":"2015-02-05T08:30:34.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same has been happening to me.","replies":[]}]}
