Farming is already difficult with poor hit boxes and unit collision. Now, I can&#039;t even see their health bars. The red is so dull and practically transparent. This last game was so painful with me having to squint all game.","replies":[{"poster":"ZRand","date":"2017-12-19T00:59:57.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I\"m colorblind and I couldn't see minion health bars at all with the winter map in the background.
