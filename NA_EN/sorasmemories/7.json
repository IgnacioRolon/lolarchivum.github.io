I think something needs to be done because her spell vamp is out of control. I don't ever see any other mage do heal as much as she does. Almost every game where there is an Akali, she is able to flawlessly triple kill and get out of the fight with full health. If I am fighting her, I can see her health bar go up in chunks when she attacks me.\r\n\r\nI'm also sick of point and click champions. No real effort required; just smash the keyboard buttons.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-08T17:40:32.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali only heals for tons if she's ahead.  This is one of the big problems with spell vamp as a mechanic in general, and is one of the reasons why spell vamp is on so few items today.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-01-08T18:36:37.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If Akali is going 1v3 and walking away with a triple, your team messed up hard and you may be done for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnonymousZao","date":"2015-01-08T18:05:03.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having trouble with Akali?\nJust use {{champion:45}}. \nStack your Q, when she goes to dash in Event Horizon -> Dark Matter and she's basically already half health and will need to retreat before you follow up with Primodial Burst + Baeful Strike. Plus when she uses Twilight Shroud just put a Dark Matter spell down right in the middle of it or use an Event Horizon right around it as it's about to end so she can't escape.\nPlus the fact veigar's ult does base dmg plus 80% of the enemies AP as damage, you will melt her with minimal items needed. Just get some MR of your own and she can't really do much against you and you ult alone will almost one shot her every time. With early lane control you will effectivly make her useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-08T17:52:28.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Assassins are flashy so they're allowed to get triples like it was nothing and get away scott free.
