I think we should add a stat to show how much gold we FED to the other team.\n\nWhat made me want to bring this back up again is a game I just played where our mid laner jumped into a 1v4. He managed to get a kill, but also died in the process and thus gave a kill and three assists to the enemy team. He seemed to believe this was perfectly reasonable and \"worth\". If we had a feature to show how much gold he fed in that transaction, I think it would help people realize the error of their ways.

Also, I highly doubt the 15-15-10 person is getting killed in 1v1's.  They may be dieing to over extended ganks, or they may be dieing through poor cc on their team.

Sometimes this is good, sometimes it's bad, but the point is that you need to THINK to decide which is which.  Players also aren't ending up 15/15/10 because the other team's focusing pressure on their lane, it's because that player has placed a very low value on staying alive. We can get into a bunch of 'what if's about roaming, free farm, whatever, but adding the stat will still be a better reflection of players' choices than anything we have now (and there's no freer farm than the farm that's left when your lane opponent's dead).  \n\nJust to reiterate, this isn't about trying to point the finger, it's about trying to improve the playerbase.

Fact #2 is that most people don't seem to know fact #1. For example, the tank charges a turret and stands there taking turret fire and enemy fire, before dying. Did he feed some gold that he never earned back? Yes. But by tanking that damage, he allowed the ADC to destroy the tower unmolested. Or a jungler that flashes into the enemy team and feeds a kill and 4 assists, but steals Baron buff for his team by doing so. Or the Nasus that went 1/7 but splitpushed top lane all the way to the nexus when the enemy team was fighting his team over Dragon. Or the support that went 1/8/5 but kept her ADC alive and thoroughly fed on CS in the laning phase, causing him to go 21/2 late game and carry the game.\n\nThe dumb player says \"but muh KDR\".

If you're 10-0 but the rest of your team is 0-10, being overly concerned with your own safety is more likely to lose you fights. Let me give an example. Look at nearly all of the top adcs on the challenger ladder. One thing they all have in common is that they play incredibly HAM on a consistent basis. The best adcs in the game constantly expose themselves to danger and put themselves at risk in order to have as much of an impact and do as much damage as possible. I'm all for playing safer and taking fewer risks in 1v1 scenarios, but staying out of danger in a team scenario means you've just put someone else on your team in danger.

Again, I don't place the blame on you in this scenario, just pointing out that it's something you can work on.
