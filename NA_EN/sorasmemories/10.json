Not just better at the game, but becoming a better person. When my team feeds like cray-cray, I don't get so angry. Just let it pass because I'll forget all about it when I'm ten minutes out. I remember my best games and my best plays a lot more. I'm striving to enjoy the game more - I still take it seriously, but I remember that it is just a game and NOT my life.\r\n\r\nI work in an environment where customers are always angry - League has helped me smile and laugh at angry people. Why? Because, 99% of the time, they're angry and raging at me, for something I didn't have any part of!! I've learned that I cannot change or control others, but better control myself.\r\n\r\nHumble in victory and graceful in defeat... I think the phrase goes like that....?","replies":[{"poster":"Buttigieg 2020","date":"2015-04-26T20:50:33.660+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol has made me a better douche.

Unfortunately it's really hard to organize it with my friends so im forced to play with strangers and more often than not it makes me really toxic, mostly I just get defensive and retaliate to provocation, but sometimes i'm the instigator when poor play or poor attitude irritates me enough.

You can, more or less, control playing well.
