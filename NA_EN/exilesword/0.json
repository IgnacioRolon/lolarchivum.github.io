He won't be able to back then come back with a static shiv and just auto win\n\nHe will have more sustain if he plays smart by more shields, which would fall off late game because he shield is not likely to generate more often u less he is dash I g around a fight and not going for his kill target\n\nIt's a nerf to damage for early and mid that evens out for late game\n\nHis AAs and Q would still do reduced crit damage, that wasn't suggested to change, the point of the change I suggested was to delay his power spike\n\nSure they could level windwall first, but the. The spells base damage would be shit because their lvl 1 and he doesn't have the items yet to make windwalls new passive strong \n\nThe point is cutting his kill power down till later in the game\n\nWindwall will likely be liked second which will result in lower base damage on Q as E is usually leveled first right now and will likely still be leveled first but now that windwall will. E leveled before Q he will lose some base damage even when ahead in items, his late game would result in a net even while delays I g the power spike through the change I suggested\n\nWithout making him utter trash because he will get more survival in laning conditions through more frequent shields, but at the same time he loses the ability to all in early because he loses a lot of base damage for Q being leveled last and windwall being leveled after E\n\nIt shifts his power to be more survive early game start picking up mid game and dominate late game, instead of the strong early game (1 item with crit runes can get him 100% crit atm) deadly mid game and dominate late game","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-11-29T20:50:35.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless he's fed, he's not likely to have Shiv before 6. \n\nMeaning his early game is going to be stronger since he'll have more shields to use. \n\nMid game for sure will take a hit.

I would recommend that in the early game, he has a little less starting AD but scales up to the same amount late game, and for crit, he starts out at 40% initial crit reduction that scales up 38%/35%/30%/22%/10% with ranks in his q (75%/60%/50%/39%/25% on active ability). additionally, leveling up his windwall should mean something so i suggest moving the sheild health scaling from his passive onto this with 100 initial flow amount scaling to 150/225/300/400/510 with each rank in w, as well as making his w requires a certain amount of flow (say 100) and consumes half of that (eg 50) until he max ranks the ability, so he has to choose to block ranged damage completely or be safe from burst. finally yasuo's e is indeed powerful but it has it's drawbacks in that he can be stopped with cc unlike master yi's alpha strike and after he casts it, he is stuck for up to a half a second traveling a fixed distance, which you can easily set up an aoe stun for. for the e I would simply shift the scaling of his flow regeneration with 60 initial and 59/57/55/52/48 by rank of e. because he's going to level it up anyways and charge his flow faster no matter what.\n\nwhen these changes are all taken into account, this changes the way yasuo is played situationally. because of the exponential scaling, yasuo is pretty dang weak early game. from level 1, a yasuo player has to take into account who he's up against and make a decision on how to level by the time he reaches rank 4. he could go the normal route with maxing r, e, q then w, but then he'd miss out on the damage he'd output against a squishy target with maxing his q to get his crit back to 10% reduced without items, or the security from burst like a level 6 rengar gank. he'd have to give up some stats in exchange for something else, adding long term planning and foresight on the yasuo player's behalf. additionally by tying these stats to ability rank, it would effectively delay some of his power spike until mid game and keep him rising as a melee carry when the game goes on(power spike on level 6, static shiv, maxing first ability, ie, maxing second ability, Lifesteal item, maxing ult, situational items, maxing final ability [all of which happen post level 6]). if this somehow weakens him to a below 38% win-rate or hardly gets picked, to compensate for his weak early game, they could potentially scale his late game damage or give him a 2 AD boost or nerf early game. the scaling on the passives could be touched up a little if necessary, which is the point: if he's too strong because of  a specific playstyle, they can adjust the way that he scales without gutting him or taking away the point of building crit on him early.\n\nTL;DR: keep double crit, add Scalings of other passives to ranks in abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2015-12-01T02:36:57.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"changing the flow shield passive scaling to his W would honestly be terrible, because that just straight up nerfs it since even then he would be maxing it last (weaker by level until he starts adding more points to it to eventually even out, so nerfed entirely up to level 18). But the changing it to costing half his maximum flow wouldn't be a bad idea IF he gets too oppressive to ranged champs (right now it is about how it should be where there are clear matchups he is favored but not absolute dominance).\n\nThe wording on your E changes are a little confusing, looks like you are having him generate less flow when leveling E? that seems a little counter-intuitive. Honestly his E is fine as is, there is a lot of power already given for maxing it. (ties directly to his in lane mobility and trading)\n\nThe crit reduction being tied to his Q is kinda interesting though, as it gives a clear reason to max it when farming well to hit his item spikes.\n\nhonestly though Alfavhunters change proposal is way easier and would feel better to have implemented","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UrPalAl","date":"2015-11-29T23:11:25.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"How to fix Yasuo:\n\nThey nerfed his core mastery, and they nerfed his core item.

It gives Yasuo the power curve and thus the Burst Damage of an Assassin, something that doesn't make sense if we consider Yasuo a DPS champion (which is further reinforced by his reliance on Attack Speed and Armor Penetration, mind you). One example is that maybe Critical Strikes can give him a minor attack speed boost, as this reinforces his job as a DPS Champion while also providing him reason to invest in Crit Chance like he does now.\n\nWe could replace the damage of the steroid entirely as well. Mind you that Yasuo is the most utility heavy Melee Carry of the Crit Based Melee Carries, why not keep playing on that by giving him a tool meant to aid him outside of raw damage? For example, Crit Chance plays into augmenting his Shield Passive, lengthening its duration or buffing its generation or raising how much it shields, for example (this also gives Yasuo only one true Passive). \n\nProbably my greatest criticism is that his current Passive is not something Yasuo _needs_ (well, maybe now he does, since they nerfed almost everything else in his kit without touching his Crit Chance passive). Yasuo does not _need_ a mid game damage spike, as that's the same reason why we criticized Vayne earlier in S5 (her Flat Damage and rushing an overtuned BotRK bumped her mid game higher than you'd expect of a hyper carry).

It was sarcasm because its not all that far off, when compared to other ADC. Even on someone with say... 300 armor after armor penetration from LW/upgrades and his ult the target has ~114 armor... before factoring in flat armor pen, shredding, reductions, etc. Pretty significant considering that is very tanky, armor wise, for anyone not named Malphite/Taric.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DogIsGod","date":"2015-11-29T18:09:14.630+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Gunslinger744","date":"2015-11-29T18:26:54.976+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"Oh, it's only **BONUS** armor pen?

Factor in any flat penetration/shredding/etc. and they are potentially at sub 100 armor or less. Meanwhile all other champs are competing with some ~180 armor before further shredding/flat pen/etc. and that is a very rather amount to compete with.\n\nDo us a favor and stop posting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2015-11-29T19:17:40.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"yasuo isnt very good if behind and his base health sucks","replies":[]}]}
