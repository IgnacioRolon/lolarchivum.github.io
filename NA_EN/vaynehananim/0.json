I got on a 20 minute ban because I was stuck in the pregame screen and nothing I could do about it because your trash servers wouldnt put me in the game. FOR THE 4TH TIME THIS MONTH. Most games go just fine, But some random times it wont let me in, and BAM insta leaverbuster. So it stacked. Why are you guys so F*$*$ing bad at fixing your stupid sh*&amp;t system? Imma just go to Dota 2. Y&#039;all is hella whack xD","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-01-07T07:35:49.610+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it really because of Riots servers, or is it actually something on your end instead? I use an old laptop myself so it takes a while for me to load into games. Because of that on rare occasions I'll sometimes get stuck at the loading screen and have to reconnect to get past it. That said, I have never gotten a Leaverbuster penalty because of it. If you've gotten a 20 minute penalty (the max amount) then that means almost certainly that there's something wrong on your end rather than Riots.\n\nThink about it, if it was truly something on Riots end causing this issue then more people other than yourself would be experiencing it. Because of that, while I get that you're frustrated, rather than blame Riot for connection problems try seeing if there's something on your end that may be causing it instead and then go from there.","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-01-07T07:55:58.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normally I would agree, but this is not the only post about it.

It could be an ISP problem, for instance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-01-07T12:37:00.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Inkling Commando,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=B5oyH4o1,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-01-07T07:55:58.707+0000)\n>\n> Normally I would agree, but this is not the only post about it.
