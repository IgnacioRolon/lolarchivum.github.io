They clearly wanted Varus to build attack speed, his W is there for that. They just need to shift him into a proper direction, want him to be an AD caster? murder every part of his marksman kit and replace it with better abilities that complement his AD caster side, instead of leaving him as a shitty ADcarry and an average AD mid who only spams Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-25T23:48:40.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have his W and passive the way they do so he's not just blowing his abilities mindlessly. While they could have give him a 3-hit passive, they instead chose to give him good poke and the ability to fend off tanks with a quick 3-AA's then E rather than tossing E and running away. \n\nHonestly, he's made a comeback every single season except S4, where Assassins were just a bit overly popular. Season 2 when he was released, he was used mid and ADC, especially as an ADC after Corki had gotten nerfed and people wanted poke comparable to Ezreal. S3, he was used as an ADC in pro play as a poke-based champion after Jayce was hit hard with nerfs. Now in S5, he's even been used in World's, though he was used by ROC in one of the worst played games ever (Nine minutes in, letting Riven take an inner for a mid outer).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maple Crusader","date":"2015-10-25T23:33:45.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least the other ADCs can buy cigars.\n{{champion:104}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-10-25T10:20:40.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not {{champion:119}} \n\n\n{{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]}
