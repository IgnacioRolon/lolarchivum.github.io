Why does the game favor more for people that start on blue team? Because people on blue team have the better camera view and can play the game more easily. people like me that rely on the self moving cam struggle on red team, sometimes missing opportunities. My simple question is why not move the rift horizontal and fix the problem for both teams and make not one team the map advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-18T15:14:37.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The red side gets it made up for by not having the tri bush on their bottom lane and having an easier time accessing the dragon pit. Late game they can also safely drop wards over the baron wall to gain vision over it. Due to the asymmetric design of the map a true lack of advantage for one side will never exist, but I would currently say that the red side has the advantage.\n\nI would suggest learning to play with your camera unlocked at least enough to lane effectively.","replies":[]}]}
