So I got my mystery gift pop up and it tells me absolutely nothing afterwards.  Do i really have to scroll through every single champion and skin to see which one I got?  I already checked my purchase history and 10 year anniversary icon is the last thing on it along with dark star varus which i purchased recently.  Is there any easier way for me to figure out what skin I got?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T16:16:47.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The pop up toast you'll see will likely be for the icon.
