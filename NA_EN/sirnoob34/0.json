I thought norms was to practice you champ or lane or mechanics but with the current systems mmr setting I cant imagine any one being able to practice with people around their mmr but just getting tilted do to the one sided all the games have. this isn&#039;t the first time I have seen the game be loaded on one side it has happened many of times I joined a friend of mine who is also silver 5 and we got two plats on the enemy team. how are you suppose to enjoy the game if you just get shit on by people extremely higher elo then you and that you cant even learn or practice, and no  you cant learn from playing bots only thing you can learn there is mechanics due to the bots not having jungle or even trying to set up ganks on your lane. this really needs fixed right it is getting very old to deal with higher elo all the time when I am just trying to have fun or practice a role.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-11T19:27:45.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely nothing, there is no MMR in normals.\nMaybe that is the problem?\n\nAll i see is an alistar with a runaans..
