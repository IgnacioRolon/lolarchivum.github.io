I can't take credit for this, but after months of being frustrated about this, I checked to see if someone had found a solution, and I found this Reddit post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4rhymk/what_happened_to_the_spectate_high_elo_players/\n\nInstructions:\n\nGo to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client_config_na\\releases\\0.0.0.58\\deploy\\ and find the file called \"lol.properties\" (This is a text file, so open it with a text editor. You will need to adjust your folder path depending on install location or version changes.)\n\nFind this line:\nlobbyLandingURL=https://frontpage.na.leagueoflegends.com/$localeCode/client/landing\n\nChange it to:\nlobbyLandingURL=\n\nSave the file. (It's also a good idea to save a backup of the original in case you wish to revert easily.)\n\nWhat the client seems to do is load a webpage onto the main client page. When you remove this URL, the client will show a different layout, and the Spectate Live section will be on the upper left of the main page.\n\nSince this change is just preventing a page from loading  (You could also possibly just block this with your firewall instead of altering the file, but I haven't tested this.), I don't believe that this is against Riot's terms of service, and they're still providing the old spectate functionality. This doesn't change the in-game files in any way.\n\nAgain, I can't take credit for this, but let your friends know that they can spectate again if they wish!","replies":[{"poster":"paisy","date":"2016-08-09T13:16:36.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worked for me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DænariusKhølerin","date":"2016-08-08T20:21:01.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This needs to be a thing for when you are waiting in queue.","replies":[{"poster":"heckin dead","date":"2016-08-08T20:45:05.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheBoscarDogma,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VEzyBH8o,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2016-08-08T20:21:01.487+0000)\n>\n> This needs to be a thing for when you are waiting in queue.\n\nIt puts you into a game as a spectator, so doing it while in Q doesn't, and didn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"DænariusKhølerin","date":"2016-08-09T00:38:27.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah true.
