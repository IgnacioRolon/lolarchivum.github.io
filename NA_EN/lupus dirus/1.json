I was 2-0 in my series and while I was waiting to lock in my champion my client crashed immediately giving me a loss in a game. After that I just lost my momentum and lost my series yet again. I know it isn't a new problem with the client crashing but is there any assurance that when I get there my 3rd time it wont happen again?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T22:05:27.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Client crashes in champ select are generally an indication that your connection is occasionally dropping before reaching the server. I recommend working through our [Network Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to work toward resolving this and preventing future crashes.\n\nLet me know if you continue to see issues after working through that guide.","replies":[{"poster":"Lupus Dirus","date":"2016-08-09T22:37:05.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't a connection error though.

I definitely recommend working through the connection guide to see if anything changes. \n\nLet me know the results.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
