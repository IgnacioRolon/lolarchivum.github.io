I am sure everyone has at least a couple times and the question is, why hasn&#039;t league put new maps into the game over the years? I have been wondering why but never really knew. So do you think Riot should put in at least two or  three more maps? I think they should, would be more fun to have something like that instead of playing on just Summoners Rift and Twisted TreeLine or even Howling Abyss all the time. I&#039;m pretty sure the maps get boring after a while. So what do you think should they put in some new maps?","replies":[{"poster":"Chaos Milk Tea","date":"2017-03-01T01:41:02.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to fix twisted treeline first.

It's already hard enough balancing 120+ champions on SR, balancing them around multiple maps is is simply unfeasible. Riot did try their hand at making alternate maps but they never worked out (bye Magma Chamber). So I don't think it's reasonable to expect any serious work on maps with alternate lanes and stuff anymore, it's kinda something Riot already tried to make it work but failed.","replies":[{"poster":"Azelder","date":"2017-03-01T04:52:57.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because Riot sucks at coding. (I.E. Spaghetti pathing) shit sucks so bad. Also, they COULD make new maps, that is why they have multiple teams working on different things for the game. They just won't because they feel that it would cause the game to change drastically and it would be a risk for pro's, which they treasure dearly for some fucking reason... *cough* money... *cough*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elkington VI","date":"2017-03-01T00:50:02.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, absolutely. The game is becoming beyond stale and rotating queue is not enough to keep things fresh. Specifically, the game lacks a fun, laid-back mode, like Dominion sort of used to be. 3v3 is worse than SR when it comes to snowballing and ARAM is ARAM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RÃ¢mmus Bot","date":"2017-03-01T00:43:30.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just something different in general.
