Like if I kill Blue Buff he will get 4 bonus health from the little creeps but nothing from the blue bluff itself. I&#039;ve killed the entire jungle except Rift Herald and Baron and I never got the bonus 10 health from any camp.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-19T00:52:26.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey INoble KnightI - \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nI had one of our champion friends take a look at this, and they're able to get the passive to work.  Monster camps should also be giving HP. Would you be able to walk me through any specifics you may have gone through / routes you may have taken to get this to happen? Did you level up W for the first time when dead?","replies":[{"poster":"INoble KnightI","date":"2016-04-19T04:45:42.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I rarely play him but after the game where it happened I watched a friend play and it worked. I tried it myself in a custom and it worked there. So I have no idea if it was a one time thing or just some weird bug.
