Loaded up for a game. Game wouldn't load. Had to try a couple of times. Finally got into game and immediately TP'd into lane and even got a 1 cs. Then boom my team starts the remake vote. And I got the leaver and lost 18 cs.\r\n\r\nI JOINED THE GAME AND EVEN GOT 1 CS TO PROVE IT. Not my fault game wouldn't load. I really hope Riot can help me out and regrant me the loss LP. \r\n\r\nI wanted to play, but my team voted. That is completely unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T22:48:06.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, we cannot modify LP or change LP loss after it has been recorded by the server.[ /Remake](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) flags anyone who is inactive for 90 seconds or more within the first 3 minutes of the match. If a player is marked by the system, the remake becomes available at 3:00 for a vote. If the vote passes, the match ends and those marked as inactive will receive a loss penalty. \n\nWhile I cannot resolve your LP issue, if you provide more details on what happened when you tried to load into the match initially, we can work together to resolve it.","replies":[]}]}
