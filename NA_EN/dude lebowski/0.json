Started the game with 99K from IP conversion then i had a \"Rune\" mission to \"Complete 1 matchmade game\" to claim my other 80K for rune conversion plus get a emote and icon. Finished the matchmade game it said i completed all 3 quests. I recieved my Emote and  Icon but not the 80K essence. It said i did after the game but it did not add it to my total. Still at 99K. Same after a restart as well. Any help would be most appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Scelto","date":"2017-11-09T00:48:37.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they didnt give me mine either so do not wait for it... i should get a lot even more then you but i just got nothing and i'm so pissed with \"everythins is fine with your acc\" god damn it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vecna","date":"2017-11-09T08:44:21.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact you have to go to the forums to figure out how to get your blue essence no in game tool tip other then some quest that pops up with another vague description, and the fact you have to go to youtube to figure out what \"Burst damage and target access\" even means.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T02:04:24.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you actually go into your loot and open the BE orbs the missions gave you ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sadorynx","date":"2017-11-09T01:09:07.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you can go to loots and go to materials and you can start crafting blue essence.","replies":[]}]}
