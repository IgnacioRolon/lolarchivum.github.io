Unstable graphics drivers, windows power settings, and corrupted game files are the biggest causes.

I would then turn on GPU temps, GPU usage percentage, fan speed, FPS, CPU usage percentage, and CPU temps, on the monitoring tab in settings. This will allow you to see exactly how hard your hardware is working while playing and if it isn't max and your temps aren't very high while playing league then it is league itself or some of the settings you have in league. You can also turn on RAM usage to see just how much you actually have left while playing. We want to make sure it is league itself, not any hardware issue whatsoever. If you are still getting low FPS. With those on I'd suggest playing an ARAM or even a custom game for awhile so it isn't a massive problem if your FPS is low. If it is a hardware issue, especially an overheating one, then I'd suggest getting a can of condensed air, opening up your case, and cleaning that sucker out if that's something you do not normally do. If it isn't a problem with hardware then something that may help is to turn most settings back up to medium and experiment with what gives you the best FPS. Often times by putting the game down to low or minimum it will shift it usage off of your graphics card and on to your CPU which is why in some games your performance may be better when around medium rather than when you are on low. Other than that I'm not exactly sure what to tell you and perhaps a rioter could help you more than I could. I would like to know what your PC specs are because that maybe be useful info.","replies":[]}]}
