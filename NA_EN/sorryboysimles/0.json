Ostensibly limiting a team to just one 1 high elo in disguise who may or may not be able to consistently carry his boostee and 3 bad teammates. Obviously could do it since we see high elo climb out of low elo on new characters all the time, but it could be more difficult. \n\nNow you can have a boostee + 4 boosters, or other combinations like 2 boostees and 3 boosters, allowing for a faster and more consistent climb, since the randomness of the other players on team can be controlled. Faster and more consistent makes it more attractive to both sides and more lucrative to boosters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2016-04-13T23:01:29.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Im pretty sure the act of tanking their elo to get to a place where they can queue with someone much lower is against the rules somewhere but as far as I understand and have seen, this is happening a lot. I ran into a pair of higher elos doing this. Fresh accounts, lost all 10 of their provisional games on purpose (I happened to be in one of those losses and have been watching them since) and then right when they hit that bronze they started triple queing with another player in bronze who had 100+ games there and within another 10 or so games, that player was silver and the duo boosters are back to tanking their elo back into bronze to do it with more people.\n\nI would like to know Riot's actual stance on this in particular.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1 800 MID LANE","date":"2016-04-13T03:41:20.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's against the rules. However, the issue is that it's significantly easier to get away with. Paying money for an in-game advantage that isn't an official thing is punishable in every single multiplayer game today.
