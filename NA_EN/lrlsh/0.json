Another huge part of the game is knowing what your champ is(are you a damage champ? and if so are you AD or AP? are you a tank? are you an off tank? ect) and how you need to play(are you an engager? are you a peeler? are you a follow up? are you a back line? what do you need to do in fights). Then runes/masteries are also a part of the game that you will need to have to start climbing(2 good rune pages are normal AD: 9 flat AD marks, 9 flat Armor Seals, 9 flat MR glyphs and 3 flat AD quints. Then normal AP: 9 flat magic pen marks, 9 flat armor seals, 9 flat MR glyphs and 3 flat AP quints) then KNOWING THE CHAMPS YOU PLAY. If you play every champ like {{champion:238}} then you will lose.

I'd like to point out that It's not easy game to get out of noob-hood.  \n\nYear after year, the game has consistently increasing in complexity (to keep the \"experts\" amused).  The normals and lower ranks are filled with ragers, afks and feeders.  (And let's not get into the blind system which has people cutting and pasting their desired roles.)  The AI games are filled with Yasuos who run from lane to lane stealing minions so you can't practice your last hits and assassins who constantly take out the enemy bots without giving you an assist or a kill.   And when a newbie posts something in the forums either here or in Reddit asking for help, then you either get the \"git guds\", \"the rank boosters\" or \"the bronze sucks\" comments.  \n\nConsider my comments pre-seasoned with just a dash of salt.  But you are welcome to salt and pepper 'em as you see fit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lRlSH","date":"2016-11-20T18:36:26.762+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats true IF and only IF that noob isnt willing to learn","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-20T18:44:17.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every time you die ask yourself \"did i do everything i possibly could have done before i died?\"  and after taking an objective \"what needs to be destroyed next, and why?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2016-11-20T18:33:51.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teach them the importance of cs, different roles and classes, trading, and map control.","replies":[{"poster":"lRlSH","date":"2016-11-20T18:38:08.873+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know cs last hitting..i get some of the roles ie top mid adc supp and jg but not deeper into the roles of the classes...not good at trading..and not good at map control..hence why im trying to get others who know more to teach","replies":[]}]}]}
