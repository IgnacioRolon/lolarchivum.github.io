I nearly have the same specs as my friend and he gets around 300 fps per game and I have never seen a number close to that on my pc. I have tried everything from reinstalling my drivers to changing where my fans are plugged into my pc. I find it weird as well that my CPU's temperature is around 40 when I don't do anything. The reason I decided to post this on the league forums is that I haven't seen anyone else with this problem and it doesn't seem to affect anything else than league of legends. My specs are i5 7600k and an Asus 1070. If you have had this problem I would love to hear if you found a solution &lt;3.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T16:47:25.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Run through our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide in case your settings and drivers might need a tune up or update, though reinstalling drivers was a good step.
