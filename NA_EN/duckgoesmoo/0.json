It may be common knowledge that slipped me by but just strikes me as odd and wondering if the new client has access to these features, or if they even exist on it?\r\n\r\nIf they don&#039;t, will the menu &#039;spells&#039; still exist on the profile page as it doesn&#039;t seem big enough to require its own tab, and could maybe be grouped with something else.\r\n\r\n Maybe being able to see your friends skins could be interesting as well? It would be useful if you want to say gift someone a teemo skin but they already have the better ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot SapMagic","date":"2016-04-27T22:20:22.087+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DuckGoesMoo!\n\nI can try to shed some light on this from the perspective of the updated client. \n\nWe want Profile to be a summative view of you (or your friend) as a player - skill level, identity, and play style. It's also important that we do our best to protect account security and privacy. We probably wouldn't create a feature that lets you see which champs or skins they've purchased since that could give you a lot of information about their spending habits. There ARE probably other interesting things we could show (like champion mastery), although that isn't something we're planning for the initial release.\n\nOne other thing I wanted to mention - the Spells page will still be in the client, but it's moving to Collection along with other things that belong to you like runes and masteries. More on that soon, so stay tuned!","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsanitysTheName","date":"2016-04-27T21:43:39.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do not have access to the champs or item sets of other players due to privacy concerns/toxicity concerns. However, I totally agree with you that the spells tab doesn't need to exist. As the new client rolls out I'm sure we will see a redesigned interface.","replies":[]}]}
