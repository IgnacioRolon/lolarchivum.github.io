One of the things that everyone has largely overlooked is the state of Corki. If you look at the changes, every single thing they did to him was a straight buff. That magic damage can chunk out turrets much faster than he used to, the new items are really fun on him. especially rapid firecannon (you can max range triforce procs with bonus damage. yes please) his &quot;The package&quot; is just sickeningly good. yes you can only use it every so often, and you can&#039;t always use it well, but if anything it is like home-guards without needing to buy it. it is also an insane amount of CC for an ADC to have... a 5 second,  90% slow that does damage? the only thing people need to know is that it knocks everyone you fly over well out of range, so it is best used  in tight quarters and as a zoning tool (or a balls to the wall rumble ult engage, which is crazy fun to do). the next thing is that it lets you use your regular W almost right after, so you can do some pretty ridiculous things with it. His power spike is much stronger mid game now, and he is just all around better than he was.\n\n\nNote: his magic damage now is most of his damage. don&#039;t let riot fool you, they are wizards who have found a way to turn an adc into a secret freelo mage who&#039;s AAs can hit like a truck.\n\n\nCorki&#039;s power is amazing, and I highly suggest people give him a try. He isn&#039;t like graves (lul faceroll OP wtf did they do to my main !?!??!), but I think Riot did well with Corki and once you get used to his unique style, Corki can be menace. (I really recommend getting triforce&gt;boots1&gt;rapid firecannon&gt;sorc boots) it is really fun and gives him a really crazy power spike and some ludicrous range and damage.","replies":[]}
