Even staple mids like orianna have been replaced with LB/cho/ekko/ other \"OP\" champions... \r\n\r\nOn a final note.... Lux's rank 5 E costs more than her ult by 30 mana.... wtf is up with that? Her E is one of the more vital parts of her kit... why have it cost that much? It leaves her OOM in lane if she uses it more than once every few minutes. Why should a champion specializing in ranged harrass be so gated by the exact thing that should make her strong?","replies":[]}
