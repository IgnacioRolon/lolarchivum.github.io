My question is why do you play? Right now I am addicted to tristana and her late game W resets. I will adc an entire game just waiting to try and get those chaining W resets or even use it to turret dive late game. I once used it to ult an ori into my teammates and out from under her own mid turret and get the reset to get out. I love my LC$BigPlays.\r\n\r\nI also really like skins or landing a tricky combo or making a good call or even getting that lucky AF shot in the dark to get a kill\r\n\r\nThst being said everyone plays for different reasons.... why do you play?","replies":[]}
