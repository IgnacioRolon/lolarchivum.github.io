He feels underwhelming, and yes, while people can have success with him, he has low cc and can&#039;t function as a tanky/frontline champ until he gets at least his 3rd or 4th item...\r\n\r\nHe can&#039;t burst people, he can&#039;t stick unless he buys an item to do so({{item:3022}} yuck) or if he runs ghost.... \r\n\r\nI just feel like he is in the really weird spot where he is a bruiser/diver... but isn&#039;t really good at either until late game.... even Vi is in a much better spot than he is...\r\n\r\nI have found a few things that have worked for me, but I feel like in doing so i am just patching up his pretty obvious flaws and trying to find ways to work around them.... \r\n\r\nanyone else kinda feel this way about XIn? Are there even any Xin Zhao players anymore? Has anyone found a good build path/runes/masteries that allow him to function a bit better?","replies":[{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2016-09-01T18:15:52.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would say {{item:1416}} {{item:3078}} and lvl W for sustain.\nOR {{item:1400}} {{item:3025}} \nbut w/e you do get a sheen item not lichbane.\nfrom there on out go tanky\n{{item:3143}} {{item:3047}} for when they are heavily ad /aa reliant do not underestimate ninja tabi the damage reduction from those in jungle and against adc in early mid is insanely usefull.\nfor mr{{item:3065}} should be your first defensive item other good mentions are {{item:3156}} {{item:3102}} .\n\nif your build looks like this {{item:1400}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3065}} and you feel like you are carrying hard {{item:3053}} {{item:3026}} to make sure you keep carrying\n\nas a general rule of thumb\n{{item:1416}} is for objective controll you get this when your team is doing reasonably well.\n{{item:1400}} is for ganking lanes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2016-09-01T18:08:06.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember a couple years ago i would build the warriors item for the strong early ganks, then into full tank for late game. I only did one game with the devourer/rageblade combo when it was a thing, and it was hilariously strong; the enemy WW built the same thing and would be annihilated in a duel with me. I feel like the temptation to go heavy damage is strong, since so many damage items work well on him, but it's best to go mostly tanky based on how his kit works.

I wouldn't think those items would be all that great on him, but it seems like you build him straight tank aside from mallet.... maybe this is a really noob thing to say, but doesn't he need some damage or lifesteal? it seems like he would do no damage otherwise.... i might give it a try, i always thought resistance stacking might be an under rated startegy on him....\n\nalso isn't ibg and frozen mallet a bit redundant...? the slows at least","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2016-09-01T17:59:28.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, I'm gonna share the best way I use to win more games using this Xin Zhao build in particular. \n\nEvery time you successfully gank, type in all chat: \"Let It Goooo!

Also, don't underestimate 900 extra mana. Xin Zhao heals enough even without items to always be at full health outside of combat, but he has no means to gain more mana, and running out of mana, not health, is usually the main cause of me recalling. The extra mana allows me to literally never go have to go home except to buy items. \n\nNotice that I buy two straight up Health Items (Cinderhulk and FM) first. Since these two provide 1207.5 extra health on their own, resistances become so much more efficient to stack.\n\nIn team fights, AoE is King. IBG is there for the AoE Physical Damage and AoE Slow, Cinderhulk is there for the AoE Magic Damage, and Frozen Heart is there for the AoE Attack Speed Debuff. Frozen Mallet is just there to make sure no stragglers get any bright ideas to run away.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-08-26T06:52:23.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin Zhao is GREAT in low elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stalinium","date":"2016-08-25T03:40:22.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't, you play {{champion:79}} because almost all of his abilities are similar to but better than Xin's","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-08-26T06:51:30.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stalinium,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rifWnfsN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-25T03:40:22.708+0000)\n>\n> You don&#x27;t, you play {{champion:79}} because almost all of his abilities are similar to but better than Xin&#x27;s\n\nThis is probably the worst comparison of champions I've seen in a while.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-08-25T02:57:31.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhhhhh you hopefully get ahead early but then mid game comes and you just get kited to death every single fight.
