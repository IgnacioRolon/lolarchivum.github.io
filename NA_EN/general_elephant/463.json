(wtf is he thinking ffs!?!?!)\r\n\r\nbut hear me out. he is an all in brawler designed to snowball off of early engages. who is weak early game? mages and assassins. with skaarl you get a bit of a life line, and if you take exhaust, you have even more kill pressure. (i say exhaust because it prevents damage from knocking you off skaarl too fast in your primary engage) and he does well with maw.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve never played kled in my life, but I did okay. the fact at 6 he can ultra roam with his ult top or bot makes him a force to be reckoned with. \r\n\r\nif you wanna have some trolly AF fun in a norm, I recommend going Kled mid. its the most fun i&#039;ve had in a game in a long time.\r\n\r\nalso max w on Kled, don&#039;t be dumb, his AA steroid on his w is his primary damage source. q+e just keep you in range to proc that juicy 4th hit","replies":[]}
