It isn&#039;t hard to see that across the board people are placing substantially lower than previous seasons for the most part. \r\n\r\nFor example, I got absolutely wrecked by an Ezreal as Corki (it happens, we&#039;re all human.. i think). now Ez is a bit of a counter to Corki because of how much a good arcane shift can screw up most of Corki&#039;s damage (if you miss Q and an R you&#039;re done). I got demolished, my support was equally screwed. We were straight up worse than our opponents, so I deserved the loss. It made sense. Even still, I checked post game and saw their adc was plat last season and their support was gold... vs me, a silver III last season and my support who was also silver last season. in what world is it okay to say &quot;hey, I know you&#039;re in bronze 1 right now and made your promos.... lets put you against a plat adc&quot;. not a smurf, but someone who was legitimately plat last season, when I&#039;ve never been past silver III\r\n\r\nI gave it more thought, and it came down to two things. The new dynamic queue meaning people get their best two roles no matter what, and the reset they did that was placing people who were really good way down into bronze/silver territory. Bronze and silvers can&#039;t go any lower, so they are forced to play against these players, and inevitably feed and lose really hard. \r\n\r\nThis doesn&#039;t mean that &quot;lol elo hell cause high elo&#039;s beating up on low elo players&quot; but it DOES mean that Riot made a bad call on how they handled the rank resets this year. I get they want you to climb, but placing people 2 entire divisions lower than they were last season seems a bit much.They are just forcing bad players to get a ton of really good players to beat down on bad players until the good  players climb to where they were, all while crushing the morale of the players in bronze/silver who are just trying to climb a little.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll end on this note....\r\n\r\nRiot. I get you want people to feel accomplished by climbing, but you forget that it is at the expense of your newer players. You&#039;re hurting your own game by forcing these large skill gaps in your games. You should really reconsider how ranked resets and placements are handled (not promos/series mind you). You should try to match players of equal skill level for every game, and not sacrifice the skill gap for convenience. If there isn&#039;t anyone queuing for a match in that skill bracket, don&#039;t loosen the criteria just to match games faster.... the point of ranked is that players of relatively similar skill levels fight a fair match in order to determine who deserves to advance and who doesn&#039;t. It should never come down to a single/few players that are way better than those others carrying one way or the other.","replies":[]}
