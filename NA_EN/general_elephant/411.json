The internet has not helped me, and Bethesda support basically said &quot;get rekt&quot; because I&#039;ve played over the return time and i&#039;m under the minimum specs (kinda, but it ran for 30 damn hours....) so they won&#039;t even attempt to help me.\r\n\r\nGG. Guess I just wasted $60. (I might just download it on a desktop that is not really &quot;mine&quot; but I can use it somewhat freely.... but even then... it sucks)","replies":[]}
