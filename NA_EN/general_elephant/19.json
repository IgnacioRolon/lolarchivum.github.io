Sure I am not amazing, I make tons of mistakes. We all do, but I have never in all my years of playing this game encountered something as asinine as the last 40 or so games I&#039;ve played. cumulatively I&#039;ve been able to win 10 out of 36 in the last two weeks. I get a lead early, I try to clear my jungle efficiently and focus on doing the most optimal things I can be... I try to shot call and warn my team about where the enemy jungler might be and when... and my match history looks like this...\r\n\r\nbeware... this isn&#039;t for the faint of heart...\r\n\r\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=General%20Elephant\r\n\r\npart of the issue is me. I try too hard to wrestle back some form of control.... in doing so I often try to take higher risk plays in order to provide some breathing room. maybe I should stop trying to fight it, if my team wants to take troll picks and play like monkeys... I can&#039;t stop them. I can&#039;t dodge every game... and it is impossible for me to sit back idly by while everything falls apart. A lot of my games end in high deaths because by that point the enemy is so fed me being 4/2/5 doesn&#039;t cut it, so I just force myself to try to make something happen in last ditch efforts and die a couple times at the end while our base is in shambles and the enemy team is just playing with their food....\r\n\r\nI was silver I 42 lp, and now i am silver IV 75 lp. over the course of the last two weeks. I guess silver is still just silver...","replies":[]}
