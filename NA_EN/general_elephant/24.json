I answered truthfully, but as a sales position I think they wanted someone who was &quot;thirsty&quot; to make sales, and as such my pending interview with them was cancelled. Unfortunate, but honestly, if they don&#039;t like that I&#039;m not willing to manipulate people into buying financial products, and would rather rely on my persuasive abilities, then it is their loss and I probably wouldn&#039;t want to work for them anyway. It is kinda crappy though because it was among the highest paying opportunities available for someone of my educational background  and work experience....","replies":[]}
