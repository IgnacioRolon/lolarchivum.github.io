Yall are complaining how hard it will be to get BE, and how the game is all fked up and so on and so forth...\r\n\r\nI for one embrace these changes. the reason BE is relatively harder to get is because the total pool of unlockable content was drastically reduced. previously you had to unlock runes and champions... so IP had to be relatively easy to get... since now you can only unlock champions, and the concept of shards for unlocking mean there are more paths to acquiring champions.... the overall result is the per point, BE is more valuable than IP was, despite the champion prices remaining static.\r\n\r\nAnd people complaining about the new rune system.... its the first few days of pre-season... ofc its gonna be crazy AF. Nothing is balanced right now because a major change just occurred.... let them slowly re-balance and we&#039;ll be better off in the long run, the old system was costly for new players and created a lot of issues for the longevity of the game... these changes fix that to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nTry to be positive and stop being mad at Riot. Being angry is pretty pointless now anyway...\r\n\r\nAlso as an aside... can someone explain why Rito threw 40k BE my way? was it because i was a &quot;conqueror&quot; in terms of time played when i unlocked the emote? I had 37.5k after conversion and then i get these four 10k BE orbs.... idek man....","replies":[]}
