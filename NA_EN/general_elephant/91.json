I used to main corki adc, then they ruined him (especially after the triforce changes) and the graves rework, bot lane has been very harsh to me lately, top lane i basically just OTP GP but he did just get some hefty nerfs... i can barely break a 50% w/r on him to begin with (i&#039;m a shitter, i know) i used to jungle xin, then they wrecked guinsoo, i still play him, but every game just feels like i am pulling teeth to do things other junglers do without a problem. I never really liked mid, and i only ever really play lux who is kinda lack luster atm.... support is just not very fun and i am not the best at it.\r\n\r\nup until a few weeks ago, i had a home in league, but now i am a mainless and homeless League player who doesn&#039;t know what to do. i don&#039;t even know what kind of meta is strong/weak right now.... all i do is play GP/xin and hope to win.... maybe i&#039;ll go back to volibear... idk.... maybe i could dust off the nautilus jungle... idek...\r\n\r\nany advice or tips would be appreciated, i just feel a bit lost when it comes to league :/ i wanna keep playing and get to gold, but nothing &quot;feels&quot; good anymore...","replies":[]}
