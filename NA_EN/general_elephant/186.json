I instantly get yelled at by our nasus and the rest of the team in normals. 28 minutes roll around, nasus and vayne get caught out, i'm too far to do anything, we are up by 5 kills and have all our inhibitor turrets still, and all the sudden i see \"your team has agreed to surrender 4 to 0!\". post game nasus (who ended 6/4/2) started flaming me.\r\n\r\nGD, was I wrong for buying a rylai's on cho'gath? it honestly seemed to do more good than anything. I had over 3k hp by the 20 minute mark and had some decent damage. should I have just build a RoA and been a boring brick wall like every other game?","replies":[]}
