(resurrected)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heads up, i wrote this 10-2013, so it is a bit dated, but still rings true to this day :)\r\n\r\nI have a new rule for playing ranked, and since I've been applying it I have gone from 30-34 to 38-35. It is something anyone can do, and I truely believe it will help everyone.\r\n\r\nIt has to deal with muscle fatigue and neuro-transmission. When playing your games, have you ever felt jittery mid way through? That is the result of muscle fatigue caused by constant tension, as well as neural fatigue caused by constant very minor movements of your fingers to use your mouse and key board. Now that we have established an issue, a mild amount of credibility, and we can all agree by reducing this, it would moderately improve your motor function, making all your plays more accurate and game changing. So... How do we affect this issue in a positive way? I spent a long time thinking... And I realized it was on my back the entire time! In front of my eyes the entire time! Especially considering what has being on everyones' minds lately! Light hoodies/jackets. What does every single player at worlds wear? A team jacket... Why? Because it reduces strain on your muscles, and there by nerves by allowing more blood flow (through being warmer, your veins get dilated, allowing much better circulation). My last 9 games I applied this. I went 8/1. I noticed better reaction times, better cs, and much more accurate skill shots. Before i had a negative w/l at silver V 0 lp, and always wore a simple shirt, i wasn't cold, but I wasn't vasodilated either... After I'm at a positive w/l, and sitting in Silver IV for the first time, at 24 lp and have been doing this every game since, no matter what!\r\n\r\nI hope this helps everyone, I am dead serious. It has helped me tremendously.\r\n\r\nedit 1: this is best observed at 60-70 degrees F. your computer gets angry if it is anywhere warmer, and that will hurt your game. if you are warm in a t-shirt... go somewhere colder. your computer will thank you.","replies":[]}
