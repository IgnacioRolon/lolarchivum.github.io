Some posts may be league related, others not. That being said, here I go.\r\n\r\nI live life in accordance with two simple rules. Be a good person, and try to be happy and bring happiness. I don't think life is really something that should be wasted. We have a limited time on this planet, so wasting it by always looking to the next step or next goal seems silly... I do want to make something of myself and live a prosperous life, but that doesn't mean I can't try to enjoy life now. I think people are too focused on the future, and don't really ever stop to try and enjoy the small things that make life... well... life. I try to find  a reason every day as to why I had a good day. I refuse to accept that any day, no matter how poorly it went, didn't have something in it that I could enjoy at least a little bit. In my mind, I have normal days and I have good days. Bad days simply put people in the mind set  of  disappointment, and it is a very slippery slope. There are a million things in life people can be upset about. The real key to happiness is finding solace in the things that make life bearable.","replies":[]}
