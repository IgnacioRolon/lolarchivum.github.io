I think it is because it fills a void in our lives. Lonely people play for human interaction, weak people play it to become dominant, social people use it as an outlet to be social, but still lazy in their own house. The list goes on. \n\nnow GD, tell me why YOU love league, and don't lie, you do, or you wouldn't be reading this post, on this forum, wasting your valuable time, reading garble written by a nobody.\n\n\nI love league because I like the challenge, I'm not challenged in anything I do, nothing is overly difficult in my life... I have a lot of spare time, and honestly it is nice to meet people, play, try and have fun, then move on. I am an introvert, and don't like long term drama. I can deal with flamers, trolls, dbags, try-hards, the lot, because at the end of the day... I'd like to think I did something to help them be a little less toxic. How else can you influence so many people? lead by example. I apologize for mistakes, I try to be helpful if I see someone doing something that might be hurting their game, I always try my best (and fail a lot because I am still regaining my edge from a long break i took from the game) but it all boils down to the fact that this game is challenging, I can maybe help people sometimes (most ignore and move on), and I enjoy trying to do the best I can, even though it is a game and completely worthless in my actual life.\n","replies":[]}
