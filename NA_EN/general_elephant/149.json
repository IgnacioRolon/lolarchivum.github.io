All that hard work and learning and progressing, and Riot just says &quot;this brand new level 30 who has played a single ranked game that he lost in his entire career deserves to be your mid laner in your silver I ranked game.&quot;\r\n\r\nI kinda expected this climbing through low silver... 5, 4, 3, and even 2 on rare occasion... but man... I just got into silver I, the season is about to end... and this is what I see... We were actually really close to getting a lead, but a ziggs with free cs, freedom to roam, and a competent team makes it really tough to get anything done much less keep your turrets....","replies":[]}
