If you can guarantee a kill, good, but it isn't worth dying over. You dying puts your whole team behind, you killing puts you ahead of your team mates slightly. Even at 0/0/0 if you have great CS and good teamwork skills to take dragon... you'll still be a threat come mid game (and you won't end the game 0/0/0, I promise,opportunities will come up). TBH, just put a sticker over the spot where it tells you your KDA.\r\n\r\nI'm a scrub, but trust me on this, next time your gut tells you to dive, chase or do something else that is stupid... don't. Turn around and walk away.\r\n\r\nwatch a few spectator games, and watch your favorite lane and just how often they walk away from engages... it will surprise you","replies":[]}
