I&#039;ve noticed something... You know how when you queue up and someone doesn&#039;t hit accept/ someone hits decline? Do not re-queue. chances are they are either not caring enough to hit the accept button because they are tabbed or something, or their computer is having latency issues. in either case, you do not want to risk getting that person on your team, because lets face it... even if odds are slightly against it, they will end up on your team more than you&#039;d like.\r\n\r\nmy advice? wait 3-5 minutes then re-queue.\r\n\r\nSounds stupid... but tbh... I&#039;ve noticed an improvement.\r\n\r\nalso note I am a bit superstitious about LoL because of how off set teams are sometimes and how frustrating some teammates can be.\r\n\r\nit might all be in my head (as in, yeah, it more than likely has no impact) but I&#039;d like to think it makes a difference.","replies":[]}
