I even saw some garen foam swords and corki hats, ziggs hats. I thought they were custom made, but no, I started seeing repeats. Riot is cranking out cheaply made, high cost products to make HUGE profit margins! 1 attendee probably spends more in 1 day than most league players spend on in 1-2 years through RP.\r\n\r\nRiot is stackin' bank rolls off of the LCS. good for them. maybe they can hire more help to make the actual game better... lol yeah right.","replies":[]}
