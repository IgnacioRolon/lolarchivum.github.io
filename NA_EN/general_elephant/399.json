And very narrow margin timing, but honesly at that point it could go either way anyway. I&#039;ll tell you what though, at 70-100 ping I miss more cs than&#039;d like too because that big wave of casters on my side decided to change targets and kill the minion in 0.5 seonds and many other tiny inconveniences that would be somewhat stopped by lower ping. While I will still be bad, if this helps my early game cs and I can get my first back bf or nlr etc it will hugely impact my laning phase even if it is only just a little more often. I would do better than I currently am, and I hope it makes my games  atleast more cs consistent if anything.\r\n\r\nBetter ping doesn&#039;t change what you do in game, it just makes things an incredibly tiny amount easier to execute. That might make a big difference for some, and not for others. It all depends.","replies":[]}
