Enough to be a core item.\r\n\r\nThe tank item changes provide a little less hp for a bit more resists. This is good for xin because lifesteal scales better with resists than raw hp. As each point of hp recovered is &quot;tankier&quot; than it otherwise would be with less resistances.\r\n\r\nWith Xin being a really strong initiator, GA having extra AD at the cost of resistances is a net gain, and while GA is situational on Xin, it makes it much more viable than previous.\r\n\r\nXin is at a tipping point right now. He isn&#039;t that great, but there are a lot of changes that will directly improve his ability to do what he does best.\r\n\r\nWith the tank item patch I think Xin will become meta again. Not super OP, but at least more viable. We don&#039;t want a sated guinsoo insanity again (I do, but most people don&#039;t, because lets face it, it was really broken)","replies":[]}
