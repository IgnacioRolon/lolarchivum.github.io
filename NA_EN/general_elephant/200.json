I tried to get on board with the changes and the reasoning behind switching the system... but the more I think about it, the worse the system seems... and not for the reasons everyone is having an issue with. I have two major issues with this new system...\r\n\r\n1. Forces unlock inefficiency. In order to get BE, you have to dust stuff, and starting in 7.23, you can get 50 BE from your daily win. If I were to level from 1-30, and unlock 30 chests, I am then forced to dust shards to get the currency to unlock champions that I would like to play. Conversely, I have the option to hold on these shards for an infinitely long amount of time, never breaking them down in the hopes I one day will have three of a kind for the &quot;free&quot; unlock. This means the account is locked out of ranked until you have matched 3 champ shards for a total of 20 champions (minus ashe  garen and annie, i think those are freebie unlocks). If you do decide to break down some shards you aren&#039;t interested in, you are actively making your total BE expenditures increase. So in the end your options are, dust everything for as close to immediate gratification as possible and spend exponentially more in the long run, spend some and save some, or wait an infinitely long amount of time until you start getting triplicates of shards.\r\n\r\n2. Hidden BE costs. I used to think this new system was supported by the idea that there is less total content to unlock, but now that mastery and leveling emotes cost so much, its reasonable to believe this new system has a larger total pool of unlockable content. Meaning your BE is worth less than IP was overall when comparing the two. One of  my main arguments for the system was that there was less content to unlock. That clearly is no longer the case...\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nI still love the concept of BE being an all purpose currency, but the fact you are punished so heavily by just trying to unlock champions you wanna play is bullshit. You either wait a long ass time and unlock random champions as they come, or you unlock them as fast as possible and spend way more BE in the long run. Also the total pool of BE expenditures actually outpaces the old champ and rune system, so BE is currently worth less than IP was.\r\n\r\nRiot, please be more transparent. These changes actively harm players, and yet you did it anyway. It feels like you were trying to pull the wool over our eyes by trying to draw attention to exp gains and a chunk of free BE. I would like to see these issues addressed, but I doubt that anything will happen overall....","replies":[]}
