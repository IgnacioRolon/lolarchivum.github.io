As a trash Xin main I would love this.\r\n\r\nFor those who don&#039;t know, building crit on Xin is typically frowned upon as his  W&#039;s third AA does &quot;crit&quot; but doesn&#039;t increase to the full 200% bonus had your regular crit chance allowed it to crit. This means Xin Zhao building crit was almost always a sub-optimal choice. As a result, he could never build phantom dancer and be happy about it. While most of the time you probably won&#039;t be building crit on XIn anyway, it is nice that he now at least has that option (hopefully). \r\n\r\nI was hoping for larger changes to happen for Xin, but any news is good news for him in the current state of the game. He isn&#039;t completely unplayable, but everything about him feels dated and outclassed. Why play Xin when you could Yi/Jax etc? I like Xin, I just wish he was a little more viable in the current state of the game.","replies":[]}
