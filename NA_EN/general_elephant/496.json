Incapable of social\nb.      she is 45, pretty, psychically sensitive and nimble\nc.      she is well trained as a fighter both in shooting and melee, but her true passions are that of healing and growing food/crops\n\nSam (female)-\na.     incapable of caring, firefighting, and plantwork\nb.     she is 29, a night owl, a careful shooter and has a chemical interest in drugs\nc.     she was a bush sniper before joining the colony, and loves animals to bits. she is a mean cook and a sharp shot. she once hit a squirrel from \n        150 yards out with nothing but a recurve bow. \n\nGreen (female)-\na.     incapable of caring\nb.     she is 23, steadfast and loves women\nc.      a brilliant mind and nimble hands, she was a born researcher and crafter. she can do anything she puts her mind to, just not healing people. \n         While she is equally skilled in melee and ranged combat, she never intended to be on a battle field. Her home is in the research lab and \n         workshop\n\nFalcon (male)-\na. Capable of anything\nb. he is 50, neurotic and a hard worker\nc. Born in a simple tribe and raised as a herder, Falcon grew to love mining. exploring the earth is one of his greatest passions in life and he would mine until the day he dies if he could. While he loves digging more than anything, he is really compassionate to those who are injured and takes pride in tending to the wounded. He was never much of a fighter but when push comes to shove he will do what needs to be done.\n\nMole (female)-\na. incapable of social\nb. she is 29, prosthophobic, and has a green thumb \nc.  Mole is a weird person. She always has been. Born and raised in a cave she quickly left to become a loner in life. In doing so she became incredibly self sufficient. She loves to cook and grow, and is great at both. Her love of animals is a bit of a sad one, as they never love her in return. One day she may gain the skills necessary to befriend some of her animal companions, but for now she is hopeless\n\nI tried to give them as much back ground as I could, the colony is really new still so feel free to offer names for any future recruits too :)\n\nThis run is looking very promising, which is funny because the random map seed I chose was called &quot;death&quot; :^)","replies":[]}
