Don't get me wrong, once he has that and maybe a BC, he is outright dangerous... if he hasn't been utterly crippled due to his horrible early game... \r\n\r\nI find Item build paths to really be his weakness, I am still toying around with what I think works best, but if you get mana, you have no damage, if you get damage, you have no mana. Even after you have tear, it still leaves him mana hungry early game, and he can barely stay in lane and has such pitiful damage until he starts building AD. Mana management is critical on him, but you can't do a thing on him due to such high early game mana costs.\r\n\r\nSo currently the Urgot Decision is either mana, or damage until mid/late game where he has a decent amount of both.\r\n\r\nSo, what if Urgot had lower early game mana costs? Honestly, that is the only way I see him making a comeback in any role...","replies":[]}
