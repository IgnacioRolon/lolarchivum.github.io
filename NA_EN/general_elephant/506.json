The number of first time in ranked ever players I am seeing that completely ruin a game is staggering, Its just about every game. If you haven&#039;t played ranked all season, you should just have to wait until next season. This shit is 100% ridiculous and ruins games for tons of players when someone is 0/7 in placements and some how still gets put in a mid to high silver game near the end of the season.\r\n\r\nRiot, please fix your game.","replies":[]}
