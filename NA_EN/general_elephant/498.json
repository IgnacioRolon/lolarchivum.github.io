The phrase perfectly represents a very succinct philosophy of using potential future outcomes to guide your current life decisions. While it may seem like common knowledge, so many people do not give proper valuations of negative future situations. It is easy to dismiss something as a possibility, but when it could have been easily avoided, it never should have even been a possibility.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just thought i&#039;d share some advice my family has been known to give. Anyone else have something crazy their family has told  them or always tells them?","replies":[]}
