Here is where we will get whats bothering us off our chest regarding things we might not be able to share with others in our lives.\n\nSo I was talking to my wife a few days ago while my mother in law overheard me saying I had today off. She texts me about 2 hours later to see if I can take my uncle in law to a dr appointment because her work is forcing her to come in on her day off. I said well let me check but I don't see why not seeing as he has no otber form of transport and is in a very bad spot health wise. She said \"thanks I'll have him call in the mornig and make an appointment.\" So thats strike 1... giving me the impression you were put in a bad spot to guilt trip me into wasting 4 hours of my life because she didn't want to schedule it later in the week when she could take him. Its a 5 minute drive for her... a 45 one way for me. strike 2 comes when she said it was just to get Rx refills... it was a full blown blood work up. I am still waiting out in the parking lot. right now. Strike 3 is that she didn't tell me he had a pain script he couldn't get filled... i work at a pharmacy, so instead of just bringing it to me... she waits until I drive 45 minutes out here to give it to me telling me he runs out at the end of the day. He was forced to walk to 5 pharmacies in the area to try and fill it. The man has 8 major ulcers on his legs. Wtf you making him walk miles in the goddamn rain for !?! I'm a nice person... but be considerate to others ffs.... don't try and take advantage of my good will because you know I won't be able to tell him no because the problem was pawned off on me after you waited until all of this became a problem.\n\nmother in laws suck sometimes. Oh, and she pawned her bill off on me at a restaurant last week... needless to say my wife and I won't be talking to her for a while\n\nThe real kicker though? My wife and I both work 40-50 hours a week and I have school. We haven't had a day off together in over 2 months. and I am wasting it in my car... in a parking lot... in a major downpour... alone. The wife has issues with being around the uncle cause of some previous family stuff that happened... so she couldn't come with....\n\n/rant\n\nI feel better now.\n\nEdit: if you would like advice lemme know. Otherwise I'll just let yall vent :)","replies":[]}
