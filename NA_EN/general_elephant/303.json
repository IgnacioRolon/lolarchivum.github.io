Not to be gimmicky like star wars, but something simple and interesting.\r\n\r\nQ a line skill shot that acts like vayne&#039;s condemn without the stun\r\nW a point and click &quot;crushing&quot; DoT spell that slows from 0-30% depending on how much they move over 2.5 seconds damage is a constant, does not scale based on enemy movement.\r\nE an aoe field similar to soraka but acts as a disruption zone that constantly pushes enemies towards the outside of it for 4 seconds, doing initial damage upon contact and can retrigger once more 2 seconds after the first.\r\nR a line aoe slightly wider than a lux ult that draws enemies towards it&#039;s center, approximately 1500 range. \r\n\r\nIt sounds OP, but it is pretty basic and doesn&#039;t have any dumb/crazy passives and has counter play. Didn&#039;t bother thinking of a passive, I just want an excuse to put a new sexy champ out, and I think a fighter style outfit would fit really well.\r\n\r\nRito doesn&#039;t pay attention here, but I&#039;d like to think this would be a very cool champ.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d call her Clio.","replies":[]}
