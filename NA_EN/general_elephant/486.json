Anyone else like it? It is a RTS sandbox battle ship/pirate (secretly) game that has a REALLY high learning curve. Basically you suck at life until you get it and become a boss. I feel like more people need to play and enjoy these sandbox RTSs that are super in depth and very complicated, while being deceptively simple. Also the freedom of design is so cool wjen you realize you make way better designs than the prefabs. Because for the longest time you&#039;re terrified of their power until you figure out the secrets to winning.","replies":[]}
