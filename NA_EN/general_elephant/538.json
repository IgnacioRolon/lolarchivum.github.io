We haven't had anything like garen or lux in quite a while. I would really like just a champion or two to be a no BS fair champion. Something pretty basic with a minor twist.\r\n\r\nQ does damage\r\nw does CC\r\ne does mobility\r\nr is unique to the champion and will probably be a highlight.\r\n\r\nWhy is that so hard? Not every champion needs two passives and a one of a kind (hard to balance) kit.\r\n\r\nI get it isn't as flashy, but not everyone wants a ferrari, some people prefer the more subtle and reliable toyota camry....  (camry because it is one of the most high vol cars in NA, not because I like them:/)\r\n\r\nGive me a solid, no BS champion Riot. I beg of you.","replies":[]}
