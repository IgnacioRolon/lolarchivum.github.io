From what I can tell, people feel mistreated, wronged, or even cheated. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I feel that many people are upset due to a sheer lack of understanding about Riot doing the things the way they are. I hope to try and shed some light on what reasons I have read and seen from Rioter posts etc.\n\nThe largest complaint I&#039;ve seen is that older players are being poorly treated by these changes. Why do they feel wronged? It is because they have spent countless time playing this game, and over the years have accumulated large amounts of IP towards unlocking runes. Now that the runes are being made free, Riot is giving a refund to players based on a flat amount per rune/quint (and extra rune pages). Many veteran players feel like this is a slap in the face because the lump sum of what they are getting is far less than their initial amount spent.\n\nNow lets look at some scenarios for alternatives:\n\n1. Riot issues full rune refund, but the new rune system, which has integrated masteries, is now a full BE cost system (and would probably be more costly than the old system because of the fact it also includes masteries). This defeats one of the major reasons for the change. Making the game more accessible for new players. They already have over 130 champions to work towards unlocking, this would only further deter them. This would also take up most of the IP you were refunded, leaving you with less than the lump sum you will be receiving anyway.\n\n2. Riot issues a much larger/full BE refund for runes than they currently have planned and launches the new system according to plan. Veteran players already have a mountain of BE to blow through, and this only makes the issue of excess BP even worse for them. The fact they are making  this exclusive BE shop a reality is to help ease this problem while handling this major transition. By issuing such a large refund, it essentially defeats the purpose of them even opening a BE shop as it wouldn&#039;t solve the problem it is intended to solve, and as a result, it would probably be cancelled all together (or they could just increase the prices to overcompensate for this larger refund). I don&#039;t know about you, but the fact they are doing something like this at all is shocking, and a welcome sight. They by no means are required to go through all this trouble, but they are.. because they want to solve problems we have been complaining about like extra IP/BE.\n\n3. Riot issues no refund and gives us a discounted BE shop and/or issues champion shards to offset the lack of IP/BE from no refund. Since had we not used the IP at the time, we only realistically could have used it on unlocking more champions. Champion shards would provide the &quot;opportunity&quot; to unlock champions we didn&#039;t back then. Since they are reducing the amount of blue essence given for disenchanting champion shards, it seems like that would also be a very lack luster option, and people who have every champion or don&#039;t wan to unlock anymore would get almost no value out of this solution.\n\n4. Riot is completely negligent of our concerns and issues no refund, no shop, and no added benefits, because they are a business and giving stuff away for free kind of defeats the purpose of running the business.\n\n\nBasically at the end of the day my point is... We would have used the IP back then to unlock the only other option we had to use IP on anyway. Champions. That was the sole purpose aside from runes for even giving IP. Over the years Riot has given us a couple different outlets to use IP on, but the base issue is that we have too much stockpiled after we&#039;ve gotten the champions we want. The system they are rolling out is them attempting to address a massive number of issues all at once. There is no perfect solution, but I think they have found the best answer given the situation. If they issue to large of a BE/IP refund, there will be no reason to even have a BE shop and completely defeats their efforts of trying to curb the excess IP/BE issue.","replies":[]}
