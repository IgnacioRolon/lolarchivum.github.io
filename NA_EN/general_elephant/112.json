It is a government given right to pursue happiness if it does not infringe on other peoples' rights... I get that some people believe marriage is something that should be between a man and a woman... but does that give you the right to infringe on other's desire for happiness? I don't think that if the situation was reversed it would be fair to say that all religion is detrimental and no one should be able to practice and believe in it... that to me is equally unjust as prohibiting same sex marriage.\n\nTreat others the way you want to be treated. It isn't a complicsted concept, and I hope many people acquire happiness as a result of today","replies":[]}
