I know purple side tends to have a slightly higher elo.... but I feel like the system is using more information than just mmr to determine match ups....\r\n\r\nStuff like most played champs, latency, leave ratio, and other easily collectable data are right at Riot's fingertips.... why wouldn't they use it? They could predetermine matches with atleast some what accurate results simply by looking at this information...\r\n\r\nMaybe I am crazy... but after so many games that feel like utter blowouts... one way or another... league is kind of snowbally, but ff should not be nearly as commonplace as it... I am displeased with matchmaking. I wish Riot would atleast try something different... not just say \"the only fair way is to use mmr because W/L is the only all encompassing factor of game play\"\r\n\r\nAlso, there should be ping checks before ranked... and automatically reject people with 500+ regular ping spikes. It is frustrating 2v1ing bot lane with a nearly afk support.\r\n\r\nBlah... I am just frustrated with trying my hardest, only to get completely stomped out because my teammates go full on wood 5 tier.","replies":[]}
