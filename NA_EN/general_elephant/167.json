(GD Darkest Dungeon blind run)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I barely know anything about this game, I watched someone on twitch play it for an hour and thats about it. I was gonna use GDers in my run. I am gonna update the OP after a while and rank how each of yall is doing. If you know the game you can try to choose a class you&#039;d like to be, but no promises. I might abbreviate names if they are long but w/e. All I have done so far is the intro dungeon, so its a fresh run. I might also include a lil log on events pertaining to you. I will do all I can as I don&#039;t usually do these, but I thought it&#039;d be fun for the first time I play it. Lemme know whatcha think and if you wanna be a redshirt :^)\n\n\nCurrent week: 13\nDeath Count: 0\n\n(note: genders referred to are that of the actual unit, not to reflect the gender of the GD poster)\n\n(other note: i dropped quirks, there is just too dang  many and they change all the time, tho if one causes a situation you'll hear about it)\n\nThe List: (will update as I play more)\n\nVirginRivenMain: Crusader- lvl 2- So far has been a badass and has been beatin up on fools really hard in the ruins. also his fascination with praying is becoming a bit out of hand o.o\n\nCLG Ear: Highwayman- lvl 2-  so far he has been cappin bitches like a boss. He did have an incident where his stress nearly reached 200 and nearly threw for the whole group but crit at the last shot so we could leave. he had fun at the bar afterwards and seems relatively normal now\n\nMymyamiaou: Vestal- lvl 3- the cornerstone healer of my \"OP\" units she has seen me through some dark times and made it out alive, she  did have an incident with CLG Ear where his inccesant ramblings of murder caused her to become hopeless, but she still prevailed\n\nXion Moonray: Plague Doctor- lvl 1- he has been messin bitches up. stunning, debuffing, blighting fools who dunno whats coming, overall very useful. i really need to use him more.\n\nJamaree: Arbalest- lvl 2- he has been snipin bitches across the map, markin and critting them like an OG making most runs a cake walk. He did have an incident where he nearly died because an enemy archer crit him for 18 damage, but he survived and no-scoped that SOB for a sweet revenge kill.\n\nHero of Ideals: Man at arms- lvl 1 he has been quite handy. Being so reliable he has been the go to guy for making sure puny level zeros don't just get wrecked and has been a facilitator of sorts to help people achieve their potential while protecting the weak.\n\nChibi Templar: Crusader- lvl 1- he has been smitin fools since a young lad. no one knows why he only uses his single target melee, but it seems to get the job done. He did have an incident with CLG Ear where he nearly went insane, but Chibi knows Ear too well and managed to stay just out of the resolve threshold.\n\nPony Montana: Jester- lvl 1- this fool has been all over the place, up, down, left, right and then jumps to the back when he gets all tuckered out. shit posting takes a lot out  of you, but damnit, if it isn't effective. though his low hp squishiness means he is super reliant on Hero of Ideals to make sure he doesn't get cucked while performing his shenannigans.\n\nJikker: Grave Robber- lvl 2- she has been a cornerstone unit in a lot of key fights, with her friends Jamaree marking fools it makes it child's play for her to throw a dagger right through their heart. When CLG Ear nearly went insane, she kept it cool and did some sort of warden thingy that made sure her stress never went over 50.\n\nRockman: Abomination- lvl 1- I got to use him on my team once, though he got kinda stressed he seemed super OP. I  decided to flagellate him to help him calm down but in the process he has become one with flagellation. I haven't seen him in 4 weeks.... I didn't think Rockman was into that kinda stuff, but I guess he is.\n\nMav: Houndmaster- lvl 1- on of  my newer recruits, he is proving to be really good at what he does. his first adventure was in the weald and damn if he didn't mess them bitches up. I am hopeful to see what he does down the road.\n\nBesteau: Hellion- lvl 1-  So far she has been swaggin on fools. She got really stressed in the ruins, but a trip to the brothel and she is all better. Most notably she crit using the iron swan for mad damage, and it looked bad ass.\n\nAudhulma: Occultist- lvl 2- So far his healing has been.... shotty, but it gets the job done. where he really shines is just wailing on the back line so they stop throwing stress goop at us. that is always good. also he REALLY hates the Eldritch, so much so he has like 30% bonus  damage against them between skills and quirks.\n\nBusty Demoness: Leper- lvl 0- adventure to be started. he looks like he gon mess some bitches up with that sword tho.\n\n\nAVAILABLE UNITS:\n\nBounty Hunter\nAntiquarian\nOccultist \n","replies":[]}
