If I don't go top against him, he is instantly 5/0 before 20 minutes. I even had a darius feed 4 kills in 15 minutes.... but the real kicker is darius had 30 cs at 20 minutes, while tryn had almost 140....  every game with tryndamere in it goes like that. Heck I might just start playing him so I can do that to people.... he is pretty ridiculous in low elo...","replies":[]}
