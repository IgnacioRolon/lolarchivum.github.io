(wtf is he thinking ffs!?!?!)\r\n\r\nbut hear me out. he is an all in brawler designed to snowball off of early engages. who is weak early game? mages and assassins. with skaarl you get a bit of a life line, and if you take exhaust, you have even more kill pressure. (i say exhaust because it prevents damage from knocking you off skaarl too fast in your primary engage) and he does well with maw.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve never played kled in my life, but I did okay. the fact at 6 he can ultra roam with his ult top or bot makes him a force to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nif you wanna have some trolly AF fun in a norm, I recommend going Kled mid. its the most fun i&#039;ve had in a game in a long time.\r\n\r\nalso max w on Kled, don&#039;t be dumb, his AA steroid on his w is his primary damage source. q+e just keep you in range to proc that juicy 4th hit\r\n\r\n... :^)","replies":[{"poster":"samibe","date":"2018-02-18T21:30:13.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just recently bought kled and i took him mid lane and i wemt 18/3/7","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angel Face","date":"2016-11-08T20:19:29.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kled mid is just like any other cheese early game ad such as Pant or jarvan.

I mean you could be boring and take cho... but still.\n\nAlso in regards to kled's w, the main benefit from it isn't just the 4th aa proc, it is the speed at which you can proc it in addition to fervor stacking. While Q is good for harass, total damage output it seems a bit lack luster, but again, I am just now learning him and have yet to really learn anything aside from what I've found out about him in videos and such, so I could be completely wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-11-08T05:33:54.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not? i personally regularly play ahri top","replies":[]},{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-11-08T05:33:40.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno I see his melee range being a huge downside.  He can't really get close to a lot of mages or he'll be stunned and outtraded before he gets in melee range, even with the snare.  \n\nLike I don't see how it would work vs annie/syndra/lissandra/leblanc/viktor/etc.\n\nI can see him as a counter to a snowball mage like Cassio Ryze and Veigar though.
