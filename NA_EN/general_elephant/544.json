Overall most of you guys are doing well, though there have been some... incidents.\r\n\r\nCurrent Week: 30\r\nDeath Count: 1\r\n\r\nIn Memoriam: Hero of Ideals: Man-at-Arms - lvl 3-\r\n\r\nIt was a dark and dreary day. morale was at an all low as coffers were empty and resources dwindling. A man steps forward and demands to lead a mission that would revitalize the groups morale and efforts. Hero of Ideals. He gathered a few of his close companions, Mymyamiou and 2nd Chance as well as the resident antiquarian. He lead a veteran mission into the Warrens. At first things began great, though the task appeared daunting, the team set forth on a mission to rally the troops and gain morale and confidence. They began their journey in one of the largest dungeons to date, sprawling forth in a seemingly endless task of conquering all the rooms filled with enemies. They began hacking and slashing their way through the enemies, but in doing so became exceedingly stressed. Along the way all members of the party had their resolve tested... the most afflicted was Hero of Ideals. Not being able to handle the stress, he developed incredibly masochistic tendencies, often dislocating his shoulder for no reason. None the less the party trudged onward in an effort to complete their mission. Finally, an end was in sight, after acquiring a record haul, the group approached the final room. In it was a strange and terrifying enemy the likes of which have never been encountered on previous expeditions. \r\n\r\nThe battle began with Hero of Ideals bolstering the party&#039;s dodge and speed in an effort to allow quick actions to lead them to victory. right behind him was 2nd Chance, who had marked their newly found opponent to be targeted and eliminated. Through out the fight Hero of Ideals had reached a peak stress level and had his resolve tested once more. He became incredibly fearful. In doing so he had drawn the enemy&#039;s attention to him which only forced the issue of his stress even more. Even with Mymyamiou&#039;s legendary healing, Hero of Ideal&#039;s health was dwindling. In the last moments of his life he had decided to dislocate his shoulder again and then deny any more healing from our Vastal. This was the nail in the coffin, after the final blow was struck to the large enemy, two smaller ones remained, but those were just enough to give Hero  of Ideals a heart attack. In shock and awe 2nd Chance and Mymyamiou dropped to the ground screaming in hopeless agony, their best friend and companion since the beginning had fallen. After a moment 2nd Chance stood up, standing their solemnly.... He turned towards his remaining allies with a fire of reckless abandon in his eyes. Impassioned by the loss of their beloved tank, the remaining three struck forth with a fury so fierce the whole world seemed to quake in their presence. The final enemies had fallen.\r\n\r\nThe mission was completed, but at what cost... They turned to their lost comrade to see his prized possession... the Guardian&#039;s Shield. They carried both Hero of Ideals and his equipment back to The Darkest Estate where they gave him a proper burial and gave the most beautiful eulogy. In remembrance of Hero of Ideals&#039; favorite stress relief activity, they hung his shield in the tavern to remind everyone of the joy he brought to those around him. He had led an expedition the likes of which no one had ever undergone before. He had brought in the most gold and resources of any mission to date and ensured the group&#039;s livelihood for the weeks to come. A man who gave every thing he had for those he loved, had finally paid the ultimate sacrifice.\r\n\r\nRest In Peace, Hero of Ideals\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nas an aside\r\n\r\n&gt; [{quoted}](name=Hero of Ideals,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=16wyl2z3,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-07-05T17:37:52.457+0000)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; mkay\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  I better not be a first death this time\r\n\r\nSorry mate....
