If not, his E has a decaying slow, so Rylais would replace the decaying slow. Well I'd have to test that since I'm not 100% sure.\n\nGo for dat Attack Speed {{item:3115}} {{item:3115}}{{item:3115}}{{item:3115}}{{item:3115}}{{item:3115}}","replies":[{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2016-11-14T02:41:06.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=McDigits,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wgwiGWXW,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-11-14T02:36:39.060+0000)\n>\n> If you&#x27;re going for more stunning and stuff, get some CDR to STAY on them even more, also, I was thinking that Rylai&#x27;s would stack with his E.

Wouldn&#x27;t Abysall or RoA be better?\n\nis there anything more terrifying than a rapidly swinging anchor?\n\nto give a real answer, it stacks AP per on hit along with a really nice flat amount of AP, it gives you an incentive to AA as many targets as possible to proc your passive (which you should do anyway, but this makes it so you can do so faster, increasing the rate of stuns you can lay down during a fight, the earlier you get it on cd the earlier you can reproc it). since you're in the front lines usually whaling away on people, it only makes sense to have the ability to do more damage as the fight goes on. RoA takes time to build up, not only that, but the hp/mana is negligible late game because if you're getting focused it isn't gonna help as much as just stacking on another tank item. honestly IBG gives you enough mana, and if you wanted to be tankier, you should just build tank. abyssal gives increased magic damage, but since you have relatively little AP, you would be getting it more to help the AP carries on your team, which could be good, but it doesn't doesn't help your own damage output all that much.\n\nalso as a side note, using Q puts you in the perfect distance to a target to shotgun them with protobelt.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-14T02:09:31.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty bad build.  \n\nIf you want to play him as a bruiser, I would probably recommend something along the lines of:\n{{item:1001}}  {{item:3068}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3151}}","replies":[]}]}
