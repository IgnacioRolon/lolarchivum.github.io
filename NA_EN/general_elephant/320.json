I hope to help people realize a more effective, and healthier way of playing LoL.\n\nEveryone knows that the easiest way to win a game is to be the biggest influence and \"carry\" your team to victory, many successful players have this as a mentality, and presents valid reasons as to why it is so effective.\n\nThis being said, I feel like this is not the whole picture for success. I feel like that during the course of a game, every player invests a certain amount of influence, and the team with an overall higher influence is the team that generally wins. This includes everything from taking a cs, to drag, to forcing a back, to any number of things that give your team an edge. Not only is this idea of influence about gaining an advantage, but it is also about denying potential advantages from the enemy. This is commonly seen in CS denial, but with the addition of Devourer, denying stacks can make objectives like dragon, or denying kills, even more vital.\n\nThis is all well and good... but what does it mean?\n\nLets say every player is assigned a theoretical post game influence score between 0-100 based on in game influence. The team with the higher total score ALWAYS has the win. In the original idea of \"carry harder\" it simply focuses on maximizing the individual&#039;s score to give the highest chances for success because it is assumed the other teammates are variables that are out of the control of the individual trying to maximize their personal score, and thus raise their team&#039;s score. While this is one way to approach the issue of getting the highest score, I don&#039;t think it is necessarily the only option, and I also think it may lead to short sighted decision making and an overall lower team score than what would have been possible.\n\n>Now comes my way of approaching the system. LCD. Lowest. Common. Denominator. A very simple math term I will use to represent my entirety of the most efficient way to maximize your \"post game influence scores\".\n\nThis idea is very similar to the plight of the jungler looking to snowball his teammates, but whereas a jungler is almost predisposed to this idea, the entire team is not. I feel in a team game such as this, individual skill is additive, while team effort is multiplicative. This means that while you may be able to go 20/4/1, it might not always benefit your team the most. This has led me to a bit of a strange way of playing league... but i&#039;ll get to that in the conclusion.\n\n>Now to answer the question \"why is it called LCD?\". The answer is pretty obvious, it is meant to compare you to your own teammates and to say essentially you are only as strong as your weakest link. While this is not entirely true, it is the right way to view a team game. \n\nObviously you can&#039;t control when your yasuo dives in 1v5 and gets obliterated. It happens, and he will learn that is bad after enough failures, but he isn&#039;t there yet, and that is okay... not everyone is necessarily on the  same skill level in the same role as the opponents or even for your team, nor may they be as familiar with their designated role as you are with yours. Patience leads to success more often than not.\n\nYour ultimate goal in a team game is to win, but to do so you are forced to play with other people, who more often than not, have the same goal. This being said you need to respect your fellow players no matter how they are performing and you need to identify the easiest ways to make gains in your end game \"influence score\". Sometimes it is easier and more effective to give a teammate a leg up than it is to secure another triple kill without giving up that oh so dangerous shut down gold.\n\n>My conclusion is a simple one. Take care of your team, and they will more often than not, take care of you.\n\nSo I feel like this may need some examples to drive home the point I am trying to make. Lets take my 2 substantially more successful champions in ranked as a synonymous example. I am 16/7 with lux in ranked, and 17/8 with graves. Every other champion I&#039;ve played has not come close to that, and it boils down to being a team player. I have learned that using graves and lux is a great way to influence the effectiveness of your own team in substantial ways, also both champions allow me to be able to give extremely clear hints as to when a good time to act is, and sometimes, you can improve their decision making as a result. \n\nLets just assume a graves and lux ult can serve the same purpose, as an ult is the most crucial part of a kit, I feel it is important to use as my example. Most people view these champion&#039;s ultimates as ways to either secure kills, objectives, or in lux&#039;s case even to wave clear, when in actuality it is best used as a signal to initiate. That is right, I blow my ults as soon as I see a good opening, I very rarely use them to kill ANYONE and it works gloriously. If I can land a 4 man lux ult, we will win that team fight as an almost guarantee as a result of a few things. It lets my entire team know \"hey, we have a clear health advantage now!\" and in some cases \"hey I am strong enough and have a close enough range to demolish a high priority target!\". Both instances lead to a clear and concise time to engage as a team. This is before any initiators blow their CC, or ults, and everyone is at their maximum potential and then they can INFLUENCE the fight to their maximum potential... see what I am getting at? The really ironic part is that everyone tends to save the bulk of their damage to try and secure a kill, and that just leaves dead damage loss when you do more damage than it takes to kill them, and especially with graves and lux, where their ult&#039;s power is a result of maximum damage potential.\n\nTL;DR of conclusion only- use your influence in game to influence your teammates through blowing heavy damage etc to prompt them to follow up and to ensure you maximize the benefit of the skills used. You still get assist gold, and often it is very comparable to the gold you would have received for the kill, while also giving your teammate the full gold quantity for the kill. One lux ult can net 400g sometimes in assists alone.\n\nThis whole idea is more of an entire gaming philosophy than some ez pz win for free idea, so to spare your eyeballs, I will cut it short. I know the editing is pretty rough, I tried to just break it up enough to be readable... format suggestions always help.\n\n\n\nTL;DR- help your teammates succeed, and try to use high damage abilities like lux/graves R to trigger your teammates into doing what you want them to so your team will make smart decisions.\n\nThere was more to it than that, but that is tldr as possible.","replies":[]}
