I wonder if this will be another &quot;beat this plat lucian to get out of bronze in your promos&quot; situations I had last season.\r\n\r\nI get flex mmr is separate from dynamic mmr... but seriously.... where do they expect all the mid bronze players to go? their mmr will be so tanked they&#039;ll never climb out of bronze even if they get substantially better because they will only ever win like 10 lp and lose like 30 lol....\r\n\r\nwhy is flex queue such a joke?","replies":[]}
