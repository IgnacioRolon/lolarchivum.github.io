He is and has been near and dear to my heart. he was my first 6300 champion, and I have always enjoyed him, though he is slower than all get out.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I am happy Cinderhulk now exists. people tend to be more accepting of the titan of the deep now that he is pretty solid in the jungle.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering though.... is he still out classed? is he still Naut as good as other picks? (:D)\r\n\r\nI also know it is extremely important to play him correctly, though I only have 3 main points of interest.. I think I'll share them because I feel they are really critical to his success.\r\n\r\n1. NEVER initiate with Q when ganking. You ALWAYS use it to cancel a flash that you will inevitably force. Post 6 initiate with your ult, it causes a sense of fear and can sometimes get enemies to flash, then you Q and E and they are complete goners.\r\n\r\n2. MS quints. Sounds terrible, but makes his base MS 340 without boots. it is critical for early game ganks and faster clear times.\r\n\r\n3. Max E first. I used to max w thinking \"oh hey, I got a shield, better max it!\" then realized how stupid I was for ignoring a crucial part of his kit... the scaling MS reduction and damage off his E.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nI would like to hear peoples' opinions on Nautilus and his viability, or any additional tips/tricks to be more successful as one of my favorite champs.","replies":[]}
