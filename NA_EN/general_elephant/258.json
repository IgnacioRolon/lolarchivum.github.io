YES better rub it in their face cause I am super right!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy point is most of GD is like a little kid playing whack a mole.... find a flaw, find a mole, and smack it! no flaws? no mole, don't try to smack.\r\n\r\nThe point of a discussion is to actively try to root out the difference in opinion and either isolate the difference in believe and come to terms that these people believe core differences that will not change, or find the fallacy in the other party's logic in order to prove one side correct.\r\n\r\naka... people generally respond to posts because they see something wrong and want to point it out. They seldom decide to create a rebuttal to the OPs argument in a logical way.\r\n\r\nwhen GDers come across a logical, complete thought, they ignore it because they can't simply point out a flaw to make their opinion seem right, which in and of it self, is a fallacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR- GD has bad logic skills, and as a result, nothing is actually discussed. GD is therefore GT, or general talking.","replies":[]}
