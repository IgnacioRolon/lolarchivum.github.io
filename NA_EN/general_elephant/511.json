I was mainly a gen 1-3 player when they came out. I am toying with the idea of online battles etc, and I am trying to theory craft what a solid, well rounded team looks like... i haven&#039;t beat the game yet, but I am training up a magnezone, arcanine, muk, braviary (debatable) and thinking of getting an alolan ninetails, the rest is kinda up in the air. Right now i have a magnemite, rufflet(fk lvl 54 tho....) grimer, growlithe, passimian and finneon.\n\nWho should I pick up swap out etc so I don&#039;t waste my time? Also i love the idea of a turtonator, though he also looks kinda garbo (i have sun)\n\nI am noob, send help","replies":[]}
