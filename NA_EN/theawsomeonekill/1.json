Im legitimately calling out an inting and feeding chogath and had to fake a bullshit apology so he wouldn&#039;t continue inting and actually play the game properly. But no, riot keeps being pansy asses about a few truthful words than actually trying to fix whats wrong with league: inters and trolls.\r\n\r\nNo one cares about toxic players, there&#039;s a mute button for a reason. This isn&#039;t even toxic, this is me actually saving a game. If I didn&#039;t calm this cho down, we woulda lost. So explain how these &quot;oh so toxic words&quot;, which actually had the exact opposite effect, are more important than inters, feeders and trolls. \r\nI even begged for the chogath to stop inting, and get banned for it? This is just dumb at this point. Dumb auto banning system where employees dont even look into anything or read legit full chat logs. Otherwise it&#039;d take longer than 2 minutes to pass such a serious punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord of Math","date":"2017-10-20T04:14:18.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shame on you for trying to win this game.
