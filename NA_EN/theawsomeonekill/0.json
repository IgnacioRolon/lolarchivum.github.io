Why would you provide us with a more variegated rune system that&#039;s not general, but put an even GREATER limit on those same rune pages. \r\n\r\nAnd dont even get me started on the snowball encouragement (cough cough scaling everything stacks stacks stacks cough cough)","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-11-09T02:12:49.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"runes were removed\n this is a new mastery system they are just calling runes.. because people cant put two and two together","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-10T03:37:51.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"New system is both.

The game is just snowbally atm because people are fighting too much because they don't know the limits of their champions and therefore the kills/min is much higher than the end of a season where we all spent a year fine tuning. I think it's actually in a pretty good state atm, I just hope the new rune system doesn't get too distilled into \"standard\" pages for roles/champs.\n\nThe problem is if too many people cry and don't embrace change, Riot will do what they've done before on the balance side, and basically engineer things so that you don't need any creativity or foresight in order to pick the appropriate options. So please just play and have fun. Try to relax and realize that it might take some time for the game and meta to balance out. It's not going to be perfect overnight, but at least this isn't the same stale old thing the last 2 years have been.

I had 15 runes pages in the old system and now I have 7 presets and can create 15 new runes what i will not do (I can always treat them like masteries and do that during champion select). On another account I had two runes pages in the old system, i can create two new runes in the new system. This is really Hilarious how Riot is treating ppl who have spend years building skills and getting rewarded. Now all mean nothing. My two runes is equivalent to my 15 runes cause I do not see any point to prebuild them, I just have to do that during champion selects... The rewards that i had for having runes and runes pages were so meaningless cause I had all the champions and skins are still depend on money and Orange essence. The games is become more frustrating, and i think they should really rethink to system. New players seems to set for failure, they can build up their champions faster and consequently spending less time to master them. Old player got nothing... I feel so bad for us. The design look so good to blind player from the reality. Even if the system is set to give more BE than it used to give IP, but this is after you level up. Basically I think we have to play average 10 games before you really get rewarding. Imagine if you 10 BE short to get a new champions, you have to play games after games before you can do that, if you only play 2 games a day, it will take you days to see and try thin new champs.","replies":[]}]}
