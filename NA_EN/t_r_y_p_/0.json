He&#039;s not afraid of anything... &quot;can&#039;t get in trouble for off meta picks&quot; ... that&#039;s bullshit. \r\nI think we have 3 options here.. \r\n1. Longer queues but better quality games..\r\n2. Ban these &quot;entitled&quot; dipshits\r\n3. Ruin lives and do nothing\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t normally bitch but this is like 2-5 times everyday.","replies":[{"poster":"Kovorix","date":"2017-09-29T09:17:16.055+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So lets go back to the old ranked system. First pick can enjoy to pick every role he wants and last pick is most likely 100% support.","replies":[{"poster":"Hahahahyena","date":"2017-09-29T10:51:48.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my deepest, honest opinion, that system was the most respected.

I'd rather wait longer to get the role I want and I know I am good at while at the same time being matched with teammates who have the same deal than having someone get dumped into a role they not only aren't good at, but outright hate.  \n\nI can see autofill being used at least in normals, but it's hard enough to climb in ranked as it is.  At least ensure I can always get the roles I'm best at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nihility","date":"2017-09-28T23:05:48.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds about right....\n\nIf I had the potential to get a great top laner, but have to wait 20-30 minutes, I would sit my ass down and wait.
