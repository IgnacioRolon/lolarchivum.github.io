I am on this account because I had to sign out to submit my ticket, and I still do not have my account (BlazzedElmo) back so I had to log onto this account (my alternate). I got a message from Weeezing saying that for security reasons I had to log out and submit another ticket which I just did. Does this mean that I have to wait again for another Riot employee to review my ticket. It has almost been a week since I submitted my first ticket, and now I have to wait again for my new ticket?? I am extremely confused what is going on, and would just like to be able to get back on my account. Can someone please, please tell me what is going on, and if I submitted the new ticket correctly. I had more than one support tab open, and I signed out of only one tab, the tab I used to submit the new ticket. I was signed in on the account MYNINJAMYNINJA so I could check that status of my original ticket, as I cannot sign onto BlazzedElmo. \n\nThe new ticket (ticket number 2) is #23804403. I believe I was still signed in because I was addressed as MYNINJAMYNINJA. I do not want to have to wait again to find out I submitted it wrong, so I am going to fill out another ticket, but I am going to make sure I am completely logged out of everything so I do not have to wait another week to be told I did not fill it out correct and, have to redo this cycle. The image below is the email from ticket #2. \n\n**[LINK REMOVED]**\n\nI just submitted the third ticket, #23805557. The confirmation email was still addressed to MYNINJAMYNINJA, and I realized that the reason this is, is because MYNINJAMYNINJA is the only verified account now for my email. Can someone from Riot, please help me out here. I probably made the wait even worse by submitting the third ticket, but I just wanted to be 100% positive I created the ticket correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T03:05:11.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely recommend submitting more than one ticket in the future unless otherwise instructed by our specialists, since it can make the recovery process rather confusing.
