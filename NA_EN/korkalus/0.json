The only period of time you can tank something in Leage is in early game, when your base stats and skills provides you enough toughness to stand some hits without being killed.\r\n\r\nIn previous seasons of this game, tanks were really awesome, they could initiate a fight without needing to inmediatly retreat from their enemies, but nowadays even if your build, masteries and runes are done to make your defense \"awesome\" you probably will die with few hits from enemy carry.\r\n\r\nSo what are tanks forced to do? Well, in the current meta you are forced to build yourself as if you were a bruiser. But you are not a bruiser, so your only goal in the game is initiate and pray.\r\n\r\nIn this game, is much more cheaper to buy damage than pure tanky stats, and when you buy, there are so easy ways to kill a tank as can be the classical IF+LW combo. That's without talking about % damage to health.\r\n\r\nMaybe this can be seen as a \"cry\", but I feel tanking should be about beign durable and hard to kill (I mean HARD to kill) with high utility, but without damage output. And to be honest, there are really few champions that can be classified as tanks in this game, namely: Alistar, Leona, and Rammus.\r\n\r\nAnd not, I'm not listing Mundo because he is no more the ubertank he was used to be, and even the previous list in late game is kinda weak at standing damage because armor/MR penetration and % damage, Alistar is the only one who can tank in late and it's due to a overpowered ultimate skill to nowadays standars.\r\n\r\nI've read somewhere in another discussion that if tanks were as they theoretically should be, durable as hell, they would auto counter ADCs, assasins and mages, but I do not agree. Tanks, as I mentioned before, are durable and crowd controllers, with very little damage most of time.\r\n\r\nIn the actual state of game, if you want to pick a tank, as Sejuani, Nautilus, Thresh, Braum etc... is the same as to say \"let's play a durable fighter\", and that's not what a tank is, in my humble opinion.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post, but this is what I really think about this not so loved class. Tanks have lost their way in LoL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Tanks nowadays are just durable fighters that lacks of durability after early game, unless you are ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-15T06:06:15.651+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"You listed Alistar, Leona and Rammus. I'd also add a few: Sejuani, Amumu, Nautilus\n\nTanks win games. You can have a team of all squishies and assassins, but having a tank allows safer initiates and means you have a better chance of winning teamfights -- AOE CC is incredibly strong even without damage. If you're dying to a few hits from the enemy carry, you haven't been building right. You have to adapt your build to the enemy team -- cookie cutter builds don't work for tanks. Is the enemy team all AD? Thornmail, FH, and Randuins. Almost all AP? Banshee's, Aegis/Locket, Abyssal, SV. Mix and match if they have some of both.\n\nI don't know what you're building or who you're facing that makes you feel like you get killed instantly, but I rarely feel that way. Sure, if you try to 1v1 carries, you will die. That's intentional. But if an enemy carry focuses you, you're doing your job and your carries should be focusing them. If you tank well, you will often either escape with low health or be your team's only death, traded for 3 or 4 dead enemies.\n\nI'd take a good Sejuani or Nautilus on my team over a good bruiser any day.","replies":[{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2015-03-15T06:49:27.751+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"(I'm Bronze, so take it with a grain of salt, but) if I'm in a situation where I'm always dying right at the end of a teamfight, I build Warmog's (*maybe* Spirit Visage) as my sixth item.

The only reason I'd say {{item:3092}} is superior to the other two  support lines on him is that it is the best suited to roaming for a ranged support. With talisman, if you aren't in lane your gold income slows down a ton. He can't use relic shield effectively because he is ranged, so while it is great for roaming it is pathetic on him. The Frost Queen line is excellent because it gives mana sustain, poke damage, and can store its charges for ages before you lose your gp10. That and roaming into a lane with an extra CC initiate and three instances of bonus damage fits his style well. Other than that, yeah, AP doesn't suit him really.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-15T20:37:11.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually don't grab a support item on him.

The 5 damage on-hit is really the only useful feature Spellthief's offers, and a tiny bit of MP5. Unfortunately, it also costs more (1 less pot to start), and you move more slowly, making it harder to roam as effectively or quickly.\n\nObviously everyone has their own preference, and I can certainly see the logic in taking a support item on him, but I prefer the boots to start.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KagenoOu","date":"2015-03-15T18:59:34.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no the problem with bard isnt itemization, its viability in meta, he doesnt  fit a meta where supports protect adcs lol, not with his kit right now","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-15T19:04:01.863+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can protect ADCs and still collect chimes.

When you and ADC back, you can roam a bit and collect, either before or after backing. When you have killed enemies or pushed them out of lane, you can collect chimes on their side of the lane. Your W should help your ADC survive whether you're with them or not, so long as they wait before collecting it (it more than doubles the heal at level 1)\n\nPeople are playing him like a constantly-roaming Alistar, but building him like he's Sona.

Previously it calculated first flat penetration then %-based penetration, this meant if you had some flat penetration % was weaker, and thus you only got % like {{item:3035}} and {{item:3135}} if the target had an excessive amount of defenses.\n\nThe changes present reversed those effects causing % to be calculated 1st resulting in penetration being much more potent that it was previously. Either by reversing the penetration stats back they way they used to be or by rebalancing tank item costs should fix the issue where tanks are not tanks, just durable fighters.\n\nI think the reason it was changed was twofold: 1st, more noob-friendly if penetration is simple like that. 2nd, there used to be a tank meta where games could one with only tanks and Riot does not want a tank meta. Tanks unfortunately are still needed cause they are initiators often and can dive in and not die instantly.\n\n I think riot should try something that cause become a thing in World Warcraft for tanks; it is called \"active mitigation\". Active Mitigation is about having defenses be reliant on a player's input rather than passive things like Armor and Magic Resist. To introduce something like this in LoL may require a faie few reworks of tank champions so they have methods of active mitigation in their kits; Also tank items could be retuned with active effects. I think I'll make a post about this idea later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"femmé","date":"2015-03-16T01:14:24.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only problem a tank faces right now is that they do what they're supposed to do until a fed/decent adc gets last whisper, then they become \"block one cait q and aa before you die\" \ntanks in order to be tanks and not just bruisers with warmogs need innate tankiness in their kits like shields {{champion:14}} {{champion:111}} \nor some form of health regen {{champion:27}} {{champion:36}}  \nor a defensive steroid {{champion:12}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:44}} \nP.S. i know i missed a lot of champions but these are examples of champions with tankiness in their kits.\nI think tanks do fine but a big problem is that botrk and last whisper can nuke them down which is a major problem since the whole point of a tank is that while you can die, you can't get 3 shotted like squishies can.","replies":[]}]}
