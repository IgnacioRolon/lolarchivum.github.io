He restarted the client, and the error message reappeared. The client had to keep restarting so we reset the computer. When it came back on we tried to open league again, but now it wouldn't even open. I looked up how to fix this and deleted some files in Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS. It still didn't work so we completely deleted League of Legends and reinstalled. Once we get through the installer and the client opens the message \"Unspecified error occurred, check logs for more info.\"  I was getting frustrated and followed all the steps on this https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/qGY56UB4-comprehensive-troubleshooting-your-patching-issues to no prevail, although I did find that the file C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln isn't there, the whole solutions folder is empty.\n The laptop we're using is windows 10 but it's a rather old computer, could this be the problem? Also it has been updated to all other patches, and it will occasionally show an error message when trying to update, but if we restarted the client it would work right after. I feel as if I've done everything already but if anyone has any ideas as to how to fix this please tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T02:41:16.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those unspecified errors popping up as soon as the client opens might be a clue that your PC is actually blocking the program from being able to do anything it needs to at the beginning of those updates.
