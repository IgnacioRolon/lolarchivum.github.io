Let me know if that helps!\n\nHi Porocles,\n\nThanks for the swift response. I'm not convinced it's security related, as the issue is persistent, but intermittent. It will pop up around 1/20 times, if security I would have expected 0% entry rate?\nThat aside tried steps 1->4 with no success, is there anything else that could be recommended before reinstallation?\nNote that the same error occurs with accessing PBE server through that client also.\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nEDIT: 7 attempts to log on waiting ~30s per time and 8th time works almost instantly after clicking launch. I really do not know what causes this problem, it is definitely an error my end? If I must reinstall I have no guarantee of fixing and ~3hours of reinstallation (the client is not install-friendly..)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T20:09:09.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, even if it's intermittent there may be some setting or software (like anti-virus) that may be getting in the way.
