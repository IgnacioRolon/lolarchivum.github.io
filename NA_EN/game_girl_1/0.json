So I tried putting together a list of their _overall_ alignments (D&amp;D style :P) however some of them are actually somewhat ambiguous so we&#039;ll be doing our best! :P Anyway lets get started.\n\n-----\n\nQuick summary of the alignment system:\nLawful Good: **The Knight**   _Follows strict moral code, always fights evil._\nNeutral Good : **The Hero** _Always does the right thing, even if it goes against the law/certain morals._\nChaotic Good : **The Rebel**  _Fights the system to do whats right._\nLawful Neutral : **The Judge**  _Believes strongly in justice, carries out certain ideals no matter what._\nTrue Neutral : **The Outsider**  _Doesn&#039;t go out of his way to harm others, but doesn&#039;t protect them either. Morally ambiguous._\nChaotic Neutral : **The Nomad**  _Cares only about him/her self, ignores moral codes/the law._\nLawful Evil : **The Overlord**  _Cares about power above all else, uses the law to enforce his power._\nNeutral Evil : **The Villain**  _Pursues evil at all costs, not for enjoyment._\nChaotic Evil : **The Psychopath**  _Exists purely to destroy, revels in acts of evil._\n\nAnyway these are pretty basic guidlines, but they are not set in stone and many characters may border different alignments.\n\n----\n\n{{champion:32}} : True Neutral (??)\n{{champion:136}} : True Neutral\n{{champion:268}} : Lawful Good\n{{champion:432}} : Lawful Neutral\n{{champion:63}} : Chaotic Evil\n{{champion:201}} : Neutral Good\n{{champion:69}} : Lawful Evil\n{{champion:131}} : Chaotic Good\n{{champion:245}} : Chaotic Good\n{{champion:114}} : Lawful Neutral\n{{champion:41}} : Lawful Evil\n{{champion:150}} : True Neutral\n{{champion:104}} : Chaotic Neutral\n{{champion:120}} : Chaotic Evil\n{{champion:420}} : Lawful Goodl\n{{champion:202}} : Chaotic Evil **\n{{champion:222}} : Chaotic Evil\n{{champion:429}} : Lawful Good -&gt; Lawful Neutral\n{{champion:30}} : Lawful Neutral\n{{champion:203}} : True Neutral\n{{champion:89}} : Lawful Neutral\n{{champion:236}} : Neutral Good\n{{champion:21}} : Chaotic Good\n{{champion:82}} : Neutral Evil\n{{champion:75}} : Lawful Good\n{{champion:2}} : Chaotic Neutral\n{{champion:80}} : Lawful Neutral\n{{champion:78}} : Lawful Good\n{{champion:421}} : True Neutral\n{{champion:58}} : Chaotic Good / Chaotic Evil\n{{champion:98}} : Lawful Neutral\n{{champion:14}} : Chaotic Evil\n{{champion:15}} : Chaotic Neutral\n{{champion:72}} : Neutral Good\n{{champion:223}}  : Chaotic Evil\n{{champion:44}} : Lawful Good\n{{champion:412}} : Chaotic Evil\n{{champion:4}} : Chaotic Neutral\n{{champion:161}} : Lawful Evil\n{{champion:101}} : Chaotic Good / Chaotic Neutral / Neutral Evil\n{{champion:157}} : Neutral Good\n{{champion:238}} : Neutral Evil\n\nLawful Good: 5\nNeutral Good : 4\nChaotic Good : 3\nLawful Neutral : 7\nTrue Neutral : 5\nChaotic Neutral : 4\nLawful Evil : 3\nNeutral Evil : 3\nChaotic Evil : 8\n\n----\n\nLooking at this I think its really telling that most champions are Lawful Neutral, it shows the direction riot is taking with the new lore. A lot of the champions fight for ideals/something bigger than themselves. Honestly this usually makes for really great stories . I think its also interesting that there are so few true neutral characters. True Neutral characters seem to not interact with the story line as often which makes sense since riot is trying to make Runnaterra more immersive and what not.\n\nANYWAY, I&#039;ll change any of the allignments if you guys think I got them wrong.

This can be a subtle shift (like Illaoi, Shen, or Azir) or the begining of a huge swing ( Ekko, Sivir, Zed)\n\nImho When writing or playing an old school rpg a character should always be transitioning between alignments.  (Or even better, facing a split in the road towards two).   So for instance i would argue orginal Sivir was neutral evil bordering on chaotic evil.  She's selfish, (ie evil)  with no respect for the law (chaotic), though some respect for tradition (neutral).     \n\nBUT look at her color text... She changing and begining to doubt how she's lived her life...   That means her alignment is shifting radically.  \n\nThus i would argue alignment should have at least two parts.

Admittedly I tried to create an alignment list before but I quit because it require multiple refinement for each champions and I am quite bias so I wasn't up for the task. \n\nSince you did say champ have evolving alignment I wanted to share who I believe to have gone through them.\n\nFirst is Miss Fortune, I believe she started at someone along the line of neutral evil. Neutral evil because she was aiming to take down the order in Bilgewaters but she was abiding by it rules because she didn't want too much attention. She is consider evil because she was selfish and driven by revenge she didn't care about the consequence of her action. \n\nAfter defeating Gangplank she became more of a Neutral Good, she wanted reestablish order which make her lawful but being that it is Bilgewater  she also have to be sly something more on the chaotic side and she is good because she is trying to save Bilgewater from itself.\n\nAnother evolving champion is Leona however I think she went in a circle. At first she is neutral good, she has respect to the law on in this case it is tradition but she didn't let tradition stop her from doing what she believe to be good. When she was taken in by the Solari she became Lawful Good. The will of the Solari is above all else. \n\nWhen she was in this alignment she was \"brainwash\" by the Solari, under this alignment she tried to kill Diana. After becoming an Aspect she return to a Neutral Good where she still have a strong belief in the Solari but isn't bound by it because she is enlighten and know what is coming. What I love about her evolution is that at her core she is good.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-05-16T02:27:53.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think miss fortune is in an interesting place--  for bilgewater she's pretty lawful... and she does live by a code.

She does this based on her faith and institution of priests. I'm sure she can justify to herself that this is necessary, but she takes their fate in her hands and culls those that her God finds unworthy. This is lawful neutral at best, where she takes action based on her faiths doctrine and accepts that her intervention is often an execution.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-05-16T07:10:08.850+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.

I pitched that in some ways her inner emotional core was that of a wartime triage doctor. \n-- Four men come into a field hospital with gunshots wounds. The first one of them took a shot to the head.  Illaoi might be able to save him-- but in the time it takes to do that the other three will bleed to death.  Now she can save those three lives-- if she decides that the first man is going to die.  Day in and day out, Illaoi makes that call without hesitation.  This is the burden of the test she brings...

What matters more; how the characters perceive _themselves_ and their actions, or what they actually _do_?

He explicitly said that Illaoi was trying to \"help people\". She's testing people to help them improve if they pass, or to better the universe at large if they fail. Not to please her god. \n\nNow, I'm no D&D expert, so I don't know if that is good or neutral or lawful or whatever, but that's certainly not evil. And also, she doesn't test random innocents, as far as I can tell. She tests people for a reason, so you can't even say she's evil \"by default\" because she does not hesitate to harm innocents.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-05-16T17:38:31.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a thing like personal opinion of good and good being caring for another.\n\nFor example Karthus is more like  a dude who imprisons people in a tower because he legimately thinks he is doing well.

I can definitely see your argument that that's just her personality, not her alignment.  She's lawful good, but she has an abrasive, tough-love personality.  This is where it's easier to assign a plane of afterlife existence than an alignment because they have in-betweens like the plane for lawful neutral/Lawful Good.\n\n\nAll in all though, I really DO see the argument for her being Lawful Good...

That sounds more like a lawful neutral who is conflicted.  A lawful Good person would probably say just laws are created for good and unjust laws aren't really laws at all.\n\nTo put this into perspective, a funny thing I've noticed is that a paladin's code requires that he is always good but not that he is always be lawful.  Yes he is LG, but he's always going to take the side of good (the higher laws) over the laws of man if you force him to take a side.  He'd rather the two be one in the same and will work towards that end in the big picture but he's got a little leeway on the law side of things when he needs it.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2016-05-16T20:32:04.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because in D&D style alignment lawful doesn't actually mean follow the laws.

He is a strange area to where it's something like Chaotic and Lawful at the same time and his motives aren't evil, just selfish. He isn't Shadow Isles, he was just stubborn and greedy, like any ruler of a pirate continent would be. He is more Chaotic Neutral if anything. His law is a little strange and not the Demacian standard at all or anything of the sorts, but isn't just evil. He rewarded the boy in the lore who told about Graves and TF with a coin, food, and bed. He has a kind heart for those who can show that they can work under him. He is just greedily strict with his laws.\nChaotic Neutral for your description summarizes Gangplank in a way, at least in my eyes. He only cares about himself, his position, and those who can help him, but loses track of morals along the way. \n\nI also think Vel'Koz is deceiving. He isn't Lawful Evil really. He loves knowledge and the power it gives, but his quotes kind of show off that he enjoys destroying those around him. More Chaotic Evil like the rest of the Void.\n\nFinally, Ekko is 100% Chaotic Good. He cares for other street boys (or whatever you wish to call them) a ton! He rewinded an incredible number of times to try and save a fellow street boy like him, and when he couldn't save him or get payback, he instead used his time to make sure the boy was with someone he liked in his last couple moments.

By this logic, GP is Neutral Evil.  He'll use the law, order, tradition or just the idea of a code of honor and unity if it suits him, but he doesn't really care about any of it and he's just in it for himself.  If someone seems to be kinda back and forth in regards to opposing alignments, it usually means they're neutral and just doing what they feel is the best idea in each circumstance.  MOST people are neutral under the alingment system, actually.  They base their actions more on circumstance, personal attachments and the situation they're in than an overall sense of morality, compassion or honor.\n\nAlignment is very easy to contest too.  I for instance... would put GP as VERY firmly in Evil.  Neutral Evil, probably.  He's a brutal, violent killer that tortures people frequently.  The reason he does this is almost ENTIRELY selfish... so he can \"rule\" Bilgewater as the pirate king.  He's essentially just a thug and a bully who stays at the top of the pile via the fear other people have of him.  His single \"good\" act in taking care of a boy who helped him could simply be a pragmatic response.  By rewarding people who help him, he encourages more people to help him.  Even if it is a genuine kind act because he feels for the kid... he's still evil.  Evil characters can have loved ones... they can have moments of compassion or even act nobly from time to time.  They can be charming, friendly or likeable.  But at the end of the day, Gangplank wants what Gangplank wants, and that involves a LOT of theft, murder and brutality.  He'd probably do the same to the kid if he had a reason to... even if he felt bad about it.  \n\nBut it's always open to interpretation.  You could see him as CN, while I say NE.  Unless YOU yourself wrote the character and thus are the one deciding how he thinks and acts... alignment is always open to interpretation.  I prefer to use it loosely, going mostly off of a character's actions and how they feel about those actions.  Theft, murder and brutal torture?  Not a speck of remorse or concern that he's causing suffering?  I put him a VERY solid Evil for that... but that's just my opinion.  \n\nLikewise, I could argue that Ekko isn't actually good at all.  Sure, he'd go to bat and lay his life on the line for his friends, his fellow street kids and the like... but if that compassion doesn't extent past people he personally knows and likes it's much more gray.  Now for the record, I don't think this... I would also put Ekko at Chaotic Good.  I'm just saying that the argument could be made that he's only so dogged in what he does because the people involved have a personal connection to him.   Even in this case he's still a pretty light and heroic neutral... but if he'd die for a friend, but ignore the plight of someone outside the \"gang\" he's protective of... he might fall into neutral.  At least, that's how I'd see it.  I think Riot intends him as CG though, and that he'd stick up for people being bullied, oppressed or mistreated no matter who they are.  I just like that the alignment system is so open and flexible.  It pretty much HAS to be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-05-15T15:23:44.403+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could argue Ekko as Chaotic Neutral.\nHe and his group look after their own, and won't let anyone stop them from helping each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2016-05-14T22:55:55.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just dropping by to say nice list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-05-16T20:25:11.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> {{champion:89}} : Lawful Neutral\n\nI don't know what she is anymore, but I do know her lore change was wrong and she's a terrible character now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Annoxis","date":"2016-05-15T14:57:30.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vel'Koz is a Lawful Evil acording to you ?
