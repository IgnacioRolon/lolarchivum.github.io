I never have problems with lag. My ping bounces from 350-650. The game is a slide show. My PC, router and modem have all been restarted several times. I am not having any lag issues with anything other than League of Legends. When I ping 104.160.131.3 -t, it is consistently one good ping (30-40ms) followed by one horrific ping (1296-1302ms), then one good, one horrible, etc, etc, forever. That's the way the game plays as well. I'll have a few good frames, followed by a game freeze, followed by warping, then a few good frames, etc, etc. I'm on Spectrum cable in Ohio.\n\nWhat is so frustrating is literally every other thing on the internet is working fine. So can't tell anything is wrong until I get into the game. Then it's too late. Something is seriously wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T21:38:15.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your traceroute results sound like your connection might be hitting some packet loss on its way to our servers.
