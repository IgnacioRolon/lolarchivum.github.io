So I was playing as {{champion:154}}  Zac earlier today with roughly 6.4 - 6.6k health at the endgame, and I was preparing to use my E (Elastic Slingshot) on an enemy Jhin. Upon landing ontop of Jhin, I took a massive burst of True Damage from nowhere. I have no idea what it was until after I died almost immediately afterwards. Turns out the damage came from &quot;game_spell_displayname_Bowmaster&quot; and nuked me for 6270 True Damage. As there is no set ability in the game even called this, I am more than sure this is a bug of some sort. I have attached an image of the Post-Death screen showing the damage indicator and I am truly dazzled at what this is or why it happened. Some light to be shed on this would be greatly appreciated. The extra damage I took from Basic Attacks was between healing from Zac's passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2016-05-03T20:05:33.865+0000","up_votes":97,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spaghetti code decided it wanted to deal 6k true damage to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Snake Town","date":"2016-05-03T22:39:03.683+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/FXK8ge2.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"I Smell Pennies","date":"2016-05-03T22:55:39.696+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's brilliant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2016-05-03T21:10:45.835+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kamquats,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=YWaGXI4r,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-05-03T20:05:33.865+0000)\n>\n> Spaghetti code decided it wanted to deal 6k true damage to you.\n\nConfirmation that we all must join the Pastafarians or perish under the Spaghetti God's withering stare.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2016-05-03T22:05:18.617+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Praising intensifies","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2016-05-04T08:56:25.952+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/28/09/31A3BE2800000578-3467794-image-a-2_1456650847620.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Owyn","date":"2016-05-04T20:31:03.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was his His Noodly Appendage {{champion:432}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-05-03T17:52:57.754+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":0,"body":"Art.","replies":[]},{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2016-05-03T17:59:30.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"probably jhin traps, don't trust the death recap, its visually bugged","replies":[{"poster":"I Smell Pennies","date":"2016-05-03T18:01:28.681+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can assure you there were no traps.
