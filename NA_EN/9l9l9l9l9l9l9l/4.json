That matchup basically forces Irelia into going sunfire first item because poppy will destroy anyone squishy. \n\nMy friend mains pre nerf Yi and even when he was fed, an even scored Poppy beat yi because Poppy W resistance increase + her passive + the fact she gets tankier when shes low on hp to all source of damage makes it hard for high dps champions who are melee to deal with her because if you have to chase her to fight her she can bait you into following her into a potential stun. Long extended duels are her bestfriend because her shield will always come up and not to mention her E and Q which are essential to her kit, but you cant just stand infront of her either cause you cant keep getting hit by her Q cause it does HP damage. Her damage is better than mediocre while being too hard to duel cause she has too internal tankiness. \n\nAnd she is a direct counter to Tryna since it doesnt matter if Tryn has all his item. Poppy is too tanky for Tryn to kill while Tryn is too squishy to duel with her decent DPS + cc and chasing potential. Jax and Irelia are the best bet against her but I main both of them and let me tell you its a losing matchup late game. Except for maybe Jax at 6 items but even then Poppy can outplay that duel if she can avoid stun with W and R and bait Jax to a wall. \n\nSo a Jax and Irelia main in me and a Yi main both diamond are saying that all of them has a disadvantage against A GOOD Poppy. Its undeniable either cause right now she is the best top laner in the game even in competitive not only in soloque.  The whole reason she falls off late game is cause as Irelia I can kill the  carries faster then she can cause Irelia chasing potential and damage are both better then Poppy. But even then Poppy is too tanky to deal with and its not like her damage is terrible late game. Making her too good early to mid game while still being decent late game with her disruption in teamfights. It doesnt mean she still cant lose.. I havent lost lane with Poppy yet even though I havent even mastered her.  The only time I lost with her is when the jungler camps me, BUT EVEN THEN I still win 1v1.

She was not made to be a duelist (well not anymore) but her outplay between IN every matchup are way too high and its so easy to do. \n\nLike here are the rules when youre facing her:\n\nYou cant chase her cause she will just bait you into a wall, so you cant chase her for too long.\nYou cant stand infront of her or in melee range cause you will just eat a Q.\nYou have to be smart when her passive is up. Cause she will probably use it to win the trade.\nYou cant be squishy cause her damage potential post level 6 and with sheen is enough to kill you if she stuns you.\nYou cant be squishy because her E range is so long she will gap close to you, even use a minion to do so.\nYou cant dash to her or away from her if her W is up cause youll just take free damage and she'll get away or engage the fight.\nIf you dont have a lot of damage, you cant fight her. Cause shes too tanky and she does constant damage.\n\nNow that is a lot of things you cant do when facing her.. Riot needs to address one or three of these problems. Like the theory you trade tankiness for damage. But you need both to beat Poppy, but I cant think of any to do that beside Yorick or Trundle but even then they cant both lose if they play the lane wrong.

Maybe removing 100 range on E is too much, though. Try 50. Poppy is the #2 top laner in the game atm, only loses to pre-nerfs Fiora (maybe still after nerfs) and Trundle. Trundle is supposed to win that 1v1 by kit design, so no surprise there. If you combine the fact that her laning phase is excellent 1v1 and in lane swaps her aoe + %hp damage help the duo jungle a lot, she doesn't have any downsides to picking her in terms of opening-game strategy. She then goes on to be a great split pusher with IBG, but is also absolutely phenomenal in team fights and for flanking. Her ultimate is extremely strong when used properly, and her back line threat due to massive cc potential (part of which can't be cleansed), ability to deny dashes, and %hp damage makes her an all around strong pick regardless of team comp. So I'd say she's lacking an actual weakness right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-03-24T01:08:08.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's almost like Riot is looking at the Tanks doing TONS OF DAMAGE and going \"Hmmm.....maybe we need to stop that?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-03-24T01:07:21.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dumpstered? uh no more like normal nerfed.  \n\nShe is way too strong, she deals Fighter Damage but is tanky like a Tank.

In my opinion it is the most defining ability on her kit and knowing when and how to use it to consistently get the most out of it is what separates the good Poppy players from everyone else. I play her almost exclusively jungle (I think I have taken her top like....once) and that would be the ability I'd be the saddest to see ruined.\n\nI've never been an advocate for \"maining\" a champion in a game with over 100 choices but rework Poppy is the closest I've ever come to that and I'm not looking forward to having to ditch her when you guys go overboard (and it looks like that's the case).\n\nOn a side note, this nerf reminds me heavily of the nerf to Maokai's W range a while back.....one that absolutely killed his jungle for me.","replies":[]}]}
