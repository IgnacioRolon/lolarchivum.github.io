Very good at all stages in the game. In early you are a bit of a bully to people, in mid you roam and excel at skirmishes and teamfights, and late game you can singlehandedly win the teamfight to win the game.\n2. He's a bit hard to play at first, but once you learn him, he is incredibly useful and good to know.\n3. Even if you feed and fall behind, he has a fallback: his stun will always be around, regardless of how much you've fed, and you still have a use in teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-04-02T07:34:16.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes good in low elo, aoe cc is always a good choice.

He's also very flexible as you can pick him in any role but the jungle.\n\nVery fun champion and he's personally one of my mains as well. He has great stuns, an excellent ult that works well in any teamfight and is a highly interactive champion. Try him out whenever you get the chance - he could be worth your time depending on your own playstyle as he's quite different compared to most other champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-04-02T00:43:18.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kennen can single handedly win team fights. high burst. can be played both ap and ad (as an ad carry). and he counters zed and most all in assassins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aonraider","date":"2016-04-01T18:08:18.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've played him mid and top whe he was fotm, i did rlly good with him. and than i played him adc so hes my main. i'd say yes. mid and top ar easy but adc is a bit harder so it depends on what role you want o play him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Next Kill","date":"2016-04-01T17:36:47.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't played him much, but I had alot of fun the few times I did when he was free.
