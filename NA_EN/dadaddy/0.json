Your resolution here might just be too big.  For example, 4K is a setting we don't currently support and can cause issues like this or with your resolution.  There could also be a problem with the cable as well that may work well on one screen but not another.  Additionally, there may be outdated driver problems if you are getting bugsplat errors.  Beyond using a smaller monitor, I'd suggest going over our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help with resolving the bugsplat.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackychan16","date":"2016-09-23T12:13:57.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its happened to me too..
