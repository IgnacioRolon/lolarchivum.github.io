Now, I can't even load into a custom game without the game crashing or if it does load in, I'm stuck with 05 FPS.\r\n\r\nI've seen a thread saying that this is only a Mac issue, but I'm using an HP Laptop (Windows 10) and I can't even play a game without serious lag from both my mouse and the game as a result of the FPS. \r\n\r\nI opened a Support ticket as well, but I'm basically being told that it's my internet connection, flush my DNS, uninstall and reinstall, etc. I've done all of that and it's still an issue. Again, I have a good laptop and an Nvidia graphics card, I was playing League prior to this patch at perfect FPS and crystal clear graphics. Even when I tried to lower graphics in game, change from windowed to borderless, basically any solution others have tried, it doesn't work. \r\n\r\nI'm just really frustrated and would appreciate any help or input. I hope I'm not the only Windows 10 user experience this extreme FPS drop and lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Zycres","date":"2017-05-07T04:19:36.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not alone at all man, every game I'm stuck with 10 fps or lower, it's hit 4 fps before especially when it games to late game ( post 30 minutes or so )\n\nEver since the new client has been established and the legacy client being retired. The experience on league of legends for me has been slowly going downhill. I love this game so much and it's all I ever play when it comes to video games, I've supported Riot a lot through many other surveys, and of course purchasing skins and other products. Now I feel like no one is helping the players who are less fortunate such as myself, I don't have an amazing computer, not even an average laptop, but it at least got me 20 fps every game, until the new client came out. Even with low spec mode and closing my client during games I just can't bare 20 to 4 fps progressively as the games grow longer. The client is significantly slower and I end up missing acceptance to games due to it not loading up on my screen. It takes forever for me to even accept an invite from my friend, my screen just remains stuck almost on the same frame. I imagine that there are so many other players out there that are experiencing the same issue, but no one says anything thing since they assume Riot will never see their message. I was one of those people until now, when I actually feel on the verge of quitting my time with league of legends; also, there is an issue with how the client opens up in my task manager. It shows two league of legends render clients .exe, when my other friends have only one. I just can't handle playing with this anymore and the experience seems like it'll only get worse for me. Please help and fix this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"852 For Life","date":"2017-05-07T02:48:40.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me, never get higher than 68 fps during patch 7.9{{item:3140}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T01:11:36.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up your ticket so I could get a little more context as to what specifically was going on. it looks like originally you were able to get those connection issues figured out, then you started having some FPS problems as well. I'd say you're in the best hands with the tech guys in your ticket, but in the meantime I'd suggest trying the steps in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to see if we can get this fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaisume","date":"2017-05-05T01:14:27.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the fast response, I've tried out everything in the FPS guide.
