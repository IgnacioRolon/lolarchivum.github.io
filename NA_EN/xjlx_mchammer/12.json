Can't they just be tier 1 turrets and the 3rd be unique?  The range is already pretty good in midlane since there's already champs that take a shot hugging the wall just because of how thin the entrance around tower is (near red).  Like I understand Herald and minions both make pushing easier even with the range but the second it starts shooting if you dont have a long flash/dash read you have minimal escapes and just by existing in midlane even with your team you're in danger of dying.  That's honestly harder than a tier 3 at that point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QuickenedBlade","date":"2017-05-13T18:24:48.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i love being dove at lvl 5 by enemy jungler and he takes 7 tower shots and ignite without dying","replies":[{"poster":"Corvo Attano","date":"2017-05-13T21:53:09.625+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"^^Clearly an exaggeration","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-14T20:08:49.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe he's Ivern with shield and a Karma mid, both of them shielding the Ivern constantly?
