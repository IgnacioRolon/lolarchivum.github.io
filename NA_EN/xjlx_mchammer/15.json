Granted the lanes were doing well and my enemy jungler was Fiddle so i had a field day. I was able to get all 5 stacks as Shyvana by like 45 min. All I can say is, very  strong. I can't get over the fact that Shyvana with 15% movement speed, true dmg, and all the other bonus is easy to beat. But imagine a ADC had this. Like it's just tooo strong.","replies":[]}
