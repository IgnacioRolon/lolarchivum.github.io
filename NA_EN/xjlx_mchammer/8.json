Runes (Electrocute), Summoners (ignite), free passive (IE Zoe&#039;s W), %HP that found in many types of items, and anti resisitance items just makes it too easy.\r\n\r\nIt used to that you due to lower damage, and high cooldowns, you had to actually plan when to trade. Now, due to all the free damage and low cooldowns, people no longer &quot;trade&quot;. You just trade, you don&#039;t have to really land abilities. A zoe can outtrade champions because she will proc electrocute and ignite very fast and still take a huge amount of HP.\r\n\r\nA Zed early game can just mindlessly Q+W+Ignite and take a good 70% HP down. Sure, you most likely wont die but the amount of damage you took means he can kill you easily in ~10 seconds; it basically forces a back. \r\n\r\nRiot also keeps buffing AA damage to compensate for buffing the non AA champions. After all, if a Zed can kill you without landing most of his abilities, AA champions need high damage. Now, ADC&#039;s in many cases can actually do BURST DAMAGE. No, they wont outburst a Zed but the AA still hits like a truck, you still die in 3-4 AA&#039;s, sometimes even less.\r\n\r\nWorst, instead of nerfing some of this free damage, they just keep buffing other champions damage, \r\nLook at Fiz. He wasn&#039;t weak because he lack the damage to kill someone. NO, he was very much able to kill someone with a rotation. But it required that the fizz player actually to land majority of his spells. Now? \r\n1.  Q a minon (to get close to the opponent)\r\n2.  E to get even closer\r\n3. Try to get close to land R\r\n4. AA the knocked up champion\r\n5. Press W to reset your auto\r\n6. This triggers a Electrocute\r\n7. Ignite.\r\n\r\n\r\nVictim is likely dead or needed to flash to avoid the burst. If they somehow survive all that, they will need to heal up. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it SUCKS. SUCKS playing many immobile champions. You are left knowing that most of these champions will use the mobility in their kit to  close the gab and still have enough to burst you because Riot overbuffed everything.\r\n\r\nA Fizz shouldn&#039;t be able to burst down champions when he used 2/4 abilities to close the gab\r\nA Zed shouldn&#039;t be able to burst a champion down when he Flash + W+ R to close the gab, land a Q + Ignite + AA to proc a elec and chuck you down or kill you","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-02T22:13:50.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not so much a problem at the beginning of the match, but this problem gets bigger the more someone is ahead. You can miss way too many abilities once ahead especially if your ignite is off CD. This makes it so hard to come back. Ahri gets a kill on my Jungler then all of a sudden she can Miss Q and E and kill me with ult and w. That is the stupidity of this meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tempname130583","date":"2018-08-02T21:52:02.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really like it when the enemy misses like half there combo so you think you can fight but then you dont realize that they dont have real cooldowns and do stupid damage so at that point its over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2018-08-02T21:46:31.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preach brother, preach.\n\nI would also like to add that when the first few champs like Lee Sin came out with crazy mobility it was fun and exciting because it made them unique. To RIOT devs out there....It is far less fun and exciting when every new champ is really mobile","replies":[]},{"poster":"FÃ­zz v2","date":"2018-08-02T21:46:07.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your point, but Fizz did need more burst damage. Maybe its too much now but he needed more.","replies":[]}]}
