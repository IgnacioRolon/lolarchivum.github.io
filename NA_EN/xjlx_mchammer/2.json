I do not agree that a mage needs that kinda thing though.....\n\nThey have a hard enough time figuring out how to stay alive without dieing to worry about dieing after they get out of a fight because they have no way to heal themself.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-11T01:11:30.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either i am crazy or it got massively buffed fairly recently..\n\nChecked wiki:  It used to be 12%, then 15%.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2017-05-11T03:00:44.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=89tEvfjz,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-11T01:11:30.787+0000)\n>\n> Either i am crazy or it got massively buffed fairly recently..\n> \n> Checked wiki:  It used to be 12%, then 15%.\n\nUNIQUE: Stores 30% of all physical and magic damage received, and is taken as damage over time true damage instead, dealing one-third of the stored damage every second.\n\nPatch before last?
