You can't watch it without video. \n\n~~I don't really have anything to say to this except mute it~~. The buttons there for a reason. Don't wanna listen because the shoutcasters suck, are biased, or anything else? Then mute them. It's your option to listen to them and watch the video. Both are separate options.\n\nAlso, lets be serious here, their job is to analyze the game and they were analyzing it. They were saying that even though members got caught, it wasn't a serious blow, nothing will happen. It doesn't ONLY happen with that team. I've heard that in fnatic games, in CLG games, in OG games. Saying that its ok at a time for team members to get caught doesn't only happen where you said. It's been used numerous times.\n\nIf it truly is a gamechanging teamfight, they'll say it is. They'll legit say \"This teamfight will decide the game RIGHT HERE.\" \"THEY GO FOR BARON AND _COMPLETELY_ CHANGE THE SWAY OF THE GAME.\" likewise if a teamfight or members getting caught doesn't change much, they'll say that too: \"X is down, but it doesn't look like that big of an effect as red team goes for dragon anyway. They try to steal, and....nothing.\" \"X is down, but with the team being this fed, it doesn't matter, AND THEY GO IN ANYWAY\"\n\nSo....yeah.\n\nTL;DR: Mute it and watch if it annoys you that bad.

It may not be everyone's cup of tea to hear casters not be neutral when it comes to the teams that are playing, but it is a natural effect of competitive sports. No offense meant in any way to the views of OP or others. Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2015-10-18T00:02:05.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.

He doesn't sugarcoat things. He says how things realistically look, and I can appreciate that.
