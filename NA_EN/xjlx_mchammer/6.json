People are complaining because Riot wants to open up every lane to other archetypes, EXCEPT bot lane, which is ADC 100% and always 100%.  That is what people are angry about.  And also, at very high elos, ADCS are very hard to kill.  An assassin killing an ADC?  Good luck.

You literally walk up to him like \"Hey, can you please hit me with your fish?\" and then whine about a champion. Besides, there is this thing called \"Team chat\" which allows you to communicate with your team, to some extent.\n\n**I'm not complaining about Fizz. I'm showing that he can kill you. People act like its impossible to kill the OP ADCs, and its not.**\n\nJust saw this statement 2 comments below so I figured I'd respond. Of course a champion can kill another champion. ADC's OP'ness comes from both his damage and supports ability to save him. In addition to that, if a Varus without any escaped walks up to me without paying any attention to me, I'm pretty sure I would kill him with a LOT of champions. Mechanical ineptitude doesn't suddenly mean that your role isn't OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Shíníng Díamond","date":"2018-04-20T18:25:55.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the \"op'ness\", as you put it, is from the supports ability to save them, then that means that adc's are not the problem, but rather enchanter/tanky peel supports.

The role is op because they are not giving enough trade off for the damage they do.\n\nDon't try to straw-man me. What I said is \"ADC's OP'ness comes from both his damage and supports ability to save him.\". Reality is that a single support can peel an adc from the entire 5-man team. You do not need an entire team to peel an adc. It only takes 1 Janna with Redemption, Zeke and Locket to absolutely shut down any attempts to initiate a fight on an adc.\n\n**If a Janna decides that she won&#x27;t shield anyone but her adc and only pop her ult and redemption for when her carry needs it, then why shouldn&#x27;t the adc live?**\n\nBecause 1 support shouldn't be enough to save an adc from the damage of 3 - 4 people.\n\n**The problem in this case is not the fact that adc&#x27;s are unkillable. It&#x27;s the fact that they are supposed to do sustained and consistent damage.**\n\nIn fact, both of those are problems. If a character that deals one of the highest burst AND consistent damage simultaneously doesn't die he is objectively op. And since adc and support can be considered a set, which means that whatever happens to either of them directly influences the other part of the set, at this point in the meta adc's are objectively op.\n\n**...no the role is not op simply for the fact that they don&#x27;t die. The role is op because they are not giving enough trade off for the damage they do.**\n\nThey are op BECAUSE they don't die. I`m fine with adc dealing shitton of damage if I can Zed ult him or cc him. But the problem is that none of that works because they don't die. In addition to QSS (which is objectively best on adc's) and GA, they have a second inventory and 4 more abilities that are meant for peeling a.k.a a support. Combine that with ridiculous damage and the class becomes op. \n\n- Here is an experiment. Stick full build Lulu to a full build tank, assassin, mage and adc. Look at who's capable to 2v5. I'm pretty sure you know the answer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2018-04-19T17:21:35.558+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":20,"body":"waveclear mages are dominating mid and pushing out other contenders like assassins \nADCs dominate bot and push out... who exactly?\n\nIt's not like they took someone else's place or there was a class that used to have ADC's place but were pushed out by ADCs","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-04-19T17:31:10.200+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Face The Win,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GwMydn83,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-19T17:21:35.558+0000)\n>\n> waveclear mages are dominating mid and pushing out other contenders like assassins \n> ADCs dominate bot and push out... who exactly?\n> \n> It&#x27;s not like they took someone else&#x27;s place or there was a class that used to have ADC&#x27;s place but were pushed out by ADCs\n\nTell that to the line-up of non-adc and non-supp champs and their strategies who got reworked and/or nerfed for daring to be played in bot lane. Who does that include? Well, we had double assassins, double bruisers, double mages, and all of those in-between with or without some mixing with supports. Oh my!\n\nAlso, ADCs at the dawn of League were originally played at mid, due to the shorter lane distance which back then were exploited as \"shorter distance to safety and more farms for our sustain damage carry\"; while bot lane was played as a supp plus a placeholder champ that changes based on the opponent's choice (people did get the clue of the importance of dragon and put 2 people at bot very quickly tho). So yes, bot was never only for ADCs; it took a few meta-shifts before Riot just suddenly decided that meta shouldn't evolve anymore and we now are stuck with the last meta we had.

ADCs scale primarily off items. Most supports are not XP-reliant, and have kits that work regardless of gold or levels. Most Tanks/Assassins/Mages/etc scale heavily off levels. Therefore, they are almost always in the solo lanes. The 2 roles that are affected the least by XP go bot. The roles that are affected the most by levels/xp go top/mid.\n\nThats why the meta is the way it is. Most mages/Assassins/Tanks/Bruisers ALL need levels primarily to do their jobs. That lvl 6 Fizz before anyone is 6. That lvl 11 Syndra. That lvl 11 Rumble, etc. There are a few mages who can survive without levels, like Brand/Zyra/etc but they are so effective they can easily survive off just the support gold income. A support Brand will do damn near the same amount of damage per game as a mid brand would.\n\nThats why it has been the way it is for so long. The champ designs themselves are why its played the way it is, and it was played this way because PLAYERS FOUND OUT ITS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. You put the 2 champs that require the least amount of XP to succeed in one lane. One of them requries gold, one doesnt(even though nowadays a support gets a ton of gold). You put the champs that require XP and levels to succeed in solo lanes so that they always have level advantages to do their jobs.
