Wow thanks...great way to have a conversation\n\nI said what's wrong with you in terms of you saying, \"ADC did not have any significant changes done to them.\"\n\nThat statement was totally in correct. Armor and HP values were changed. Armor boots passive was changed. AD items have been buffed across the board from BOTRK, to BT, to IE, to SS. New AD items were introduce. Old items were reworked to benefit ADCs. ADC were either nerfed or buffed. Support items that ADC benefit from the most due to proximity early game and late game sync has been buffed. Items like Knights Vow, Arden..etc have all benefited ADC's the most\n\nThe statement you made not correct.\n\nI also never said or made a statement regarding nerfing the entire role. I just made a topic to say the changes over the course of 3-4 seasons have gotten us in this situation where not only are ADC mandatory in games, they are becoming the class in my opinion is broken. ADC by design will normally mean that changes tend to benefit or hurt them all in a similar pattern (but different degree)\n\nIt's time Riot address that ADC is no longer the role that is weak early game. We are seeing ADC go in mid lane, a lane that should be scared to go into from champions classes like Assassins, or mages. Instead, they are beating them in lane. Are they all doing it? NO! Of course not. People are still following the mage/assassin setup in mid. Give it another season with  the way we are heading and you will see more ADC in mid lane.  Last weeks LCS/LP have shown it. 25+AP mages, players can't pick any one of them because they don't have the early game to fight a Lucian/kog early game but they can't scale into late game as good...They lose out in mid game due to their disadvantage early game. \n\nThis was what AP and assassins were meant to do ADC champions; beat them early or mid game to make them fall behind and not reach a late game that is superior to ADC champions. We are slowly moving away from that where ADC are become better at early mid game for various reason that I have stated.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"50ShadesOfÀDC","date":"2017-08-24T16:19:44.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Redemption is for team ardent is also for team (Karma R+E,Janna R and more,),Locket affects everyone.","replies":[]}]}]}
