Sometimes I Q the wrong way and sometimes my eq combo doesn&#039;t work.

I like the particle animations but the skin just doesnt feel right.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-02T01:57:52.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heyu NUTTYN -\n\nThis is something we've investigated before, and it doesn't appear to be a bug, but rather, the difference in sound for her (Q), as opposed to other skins.

Not a huge distance away, just like half a second after the shop icon dims out, walk back under the fountain again and you should be able to buy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NUTTYN","date":"2016-02-02T21:12:18.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=vxB8jw0K,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-02T01:57:52.254+0000)\n>\n> Heyu NUTTYN -\n> \n> This is something we've investigated before, and it doesn't appear to be a bug, but rather, the difference in sound for her (Q), as opposed to other skins.

There seems to be an actual issue- I don't use sound when playing League anyhow, so this probably means that the skin is bugged.{{champion:53}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mighty Lychee","date":"2016-02-02T15:14:50.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=vxB8jw0K,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-02T01:57:52.254+0000)\n>\n> Heyu NUTTYN -\n> \n> This is something we've investigated before, and it doesn't appear to be a bug, but rather, the difference in sound for her (Q), as opposed to other skins.
