{"poster":"Ranger Wolf","date":"2015-07-03T20:04:43.125+0000","title":"Gnar, who was hunting him? - lore","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok, so I read the lore several times over and there is just one thing that eludes my grasp for full comprehension. Who is it that was tracking Gnar in his lore? I thought maybe it was Kha&#039;zix, Rengar, or Nidalee, but none of their lore descriptions indicate such is the case. Is there some unreleased champ that was hunting Gnar, or is there something I keep missing. \r\n\r\nI am fairly certain it is not Rengar or Kha&#039;zix because, according to their lore, Rengar considers Kha&#039;zix to be the most challenging prey and vice versa. For they both suffered serious wounds in the fight; Including the loss of Rengar&#039;s eye. I can say with near absolute certainty that it can not be Nidalee as, according to her own lore, She is not one for the hunt so much as she is trying to protect her home from the Demacians and Noxians. Lastly none of these three ever mention they tracked any large creatures capable of mass destruction, nor do they mention meeting a yordle wielding a bone weapon. Any assistance you guys can offer in my quest to uncover Gnar&#039;s hunter would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[Gnar](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/gnar/)\r\n[Kha&#039;Zix](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/khazix/)\r\n[Rengar](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/rengar/)\r\n[Nidalee](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/nidalee/)\r\n\r\nP.S.
