Can't farm, is useless without farm, mediocre in double jungling, awful gank potential. She would be in a terrible position, not to mention Fnatic is extremely reliant on their top laner. This alone would have fatally wounded Fnatic.\n\nNow let's add in safe Sivir farm and how she out scales Urgot. Finally, TSM would feel a lot more comfortable since they almost always lane swap while other regions don't lane swap anywhere near as much giving TSM a huge advantage in experience.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-05-07T22:29:45.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything correct except that Cassiopeia can farm every easily in laneswap situations.

Just giving Dyrus a gank would have made that lane go well.  Realistically when the same tops and jungles were played again later on in the day (I can't remember the teams involved) what determined the victory was just giving ganks to top lane.  TSM's style of ignoring top is starting to seriously come back to bite them.  Worse yet, dyrus's lack of skill has become more prominent in his bad decision making and overestimating what he can take and do.  His failure against cass earlier with gnar wasn't the worst thing since he only died due to ganks.  However, when given hecarim against gnar he failed to play the lane out right.  overall, every lane did quite poorly and santorin was unquestionably useless in the games lost.  The whole team did bad, period.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KazaLyn Shao","date":"2015-05-08T04:19:27.526+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"NA teams have always been trash compared to any other continent.  They lose the laning phase, they lose the team fight phase, they lose at objectives, and they lose matches.

Gnar doesn't beat Cassi, like ever. Cassi is immobile, Rek'sai snowballs hard off ganks, what do you? Well if you're TSM, you just afk farm on a gank heavy jungler against a Cassi pushing the lane.

They obviously can't compete well internationally unless there are flukes like at IEM.  Things that will help TSM are getting a better top/adc (Dyrus just needs to retire and Turtle's been falling off for sometime) and getting new ownership that isn't toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grande Sonnerie","date":"2015-05-10T00:30:28.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets make  a small genesis of what NA did during past several seasons - \n\nSeason 2 - American style failed horribly.
