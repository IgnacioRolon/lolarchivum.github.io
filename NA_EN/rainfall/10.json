Executioners calling messes her up, but she's not the Juggernaut who's impacted the most by it, and most every Juggernaut can be crippled by executioners. \n\nHer mobility is fine for a Juggernaut, as others might have strong movespeed buffs, her strength is that she's easily the strongest area controlling Juggernaut. Juggernauts like Garen might get a fight going by running in, while Illoai does it by slowly but surely moving a zone of death forward towards the enemy. \n\nHer reliability on tentacles is the trade off for her monstrous ult, which she can use to single handily win teamfights if played right. \n\nWhile she lacks CC, I would argue that her form of CC (her E) is amongst the best of the Juggernauts CC. Fairly good range, strong way to harass or even make someone leave lane for a bit of time, and applies a good slow. Other Juggernauts have even less effective CC, which is fine as the class in general isn't supposed to have top tier CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-06-04T14:41:08.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JAGERNAUT. \n\nI desperately need a nautilus skin with Jagermeister bottles attached to his breathing apparatus.","replies":[]}]}
