But then I realised something else was happening too. \n\nWith the removal of masteries, we're losing a lot of percentage damage increases. I completely forgot to factor that in. And then I read this riot comment: \n\"to TL;DR the problem with ~some~ context I have:\nWe did some systematic DPS testing, and squishy vs squishy damage was noticeably lower than it was on live (somewhere from 10-12% lower) and so these Void/Lethality changes are a starting point to tune them back towards their \"correct\" spot.\"\n\nTaken from:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/75rd7n/1011_pbe_update/do8cx7b/\n\nSquishy damage vs other squishies is all around just worse. With that in mind, since both lethality and mpen are getting buffed, and I think Riot's making the right call by not giving armour/mr to midlaners, since their damage to each other is already lower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aqours fanboy","date":"2017-10-16T16:51:31.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Diana's PBE changes (from the mains Discord, I myself need to see this for myself):\n\nBase armor increased from 26.048 to 31.05\nHP growth increased from 90 to 95\nBase HP increased from 589.2 to 594.2\n\nSo MY main is good.
