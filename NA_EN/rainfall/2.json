Ardent is fine now but it's the supports and crit being too cheap for its price that needs a nerf.

Which is also the reason Janna can even do anything. Sona is the only other outlier in that regard, too, which is what allows her to be such a bully for free in lane.\n\nMost enchanters are trash. Nami is god awful. Just... trash. Truly trash. Soraka is too easy to counter with ignite or any other wounding source (and wounding items are basically core on literally every carry or mage anyway) and too easy to kill during laning or teamfights. Annnnnnnnd.... there basically aren't any other enchanters.\n\nThe entire reason enchanters became a thing was because Riot allowed them to spend some of their pitiful budget on behalf of their carry in the form of free steroids (Censer), Locket and Crucible. It really says something about how awful enchanters are when the only important thing they bring to the team is one or two items that everyone else wants the team's wardbitch to buy because it's not otherwise gold efficient to buy the stats themselves.\n\nMage-supports like Morgana, Lux, Karma and ZIlean are in a terrible spot right now because AP itemization sucks so bad and because most of their potential requires midlane gold to unlock. Zilean in particular is having a hard time feeling like he does anything when you're playing him. The only reason he *can be* relevant is that damage creep is so bad right now that his ult is the only meaningful \"save the carry\" button in the game outside a marksman's lifesteal. His slow endgame can be ok... provided you are targeting something kitable. Which marksmen are not, especially if they have Mercurial. Morg would scale well in theory, except she spends the whole match trying to catch up and can't secure kills because W is sooooo bad. Her ult is among the absolute worst in the game too. Basically, mobility creep has made Morgana obsolete. She is literally a champ that hasn't really change since 2010 and it is showing. Her in-game model looks like something freshman digital arts kids would shit out in a weekend, it's so bad. Lux has more utility than Morg and a far better ult so she can actually leverage her long range effectively. Especially since her Q roots multiple people.\n\nKarma is trash. Pure trash.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dani El Pezglobo","date":"2017-10-29T18:10:34.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crit itemitation become 2k gold more cheap from 7.20 to 7.21, im waiting if changes preseason (mr deleted from runes) will make ap carries be able to actually carry and define a game like ad carries do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goodwill","date":"2017-10-29T17:34:31.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm expecting to slowly climb the top % ladder without playing ranked","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-10-29T17:39:07.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustifiedkNot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YP6XEHhM,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-10-29T17:34:31.586+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m expecting to slowly climb the top % ladder without playing ranked\n\nIf this were blizzard, you could lose so much your points go negative and you become rank 1 grand challenger!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jesus Is My King","date":"2017-10-29T17:26:09.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know, thats actually true... well said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLBGAMing","date":"2017-10-29T17:11:32.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-10-29T17:31:24.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But...
