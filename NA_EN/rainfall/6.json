It also had a scaling cooldown (NO IDEA why that got changed, especially because mana cost also went down).\n\nSo if you got hit by it early game, it meant that you knew you could fight him. Now... Warwick runs in at 600 movespeed from fog of war, slaps you, Q's, slaps you again, slaps you a third time because you're now below 20% health and he gets tripled attack speed, and you die. Or maybe you don't, in which case he fears you and slaps you some more.","replies":[{"poster":"statelesskiller","date":"2017-06-04T17:01:29.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats also pretty dirty is that bork and spell blade procs get converted to magic damage. thats alot of fucking magic damage that early on","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-06-04T19:19:59.419+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nogankaIIpIank,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pl9KmVXA,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-04T17:01:29.764+0000)\n>\n> whats also pretty dirty is that bork and spell blade procs get converted to magic damage. thats alot of fucking magic damage that early on\n\nWell, I don't think he'd have Sheen or Bork that early on, either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlackBattler","date":"2017-06-04T12:49:51.149+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Press/release to bite, hold down to slide across and follow.

Let me explain.\n\n-His Q is supposed to when held let you follow target and jump behind it,when just pressed and released quickly its just bite without following but in practice its so hard to pull off without any reason but just being pain in the ass,if you keep your Q pressed before being in range with your target nothing will happen you have to start pressing Q when you get near the target range of your Q and its so clunky and feels terrible sometimes work sometimes doesent. Sometimes it follows target sometimes just bites it almost feels like it happens random at times which is terrible\n\n-His W passive works as intended but is pain in the ass and feels sooo clunky. It is giving you attack speed buff when your target is below 50% and if you are swiching target you can never get used to how it jumps from fast attacking to slow attacking its just terrible,try farming wave of minions or monsters in jungle and as soon as monster gets low he starts to attack faster and when you switch target he slows down,trust me its just feels so bad,and opposite of satisfying. The other part of his W is it can track targets that are low and gets out of combat MS,its buggy and doesent register all low targets just some and pathing is bugged sometimes ugh i cant even describe this properly\n\n-His ult,oh well it would be good to use if its hitbox wasnt thin like a needle.
