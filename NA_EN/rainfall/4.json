I play Ziggs and I'm fucking tired of seeing that wall cock block my combos with minimum effort. Even though I usually win against them it's still fucking lame to wait for your jungler to lock him down or for his annoying ass wall to be down for like 10 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-06-05T20:49:43.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"His wall has a 24 second CD to start and Yasuo never builds significant CDR. His kit is made to excel against skillshot-reliant champs, but that doesn't mean there aren't Windows of vulnerability for you to exploit.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawckey","date":"2017-06-06T05:02:10.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have cooldowns too, when I waste my shit trying to hit him and he blocks it, you may as well erase a good 10 seconds off his wall's cd. The only thing I can do is just fucking farm the whole early game and roam bot if I can. And again, I'm not gonna change the champs I like to play just cause I have to face a fuckin yasuo","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-06-05T20:06:42.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's popular.\nHe's annoying to play against.\nBut he's decently balanced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2017-06-05T18:23:58.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As you said, a lot of people enjoy playing yasuo.
