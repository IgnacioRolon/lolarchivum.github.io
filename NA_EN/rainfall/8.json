Hell, even {{item:3060}} is better on most tanks now since you dont need to be near it to get worth from the active.\n\n{{item:3194}} stats are way to low, and its barely even worth getting against someone like \n{{champion:63}} {{champion:17}} with full DOT.  \n\nThe tank rework didnt help tanks at all itemwise.  Also, {{item:3143}} will always be a must pickup on tanks as long as it is the only item with a \"reduce crit damage\" passive, given how crit works in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2017-05-29T00:04:56.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} is a lot of harass.... so the extra sustain from {{item:3065}} might be almost just as good (since it also increase health regen and potions and such)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nickssaa","date":"2017-05-27T18:34:50.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only purpose of {{item:3194}} is to make {{champion:268}} cry in the corner","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-05-27T20:33:28.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah.

I would say it`s far too niche. When you pick it in the right situation you basically have a stronger Tabis against most sustained magic dmg alongside the mr you are basically unkillable.
