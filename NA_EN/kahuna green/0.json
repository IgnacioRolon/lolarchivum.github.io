I have re downloaded and also disabled the game bar. Seems to be the same issue every time. It shows a stopped frame of the instant the game loads each time and doesn't move from that frame. The frame has the ping at roughly 20 ms every time and 03 - 07 frames showing in the top right. After I use the task manager to exit the frozen application, none of my other applications on my computer will work again until I restart the computer.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-25T02:44:52.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, it isn't too often I hear that League completely locks up the entire computer!
