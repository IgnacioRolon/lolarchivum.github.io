I see there's still people with this issue, and hopefully this thread can help you resolve your issue very easily. \r\n\r\n**Step 1:**\r\nRestart your computer, as it's restarting tap F2 when you see the Gateway Logo, this will enter you into your computer's BIOS Setup.\r\n\r\n**Step 2:**\r\nNavigate with your 4 arrow keys, press the right arrow key to get to the \"Exit\", or \"Save and Exit\" section.\r\nNavigate down with your arrow key to \"Restore Defaults\", or \"Load Setup Defaults\", press enter, select yes. Save the changes and exit.\r\n\r\nYour computer should now restart or finish restarting, if you had web access issues(trying to look up resolutions), or issues connecting to League of Legends, it should now be resolved. If this thread helped you please like it to help get it pinned for others to easily see, not sure how the League forum system works.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-06T15:53:36.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are some unsafe steps, and not the first I would recommend.
