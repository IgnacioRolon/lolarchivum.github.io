I opted to skip, and I immediately saw a pop-up that said something was messed up and that I should restart client. I did, and when I opened it it said that I left a game in progress and prompts me to reconnect. If I click to reconnect it says that it cannot connect to server and to retry or cancel. If I cancel my whole computer freezes and I have to restart. If I retry I have to keep retrying. No matter how many times I restart my computer/league it keeps happening. I have Mac OS X by the way","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-04T23:21:53.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heyo,\n\nCould be you're stuck in a ghost game. Pretty rare, but if that's the case, nothing you can do on your end to fix it since you've already tried to reconnect and restart the client, I think you can only wait for it to finish sadly. The game should pass and finish within the next two hours (but usually is around an hour).","replies":[{"poster":"echoelocation","date":"2016-04-05T00:53:04.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been 2 hours and league is still telling me that I'm in a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flappers","date":"2016-04-05T00:24:56.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me earlier as well, every time I try to re-log I get sent to the screen.
