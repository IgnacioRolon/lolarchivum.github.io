Most people who are either in similar elo or lower wont really listen to me but.. for all the people in bronze 4/5 or maybe even 2/3 that say they cant get out of 'elo hell' and that they need help, they need the answer to getting out of bronze.. let me tell what the answer is. \r\nPERSEVERANCE! \r\nI've been in bronze for TWO YEARS and you know what. I've realised that there's no magical answer to getting out of bronze.. the way of getting out is just learning from your mistakes and not blame everyone else because your just as responsible as them! so can i just say this for all the people who are stuck in 'elo hell' I'm in the exactly same place as you and im happy for the simple reason of im learning at my own pace and there's no point rushing because success comes after you fail time and time again. You people need to realise that maybe being in bronze is exactly where you suppose to be... That's a thought ...\r\n If you were a 'challenger smurf' as some of you say you are, then you would be in challenger playing with better players. Not with flamers, ragers, afk's...Your getting no where when you tell your team \"OMG I WENT 21/0 LAST GAME WITH YASUO SO YOU HAVE TO LET ME MID OR I'M GOING TO REPORT YOU ALL AND FEED\" and all you do is cry if you dont get your way... STOP! please stop crying and man up because your in bronze for a god damn reason.\r\n\r\nI know not everyone in bronze is like what im describing but for the people who are like this\r\n\r\nSTFU CRYING YOUR BAD GET OVER IT BECAUSE ITS A GAME!\r\n\r\nRant over.... thanks for reading XD","replies":[{"poster":"Barbwired Mind","date":"2015-03-22T23:17:25.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"You do realize you are still playing the blame game and contradicting your self, right?

If you main sup you are at the mercy of your team. Best choice with current patch is probably adc. With recent changes making tanks really popular, main damage dealers are adcs.

Even if that were supposedly true (it's not), they should be thinking less about how bad their team was and how they could have done better that game, and implement that into their future games. Nobody wants to put in the personal effort into getting good, though, they just simply want to be good at the game. \n\nSure, there are maybe some players who could survive in low Silver that find getting out of Bronze difficult because they simply can't carry their team, but that just makes getting out a matter of time rather than just forcing yourself out through fantastic play. Since they're the only consistent element in each game, they will eventually get where they belong, and then stay there unless they actively improve. \n\nOf course, that's also true for anyone who's in silver but thinks they should be gold, in gold but thinks they should be plat, etc. If you want to get higher, then you will simply have to play better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YossarianSensei","date":"2015-03-23T00:11:08.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real secret to solo queue is realizing your team will suck dick regardless of ELO.
