I have always had pretty decent ping when playing LoL, generally 70-80. But when I updated my computer to Windows 7 I've seen a ridiculous rise in my ping. From 70-80 to pretty much always having 400 or higher. I have updated completely for Windows 7, went on multiple internet testing sites and they said my internet was fine. I don't know what to do as I can't play LoL pretty much now, if you can help me in any way it would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T04:52:30.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you [**reconfigure your network settings for League**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) after completing this upgrade to Windows 7?
