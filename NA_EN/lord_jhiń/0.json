I received my 1st chat restriction for being toxic, I fully understand that even having an argument with the players is toxic. I took my 10-game chat restriction and reformed and dealt with it. But this time, it doesn't make sense, I haven't offended a SINGLE PLAYER this entire game and I was given a 25-game chat restriction for saying I'm going to report a inting Yasuo that autolocked mid even after I called it and to make it worse, he had everyone on the team conspire with him to grief the game and everyone go midlane, and you will see that the enemy team wants to report me \"Twisted Fate\" because I'm playing the game correctly by going to a different lane. Which leads me to this point know where I am simply leveling up my account and I'm about to hit level 30 so I can play ranked with my favorite champion in the game, but I find it hard to play League of Legends with such a toxic community and toxic bot punishment system. The way I see it is if multiple people report you, you're going to take an offense regardless of what you do and I believe this is very unfair! I will let you read the chat for yourself and see if I've done anything toxic. I've also added a link so everyone can see exactly how the game took place. This is still allowed to be toxic on league of legends with no punishment, while I'm giving a offense for \"no respect on the rift\" What? Also, when I say \"TF\" I mean Twisted Fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nLord Jhiń: mid\r\nLord Jhiń: mid\r\nLord Jhiń: im mid\r\nLord Jhiń: Magnus is big joined the lobby\r\nValyrianRunes joined the lobby\r\nNigreo joined the lobby\r\ngay boy clique joined the lobby\r\nLord Jhiń joined the lobby\r\nLord Jhiń:  mid\r\nNigreo\r\n76ER\r\n:  tpo\r\nLord Jhiń:  mid\r\nNigr\r\nLord Jhiń: said it twice before you even joined\r\nLord Jhiń: lmao\r\nLord Jhiń: really\r\nLord Jhiń: you're banned\r\nLord Jhiń: thats what it is\r\nLord Jhiń: enjoy your report\r\nLord Jhiń: reporting me\r\nLord Jhiń: for calling my lane\r\nLord Jhiń: funny\r\nLord Jhiń: enjoy ban\r\nLord Jhiń: ^^\r\nIn-Game\r\nLord Jhiń: .\r\nLord Jhiń: imagine calling mid lane\r\nLord Jhiń: then yasuo trolls and insta loks mid\r\nLord Jhiń: then whole team joins him\r\nLord Jhiń: rammus is duo\r\nLord Jhiń: with yas\r\nLord Jhiń: btw\r\nLord Jhiń: they're trolls\r\nLord Jhiń: just gonna report and enjoy a good game! ^^\r\nLord Jhiń: thanks tf\r\nLord Jhiń: riot will see the chat\r\nLord Jhiń: idc what you have to say\r\nLord Jhiń: Enjoy your laughs ^^\r\nLord Jhiń: thanks teemo\r\nLord Jhiń: swain\r\nLord Jhiń: fun fact\r\nLord Jhiń: teemo was in that bush\r\nLord Jhiń: just want to show you\r\nLord Jhiń: how toxic\r\nLord Jhiń: they're\r\nLord Jhiń: come on tf\r\nLord Jhiń: im playing the game bro\r\nLord Jhiń: lmao\r\nLord Jhiń: like i said\r\nLord Jhiń: lmao\r\nLord Jhiń: i just  cant wait\r\nLord Jhiń: for the reports\r\nLord Jhiń: im about to give\r\nLord Jhiń: thank you ezreal\r\nLord Jhiń: thank you\r\nLord Jhiń: so annoying\r\nLord Jhiń: tf\r\nLord Jhiń: so in that case\r\nLord Jhiń: you greifing the game\r\nLord Jhiń: and conspiring with trolls\r\nLord Jhiń: is an even bigger offense\r\nLord Jhiń: but okay\r\nLord Jhiń: rammus told you what happened and you still dont believe it\r\nLord Jhiń: yasuo is duo with teemo\r\nLord Jhiń: wp lee\r\nLord Jhiń: hope you're happy of what you've done rammus\r\nLord Jhiń: lmao\r\nLord Jhiń: only one getting a honor this game is ahri\r\nLord Jhiń: thank you for being a great summoner ahri\r\nLord Jhiń: thank you\r\nLord Jhiń: so\r\nLord Jhiń: twisted fate\r\nLord Jhiń: you saw that\r\nLord Jhiń: yeah\r\nLord Jhiń: lmao\r\nLord Jhiń: okay\r\nLord Jhiń: damn ahri\r\nLord Jhiń: how much did it hit for\r\nLord Jhiń: tahm\r\nLord Jhiń: im not gonna cap\r\nLord Jhiń: you have hard carried that team\r\nLord Jhiń: from the bottom\r\nLord Jhiń: that elder dragon dmg stacked with your abilities goes crazy swain\r\nLord Jhiń: thank god this nightmare is finally over\r\nLord Jhiń: lmao\r\nPost-Game\r\nLord Jhiń: reported\r\nLord Jhiń: that felt good\r\nLord Jhiń: gg","replies":[{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2019-06-19T18:08:50.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">League Of Legends Punishment System NEEDS A CHANGE! \n\n\nWell...what kind of change ? \ntell me.{{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Jhiń","date":"2019-06-19T18:11:08.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I know that there's more players than moderators but I believe instead of bots I really feel like for TEXT reports it should be more validated like actually run thru a human instead of an automated system because players are punished unfairly.

Riot doesn't have enough people, time, or money to do this. Whatever number you're thinking of right now for the number of reports and/or people required, multiply that by 100,000.\n\nYou also need to understand that back when there was peer review (the Tribunal), we who participated **overwhelmingly** voted to punish. We didn't let negativity and horseshit slide just because someone else started it. **You** contributed to derailing the game as well.\n\nYou are much better off getting judged by a system that doesn't have biases. If I was reviewing these cases, I view the people who continue an argument worse than the person who started it.

League is a game, not real life. Anything you do in a match will have no real impact on your wellbeing. Because of that fact, arguing and insulting each other is quite pointless, as well as distracting. This actually corresponds to what most adults learn during the course of life. More often than not, it's better to leave assholes alone and not interact with them, when they start their rants.\n\nRiot, even if they do screw up massively in various situations, actually cares about player retention, and controlling chat is one way of doing that.
