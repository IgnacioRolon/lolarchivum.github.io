It was not because of my computer since the mouse was moving perfectly  (or at least that&#039;s what I think). Because of the anti-leave blocks it blocked my PC (I mean the pop-up that blocks you from alt+f4 and clontrol pannel).\nI was playing Miss Fortune if that helps somehow.\nUpdate: I just played a game and asked players if they knew about it and one responed that I should Turn of sounds, and it worked\nUpdate 2: Other summones have been typing in chat on butcher's bridge that they have really low FPS, but I don't know If they could turn the sounds down because when I played I could barrely open the menu and then I couldn't close it.
