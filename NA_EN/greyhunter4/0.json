PING PING PING PING.  Let me mute that specific players pings.  They are annoying and make me toxic.  This is on ARAM too where there is such a small amount of useful information that can be given by pings.  Oh leaving base, PINGING ON MY WAY, PING PING PING.  Uck.\r\n\r\nThey're usually dead half the time too giving them more time to try and backseat game by pinging your every move.  I'll listen to the pings from players that actually give good tactical advice, not the spammers clouding up my speakers.","replies":[]}
