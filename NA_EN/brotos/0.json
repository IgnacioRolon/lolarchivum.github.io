I was in the loading screen, waiting for another player to load as I already had hit 100%.\r\nIt was stuck there for about 5-10 minutes before I decided to alt+tab to do something else while I waited.\r\n\r\nOnly when I did this, did LoL state that I had been disconnected. I had been disconnected without my knowledge this whole time. The game had started without me and I was extremely behind.\r\n\r\nI am uncertain what you did with your last few patches, but you are breaking a significant amount of things.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-03-27T21:11:47.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Brotos!\n\nIt is usually very uncommon to have an issue where the Loading Screen simply sits at 100%, while the game starts playing normally.  I would be really interested in figuring out how this happened, so we can prevent it in the future.  To that end, can you find the R3d log (game logs) of this particular game and reply back and attach it?

Last night I was at 100%, a teammates avatar hadn't even loaded, and 2 enemies were stuck around 50%. After a while I killed the game and reconnected. I got in but disconnected within seconds, tried for ~15 minutes. Got the dumb warning about leaving when I logged on today. First game, froze during load. I actually got into the game but I was already 3 levels behind. An enemy had the same issue and got in much later.","replies":[]}]}
