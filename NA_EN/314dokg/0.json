But his Q, i mean, He&#039;s already really strong with the Passive + R combo. he can give full stacks with his passive to the enemy with one auto attack or a hit from his Q.\r\n\r\nThe only thing i find unfair is that his sustain is over the charts. Especially when you build him a HP Tank Bruiser kind of champ. like if Darius hit like 3 enemies with his Q, his heal is insane. Plus his Q has a decent short cooldown, so that he could spam it until he goes back to full health esp in team fights.... so here&#039;s an idea to make it more fairer...\r\n\r\nIf you remember Fiora&#039;s old passive, where she auto attacks she gain HP regen... so i was thinking instead of\r\n\r\nQ - Darius is healed 10% of his missing HP for each enemy he strike (max 30%)\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nQ - Darius gains 100%/125%/150%/175%/200% bonus HP Regen for 1/1/2/3/4 seconds for each enemy hit (max 3 enemies) and Grievous wounds will be 50% less effective on Darius during the duration of his HP Regen.\r\n\r\nFor me i find this Change more fairer, still keeping Darius a good sustain in lane, and still a good fighter.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-31T07:42:48.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't take this thread seriously after seeing 'Morde support playstyle'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pupel","date":"2015-10-31T06:53:25.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was talking more like your tanks need to make sure Darius isent allowed to run into the middle of your team and if he tries to run at you you peel him so you can only Q 1 or 2 people if he gets more than that he deserves to be rewarded. Like you wouldnt all in dive a Himer while he had 3 turrets around him and his ult up and then call him OP when he kills 3 of you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pupel","date":"2015-10-31T06:26:51.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think thats kinda the point Darius get a big reward for being able to position in the middle of your team its your job to make sure he doesn't get that opportunity which seems fair to me","replies":[{"poster":"314dokg","date":"2015-10-31T06:37:31.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he's already strong in early game, strong damage in his Q plus a flat heal, which is for me too much... During Team fights, my suggestion of his Q change is like giving him a Voli passive continuously. it's like trying to deal more damage than his heal kind of game.","replies":[]}]}]}
