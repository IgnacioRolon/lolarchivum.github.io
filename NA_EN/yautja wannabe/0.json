And if they didn't get the kill, then you've already hurt their ability to affect the game. \n> \n> On all the Diamond videos I've watched, on how to be a better jungler, one of the core things has been paying attention to the enemy jungler's clear routes, and position on the map because he's your rival, your lane opponent without a lane. The same way laners manipulate the waves to deny CS and exp, you should be doing the same with the enemy jungler. You don't deserve just to have a nice safe place to afk farm so you can eventually emerge out the jungle to win the game, while effectively ignoring everyone else. \n> \n> League is not a PvE game, if you want to power farm, you need to start invading, and actively punishing the enemy jungler for wanting to gank lanes. This is how you stay relevant in levels to laners. I know, because this is what I've been doing differently. It doesn't even need to be that much, a chicken camp, gromp, or depending on the jungler, you can steal their opposite buff while they're still clearing theirs or Scuttle (might want to ask teammates to ward your own though.)\n> \n> Effectively, all that is just a long complicated way of saying 'git gud', but I think that folk like you have the wrong impression about the jungle. It's not a place to just farm gold and exp, the enemy's jungle is as much your playground as your own is. Win the game, by denying your enemy jungler the gold and exp they need, while keeping yourself ahead of them.\n\n\"Look at me i'm so good y'all suck.
