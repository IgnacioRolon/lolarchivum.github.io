For example, during the first section of patching, you're primarily scanning files in your League directory so the patcher knows where to put new files or if you have any corrupt/missing files. I recommend just letting the patcher process run for a while on its own.\n\nIf you run into any errors during patching, let me know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Compressed","date":"2017-02-14T22:56:58.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***UPDATE*** it's now at 96kb/s.
