And if you select beginner it will force you to play against bots and show you what the QWER keys do.\n\n Also, I assume there is a form of normal elo which would pit you against other people of the same level of skill... which would defeat the purpose of creating a new account.  But for the most part you would be stomping someone who has never played the game before.  Which is just cruel.\n\nSo I would say the only reason to smurf would be to re-level an account after being banned, creating a new account for ranked, or learning to play a champ your HORRIBLE with.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-23T18:58:00.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even though I may not agree with you\nI just want to thank you for giving your opinion","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BRBGTGBOWFLEX","date":"2014-12-23T18:49:32.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, smurfing does help, but you have to actually be good enough to learn from it.\n\nWhat smurfing teaches you is how to carry a game. Anyone in a game full of less skilled players can do well in lane, but that doesn't always translate to a win. The reason to smurf is to learn how to translate a winning lane into a winning game. Or, how to make your own individual play that is better than everyone else, make the game a winning game.\n\nThis can actually be very hard to do. I had a game on my Riven smurf account where I went 45-9-3 (our team had 49 kills total). The other team had 54 kills total and was winning every lane but my lane. So, in order to win that game, I needed to carry each laner and put them in a position to knock down turrets. It was insanely hard, because every one of my teammates was not going to be useful, all were 1-10 or worse, and carrying the game took a lot of work (basically, the only way my team could win a lane is if their opponent was dead or not there). \n\nSo, I basically went around eliminating any possibility for the other team to fight mine, by killing all of them. Usually it was just killing two or so at a time, but I did get a 1v5 Penta, but noticed around that time, that I was falling off and needed to end fast or I wouldn't be able to carry the game.\n\nAnyways, yes, smurfing helps teach how to carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Seth Lightheart","date":"2014-12-23T19:10:41.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No... The situation you are \"practicing\" for is something that will never happen in a ranked game or otherwise.  The skill level gap you are talking about is much to extreme. True everyone has had a feeder or two on their team but that was because they were having a bad game.  The people who you are teamed with AND against are people who don't even know their champions combos or positioning.\n\nYou are just beating up on people who don't know how to play the game, nothing more in that scenario.\n\nEdit: What you are merely saying is cognitive dissonance.  Where you know what you are doing is wrong, but are trying to rationalize it as practice.","replies":[{"poster":"A Tall Joke","date":"2014-12-23T21:12:58.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Though I personally don't think Smurfing really helps you, this is just wrong. Here are several very realistic situations in Gold+ you could face that mirror those situations:\n\n1) Other lane(s) are failing and you have to compensate (gank? Stall and bring pressure to your lane so they can farm?)\n2) Team isn't very well coordinated and you have to guide them through plays (push mid turret quick and move down to bot)\n3) You're fed and you need to translate that to a win. What do you do? Ganking, pushing, shifting pressure...\n4) Encouraging discouraged teammates\n5) How do you compensate for a skillgap between you and your teammates? Sure the skill gap may be smaller but even in Gold, I can meet people who are having a bad day or rough game and the negative mentality ends up making them play very poorly. Which introduces two very important questions: how can I encourage them and raise their level of play? How can I put them in a position to do better after their rough start?\n\nThese are the sort of things, not my own individual skill, that have really carried me through ranked games. I mean, sure, I have games where I snowball and start taking charge but I don't play play-makers. I main Veigar. I support frequently. I'm rarely in a position to single hanedly kill 2-3 people or make game-changing plays or take turrets. So, instead, I have to make my play revolve around my team. Which often times means dealing with a team that's doing poorly and translating that to a win.\n\n\nThat said, I still think it's probably better to practice all of that with players on your own level but the idea that it's just a rationalization is wrong. Also, I don't think he \"knows\" what he's doing is wrong so the cognitive dissonance thing is pretty moot.","replies":[{"poster":"Seth Lightheart","date":"2014-12-23T21:34:49.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm sorry, but you can't say that.  You are practicing with people who are just leaning, and you will never play in that environment in ranked.  Learn to carry in a normal game.  I can jump into a level 1 match, play AD TF and do the same thing, that won't make me better, it will just make me an A-hole. And cause a bunch of newbies to think AD TF is viable.\n\nIt is like saying if I am a mid to low level soccer player, change my name, and join a peewee soccer team it will teach me to be a better player.  No, putting in my hours and learning the game will.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-23T18:53:40.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you this was very helpful I thank you for taking all this time to rite all of this down\nthis was very helpful I thank you again","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-12-23T18:34:57.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-23T18:36:40.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do you mean, no?","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Clueless PhD","date":"2014-12-23T18:38:37.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He means no.

People don't make smurfs to learn. They make smurfs when they're frustrated with Ranked and want to feel better about themselves. These players are still really bad, or they wouldn't be doing it. There are smurfs made for other reasons, but they are few and far between. Most smurfs are simply a way for someone without the skill to climb in Ranked to feel better about themselves by beating up low-level players.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let's say that you were playing against legitimately good players who were smurfing. Say it's somebody your level or better. What have you gained by smurfing? You're playing against someone you probably could anyway normally... just without all Runes, Masteries and Summoners.
