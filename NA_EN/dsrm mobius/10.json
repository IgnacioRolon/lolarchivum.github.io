I think this would be an amazing little change that would help a lot of Zed players. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2016-02-29T16:46:10.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It already exists. You have a little arrow pointing to your shadow, I believe when it turns red, you've left range.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2016-02-29T16:58:01.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, but for better clarity I think a ring around the shadow would be much better.\nThank you for your comment. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2016-02-29T17:07:09.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just go in a custom match and test it's borders, than you'll have a good idea of it's radius","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2016-02-29T17:10:39.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a pretty good idea of his W's radius its just when I'm in the middle of teamfight I usually don't quite remember the range of my shadow, so I still think a ring would add a lot of clarity.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
