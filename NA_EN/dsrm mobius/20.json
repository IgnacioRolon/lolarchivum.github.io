I'm totally happy with this, since it shows their commitment to doing a good job technically without making a bunch of unneeded release pressures due to marketing. (I'm a software developer, so my bias may be showing here)\n\nRight now on PBE, they have separate test schedules for preseason changes and for SRU. This tells me that they don't want to tie together the projects and their release, reserving the ability to release one of them first. However, they don't test preseason changes on old SR, only SRU, so this seems to show that they are planning to have preseason only on SRU. This could mean that maaaaaybe SRU will be ready before preseason changes go in.\n\nI believe there are still some issues with feature-completeness on SRU, such as some ambient details (little animals and stuff), and some of the far background textures on bottom right of the map or some such. They can't release until it's done...but my random guess is that they'll release some time in the neighbourhood of early December. We clearly won't hear about it until maybe a week before it actually happens though.","replies":[]}]}
