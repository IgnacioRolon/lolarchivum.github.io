On top of that, mana regen items were nerfed. So basically you get wayyyyyyyyyyyyy less regen now if you are used to building grail first(even moreso than other champs by a lot), but the same if you just rush dfg.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2015-01-06T18:57:16.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that seems right, I just don't feel viegars passive working at all it seems like I get no mana regen \nI hope rito buffs his mana regen or something","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kiritotas","date":"2015-01-19T21:07:16.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see veigars kit twiked to show that he is a master of magic\nthat includes changing his passive to like soccer's stone where it ranks up with his current ap bonus and maybe even gives his skills different effects\nI mean would a true master only have 4 moves in his kit \nno\nthis is were i propose that certain combinations of his kit make his skills different \nsay his q going through the prison walls would make his q travel longer or split shot. and his w with an immediate q would make a line of comets not just one or w in prison would hit the vertexes of the prison while also hitting the middle. \nI think veigar should get a rework to show his mastery of magic and not be a AP addict that focuses on burst damage only.","replies":[{"poster":"Mazianos","date":"2015-01-27T20:55:49.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kiritotas,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G6LMfoNQ,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-19T21:07:16.462+0000)\n>\n> I would like to see veigars kit twiked to show that he is a master of magic\n> that includes changing his passive to like soccer's stone where it ranks up with his current ap bonus and maybe even gives his skills different effects\n> I mean would a true master only have 4 moves in his kit \n> no\n> this is were i propose that certain combinations of his kit make his skills different \n> say his q going through the prison walls would make his q travel longer or split shot. and his w with an immediate q would make a line of comets not just one or w in prison would hit the vertexes of the prison while also hitting the middle. \n> I think veigar should get a rework to show his mastery of magic and not be a AP addict that focuses on burst damage only.\n\n{{champion:11}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5thYL","date":"2015-01-19T21:08:02.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try the chalice on Veigar, it's infinite mana~(15/s when you are low)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-01-10T16:42:29.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still works and still buffs mana regeneration from items as well I believe. When you increase your mana regeneration to 125%, his passive should increase it to 250%. 150% to 300% and 175% to 350%. Also, I have played Veigar since the changes and it definitely works although I wish his base mana regeneration was higher to help work with his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AuctionedDonkey","date":"2015-01-10T16:29:54.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should just change his passive altogether... Honestly, his passive is mana regen and his ability costs are some of the highest that I know of.... They should just lower his mana costs and give him an actually useful passive. Maybe increase his mana regen a little after, because early his poking consists of combos so he would need some mana regen.","replies":[]}]}
