Voidlings are not a once every 5 minutes buff that grant great rewards; they are extremely transient squishy beasts. In addition, a timer still wouldn't be helpful there, since they also have hp (I suppose you could do the Shaco box thing, but that would add a LOT of visual clutter for a pet that is almost entirely ignored except on AD malzahar).","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-29T03:47:29.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey I love AD malz","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-29T03:46:32.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just so you guys know\nif you guys see misspelled words please don't get mad I had to write this fast so I could go to work","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-29T03:34:24.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just so know this is just an illustration \nthe teamfight I depicted has some things wrong with it","replies":[]}]}
