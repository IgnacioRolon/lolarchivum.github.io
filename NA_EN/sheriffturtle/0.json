I loaded in at around 2 minutes even though I had been at 100% for at least 45 seconds, then at around 3:10 the game crashed with no bugsplat error message, and it was not related to my internet. So I tried to reconnect, and immediately the game crashed again with no bugsplat. I attempted to reconnect 2 more times with the same result, although on those 2 tries I was able to get some percentage on my connection. I crashed a total of 4 times. I just want to know if this is a problem with my computer or a problem with the client that needs to be repaired or what, because I most likely got a low priority queue because of this which I am not very happy about. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T02:31:50.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random crashes can be caused be a number of different factors.
