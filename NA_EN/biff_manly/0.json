You bring it to live, and you actually get a good representation of how good or bad something is.\n\nAlso, the last time Riot listened to feedback on the PBE to balance a champion, that champion was reworked into (arguably) the most broken champion ever to appear in League of Legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WadeWilson1337","date":"2016-02-17T08:00:01.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"PBE is honestly just bug testing. It takes OVERWHELMING amounts of community response to make Riot change things (like where they were going to absolutely gut skarner even though he was already medicore at best, absolutely nonexistant in masters+), and then they still nerfed him quite hard. They did tone down Xins number slightly, but honestly, even if its a tap on the hammer Riot will give themselves a pat on the back thinking they listened to the community. Lets be 100% real here, Riot WANTS champions to be op, it sells skin. Remember Patch 5.22-5.24 or the Era of Miss Fortune? The #1 skin the ENTIRE TIME from what i saw was Arcade Miss Fortune, a 1350 rp skin. And i think 2 waves of skins came out in that time. It was absolutely insane.\nEdit: TLDR OP = $$$$$","replies":[]}]}
