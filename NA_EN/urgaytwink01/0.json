This hasn't happened before... so then I thought my computer may just need an update, which I did, and still no luck. I saw the update for the client and stats for 1/11/17 but I don't think it should effect todays game play. Is anyone else receiving any issues like this. It also happens in between champ select to the loading screen.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T02:57:57.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find a record of issues from our side within the last 24 hours on NA.
