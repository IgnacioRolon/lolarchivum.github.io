If I push that skip stats button, the client just closes down. Sometimes the client never comes back and simply crashes after the game. It doesn't affect the game at all but it's annoying to constantly re-login after every game and I like to see my stats after the game. \r\n\r\nI am using a mac and I have never had this happen until the last few days.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T23:41:36.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be having a network issue that's having trouble leaving the game server and returning to the client properly.
