The problem is that I got a 5 minute low priority queue and now every time I try to startup my queue it stops either in the low priority queue randomly or it stops exactly on 5:01. I really require Riot's assistance here, because I can't find anything similar to this on the internet. :) &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"charles magic","date":"2017-09-21T17:35:29.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This happened on my alternate account, i was a yas main on that account and had even spent money on skins and whatnot. I DCd in one game then reconnected immediately, and we won. Then i got a leaver buster.. Every time it would have 1 second left, it would stop. Riot never helped me fix it and I havent been on that account in like a year lol. Last time I logged on to see if they fixed it but it still has the unbeatable leaver buster. My guess is that since they wouldnt help resolve the issue, it was some form of \"permanent ban\" or something. What other reason could there be for not helping someone play who might buy more skins?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T16:28:15.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's really strange!  My first instinct here is a potentially unstable connection that's causing you to desync from the matchmaking service.  Try out the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if that helps stabilize things ab it.","replies":[]}]}
