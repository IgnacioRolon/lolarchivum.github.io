So I played league yesterday on that account and today, as I'm trying to log in, it says the \"Username or password is incorrect. Please try logging in again. If you have forgotten your password click here\". So I try to get on my account using the website, because I have my passwords saved onto this computer, so if I put in my username, it'll automatically enter the correct password (this was working yesterday, too). I try it, and it says the same thing as it said on the client. So now I've lost my account and I don't know how or why it's like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-07T23:16:58.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm it doesn't look like there are any signs of hackers or anything like that, but I'd be wary of using a program that automatically inputs your password for you. That sounds like it runs a pretty high risk of being malware, and it's best to stay safe. I think you might have been in a live chat with one of our tech guys earlier (heard a similar conversation over there) so hopefully, this was figured out already!\n\nIf not, hit up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to help you get that reset.","replies":[{"poster":"788irtegb54hi","date":"2018-01-08T23:48:28.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one has responded to any of my tickets yet and my account is still locked.
