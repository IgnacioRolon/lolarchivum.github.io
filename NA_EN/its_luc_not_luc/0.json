Please Help.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got past the setup phase and declined playing on the new client for another reason I'll get to momentarily. The launcher will then pop up like it's supposed to, but it completely skips installing the game. The launch button will come up and I'll click it then the two terms &amp; conditions pages will appear and I'll accept those the the launch button just stays grayed out for a minute, then it pops up again then I'll click it and it repeats. This is on the old client. On the new client I'll open it up as admin then the giant loading spinning circle of perpetual hypnotism will perpetually hypnotize me. I've deleted every single league of legends file off of my computer and uninstalled and reinstalled so many times and tried so many things but nothing is working.  D:\nI have a video of it not working but it's not on Youtube and I don't plan on uploading it. It's basically just showing what I said though.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T00:40:44.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've installed just fine, it just sounds like you're having issues going from the patcher to the login screen.
