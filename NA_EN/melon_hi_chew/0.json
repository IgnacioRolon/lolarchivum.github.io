And when I do somehow connect, it's only for a second before it bugsplats again. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice. I've run the client as admin. I've tried the repair option so many times already. The best part is that it was working perfectly fine yesterday. I've dodged 2 games today and got an afk/leaver warning for this, which is great! Because it was my fault haha :) In those games I \"left\", everyone on my team (and the enemy team) saw I was trying to reconnect the entirety of the game. Received a \"lower priority queue\" for 5 games for this when I logged back in a few hours later. \r\n\r\nSubmitted a ticket a bit ago, but thought I'd shoot my shot here to see if anyone had a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T01:01:10.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could provide you a basic troubleshooting guide like the [Bugsplat](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) one, but since you've already submitted a ticket, I would recommend against making any changes until a tech specialist hits you back on your ticket. This will ensure the information in the logs you provided will be the most up to date for the tech. Either that, or you can update your ticket with new logs if the steps in the guide don't work. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
