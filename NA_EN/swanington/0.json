However, it's still a prevalent as ever. \r\nAnyone else experience this? Any ideas what could be causing it?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Shutori","date":"2017-10-13T18:32:46.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T02:00:22.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you able to see the client whatsoever after the game itself closes out?
