I can also practice all the inputs. \r\n\r\n I'm thinking of clicking Play, then Create Custom, and Summoner's Rift. But I don't see the option for adding bots. After I click Confirm, will there be an option for adding bots? I don't want to start a PvP game by accident. I'm pretty darn green. haha\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-03-07T01:14:18.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey HaevenPsye,\n\nDıana Main's correct, once you're in the Custom Game Lobby, there's an \"Add Bot\" button that allows you to add any number of bots and adjust their difficulty. Note that depending on server load, sometime you may get a message that states that you need more players in the game before the Custom Game starts.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/heunyAt.png[]","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChrisBrownze","date":"2019-03-06T02:51:22.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you 65 or over with a good driving record?","replies":[{"poster":"HaevenPsye","date":"2019-03-19T23:36:35.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a good driving record. :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HaevenPsye","date":"2019-03-19T23:36:09.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, Diana Main and Son Golin for your help.
