You have more funds and better equipment and supposedly access to the best artists out there. And it took a random deviant artist to turn your snow day abomination into something so perfect I couldn&#039;t even imagine a more perfect melding of the new irelia and original frostblade skin. \n\nPlease for the love of god hire this guy and make this happen. I don&#039;t care if you have to make it a new skin and call it project or something.

Summoner's Rift has a lot of colors, and Riot has to consider those as well and how visible the skin and its particles will be when ingame.\n\nneither red/green or blue/yellow colourblindness affect one's ability to see blue. The skin is bulk blue. Even if it wasn't there's inking. There's really no way it would be hard for anyone to see. Also the addition of extra colours never makes colourblindness worse. It's the lack of contrast between either red and green in the common case or red and yellow in the rare case that makes it hard to see. Basically the common complaint is that something green or red becomes hard to see, not blue. \n\nJust to prove a point here's the image in two colourblindness simulators. Sorry about the cropping, the thing was a pain but you can see enough of the images to see there's really no issues.\n\nR/G (common)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OP9jn\n\nB/Y (rare)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/VLkbS\n\nNeither skin is going to cause huge issues, because neither is prominently yellow or red, which are the worst colours for y/b and r/g colourblindness respectively. The added yellow can really only help TBH. It's just extra contrast. If the blue is for some reason an issue for someone (I've never heard of this) then it's logical to assume the yellow trims on the edit would make it clearer for that person while the Riot skin doesn't have anything to help with this other than her face maybe.\n\n>You paid for Frostblade, but what you want is Championship/Victorious Newrelia, if the gold/brass accents edit are any indication.\n\nhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/leaguesales/images/imgs/000/000/477/original/frostblade-irelia-02.png?1466085086\n\nThis is what I paid for, if you don't think the gold brass edit looks more like that than any of the others then I think you're delusional.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Purejoyce","date":"2018-03-26T15:13:22.956+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SithesisLord,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HqlzY80E,comment-id=000100000000000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-26T11:48:01.078+0000)\n>\n> The edit turned it into Championship Irelia, and didn´t make it closer to the old Frostblade in any way.\n\nDid you ACTUALLY see the original frostblade skin?

What matters is the **style of the skin they already paid for**. The fact that you (and apparently some other people) don't understand that and keep using the skin name as an argument is just f*cking mindblowing to me, it was never about the name.

The excessive number of flairs and wings on the skin are more reminiscent of a Demacian warrior and less of an Frostborne blade dancer.\n\nAlso, it’s important to keep in mind that while the chatacter’s base lore changing to now specifically fighting with her pisonic blades and what technically constitutes “dance”, it’s not unreasonable to assume that certain flairs on certain skins might change also. I happen to really enjoy the old Frostblade Irelia, but their character archetypes are different. Old Irelia was just a warrior that swung her swords with her mind, and nothing more. New Irelia’s personal story is all the more richer, and new skins should somewhat reflect that.\n\nMy last main point to bring out is connected with the first. Frostblade Irelia had a definite high-tech feel to it with the lights on her combat suit. This skin doesn’t really bring any of that into the equation. It is also entirely possible (conjecture here) that Riot may have intended for this skin to more closely reflect the original but felt that Infiltrator and Nightblade(?) too closely overlapped that “high-tech” skin concept.\n\nA slight sidepoint is that the blades took up a lot of design capital in the old skin, while Irelia’s suit itself was fairly simple. The new design doesn’t have that, which means that more capital has to be spent on the suit itself, which may have caused all of this to begin with.\n\nMake of it what you will. Not trying to trash anyone, just putting my thought out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prestige Eve","date":"2018-03-26T02:13:12.073+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh look, it's The Wolf King, the same mode KNOWN for shooting down almost everything that discredits riot in even the slightest way.
