And this is the country that Blizzard is trying woo with flowers and candy. \n\nNo amount of chinese dollars can fill the empty pit in your soul Blizzard. If you had any decency left you would stop production on your game until censorship like this was lifted. Or better yet go back to making games for the people that built you and actually give a shit about your games. No one wants your battery sucking gatcha game.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KDJumub.jpg[/img]","replies":[]}
