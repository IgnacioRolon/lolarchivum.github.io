If Rito unbans ONE OF (quit trying to deflect from the main point.) the most toxic players of all time. Than that would open the floodgates and give ammunition for every single banned player out there. \n\nEvery time someone comes on here complaining that they got banned because of XY or Z they would be able to point out that someone who did much worse things than them got unbanned and they should be allowed to play again too.\n\nLaw and order would break down and it would be the wild west, if you want to let the rats back on the boat than be my guest.
