Going to their official forum is surreal. 99% of the posts are bashing the game and they all have tons of upvotes. Even when riot or blizzard makes a boneheaded move you always see plenty of lapdogs who just can&#039;t handle any sort of criticism but except for their reddit page it is almost universally panned. \r\n\r\nAs a pc only player I never got into D1 and a lot of the early criticism was that it was too much like the first game and people wanted something new. I thought I wouldn&#039;t have a problem with that since it was all going to be new for me but I only lasted shortly under a week before I lost all interest. I didn&#039;t even finish the main campaign, everything just felt so samey and done a thousand times before and better in other games. \r\n\r\nThe story was non existent, the bad guy was just some vague menace somewhere out there that I am told you finish off in a weak fight a few more hours into the game. None of the npc&#039;s stood out to me except for cayde 6 and that&#039;s pretty much because of his voice actor. From what I hear all the guns are exactly the same and the balance felt way off. I was just cruising along like normal even taking breaks to do some public events from time to time and suddenly I am sent to a new planet for the main story where I am being one shot by every single mob. But the ai is so bad I was still able to get through it because they were laughably easy to out maneuver or trick into stupid attack patterns. \r\n\r\nThe pace of the game never changed, meet someone in town, told to go to x place, get there and detect something, follow the arrow, the music changes and bad guys start spawning. Kill the bad guys for a few minutes, bad guys stop spawning, walk along a corridor until the music changes again, rinse and repeat until one of the spawns has a bad guy with a bigger health bar. Shoot it a million times and maybe get a gun with a higher number than your last one.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure this came as no surprise to D1 players but I can&#039;t believe that this is all there is to the game. Yes I know there is a raid and other shit and vaunted pvp but the core game is so hollow that I have very little incentive to push for those things.\r\n\r\nOh and the two steaming turds on top of those things is that this is the least social online multiplayer game I have ever seen, I don&#039;t think I saw another player ever say a word the entire time even when I was surrounded by other players, hell I don&#039;t know if it is even possible to communicate with others. And the game literally came out a few weeks ago for pc and there is already forced dlc coming out next month? I paid 60 fucking dollars for this shit and now I have to pay 20+ more after little over a month? That was the straw that broke the camels back for me and I uninstalled a few days ago and have no intention of coming back anytime soon. Honestly this spoiled me on gaming as a whole and I don&#039;t know if I will ever be able to trust a big name gaming company besides blizzard ever again. \r\n\r\nI think that is what got me to buy into it in the first place was that blizzard was hosting the game on battlenet so I figured it couldn&#039;t be that bad if blizzard was willing to put their name behind it but now I realize that it was probably forced on them by their corporate overlords and they probably didn&#039;t want to have anything to do with it. Also reading up on all of the drama involved with D1 and D2 like head writers and music producers being shadily fired so they didn&#039;t have to pay them for their work and tons of other shit, it&#039;s just disgusting. The Bungie name needs to be retired because it is a false flag tricking people into thinking they have anything to do with the people that made Halo.\r\n\r\nOh but the visuals and music are pretty good, I guess that is where they put 90% of their effort into.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Destiny 2 is the hottest garbage I have played in years and you shouldn&#039;t touch it with a thousand foot pole. 3/10 for the visuals and sound.","replies":[]}
