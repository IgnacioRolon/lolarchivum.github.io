Maybe I am playing her wrong but I have been maxing E and then Q and then W. I have tried a few different builds with either going hurricane first or bork first but it doesnt seem to matter much what I build, her damage just feels weak throughout the game. And I feel like she has the least dueling potential of any of the carries vs another carry. But I know she was pick/ban during worlds so I must be doing something wrong. Any advice?","replies":[]}
