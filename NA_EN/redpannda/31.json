I have never seen a show with so many ups and downs, it takes what is usually a silly premise played for laughs and fan service and just turns all of your expectations inside out. Nothing feels forced, the laughs and the cries are all earned and every character feels like they belong in this unique world. Sure not every episode is perfect and there are a few flaws but my god when it its all the right notes it just blows me away. Do yourself a favor and give this one a shot, you won&#039;t regret it.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}
