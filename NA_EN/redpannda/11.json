Sorry I haven&#039;t been around much lately, I just need some time away from this game for a while. I hope you are all having a great time, Capt Morgan has been helping me get through this day nice and smooth. :D\r\n\r\nAnyways I happened to get a small chunk of change from a relative this year that I don&#039;t normally get and I was thinking it was about time I stepped into the modern age. I have been using basic phones since forever and would like to get my first smartphone. But I know next to nothing about them, all I know is that I don&#039;t want an Iphone. I would like something that uses android and preferably has a good sized screen. My eyesight isn&#039;t what it used to be, I don&#039;t care that much about camera power or things like that. I would mostly use it for chrome apps, GPS, maybe some games and youtube. \r\n\r\nMy budget is around 400 dollars, I don&#039;t care about name brands and I would like to get something that could last me at least 4 or 5 years. If anyone has any suggestions or even just things to look out for when it comes to them I would appreciate any and all advice. Thanks again and have a blessed day everyone. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xFqRDsI.png[/img]","replies":[]}
