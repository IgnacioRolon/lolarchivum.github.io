No amount of words or pleading will make them move an inch. Unless you want to be celebrating christmas in july and halloween on easter than we need to show Riot that what they pulled is unacceptable. \n\nUntil we get a public apology and a promise to have holiday events on time from now on than I ask each and every member of GD and anyone else you can convince to not spend a dime on harrowing skins. I know this is a hard request, these skins only come once a year and I have had my eye on a few for a long time.\n\nBut I am sick and tired of getting the run around from riot and I am putting my foot down. I will not be making an harrowing purchases. Stand with me brothers and sisters, and show riot that we can be united in a common goal.","replies":[]}
