He pretends that he is religious even though he doesn&#039;t live it, that&#039;s another can of worms. It usually isn&#039;t a big deal but when we saw Logan together and there was that scene in the Limo with the batcholerette party he freaked out and made a big deal out of it in the middle of the theatre. I have heard that there is a sexual scene in A:C but I can&#039;t confirm it. Can anyone verify if this is true or not and if so how graphic does it get? I really want to see it because I am a huge alien fan and he likes them too but I don&#039;t want to watch it with him if it is going to get super awkward.","replies":[]}
