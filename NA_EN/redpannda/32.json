Every time I have a bad feeling about our team it turns out to be true and we get steamrolled. So now I have been dodging every time our team looks shady but now I spend twice as much time in the dugout as I do in the field. Am I going to get in trouble for dodging so many games?\n\nAlso I feel like I have to dodge so much more stuff now. \n\nGuy doesn't get the lane he wants: I know hes gonna feed so I dodge.\n\nEnemy team gets Tahm/lux: gotta dodge I have never won a game vs lux \n\nMy team gets Yasuo: dodge city never won a game with yasuo\n\n","replies":[]}
