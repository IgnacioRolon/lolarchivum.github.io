Everyone was friendly even the enemy team, your teammates never raged at each other or you but offered encouragement when you made mistakes and praise when you succeeded. Every game would come down to a close finish, there would never been any massive feeds or leavers. And afterwards both teams were friendly and discussed the finer points of the match giving praise to everyone equally and everyone leaves the game feeling like they were a part of a greater whole.\r\n\r\nBut.\r\n\r\nYou were guaranteed to lose 100% of your games, would you play that mode still?","replies":[]}
