Is it worth getting into?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/jGOFvTX.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nTried it years ago and didn&#039;t think much of it but I have seen a lot of positive news popping up for it recently. It seems to have a pretty loyal fanbase, I heard it was really obtuse and hard to get into though kind of like Eve. \r\n\r\nI am trying to hedge my bets, I want to have a looter/grinder game to fall back on and I am afraid Destiny 2 isn&#039;t going to cut it. I already preordered it but I haven&#039;t seen a single positive thing said about it so far so now I&#039;m getting scared I wasted my money. Should I just wait and see if it gets better or give Warframe a shot? Can you get a lot out of it without spending money? I&#039;m pretty broke atm so I won&#039;t have any cash to throw at it for a while.","replies":[]}
