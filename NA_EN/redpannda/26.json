Then I get home and try it out and I am confused because it shook like jelly when I opened it up and I was able to just dip a hunk of bread in and scoop it out with ease. Pimento is usually much firmer in consistency. It tasted nothing like any pimento cheeses I had had in the past. I turn the damn thing around and look at the ingredients and the freaking thing had MAYO as the first and main ingredient. And not even real mayo, it was that fake crap stuff that is made to last centuries that cheap fast food places use. \r\n\r\nI have never felt so cheated in my life, my entire dinner has been ruined. :(\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]}
