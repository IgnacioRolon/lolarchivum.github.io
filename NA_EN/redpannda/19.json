It's not like going to be 60% cdr cooldowns but rather 45% first then 15% after the amount is subtracted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuperCosmicHobo","date":"2017-11-08T20:17:56.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it says 5% cdr reduction and 2% on each ult use so that's 10% max on 5 stacks. 5%+10% = 15% Yup, will push it faster. You can put a Zilean who's 45% cd with 33 second ult into 28 second ult, which is very fast.","replies":[]}]}
