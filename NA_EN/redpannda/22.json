I enjoyed hunterxhunter and thought I might give another long show a shot. Of all the shows with a massive amount of episodes this one seemed the most interesting. I&#039;ve heard the usual it has tons of filler (which really isn&#039;t a big deal for me if I like a show and its characters I don&#039;t mind episodes where there isn&#039;t really any plot going on). Other than that are there any major flaws that would make it not worth investing the time into?","replies":[]}
