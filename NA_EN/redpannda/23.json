This is as close as you will get to the real thing. The value like anything store bought can very from store to store and luck of the draw but it is pretty consistent for the most part and has the best all around pizza value. A great crust, crispy on the bottom and edge with just enough soft dough to act as a counter balance but not enough to make it feel like you are eating a marshmellow. The sauce has plenty of flavor, the cheese is moist and comes in smaller shreds that melt better and the pepperoni is cut into triangles (who doesn't love triangles yo), and to top it off there is some parmesan and herbs scattered on top which gives it a nice italian finish. 9/10 \r\n\r\n2) Red Baron - This is the pizza you bust out when your bro's are over and you don't want to order take out. The middle child of the frozen pizza's, the ingredients are much more obviously chosen for their cheapness rather than quality yet still retain some of their flavor. The crust is pretty good, still giving you that crispy bottom with a larger layer of softer crust above it, I enjoy it but some say its a bit too much. The sauce is much more on the sweet side without as much herbs and spices coming through. The cheese while moist is that large shred that doesn't melt very well unless you almost get the pizza to the point of burning. The pepperoni is good but nothing special. Great for sharing with a few friends or on your own but is packed with extra sugars and unneeded fats. Best eaten between 2-8 minutes out of the oven, loses value quickly as it cools. 7/10\r\n\r\n3) Totinos - This is your classic bachelor/college dorm room pizza. When you have 2 bucks and nothing but pizza will do. The best thing about this pizza is its versatility. It can be eaten straight up cooked in the oven. Or you can microwave it and fold it in half turning it into a calzone. It works great with toppings, add some mexican flavors to turn it into a mexican pizza, some shredded bbq  or buffalo chicken or even some chili. Pretty much anything you add to this pizza will enhance the enjoyment without taking away from the pizza itself. This is that comfy sweater that you only wear at home when you are alone of pizzas. 5/10\r\n\r\nAnd now the shit list\r\n\r\n1) California pizza kitchen - You are paying 7 bucks for crackers and cheese. Fancy millimeter thick doughs with fancy toppings only works when you are getting that pizza straight out of the oven at a restaurant. This shit was never meant to be frozen. I have gotten more value out of a box of crackers and some cheesewhiz. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, the overrated grand daddy of failure....\r\n\r\nDiGiorno-is the shit tier of frozen pizza, what is wrong with you people. Just because they came up with some stupid catchy commercial everyone goes ape shit over their bland as fuck sauce, their dry as fuck cheese which never melts all the way and you are left with chunks of barely softened cheese, and their god awful chewy gooey doughy that burns to hell on the outside and has the consistency of cum on the inside. This is the pizza you serve as the last meal to the person you have locked inside your basement. -666/10\r\n\r\nI am sure there are some off brands and local brands that fit somewhere in this list but these are the most popular ones in my area. Feel free to add to the list.","replies":[]}
