There was no problem there.\r\nToday i wanted to play atleast 1 but ofc bugsplat kicks in and fcks up everything.... \r\nAnd i could'nt do much.I resetted the game it didnt do much. Turn off than on the pc -> same.....\r\nBut still i get my 20 min . I understand that i should get 20 min IF I DO NOT JOIN OR AFK!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidk how do you guys feel about that but still i think that if a player CANT join in it does not deserve a 20 min cooldown. \r\nI sent a bugsplat and i hope that they are gonna delete my 20 min. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of this? or am i the only one who thinks that this is dumb???????\r\n\r\nGL HF","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T19:01:59.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It certainly sucks when you're unable to load into a match due to a technical issue. Not only does this negatively impact you, but it also impacts everyone else in the match. Regardless of the reason for being unable to connect, it will negatively impact everyone, though. This is a reason why all disconnections are treated equally by [the system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) and why penalties cannot be removed or modified.\n\nBugsplats are often the result of drivers or hardware issues, so I recommend working through the steps in our [bugsplat and crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if you continue to see bugsplats after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
