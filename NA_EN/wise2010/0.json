Most official normie forums of big games do not allow naming, if you want to do it that much, best places are club chat, Discord, YouTube.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wise2010","date":"2020-01-01T01:08:53.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you block every person you report?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-12-31T23:30:57.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you are saying you accept friend requests from strangers for no reason at all?
