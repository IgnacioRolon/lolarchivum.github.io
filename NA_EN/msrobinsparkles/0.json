Now I'm S4 and I was S2 like 1 or 2 weeks ago. Since then (S2 to S4) I'm almost always catching up Iron and Bronze players on my team. How is this fair? How can this happen? I'm playing Solo. I'm constantly losing games cause of this. Often I even catch Golds on the other team, when mine is a S4 (me), maybe other S4 and 2 bronzes (1 or 2) and 1 Iron 1.

If my mmr is high enough that I’m being matched with gold players, and their mmr is low enough to be matched with bronze 1 players. Then either \nA. I should just be fucking gold\nOr\nB. They should be bronze 1\n\nTheir match making is just fucked and I don’t know why you all continue trying to make excuses about it. -.-","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-21T01:26:48.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A.

The issue is riot has shoved a rank based system together with a mmr system and just let the shit run wild. \n\nIf your mmr is lower than or equal to a bronze player. You should be bronze.
