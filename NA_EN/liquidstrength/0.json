My account got banned by conflict reason with riot so I decide to quit league. Here I have some improve suggestion that I want to share about on this game, the season 7 jungle really don't make the plain system, it makes the jungle unbalance and harder. I hope to keep the same as old season, the new assassin skills are really fun that players would like to play a lot. However, for my personal experience, I really want the green ward and purple ward back on this game.  They are really useful and safe on both sides. Also, items boots removed the extra update items that made the boots not really useful, maybe riot could think the other way of boots item to make it useful. league of legend is a really fun game, but a lot of big change would make a lot of old player feels bad on it. Ask the player during the pre-season how they feel about it then think to fix the game or return to season 5 before. Because season 5 was the golden age of this game, seriously.  {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-05T16:10:12.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Conflit reason with riot?

They think riot should change it or remove it. However, Riot did not even care the players reply the new system during alpha patch and still keep the system going.(THEY ONLY FIX BUG?) SIGH, jungle is getting harder to play even I do not usually play jungle.Before, I played it was hard, now I play it is even harder. I do not know this game in the future. It was worst that they made a lot of changes, now it makes even more worse. {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-16T05:20:17.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf does that have to do with your account getting banned?","replies":[{"poster":"liquidstrength","date":"2016-12-14T15:45:53.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seriously, a lot of players leave after season 6. They do not like the change, but people complain it. Riot never listen to them. They still prove they did right. After many players leave, they still do not care.  I do not know this game future, hope they can change it back and stop reworking the champion. They can make it new, but do not change it as well. It makes no sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"liquidstrength","date":"2016-12-14T15:41:03.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does not have everything special, sometimes you do not spend money on the game, sometimes you play really well, sometimes you say something bad to riot reworks. You will get banned for no reason, maybe sometimes you do not do anything you still get banned by riot. They are really hardworking to ban the players for no reason at all. I feel like they just like any north Korea or those communist, dictatorship country. If you do not like the game, don't complain the game just leave.{{summoner:4}}","replies":[]}]}]}
