Every single ranked or unranked game today is met with endless bugsplats during loading. I have already repaired the client. Come out with a patch and fix this issue. It is getting ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T21:17:31.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused for several reasons like outdated drivers, settings, or something else.  Repairing would fix up corrupt game files, so if it didn't resolve the issue then it may be something else.  Go over our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) guide to help rule out possibilities and get this fixed up.

Up until yesterday when I too got a bug splat error message. Right after champ select, right before loading screen. I tried repairing, reinstalling, all sorts of different tips from YouTube. Nothing has worked.\n\nRiot really needs to work on it's tech support.\n\nAlthough I recommend not going into ranked but instead starting a custom by yourself when trying to troubleshoot a bug splat.\n\nIt is a nightmare and I just want it to go away.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T21:18:56.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help and get you back in game!  Troubleshooting in a custom game is a great idea, and there are a few steps that can be taken to get this resolved.
