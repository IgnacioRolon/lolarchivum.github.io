You&#039;ve probably went to these Boards or Player Support with an inquiry or two regarding your punishments, and have received advice time and time again, only to be punished _time and time again._ Oops, looks like you&#039;ve been **PERMANANTLY BANNED.** \n\nOh, woe are you! You didn&#039;t learn your lessons and now have lost access to all those sweet, delicious Legendary and Ultimate skins! Those cool emotes, gone! That Rose Bouquette ward you always dropped on the fallen bodies of your enemies, lost! \n\nBut, you just can&#039;t help playing this game! You strive to repent and decide to make another account. You&#039;re playing, you&#039;re positive, but it&#039;s just not the same, is it? You&#039;re playing the same champions as everyone else--the Garen and Ashe from Tutorial Lore, the Flavors of the Week--you might decide to splurge using that precious Blue Essence to purchase all of the lease expensive champions to expand your access. The remorse just doesn&#039;t escape, though. **YOU&#039;LL NEVER HAVE WHAT YOU LOST AGAIN.** Unless, of course, you spend some real money or get lucky with the chests and capsules within next undefined amount of time...\n\n~\n\nIt&#039;s 2018. It&#039;s Season 8. No longer are we required to spend real money on premium content. There are many opportunities to freely gain what some have had to spend hundreds of dollars to achieve. There&#039;s a reworked Honor system with visible tiers and achievements. Shopping and earning has been adjusted, but punishments have remained the same. No matter how much you prove yourself to be a reformed, positive player the punishment is _permanant_ and that feeling of suffering will continually remain. \n\nI propose a change to that. Not to the concept of &quot;Permanant Bans&quot;; that&#039;s a solid idea that gives proper incentive to **NEVER** receive such harsh punishments. Instead, I believe that League of Legends is at a state where it should be possible for _truly reformed_ players to be returned at least _some_ of what they lost:\n\n* Content purchased through RP: Champion Skins, Chromas, Ward Skins, Summoner Icons, Emotes\nx Champions\nx Hextech Crafting Material\nx RP Itself\nx Boosts\nx Rune Pages\n* Loading Screen Border (Though tbh I feel that this should be lost, as those borders were acquired through limited availability)\n* Special Blue Essence Shop purchases (Let&#039;s face it: That early time following the IP to BE conversion was special and fully of purchases any new player will be able to make within the season)\n\nIf you&#039;re still reading, I&#039;m sure at some point wayy~ up the page you thought to yourself &quot;How will this work? What&#039;s the process? What exactly determines who&#039;s eligible for this?&quot; \n\n1. The account receiving your items should be associated with the same Email address as the account banned\n2. The account receiving your items should maintain an Honor Level of 2 or above\n3. **NO FURTHER PUNISHMENTS ON ANY ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMAIL ADDRESS OF THE ACCOUNT BANNED**\n4. The account receiving your items should have active use prior to two month _before_ the end of the current season at the time up to the beginning of the next. That said, you are **REQUIRED** to exhibit Honorable and Positive gameplay for a time within the season of your new account&#039;s creation. No creating an account and just leaving it inactive until reimbursement time.\n\nLet me be clear with this: This is **NOT** intended to reward or otherwise &quot;remove&quot; the punishment given to players who reached this point, hence why any content received through Blue Essence purchases or Hextech Crafting aren&#039;t received but instead the content is limited to some of what was received through real money transactions. The punishment should be lasting as a reminder to adhere to the Summoner&#039;s Code. That said, I feel that there should be _something_ provided to reforming players as a show of not merely thanks but appreciation for their continued efforts in both reforming and doing their part in keeping League of Legends a positive environment.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n*I&#039;ve put a lot of thought into this, yet as much thought as I have put into this any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I care about this game and it&#039;s content, and believe everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves even if they aren&#039;t full repaid. I hope Riot would give this idea a shot, even if they make their own adjustments to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-04-25T02:57:16.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Instead of banning, they should just reset people to level 1 tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-04-25T02:58:35.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ok sure but why,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ogrAKGQI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-25T02:57:16.870+0000)\n>\n> Instead of banning, they should just reset people to level 1 tbh\n\nThat doesn't do a thing except make them the new players problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-04-25T03:00:03.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Trust me, the new players are even worse lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-04-25T03:14:55.840+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ok sure but why,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ogrAKGQI,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-25T03:00:03.686+0000)\n>\n> Trust me, the new players are even worse lmao\n\nWe've all been new players.

And if you're talking about the kind of \"toxic\" that implies them actually trolling matches, then yeah, these players are a lot worse. They won't even notice, because a Tahm x Anivia duo locking the ADC in base all game will just make sure that ADC goes 0/0/0 instead of 0/11/0.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-04-25T03:42:36.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ok sure but why,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ogrAKGQI,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-25T03:00:03.686+0000)\n>\n> Trust me, the new players are even worse lmao\n\nAs someone who's currently playing with new players, I'll have you know that they're MUCH more tolerable than actually toxic players. They're new, which means they're open to discussion, disagreement, learning. They don't randomly insult you if you do one thing wrong.\n\nLast night I was in a game with a new player and they actually do hear that League has a toxic community, but don't experience it that low in the elo brackets. I wanted to tell them that higher up they'll encounter it, but I couldn't for the life of me ruin their sparkly dreams lmao \n\nTthere wouldn't be toxicity if people weren't toxic. Making people create a new account is punishment enough; I just feel that there should be some way to reimburse them and encourage further reformation and positivity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-25T03:16:32.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont trust you, you are some random idiot on the interweb who has strong opinions about things.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-25T03:15:52.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So even more toxic trash is struggling upwards through new games and punishing new players instead of the people who should be punished?\n\nRemove trash, make it quit.
