It's the variables outside that is what should be of concern; runes, items, opponents, champions, teammates, gold prices and rewards, objectives.  It's not like Pros become pros by \"learning the basics\"; they learn the basics...and go beyond.  Find positions and roles to specialize in, builds that work, make contingency strategies if things go bad, understand potential counters, etc, etc.\n\nWhat you declared was \"I want to be a burden and have my team babysit me or I'll feed\".

That's the reason why so many trolls exist in the playerbase and it's a shame.  The only advice I have is face it and get real.  By the way, going roundabout with the point and calling me wrong and explaining why by insulting me is not an effective counterargument.\n\nAnd guess what?  Not everyone has a team, and pros tend to make strats together so as to maximize they're overall effectiveness.  And in many cases, some pros started on their own or in other teams; in other words, pro players kinda HAVE to be strong on their own anyway.  There are also hams who exaggerate claims to make themselves sound better, or pros don't really care much for the limelight.
