Does one HAVE to honor a teammate? As it stands in the current system in my view there seems to be no reason to honor in particular. Not just because the honourable person doesn&#039;t actually receive much but because there is no personal gain. There are very few games I have where I think &quot;wow, this person deserves and honor&quot; although there are some. So whilst this new system makes it more obvious that one can honor I still feel that the majority will simply opt out of the honor system unless with premades. \n\nHave I misunderstood or can one simply opt out of honoring? Is there a negative impact to not honoring? (apart from the whole &quot;if everyone thought like you no one would get honored&quot; - which is pretty much exactly what happens right now)","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-06-01T13:56:05.259+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Not just because the honourable person doesn't actually receive much but because there is no personal game.
