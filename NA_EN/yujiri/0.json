I've done this several times, but it still doesn't work. Any ideas on how to fix this problem, or should I just try sticking to the old client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-23T18:43:57.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may need to restart your computer in case the client crashed in the background and isn't closing.
