Then I look at the item and read \"65 armour, 2700 gold.\"\n\nPeople complain about the stale meta but the meta is just CD dependent champions that use items that weren't nerfed because they are mostly mana/CDR.  If that actually got changed URF might not be the exact same team every game.\n\nThe only items with mana that are actually still good pick ups are ROA and Seraphs Embrace because the stats on them + Seraphs active overshadow the uselessness of mana on the items.

He has all the tools to do amazingly in URF.  Despite that he is meh because he either has to build items he dislikes or build items that are horrendously inefficient because they are mostly mana/CDR.  You basically can't buy IBG for the passive in URF without getting screwed over one way or another.\n\nPretending that items have no impact is just silly.  Look at lethality right after the buff.  Despite crit not having been hit at all crit ADC's all but vanished off the face of the earth for a patch.  Is it really so surprising that URF has a stale meta when half the items that half the champion pool uses are only half as useful as normal?\n\nTake a look at defensive items:\n{{item:3001}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3060}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3814}} {{item:1401}} {{item:3401}} {{item:2303}}{{item:3110}}  {{item:2302}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3030}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3027}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3512}} \n\nThese are every completed item that provide defensive stats (Not passives, hence why Last whisper and the like aren't included.)\n\nNow lets look at how many of these don't lose the stats they are balanced around and priced for in URF:\n{{item:3102}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3814}} {{item:1401}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3091 {{item:3512}} {{item:3091}} \n\nLess than half as many items, and how many of those are true defensive options for tanks?  I know Taric isn't interested in half of those items.  He isn't going to be buying and edge of night or a QSS.  Rylais is wasted and he doesn't actually use the AS from Wits End due to his passive.\n\nLets compare that to AD/AS damage items:\n{{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3814}} {{item:1416}} {{item:1400}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3004}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3142}} \n\nThese are any completed items that grant AD or AS.  Admittedly fewer items than the defense options, but you have to keep in mind defense options are vs both AD and AP which only 2-3 of these items are ok buys on most AP champs outside of those like Kayle who just want to abuse AS whatever the form.\n\nAfter we cut down the list we are left with:\n{{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3814}} {{item:1416}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3091}} \n\nIn comparison to defensive items we lost far fewer.\n\nCan you really say that a stagnation of a gamemode's meta has nothing to do with the fact that roughly half of all items in the game lose out on stats that they are balanced around?  That it is only coincidence that many of the strongest URF champions normally build items that didn't get hit by this nerf?  That many strong champions that did get their normal itemization hit have other options they can turn to?\n\nSure many of those items make a comeback due to strong passives/actives like Death's Dance which has a passive that effectively scales with CDR since it lets abilities heal you or Hextech Protobelt which has a strong active.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-03-03T08:30:24.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Khâmul,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nppIgHIl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-03-03T08:27:49.872+0000)\n>\n> People on URF: oh no people always pick the same champions its boring ,no one takes anything new, i have the feeling it&#x27;s the same game\n> People on ARURF: oh no, people are more lucky than me because they got a better champ.\n> \n> Arurf is better than urf, at least i see more diversity\n\nARURF and regular urf would be a LOT more fun if riot curated the problem champions out. \nAs the fat mexican pointed out in his video.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-03T14:10:14.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Get rid of the current problem champions and new problem champions will spawn.\n\n\nLike it or not, that's what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Serophous","date":"2017-03-03T23:46:07.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah no\n\nRiot has done it in one for all, where teemo and karthas are locked out. \n\nI even think ryze was locked out of another one, but can't remember which.\n\nSo Riot HAS done it before.

You can go dual top, you can go dual mid, double jungle, 4-stack lane pushing, etc. You would see a lot more combinations of champions, like the triple hook comp (Blitz, Thresh, Naut) because you could have 3 support/tanks and still have 3 carries. \n\nI played Hexakill when it was on SR, it really REALLY didn't work out that way. Unless the sixth person picked another support there wasn't enough gold on the map to support them. It works on TT better because more people are starved of farm gold and so most get it from kill gold and since there are so many fights the game progresses at a good pace without leaving anyone too far behind.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-03-05T09:54:51.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And thats where I disagree with you. The game modes dont HAVE to be about brawling - we see that through Doombots or Nexus Siege, and even with OFA to a point since they took it from Howling Abyss to Summoners Rift. Nemesis Draft was even good. The ones about the brawl were URF and Ascention. \n\nHex has potential to be a strategy game instead of a brawl. I often did see it work out that way - some teams would go for scaling with the double support, others would go for the earlygame with the double jungle. I didnt see dual mid too often, but I remember facing it once and trying it rightafter. And personally, I think game progression SHOULD include scaling and snowballing. I hate how on TT, it seems that everybody ends up with full build unless you get stomped. You can do really well in the earlygame with an earlygame comp, but if the enemy has some decent waveclear in each lane and hold their inhib turrets youre free to pick the AP Ezreal and wreak at 20 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-03-05T15:45:16.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hexakill is designed for brawling.
