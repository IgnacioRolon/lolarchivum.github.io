The game is honestly a mess right now because its just too much.

No 1 group is responsible.\n\nThey said that Runes were gonna be the largest patch to league to change the future. I think Riot should own up to this by making the 2nd largest patch in the history of league be midseason and just try to fix the entire mess that has happened recently.\n\n-------------------------\n\nEdit: When I posted this yesterday I didnt expect to wake up to it being the top post. And staying as such all day. Ill take this moment to just say that this isnt a \"fuck Riot\" or \"fuck __\" post. Just simply put in my opinion everything in the game feels a bit much right now. However the main point of this post is mainly to try to get through to people that any one group isnt more/less broken than the next. Just that the game as a whole feels a bit much. I enjoy the game, I think Riot does a good job. This isnt meant to fill an agenda, or to insert your own agenda like ive seen a little of. Nonetheless I enjoy the actual debate going on and applaud the comments discussing game balancing with a minimal amount of REEEing.","replies":[{"poster":"Akaviri","date":"2018-02-06T06:03:10.604+0000","up_votes":88,"down_votes":5,"body":"Don't know why this is being downvoted, it's about as real as it gets on here lol.\n\nHate to say it, but support itemization powercreep is most likely the reason why people are mad.

Riot should nerf everything but not everything to the same scale/degree. What this game needs I think are new starter items that promote non snowballing games and they need to make ADC itemization go up. The standard vayne build(a late game hypercary)  is berserkers, Static shyv, IE, Mercurial, Rapid fire cannon, and GA. This amounts to 15,700 gold. To put that in perspective, a tank build, for instance maokai, is tabis, sunfire, spirit visage, Righteous Glory, thornmail, and locket. This amounts to 14,550. These two builds should not be so close in price. In theory an ADC will be the person with the most farm, most kills, and highest damage. So they will end up having the most gold. Tanks will have good farm, but more assists than kills. So because of this they will have less gold. ADC itemization needs to have an increase in gold value.

Maybe the changes to AP itemization planned for 8.4 will change something, but AD and tank need to be looked at too. \n\nLoL since juggernauts patch seems like a game in beta.

There has been a support itemization powercreep, but then tank items got massive flat stat increases and ADCs got gold reduction across the board on their items alongside base AD increases. The power creeping hasn't been limited to just supports.\n\n> No 1 group is responsible.\n\nIs probably the truest statements with regards to balance I've seen on the boards. \n\nI've said it in another thread, every item needs a stat squish. Reduce AD across the board, reduce health across the board, CDR doesn't need to be on every item. Rework crit for the love of all that is holy, like Riot said they were going to do (or at least look at) seasons ago. Leave resistances alone IMHO, they got shafted in favour of more health.\n\nThen Riot has something tangible to work with, and can consider adding more items to counteract the meta without worrying about everyone that isn't a tank getting one shot bursted by everyone that isn't a tank. Class updates dropped a nuclear bomb on balance, then the runes update was a natural disaster following suit, so time to start rebuilding from ground zero. \n\nUntil Riot admits to themselves that there isn't any balance, and they need to do some drastic changes, I'm afraid it's only going to get worse. But even then, I don't doubt things will get worse before they get better.

Why do u say that only ranked games gonna be disabled during a patch which turns out is notning more than a maintenance so u disabled the whole game for a while. Why the fuck do u always lie about things? This game in the other hand just got much worse and it still gets. Will u guys ever return to the old shine or league player have to deal with this shit? Btw not to mention that everytime when i want to start a custom game the game just crashes and it sais 'unable to connect, please check your Internet connection and try again' even when loading screen is on 100%.

Instead of having creative, unique item building, compositions & skill point distribution, we have:\n\nArmor to counter AD\nResistance to counter AP\nAD? - build AD\nAP? - build AP\nMeta-sheep lanes and socially-designated or assigned roles.\n\n\nThere's less you can do to mitigate a poor lane match-up. You can't optimize to build around your counter often, you can't abuse AI in order to shift map pressure, you just have to sit there and take it in the ass. This problem is further emphasized by a lack of willingness to change one's playstyle to be more adaptable in general.\n\nI've never tried to cooperate more as a team than back when I was playing Captain's Mode on Dota 2. The picks/bans were alternated in a balanced manner and had separate pick/ban stages (I'm not sure why this isn't a promoted mode).\n\nBasically Lol's champ select mode is \"pray for the best\". Everybody gets to ban ASAP and by doing that, you hope you're not going against an OP champion, or one that will counter your lane. Whereas in a mode like CM, the captains have the option to 'fake' compositions or shut the other team down from fully actualizing their comp.\n\nThen upon pick/ban stages being completed, teammates have the option of... **diversifying their lanes.** Maybe we'll put two top. Maybe two mid. Maybe 3 bot. The way to play is less rigid, more adaptable & consequentially, more fun and balanced. It has less to do with being restricted by picks/counters and gives more leeway to skill-based matchups because of creativity & opportunity.","replies":[]}]}
