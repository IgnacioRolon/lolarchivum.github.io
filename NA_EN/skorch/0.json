And it never reconnects, so i will have to reset my client then too.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T21:35:36.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once champion select is over, you switch from the client to the game so any errors you receive are not related to the updated version.  The error you're receiving is also more specifically related to a network problem that's failing to reach the game servers.  If you return to the legacy client, it's likely that you'll find the same error.
