Even people like {{champion:238}} +{{champion:141}} are really just pissed at noxus and while kind of assholes arent villians. And noxus themselves are being written to be different, but not evil.\r\nThey do what they consider good for their common man.\r\n\r\nI want more TRUE supervillians. And i mean SUPERVILLIANS.\r\nsure there are &quot;bad guys&quot; like {{champion:120}} and {{champion:412}} but they are only just bad guys, hell even lackeys to Mordekaiser.\r\nAnd a lot of &quot;villains&quot; are just groups, Darkin, Voidlings, Demons.\r\n\r\nThe only true single villians are the murderers {{champion:555}}  and {{champion:202}} , {{champion:82}} , {{champion:143}} and the black rose.\r\nMurderers while solo, are just murderers (dont get me wrong i love jhin), Zyra has got nothing recent in years, all we know of Morde is hes &quot;growing his army&quot; the black rose is barely in the lore at all.\r\nSure we have &quot;the entity&quot; but he&#039;s just the boss of league of legends, he&#039;ll probably never be a champion or at least for a REALLY long time.\r\nLiss got changed.\r\n\r\nSo I feel like this is a bit nitpicky. But can we get more villain... at least stories? maybe not champions, but more information on what the TRUE villians are up to, other than existing.\r\n\r\nAlthough an entirely new evil female champion would be cool too... something to cover where lissandra was, and someone who ISNT connected to a currently existing faction (darkin, shadow isles, void) someone who acts of their own will.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2018-09-12T21:48:36.970+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"#I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED!","replies":[{"poster":"reba042","date":"2018-09-12T21:53:16.947+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**ALL BOW TO OUR LORD**","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2018-09-12T22:01:03.637+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nonsense!\n\nI wouldn't demean my adoring public by demanding them to prostrate themselves before me.

Zed, for example, was an evil shadow ninja whose law was:\n\n\"Embrace the shadows, or DIE in darkness!\"\n\nIf someone didn't wanna b a shadow boi, they get killed and their shadow got stolen.\n\nBut they had very vague stories. Not much was known about them (for better or worse), and when Riot updated them (for better or worse), they decided to give a more human aspect to them (for better or worse). I love anti-heroes as much as the next guy, but Zed went from Ra's Al Ghul crossed with the Arkham Knight (The Demon Knight of Arkham?) to Donald Trump crossed with Red Hood (the Red Wall?). I absolutely love Zed being an anti-hero and sympathetic, but keeping him as a straight villain wouldn't be a crime (no pun intended) either. Like All For One. Yeah he takes in Tomura-- in Zed's case, Kayn-- but he still isn't doing what he does for the sake of protecting his country. He's doing it to destroy Pro Heroes (and groom Tomura as the next All For One). Or so I presume, as I'm not totally caught up with the manga or anime yet.\n\nZed could have been an All For One-esque character. Someone who is trying to break the Traditionalist beliefs in Ionia, striking from the shadows while grooming Kayn (who now has Rhaast and could potentially become the third-most powerful being in Ionia next to Syndra and Karma) as the next Master of Shadows to take complete control over Ionia, as opposed to a conservative trying to deport the Vastayans and protect Ionia from potential threats.\n\nMoreso than that, it'd also add a bit more impact to Zed's decision to put aside his differences and work with Shen to take down Jhin. It'd show his understanding that Shen deserves as much justice for what happened to them (or his hatred for Jhin) is greater than his ambition for taking over Ionia and decimating the Traditionalist Clans. Because if he's an anti-hero, it's somewhat expected that he'd be willing to put aside differences to fight Jhin. Because Jhin is just another threat to Ionia.\n\nBut that's just my two cents on the topic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wind234","date":"2018-09-13T03:45:49.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now when you say \"villain\".....in what capacity do you mean?

Some of the champions you mentioned are VERY villainous - just because they may have some sympathetic characteristics doesn't mean they're not villainous, just more complex. If you were to ask Shen or Akali, I'm pretty sure they'd agree Zed is definitely a villain (the man murdered Shen's father and took over their monastery because he thought his own sense of justice was better than everybody else's). And Thresh is for-sure a villain - Lucian's entire story arc is basically a revenge arc aiming to fill him full of holy lead \"for Senna!!!\" Just because there may be \"bigger fish\" in the pond, doesn't mean that these guys are less villainous. It depends on the role they're meant to play in their stories. \n\nThe very thing you're pointing out is what -makes- a compelling villain - everybody is the protagonist of their own story.

How can I be totally villainous today?\" We have a character like that in Veigar, and the thing is....he's kinda a parody of that sort of thing. It's clear that NOBODY takes him seriously because he's basically a cartoon supervillain in a world where that sort of thing just isn't realistic.

They're supposed to have a motive and a purpose to their actions aside from \"I am super evil, fear me!\" When I hear the term \"supervillain,\" I can't help but think of the childishly cartoonish characters from Saturday morning TV shows. If this isn't your intention and I'm misreading you, please feel free to correct me, but I'm of the opinion that villains who land in a darker shade of grey tend to be the most effective at doing their literary job. \n\nHowever, I will agree with you on two points. One, we definitely need more lore showing League's various baddies actually DOING bad things. We get bios and stories that make them sympathetic, but we also need stories that show us why we don't want these people getting their way. I think the reason why you feel there's a lack of villains isn't because there IS a lack of villains, but because that villainy hasn't been the focus in all the new stories and bios. The second thing I agree with is a lack of independent villains. Most of our cast of baddies are working with some higher force, or are otherwise tethered by something or someone else's will.

Shurima is a dead empire full of godlike beings with morals and actions unbound by any human social contract. And The Void represents destruction and nihilism as a pure force of the basic fabric of Runeterra's universe.  I mean,  I guess the yordles and Bandle City are technically \"good\" but even they represent something more akin to noble-savage nature-spirit innocence than traditional heroic values.  (For instance, I get a kick out of {{champion:17}}'s lore being full of James Bond-like soul-of-a-killer melancholia because he's the most efficient poisoner and military scout the yordles have ever known.)  \n\nWho are the heroes and protagonists of League?  {{champion:59}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:99}} ?  Seems a little thin.  But I like the lore this way.  I find Runeterra's descriptions of human nature as expressed in the lore to be realistic - I love the way {{champion:223}} preys on human greed, for instance -  and consistent with the concept that no being is entirely pure, and that every creature, human, and empire is characterized by their sins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2018-09-13T02:03:23.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really think {{champion:143}} is evil.\n\nShe's pretty much a force of nature.","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2018-09-13T03:30:41.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bârd,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Olvf0EiQ,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-09-13T02:03:23.273+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t really think {{champion:143}} is evil.\n> \n> She&#x27;s pretty much a force of nature.\n\nA FoN thats pissed off.","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2018-09-13T04:51:23.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, kinda?\n\nFrom her perspective, she's just eating and propagating her species. \n\nShe doesn't hate humans, per se, it's just that she doesn't hold them in any higher regard than animals.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SS Big Daddy","date":"2018-09-12T22:02:36.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius {{champion:122}} Draven {{champion:119}} Have always been the baddies from that League cinematic when they fight ahri n shit. {{champion:31}}cho obvs needs a rework but still","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2018-09-13T02:04:22.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius/Draven are just noxians.
