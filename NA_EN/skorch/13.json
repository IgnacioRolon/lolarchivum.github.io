I am not a main, but hes a fun champion so i play him every once in a while.\r\n\r\nI get into a game and it turns out im laning against a Diamond Aatrox main... I got shit on to be frank, however came out of lane with a not IMMENSLY terrible score all things considered. I mean its whatever it happens. I wasnt very surprised. However there were some members of my team who proceeded to constantly troll and be toxic to me for being &quot;trash&quot;\r\n\r\nI mean i already knew they were toxic since they were also trolling my jungler.\r\n\r\nBut the &quot;If Yasuo doesnt win lane he is trash&quot; syndrome is honestly one of the most toxic and infuriating attitudes in the game and it makes me wish Riot was harsher against people who exhibit extremely toxic behavior all game even if its in a single game. Like a 1 day ban or something.","replies":[{"poster":"ReySolomon","date":"2017-07-24T04:49:14.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this in ranked? or norms?","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2017-07-24T05:55:46.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Norms, i dont play Yas in ranked.
