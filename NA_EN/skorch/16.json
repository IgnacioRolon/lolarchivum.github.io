His new ult is always going to feel worse than his old ult and his Q is the most 'whatever' change I've ever seen.\n\nMaokai's rework is just as questionable, they really gave him nothing that would make him want to be a tank. They stuffed so much power into his brush camping, but ideally you want the highest damage you can for this so mage Maokai is just a logical consequence. Until they give him something to make him want to be a tank he will be a mage, even if his buildpath changes up a little it will probably still stay as a mage like MPen based build.\n\nSejuani's a clear example of Riot not understanding how to put together the pieces they had. Nothing on her kit is too individually garbage but Riot just made a few too many bad choices on her. They crammed all the power on her kit into her E and passive in her 20% max HP burst and ally interaction. In doing so they just made a kit that isn't that good to play, you just feel like an E/passive bot who's power is tied to their melee allies and who's other abilities only exist to serve E and passive. Your ult feels utterly abysmal and doesn't even feel like an ultimate and W only exists to stack E. This is made even more frustrating by the fact that her W is a well designed kit-linchpin ability. It feels like the sort of ability you'd want to design a kit around but is instead sidelined for her less interesting Braum-passive.\n\nThe item changes also aren't good, it doesn't take a genius to work this out. Tanks didn't get good new itemisation choices outside of maybe Adaptive Helm. They lost GA, Rand's, Cinder and Sunfire either entirely or to the realms of utter trash though.

Even if she's more powerful the way that power is expressed is terrible. So much of her power is locked to her ally rather than her and so much of her power is in her absurd shatter damage. Neither her E nor the damage component of her passive actually feel fun to play with and they're certainly the worst parts of her kit to play against. Her ult and her W just end up feeling crippled due to the amount of power shifted onto her E and passive, her ult doesn't even feel like an ult and her W just feels like an extension of her E, which is a shame because it is certainly the most interesting of her post rework abilities.\n\nSo no, I can tell that the Sejuani rework is a failure and balancing ultimately doesn't even factor in.

New Sej is far less healthy to play against as well. Her E creates some frankly abysmal situations. Sejuani can land a point and click 2 second stun after doing literally no work just because a bruiser gets on top of you, then she can nuke you for 20% or even 40% at a range. She has some abysmal play patterns, I didn't even need to play her to see this, but playing her has certainly confirmed it.\n\n>And that covers how it FEELS to play but what about how it feels to play AGAINST? Well i can damn say its too early to tell.\n\nWhat world do you live in?

Old Sej was a top tier teamfighter and effectively the hypercarry amongst tanks. New Sej spikes at around 9, she's optimally played in either small skirmishes or even just as a solo splitpusher from the top lane. She has limited DPS where she used to have a lot, and now she has insane burst.

You press a button to follow up CC for a melee ally, then you nuke them with your passive. At least old Sej was DoT so you could potentially avoid it, new Sej is just \"fuck you dodge my Irelia's AAs, good luck\".\n\n>Its frankly plainly fucking obvious she needed a rework.\n\nAnd the rework they gave her didn't help anything, it just created new problems and pissed off her mains.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"1995 2017RiP Eva","date":"2017-05-13T11:35:05.804+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"is not a fail? the 3 tanks they remake they failed hard to make them balanced.\n\nThe items exepct the MR ones are all useless now (hELLO SUNFIRE AND JG FIRE)\n\nIt didnt fix any of the tank issue\n\nIn long terms sej would need 2-3 patches of nerfs in order to be balanced which translate 3 WHOLE MONTHS.....in 3 months we are already setting up for the WORLD patch...so nobody would care for the tank uptade any more....\n\nSo as you see ITS A MAJOR fail","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-05-13T15:04:09.930+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-05-13T15:08:31.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What if in 7.12 everything gets refined is amazing?","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-05-13T15:16:28.940+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A fix does not remove a failure.\n\nThe update is still a failure.\n\nThe fix can be a success, but it does not remove the faulure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-13T15:10:23.473+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wouldn't change the fact that the midseason patch was a failure?\n\n7.12 would be an amazing success, 7.10 would still be an astonishing failure.","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2017-05-13T15:14:59.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"No as the important changes came about in midseason.
