I defend Riot... A LOT. Probably because I find the boards overly witch-hunting... A LOT. That aside I decided to try my best to compile a list of issues for Riot to consider in upcoming patches. Most of these they already are probably working on since 8.2 is in full work, but eh.\r\n\r\nTop Lane: People are upset at the tank only top lane. With Juggernauts and Fighters heavily outclassed. Now personally I think that it MIGHT not be 100% on runes.\r\nWith a bit of changes on who they are fighting I think Fighters like Fiora and Renek might really like Press The Attack, or at the very least it can be SLIGHTLY changed to be liked by both ranged and fighters like Fervor was. Maybe change instead of a flat further damage buff maybe something to assist in quick trades?\r\nAnd for Juggernauts I can see them taking Grasp if it did just a BIT more in the offensive department, which it should since it is the ONLY offense keystone in resolve (Well aftershock but that is more of a benefit of CC than flat damage)\r\nAnd also maybe giving a price reduction to Triforce. And maybe -100g on Phage and BC? maybe a small upgrade to the stats on Steraks? IDK These are just ideas.\r\nI would also mention specific champions but raw statistics say way more than I need to speak about.\r\n\r\nMid Lane: Honestly im happy with Mid but from what I hear ManaFlowBand might be a bit strong.\r\n\r\nJungle: Honestly I dont really hear any complaints about JG right now.\r\n\r\nBot Lane: Alright this is the big thing Rito........ NERF ADC ITEM GOLD. I think that, what, 20 patches ago or so it was a deserved buff, ADCs back then were struggling, people seem to think their current strength takes that away from them or that they deserve being dumpstered. But back then it was indeed deserved. Now though? Not at all. I think that the Zeal items need a cost increase for sure.\r\n&quot;What is to stop the same thing from happening again?&quot; Well the current support changes (while taking the 3 actives away) Allows Supports to start getting actual items much faster... Which hopefully would be enough to protect the ADC enough to survive these situations. But ADCs are getting items much to fast for being ADCs and I think a gold nerf is now deserved.\r\n\r\nSo yeah thats my 2 cents on what should be looked at in upcoming patches. Did I miss something? IDK.","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2018-01-10T15:06:14.451+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":8,"body":"What about the overall damagecreep.\n\nTanks dealing more damage than actual carries is pretty disgusting.\nNon assassins or non burst mages being able to kill others faster than assassins and burst mages shouldn't be a thing either.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2018-01-10T16:04:51.047+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":15,"body":"> Tanks dealing more damage than actual carries is pretty disgusting.\n\nWhich is untrue?

I was trying to say that mages have 0 adaptability and don't have individuality. They might perform well as a class, but they have very little effectiveness individually in comparison to eachother. I guess what I'm getting at is that _they basically all play the same way and build the same way, with just different results because of theyre kits._\n\nThat's what I wanted to stress.\n\n> Plus I never understood the problems with the itemazation.\nit's the fact it is quite similar to every mage?\n\nIt really is. If you look at pretty much any mage, you'll see they have essentially the same exact late-game build with little deviation. It usually looks something like this:\n\n{{item:3165}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3020}} with sometimes {{item:3089}}\n\nsome special shoutouts are\n\n{{item:3158}} {{item:3027}}\n\nany other items like {{item:3116}} {{item:3152}} are only built by specific champions or in very specific matchups. There are literally 4-5 *core* items for almost all mages, with very little adaptability. \n\nEvery other class of champions generally has 3ish core items have have much better alternative choices.","replies":[{"poster":"iDarkWind","date":"2018-01-11T14:16:14.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright, but it isn't a problem that only mages have at all.\nIf you look at Assasins class(AD), you will notice that the case isn't very different.\nThe build usually is:\n{{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3035}}  {{item:3814}}  / {{item:3026}}  {{item:3047}} / {{item:3111}} \n\nAnd only 3 of those items are really assasins items, plus they suffer from the fact that they can be abused by marksmen and for that reason they have been nerfed over and over again.\nIf that wasn't bad, Assasins in order to become actual Assasins, are balanced around {{item:3147}} damage proc for god knows what reason.\n\nYou could tell me we also have this items:\n{{item:3139}} {{item:3156}} \nBut that items are flat out garbage, and if you picked an Assasin against a team with a lot of CC, you're going to have a big bad time even if you build {{item:3139}} , for example. In the case of Maw, it's just bad. Some players may abuse the {{item:3155}} in the laning phase though, but at the cost of a {{item:3134}} , wich provides much more raw damage and one shot potencial.\n\nLook, I may have looked angry in my comment, but isn't because of you. I have a big issue with the boards because they always favour mages over anything, and I've seen a lot of ridiculous suggestions being upvoted without making any sense.\n\nThe other topic you talked about was the difference between mages.\nI don't think they're all equal at all, in fact I think the mages have a vast variety on their own:\n\nBurst mages: {{champion:63}} {{champion:134}} ;\n\nUtility / Poke / Burst: {{champion:61}} (Yes, I hate her. She's a lane bully that perma pokes you, has a shield to win trades and offers a huge team fight potencial with her ulti that can one shot squishy's that have no MR items (and if she's not too much behind));\n\nPoke: {{champion:101}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:115}} \nEspecially this guy {{champion:101}}  that is insanely strong at the moment, and in my opinion someone that requires so much skill to play beind so good proves that something is wrong;\n\nCC Machines / Control mages: {{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:163}} (not sure about Taliyah\n\nDPS: {{champion:69}} {{champion:13}} \n\nDivers: {{champion:8}}\n\nAnd there are many others.\nSo far, in my opinion, they have a huge diversity and each one of them can do different things.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-01-11T18:49:51.757+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mention that AD assassins have a similar restriction in their item selection, but tbh pretty much all AD assassins play the same way with the same goal.

It doesnt matter, everyone has the same build, no matter their purpose. \n\nThe *only* exceptions are when a specific champion is intentionally designed to benefit from a specific item or to require and item, like:\n{{champion:268}} + {{item:3115}} \nor\n{{champion:34}} + {{item:3070}} \n\nVladimir's core build is different because his entire kit pushes him to build tank to a degree as well, not because he's a diver.\n\nthe *only* deviation in a mage's core build is when it's specifically implemented due to their individual kit and not due to their purpose for the team.\n\nYou have burst mages building the same as zoning mages. You have mobile mages building the same way as immobile mages. \n\nSo you comparing mages to assassins is actually an amazing point for my argument. You have an incredibly diverse class class like mages that has the very same restrictions and build diversity as a binary class like ad assassins, and that's a problem yaknow? I could also bring up the fact that when an Assassin like Rengar/Nocturn/Kayn get behind they have the option to default into a more diver-ish build to opt as a tank, Mages don't even have that option. It's generally more efficient to just keep building for their core build than to opt for {{item:3027}} or {{item:3116}}.","replies":[{"poster":"iDarkWind","date":"2018-01-11T20:16:56.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Danm, you made a good point right there, I kinda forgot how big the mages roast is compared to the AD Assasins, and it is a huge factor.\nWell played.\nI mean ... you kinda answeared all the points, can't really make a outcome.\nBut you shouldn't really look at assasins like they're all same.\nThey're different in the way they do their job, indeed I understand and agree about what you said: their main goal is always to kill their squishy target.\n\nThere's just one thing I strongly disagree. If you fall behind as an Assasin, chances are that you're going to stay irrevalant the rest of the game, and that's pretty much one of the big risks of picking an Assasin.\nIt doesn't matter at all if you build bruiser like. Most of the AD Assasins use their bonus AD scales to stay relevant and keep doing damage. If they simply start building tankier when they're falling behind, 'they won't be anything' - They won't have enough damage, neither will have CC to help their team out or will be tankier enough to be relevant.\n\nAt the same time, I've seen very situations where mages usually that exit the laning phase 0-5, can still make a comeback, monstly due to the fact if they get positionated correctly in the team fight, they will be able to cast their spells without any risks, and most of them always have some kind of CC, wich is amazing in team fights. If they're smart enough, they also have this bad boy here {{item:3157}} that will make the enemy divers think twice about diving them.\n\nBut yeah, you answeared pretty well. Can't say much more, I just think that people should say something like 'Mages itemazation is very binary' instead of 'It sucks'.

Aftershock just amplifies this a ton - it basically matches electrocute at level 1 while also giving you strong resistances. Tanks are the only ones who can deal with ranged harass effectively. So that's why bruisers and fighters were largely crowded out. The only alternative is full damage champs like gp.\nDue to stuff like pta, aa champs can also nearly match the burst of a caster-based champ in the EARLY game when the caster-based champ should be stronger by far. But of course, Riot has decided lately that they don't like champs bullying hard early (renekton, leona, etc.). Meanwhile, hyperscaling champs are allowed to match or nearly match the power of a early game champ in the early game while scaling to the point they bully 5x as hard as they should be getting bullied early if the lane bully champ were allowed to properly do their job? Ex: taric vs leona (close battle early, taric almost matches the cc and makes team way more unkillable mid/late). Also individual durability of the champs. How is this ok? Ex: renekton vs gp, jax, fiora. So, the latter 3 can all duel with renekton early game if they aren't complete idiots about it. Miss a few cs, nothing to put them way behind. Even kill renekton if he makes a mistake or in some cases simply doesn't outplay. But can this be flipped mid/late game? Can renekton do the same thing to a fiora, jax, or gp who messes up?

That particular runes page allows ADCs to have a more sustained damage and literally makes it a game of which ADC can manage their resources better (Mana/CDs) and or who can get ganked first before the first back/death. From their it's literally just a snowball since the extended laning phase (If you can call it that) allows more accumulation of gold including any kills from it which leads to quicker power spikes after first back. From their it's simply who had the chance to maximize their itemization and whose kit ramped up quicker for example the reason why Vayne who is traditionally a late game duelist now power spikes around with just BF Sword and Static at 15-20 minutes is because of this reasoning. Honestly Riot just needs to nerf damage on ADCs plus some more (since most runes gives a more inherent gold effective boost) instead of keep increasing every other champs to match that same power overall.
