You should be able to resolve this by swapping over to the Legacy Client (from login) to visit the store and cause a sync of your IP balance with the server again.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/drrzBd9.png\n\nLet me know if this worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2017-03-01T06:02:14.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played a few games, until i had enough.

It is fixable if you swap over the Legacy Client using the instructions in my first reply.\n\nHit me back if you still have issues with your IP balance after trying that fix.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
