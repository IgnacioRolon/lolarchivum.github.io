Too big to conceal, too cumbersome to use discreetly, too heavy to wield quickly, and too obvious to give the impression that your victim died of anything other than \"violent end enforced by a man with a longsword\". \n\nAssassination is about more than just killing people; it's about doing it _quickly and quietly_, particularly while avoiding notice both while entering and leaving the scene. A good assassin leaves no trace of his presence but a corpse and a bloodstain, a _great_ assassin doesn't even leave a bloodstain, and the _best_ assassins make it look blatantly obvious that the victim committed suicide, had a plausible accident, died of natural causes or health complications, or perhaps were just murdered by someone else entirely who had every good reason to commit the deed and absolutely no alibi to place him anywhere other than the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.\n\nPoint is, longswords are not discreet, and a \"master assassin\" by definition can never afford to be _not_ discreet. Granted, that wouldn't stop him from using a longsword for normal day-to-day broad daylight self-defense since defending yourself with well-honed assassination techniques would raise eyebrows (and I suppose it would deflect suspicion of someone was well enough known for their traditional swordplay that they wouldn't be at the top of a list of suspects for murder by tiny knives and strangulation), but you can't say with a straight face that this \"master assassin\" brings a longsword to his night job. Especially not if you try to argue that he can because he's \"just that good\" as if this were the same as Jax being able to kill a man with a broken lamp-post because that's not how any of this works.\n\n\nAlso: has anyone ever told you your apparent inability to draw the line between in-character and out-of-character is _very disturbing_?","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-20T23:14:00.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR\n\nHe uses a longsword, because he's a master of the blade, the longsword is used in dueling, he actually has a whole belt of small knives, like Kata's which he uses for long distance assassination, on one of his boots he carries a hidden dagger which he uses for the actual assassination, because General Du Couteau as one, is not like a grandmaster of assassination, but in the art of blade dancing and sword to sword dueling, that's why his combat abilities are superior to Katarina's or Talon, because he has combat abilities they never had the chance to master. \nHE's MY DADDY ?OKAY?

There's a time and place for everything, and that place is the Roleplay forums and nowhere else.\n\nI had a feeling you would bring up Assassin's Creed eventually, which is funny because a friend of mine who has a college degree in history often jokes about how bad an assassin the main characters in those games tend to be given how many bodies other than your target you leave behind. The point of a good assassin is that only the person or persons of interest die, and nobody knows who killed them, if they can even tell they didn't just commit suicide or have an accident. If you need to bring a weapon like a longsword to that kind of job, you are clearly not very good at doing that.\n\nBut all of this is a bit of a moot point since as others may have mentioned General Marcus DuCouteau's last known status was \"missing and presumed dead\", and I don't think Riot has brought back someone who had died as part of someone's backstory before; I know there are characters who are or were dead as part of their backstory, but most if not all of them were introduced as such from the beginning rather than having been part of another character's background and then later introduced as a champion themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-23T08:31:20.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, the creators cannot proof anything, about anyone in reality. \nSecondly I didn't mean the assassin creed as corpse numbers, but as gear and the sword Altair uses, which is a class of longsword.\nThirdly, General Du Couteau isn't really an assassin in his job, but a Generral and a Swordsman, so his main tool drops to a sword unlike his daughter dual short swords....\n\nArguing with me on any of these points, is just a way to make break out of my good Kitty behavior and become my champion in terms of being pissed of and then I really act too drastically close to her...

So get out of your video game world, where assassins just sneak in the shadows and go carefully and stab someone in the back with a dagger, this isn&#x27;t Skyrim. \n> \n> Oh forgot to mention, remember that president that got assassinated? Who isn&#x27;t even my job to know his name, or even the fact that he got assassinated, giving the fact I live in the other end of the world? Yeah, that guy got assassinated by a BULLET, a sniper BULLET... Which isn&#x27;t a blade as you claim it should be done.\n> \n> Have a nice evening and do please avoid arguing over stuff you are not well educated enough. Thank you my friend for the long conversation, I truly enjoy when I spent my time writing such long explanations for a single person, which will be forgotten in few hours most likely and never see the light of day again.\n> \n> Love, the unknown person behind the keyboard, writing this letter to you, who may or may not be the actual redhead of whom was referred earlier.\n\nThe notion that _all_ fictional characters are based on real individuals is false and/or exaggerated; _some_ myths and legends might have been inspired by real people, but plenty of people (myself included) just make characters up off-the-cuff from common personality traits or archetypes not particularly with any specific individuals, or sometimes base them on other known-to-be fictional characters. The odds that someone at Riot had you in mind when they made Katarina Du Couteau, and I think it's safe to surmise there was a time where you existed and were not aware of League of Legends or Katarina in particular. \n\nI'm not calling you crazy for liking blades and the like (lots of my friends do), I'm calling you crazy for acting like that's enough to put a \"may\" in \"may or may not be Katarina\", stating your headcanons and theories as if League canon fact, and repeatedly making statements in-character as Katarina (like \"He [General DuCoteau] is my Dad\") without indicating any separation of character knowledge. League of Legends started in 2009, and from what I've seen it's safe to assume you are much older than 7 years old, so clearly you were around before Katarina was and aren't currently living in Noxus (in fact your username tag says you're from Europe).\n\n\nAnd you still haven't paid any attention to a thing I said about assassination: I never said it _had_ to be done with blades, I said it _had_ to be done discreetly, and professionals in particular more so. This means that a dagger, hidden blade, garotte, poison, bare hands, or other such concealable weapon will trump a longsword designed for open man-to-man combat in a close-range assassination, long-range weaponry such as sniper rifles or timed explosives can do the job just fine because they get around the lack of concealability by eliminating the need for presence.\n\nBasically, assassination is all about nobody seeing you do it, meaning either you get close without drawing attention (which my point was a longsword is too conspicuous for that and would be a poor choice for someone who is repeatedly described as \"the greatest assassin in Noxus\") or you kill from afar where nobody can see you. Theoretically you _can_ assassinate someone with a longsword under ideal circumstances, but a \"Master Assassin\" would not settle for something so crude and inefficient.\n\nAnd yes, you'd be amazed what people are allowed to talk openly about in America. I had a buddy who was a living encyclopedia on anything historical, including but not limited to weapons and prominent murders of bygone days. It wasn't even required for his degree, he just had an eiditic memory and lots of questions he wouldn't leave unanswered. If it was in a fictionalized medieval setting, he wanted to know how plausible it was and how different the real thing was from the fake versions, and he just didn't stop until he could recite from memory everything he learned.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-24T00:03:18.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse ser.

I get to be myself and people never know if I&#x27;m serious or not :p\n\nOk now I'm beginning to see the bigger picture here. For what it's worth I've had similar gaming premonitions before (indirectly foresaw Knuckles the Echidna and Shadow the Hedgehog getting their own games, Mega Man Star Force 3 having Omega-Xis cards, League of Legends getting a figures-based tabletop game, and probably others that I just forgot about) but I would still say be careful about letting these visions consume you like that. Plus as one who likes creating characters for stories and games and the like, I would be highly disturbed if I heard of a person going around and insisting they were one of my characters (though I would be impressed and somewhat frustrated to hear they had 'foreseen' one of my designs) when I clearly had not been thinking of them or even known of them at any time during the creative process.\n\nOn the other hand, though, one of the complaints I have heard about Katarina is that her design is extremely generic, and I am somewhat in agreement with that notion. I feel like I've seen designs similar to hers before, either whole or in bits and pieces, in another game, be it a video game, an iconic MMO character, an example tabletop RPG character, or just someone's OC from the many forums and art pages I visited through my years. It could very well be that your idea for the character and Riot's design (tried to single out who would be considered her \"creator\" but it was on a team so I'm not fully sure who) were purely coincidental. The personality similarities you mentioned also seem like they could be just you projecting yourself into her as most of the traits you said you have in common are either fairly generic (i.e. there are enough people in the world that it shouldn't be strange for more than one person to share those same traits) or that aren't particularly prominent in the character as depicted in canon (you mentioned Katarina has a sense of justice that \"nobody notices\", and I suspect there may be a reason for that).\n\nHaving said that, there's nothing inherently wrong with finding or having a lot in common with fictional characters- I and a few of my friends all have someone from a show or a game that we joke about being dead-ringers to- the problem only arises when you \"cross the streams\" and start genuinely confusing the fantasy with the reality to the degree that it's no longer joking. You can go RP as Katarina all you want, just don't forget how to take off the mask is all.\n\n\nAnd finally I probably _could_ find out who you are over the Internet because there is _always_ someone who knows and always ways to find out such things, but I'm not gonna because even though I know how, I'm too lazy to bother and actually doing that would be rude and creepy and at least partially illegal.\n\n\nBut yeah, I've been dragging this out much longer than it had to be. Sorry for wasting your time and mine, you go have fun doing your thing, just... don't hurt yourself, ok? I would feel bad knowing someone I spent this much time talking to actually had a breakdown or something.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-24T07:17:16.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me thing... I don't actually plan on hurting myself over the words of someone on the internet claiming he's a hacker and can hack me and know all, about me, even if my online information is less than my care towards you :))\n\nAnd I don't know how the traits as a combination are so common, I never met a person like that and if I had I wouldn't be here at the moment, because I would be enjoying time with such a person, because I truly enjoy the traits... And the basic I still haven't seen anything similar to her design to hers in other games or movies or books or anything to be honest... But if you truly claim the new games that appear and literally copy her with small visual changes is similar design of her towards them, then you got stuff very very wrong...
