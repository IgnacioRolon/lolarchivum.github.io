The reason I&#039;m curious as it is a duo theme skin with Twisted Fate. And in the past shared themes only got minor updates, See Pentakill Yorick.\r\n\r\nI am hoping the skin as well as TFs splash get updates, as they are Xayah and Rakan before Xayah and Rakan. It is also IMO Eves best skin, at least right now.\r\n\r\nMaybe it could be a more active splash. Something like Eve and TF mid dance instead of striking a pose like right now.\r\n\r\n(Personally my idea for the splash is more of a first person view of the other person mid dance with a bunch of motion blur in the background but thats my personal idea)","replies":[{"poster":"Bunnymap","date":"2017-06-15T17:18:46.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're 2 champs and urgot rework away from Eve, so it's still a while away.\n\nBut yes, they will update all the normal splash arts. Hopefully since Eve takes up a large part of the tango splash art they'll redo the entire thing. Other than that, we have no idea what they're going to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-06-15T19:50:18.418+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bunny speaks truth. Skins and skin splashes are updated as part of the VGU process. But you seem to already know that, lol. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} Your real question is, how much will we change the Tango splash, since it's a shared one with TF?\n\nI don't think anyone but Reav3 could give a firm answer. The Tango splash doesn't look up to Riot's current standards though, IMHO. I could start bugging Lonewingy, Evelynn's artist for you. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Riot OwleyCat","date":"2017-06-19T22:56:17.565+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interlocutioner also speaks truth!  I'm a splash artist on the Champ Up team, and I can confirm that Eve and TF will stay dance partners in her updated splash, and it will be a whole new image.\n\nIt's one  of the Evelynn splashes I am most excited about :D","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-06-19T22:59:31.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about the girl in Giant Enemy Crabgot","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackfootedfox","date":"2017-06-20T01:28:45.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its the Eve skin I wish I rolled instead of Masquerade, tho I'm actually curious how the Masquerade skin will change with the update because I feel like it's fairly lackluster in its current state.
