As we all know, we have few origins like Noble, Dragon, Yordle, Pirate, Imperial, Glacial, Demon, Exile, Ninja, Phantom, Robot, Void and Wild. This is working pretty well, but i have a feeling that additiobn of new champions and origins might be problematic with actual distribution of characters. I'm aware that **gameplay > lore**, but to be honest whole auto-chess genre may consider both options as equal. So if the game is in the beta state, I'm suggesting to adjust actual tags of few pawns, according to lore and logic. \n\n{{champion:78}} - Poppy is **Knight** and **Yordle**, and this fits her very well, but I would also add to her tag **Noble**. Why? Because Nobles are just Demacian(I'll talk about Leona later, don't worry). Also i believe that this simple change could be a nice buff for her. Additionally, if {{champion:240}} would join the game, then he would be probably Imperial, Knight and Yordle, so Poppy would be harmed. Also that allows to create noble-yordle comp.\n\n{{champion:421}} - Brawler and Void, but in contrast to the rest of the known voidlings she is more animalistic. {{champion:121}} {{champion:31}} seems to have their mind and goals, but she behaves like savage beast, she is just shuriman predator-sand shark, so I suggest adding her tag **Wild**. Also her only task is to fulfill the condition to receive the void bonus, until we find a replacement in the form of Cho'Gath. Combination of Wilds and Voids seems interesting... at least for me.\n\n{{champion:555}} - **Assasin**, **Pirate** + **Phantom**. Well, he is drowned-zombie, so givinig him tag that represents undeads(and spirits like{{champion:203}} is reasonable. I know that this adjust forces another adjust for Phantoms, so let's increase the amount needed to activate the curse from 2 to 3... Pirates + Phantoms? Assasins + Phantoms? Pirates + Rangers? Pirates + Mages? Why not?\n\n{{champion:10}} {{champion:25}}{{champion:136}}  - They also should recieve a third tag. If Riot would love to add new Origin - **Astrals **(Celestials and Targonian Aspects). Lorewise they would fit to this origin. Kayle is  demi-aspects of justice, connected with Demacia and chivlary. Morgana is Kayle's twin sister, so in theory she also should be Noble, but I think that giving her 4th tag would be an overstatement, she \"betrayed demacian justice and became a heretic\", so Demon, Astral and Sorcerrer looks ok for me. And Aurelion... well he is magician-cosmic-dragon, this is obvious.\n\n{{champion:89}} -  I would exchange **Noble** for and **Astral**, she's not connected with Demacia and her place in this composition would be taken by Poppy.\n\n{{champion:157}}{{champion:84}}  - I believe that we need tag connected with Ionia, for example **Oriental**. But why? Actually Yasuo is only **Exile** and I have a feeling that next exiles would be {{champion:92}} {{champion:517}}. We need this tag to distinguish exiled, imperial Blademaster(Riven) from exiled, ionian Blademaster(Yasuo)... and later another triple tag Exile Sylas(Noble, Sorcerrer). Also **Oriental** turns out to be cool foundation for new champions like {{champion:43}} (Sorcerrer), {{champion:39}} (Blademaster), {{champion:64}} (new class **Monk**?  {{champion:77}}  and {{champion:83}} ), etc. Also we can transform Akali into **Exile** or **Oriental**. She left Kinkou Order and now she is rouge-ninja, that's why we can treat her like an exile. But she's actually focused on fighting with aggressor(Imperial-Noxus) for the sake of Ionia(Oriental). So we have to think about whether we are considering her \"betrayal\" or her \"goal\". If she get to be Oriental then why not Kennen, Zed and Shen? Because Kennen have already 3 tags, and ninjas are isolated from their country, they've got their own \"state\". \n\nWell, that's probably everything what if got on my mind. What do you think about it? Do you have your own suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-13T22:25:36.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With all the additions, there would be a ton more options to overlap.  In general this is good, but it risks there being too many connections that the game structure breaks down.  If we add 10+ connections, the number of champions needed for each synergy would be required to increase as well (nobles would need to be 4-7 or something).\n\nWorth thinking about, but I think they restricted most champions to 2 tags so that things wouldn't get insane, and be possible to analyze.  3 connects per champ gets very complicated to think about on the fly.","replies":[{"poster":"PlsRitoRepairS10","date":"2019-07-14T00:54:14.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... I do agree. Maybe I went to far with Pyke, Rek'Sai and Akali. But imho Leona, Poppy, Yasuo, Kayle, Morgana and Aurelion, are must have changes in future, if they add new origins. Maybe I'm delusional but Riot were talking about rotating pawns, or soemthing to keep game more exciting, and still balanced. Considering this I think that this adjustes aren't so problematic.","replies":[]}]}]}
