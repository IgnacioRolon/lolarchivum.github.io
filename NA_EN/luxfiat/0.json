I see so many cool ideas for skins for her like a cheerleader, or an arcade skin. The ult for the arcade could be rainbow and the cheerleader could have an R for Riot.

I get she has a higher number of skins than most champions, but none are recent and none of them are up to par with the standards Riot has put in place now. Out of all the skins she has, only one of them has particle changes and a recall. She deserves 1350RP-quality skin!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-04-23T15:20:25.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Lux has a ton of skins.

And the Lux-Community is of the opinion, that all the Lux-Skins are not what they are supposed to be. Dians Skins for example are awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-05-01T13:23:56.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno bout that.
