That player receives the ban. \nIf a ban expires that player must have played at least X normal games before he can go back to ranked. \nIf ever needed, a permanent ranked ban can be issued of course. \nDetails can be worked out, but what about the concept?","replies":[{"poster":"DontLewdOrianna","date":"2019-04-11T19:15:40.410+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, stop banning and punishing people bacause they say mean words and ban the people who are the actual problem : inters, soft inters, afks, people who give up early. smurfs.

We want to punish those that are doing these things by taking them out of games. Its more strict then a chat ban, but gives them more leniency than a permanent ban.
