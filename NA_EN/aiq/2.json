This option would just be slapping chunks/armor/garments onto her new design. \n\nOverhaul: Heavily modify both the feeling and aesthetics of the armor. Completely revamp it. \n\nIf you want to get more into detail or feel I should add another option leave a comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2019-02-18T22:42:04.014+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think if they fixed her horrible looking neck and make the armor a little more bulky, Kayle will look great.","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-02-18T22:46:50.432+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Bulky\" is a great word to use.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2019-02-19T03:39:02.946+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"“Useful” would be another.","replies":[{"poster":"FridgesArePpl2","date":"2019-02-19T16:22:12.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be fair, it's not like she's a tanky champion","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaroxas","date":"2019-02-19T17:56:09.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appearance doesn't dictate a champs role.

Completely revamp it. \n\nI'm not satisfied with the tentative state of Kayle's update.  The wings don't look functional.  Sure, they flap, but they lack the proper shape to do so.  While it's a nitpick, the departure from functional wing shapes is emphasized with the new design.  Her face, while not really an issue from a player's camera view, has a jarringly inhuman look (and not in an ethereal/heavenly way).  Her breastplate design makes me feel like I'm looking at an underaged gymnast, which is exacerbated by the prominence of her cuisses, which give the illusion of a fuller ass and thighs.  The contrast is dissonant.  Jinx's flatness doesn't cause that  visual discomfort.\n\nMan, that description just sounds creepy.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=AIQ,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=JAp0mcAL,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-02-18T22:30:59.490+0000)\n>\n> ascetic design\n\nThis is off topic, but the word you want is \"aesthetic.\"  Ascetic describes a form of self-discipline.

Perhaps maybe try to give her a different body shape, face shape, or hair style while I'm at it (her old hair style suited her way better, and while the face isn't the biggest deal with Kayle, to me the only requirement that needs to stay is that she needs to look somewhat like Morgana.

Perhaps the colors are supposed to show how much Kayle has influenced Demacia while Morgana has little to no aesthetic similarities to the country, signifying how Demacia favored one sister while shunning the other. But I think I personally would have preferred it if both sisters had a little bit of Demacia's style to them, but had enough differences from it that they stood out.
