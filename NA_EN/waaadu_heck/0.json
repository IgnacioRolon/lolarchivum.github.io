GOOD JOB RIIIIITO\" -----------------------------------This was my previous post, and riot thinks thats breaking the in game rule and DELETED my post !!!!!!! but not banning the right person.  what a nice move~~~~~~~~  I wonder how was that making sense, im just helping people or victims like me to do the right thing since RIOT COMPANY WON'T do the right thing. AND I submitted at least 3 tickets and RIOT just ignored it.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2020-01-08T05:37:41.814+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI removed your thread earlier because you said: \n\n>ha , thx for letting me know, and i submitted over 3 times and it wont work, and this is the reason why im letting everyone know we can now all toxic in chinese lul\n\nIn my removal message, it specifically stated not to encourage others to break in-game rules.

Im sure an extensive, methodical, high level study was done that was peer reviewed. I'm sure it was done without bias or prior motive. Don't be toxic in ANY language. Report them at the end of the game and move on. You don't know they weren't punished either. Don't be toxic. Take responsibility for your own actions. Report and move on. And if you were toxic (which you were since you were punished) then Riot did ban the right person. I'm not sure how you're \"helping people or victims\" by adding to the toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Waaadu heck","date":"2020-01-08T04:24:53.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"lol this guy toxic on me for over 30 mins and i responded couple sentence, and this is reason why im the victim.
