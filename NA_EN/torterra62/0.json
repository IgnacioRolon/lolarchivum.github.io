He has good engage and easy escape. He provides tons of burst potential and is able to secure kills without the use of his ultimate, this was due to his changes a while back in the assassin update where his w became stronger and provide more damage while also causing him to have to have good timing. This change on its own is very annoying but fair because he has the ability to stick to you even if his w takes time to prepare. However his W is not the point of this board. The point is that fizz will turn out just like Ekko people think he is fine now but they gave him such high scaling on his ability he a complete pain in the ass to deal with. He does so much damage late game with only so few abilities. It&#039;s good that a champ doesnt have to rely on all their abilities for a kill but isn&#039;t that what an assassin is? Someone who&#039;s job is to destroy a high priority target on the enemy team using a full rotation of spells, but also they take skill and good positioning. Fizz is not what i think of when i think of assassins that have good counter play. These buff are also very unnecessary the damage buff that his W is getting is too much and I&#039;m sure most people would agree that having 120% scaling is not fun to get hit with. Overall Fizz is already disliked by so many people in the League community and he is not doing badly at all right now. Do we really think a 50.57% win rate mid lane needs to go any higher? Thank you for taking the time to read this. Let me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"Thebiggestpanda","date":"2017-05-17T01:32:38.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Fizz needs 375 AP to break even in damage after this change. Sure, his late game will have extra damage, but everything up until that point will have him hitting softer than before. Also, these changes are likely to force E max instead of his usual W max in lane, making him more unreliable early. Its a good change that will likely kill bruiser Fizz but leave AP Fizz playable.","replies":[{"poster":"Torterra62","date":"2017-05-17T01:37:29.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i never thought about the forced max e change you have a point there .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gl√Ætchy","date":"2017-05-17T01:27:47.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Cause you know, Fizz wasn't a toxic af champ already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-05-17T01:38:22.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea Fizz never is OP or toxic ever.\n\never.","replies":[]}]}
