{"poster":"Poro Support","date":"2014-10-17T16:01:01.519+0000","title":"FEK Feature Request Thread","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"The purpose of this discussion will be purely for the sole purpose of creating a \"mega-thread\" of features you'd like to see implemented into FEK. \n\nPlease try to keep this on topic so that the FEK staff can use this as a handy reference to see what the users are considering the most demanding features they need/want. Also, please try not to repost the same idea too much. Instead, if an idea is already here that coincides with yours, please upvote that idea and if necessary, quote the original post and add any modifications you feel necessary, or ideas you'd like to add on. An example for this would be.\n\n> Original Post : Please add more colored themes!\n\nModification : I'd like to see the following colors : Black/Green, Orange/Black, etc.\n\n-----------\n\n-----\n\n*Suggestions that have not been implemented yet suggested by FEK users*\n**updated on 12/4/2014 **\n\nQuoting adds a \"Name\" from the parent it's quoting. Example : \n\n>#UserName:\n\n-----------\n\n**Responses from Fizz section**\nForum Titles\n>From the start, forum titles were meant to be special and if everyone is able to have a custom forum title then that defeats the purpose of their original intention.\n\n\\>Themes, along with the ability to customize them by font, font size, size in general, color, background, (possible sounds on button clicks).\n>This will be one of the last major features, since bug-fixing and polish are more valued. It's important that FEK actually works perfectly to begin with before making new themes.\n\n\\>Being able to view threads by page, rather than a continuous scrolling.\nI assume you mean when you're viewing a thread in Discussion View as opposed to Chronological View?\n\n>I can see no way to mod this and is most likely impossible using just a script. The reason is because when in Discussion View, the client doesn't know exactly how many replies to the thread there are which is the whole point of having a dynamic webpage.\n\n\\>Avatars above 100 x 100.\n>This will be included in the next FEK release.\n\n\\>Text Wrap / Formatting. When changing size of your browser window, it tends to funk up the post.\n>This is high on my list to fix.\n\n\\>The ability to see who the last person to post in a thread was, whether by hovering over the thread or like the old style, next to the creator of the thread on the main board page.\n>I'm not sure if the Boards supply this information actually. If they don't, then it's impossible for me to do this.\nIf the Boards do supply the information, then I will find out a way to grab it and put it on the thread in the Topic Listing page.\n\n\\>Image embedding.\n>Possible in the future.\n\n\\>Emoticons\n>Possible in the future.\n\n\\>Ability to self-change avatars via local storage.\n>This used to be a feature a long time ago, but it was removed for reasons I am unsure of.\nIt might come back in the future, but since I'm not in charge of the original website I don't have an answer on hand right now.\n\n\\>MULTI QUOTE\n>Riot acknowledged that their quoting system is pretty bad, so I'm going to see how they are going to fix it first before coming up with my own solution so that I don't potentially waste my own time.\n\n\\>The ability to \"sticky\" a thread for personal usage, rather than having to have a billion bookmarks.\n>Possible maybe.\n\n\\>Make sidebar collapse-able rather than fully removing it, making it appear upon click/mouse-over.\n>I've heard that this is already in the works, so my response is the same to multi-quoting above.\n\n\n--------\nChangelog : \n12/4/2014 : FEK update has included blacklist off of original post (previous update however I forgot to include in changelog), also includes forum badges if found in Riot's database.","replies":[]}
