You wage war on the dragons, but there are too many of them and you lose tower after tower. All the while, your enemy is too busy killing dragons to fight you, and so most of your kills are dragon take-downs--then suddenly, Dragon Trainer Tristana reconnects and argues for everyone to stop fighting and make peace with the dragons, but it is too late. Too many have died in the fight, hatred and fear run too deep to be purged by the words of an innocent Yordle; as the Elder Dragon rises from the depths to avenge his kin you sharpen your Black Cleaver and don your Thornmail as you prepare for the final battle.\n\nIt would be an epic gamemode.","replies":[{"poster":"AkaiNeko4","date":"2016-04-26T18:35:09.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, that went somewhere I was not expecting.
