Does any one know of have an article they can point me too? Fly quest is pretty much the old c9 without sneaky and meteos. Im curious why meteos didn&#039;t transition to fly quest like some of the other former c9 members.\n\nAny input or links to articles detailing why the transition didn&#039;t happen would be nice.

Meteos was still on the C9 main team. When they qualified for LCS, Meteos retired, Contracz went to the C9 main team, and C9C/FLY picked up Moon. All the other former C9 players were already there, and Meteos never had any reason to go there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-02-20T16:40:05.537+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
