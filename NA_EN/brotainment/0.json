This move put the servers much closer to Florida.\n\nSincerely, a player who used to get 35-40ms ping but now gets about 75-80ms so that you on the East Coast can get the same 75ms rather than 120ms or more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-08-04T09:15:27.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Plead to move NA servers to a more centralized location.\n\nChicago is pretty much smack dab in the middle of the North American countres that would use the server (y'know, the US and Canada, not just the US). Moving the server from LA to Chicago made it where pretty much all of NA has playable ping, instead of completely screwing over everyone on the east coast and in north/east areas of Canada. \n>I live in Florida and it should not make any sense that I would get a better ping in a server for hispanic people rather than one from my own country.\n\nthe LAN server is literally _in Florida_. Obviously you get better ping in a server in your own state. Unless riot moved the NA server to your living room, you're not going to get better ping than what you do to LAN. \n>I have notice that this huge margin in ping prevents me of playing champions like Camille or Nid in the jungle.\n\n75 ping isn't that high, and will absolutely not prevent you from playing either champ you mentioned. LA gets about the same ping you do in NA, and there are a lot of challenger players around that area. If you want to play on NA, just play on NA and adjust to the difference in latency. It will feel extremely slow at first, but you should get used to it pretty quickly.\n\nJust think, pro players have to go from the ping where they live (a lot of which is in LA, so ~75 ms) to playing on Local servers with virtually no ping, and they have to switch back and forth with practice and scrims/playing on stage. If they can adjust, so can you.","replies":[]}]}
