Someone who knew nothing about league likely wouldn't know he was the same species as Rhaast or Aatrox if you put them next to each other. He's very human and the Darkin are very demon/monster like, he's got a mostly purple color scheme while they have a mostly red one, etc. So I have to wonder, do you think there are any plans to give Varus a visual update and bring him more in line with the current darkin aesthetic? I know his voicelines could use an update but I feel like his appearance could too and that the aspect of his looks doesn't get talked about as much.\r\n\r\nNow personally I like his signature evil twink (or is he more of a twunk?) aesthetic and I wouldn't want to lose that, buuuuut I also wouldn't mind him looking more bestial too. I just don't know that there's a happy middle ground to keep his current looks while also making him look more like a darkin. Some horns or sharp teeth at the very least would go a long way I think, for starters.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-10-18T00:39:22.986+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Darkin corrupt their hosts over time.

Since we learned that Varus and the other darkin were once ascended, I've thought it'd be really poetic and beautiful if Varus had the form of a stag. Since Valmar and Kai were hunters and stag is an traditional game for hunters to go after, it'd be a cool foreshadowing. Plus there's the deer in the music video symbolizing their struggle to destroy the darkin before it destroys them.

Once they were trapped as weapons, they lost a lot of the specific powers they had once had.\n\nSo, odd question: is there a narrative reason you guys have talked about explaining why the Ascended all take animal/human hybrid form then, if they can reshape themselves to whatever they wanted? It seems a bit odd that *all* of them we've seen would say \"this is my go-to aesthetic\" and then *keep* that aesthetic for as long as, say, Azir and Nasus and Renekton have. That indicates that it wasn't just the passing fad in Shurima at the time, but something almost fundamental to being an Ascended.\n\nWhich also makes me wonder why those older, probably more comfortable forms aren't the forms that the Darkin take when trying to \"remake\" their bodies. I wouldn't expect them to be perfect copies, certainly, but I feel like they'd at least TRY for that apparently desired animan/human hybrid and land it a bit more than, say, Varus did.\n\nAny thoughts you can share?","replies":[{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2018-10-18T13:42:20.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not **all** Ascended were able to craft their bodies, that was an ability exclusive to the Darkin because of the dark magics that they learned over time:\n> Over the centuries, they mastered many forbidden forms of primal magic, crafting their own flesh and armor with equal ease, until they were completely unrecognizable as the noble warriors they had once been.\n\nThe animalistic form was also explained in this comment:\n> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ineA9uOv,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2018-06-25T20:46:15.539+0000)\n>\n> The animal theming (or lack there of) has to do with the Shuriman language/orthography and cultural symbology.   \n> Somewhere between ancient egyptian and chinese ideographs, shuriman concepts have symbols --often with multiple meaning depending on the context. \n> \n> So the word/concept/symbol for &quot;Lord or Emperor&quot; might be a golden bird...

Like for example Armor falling off, height changing, colors changing. Like if you get a bunch of kills with champion you become stronger so your appearance changes.
