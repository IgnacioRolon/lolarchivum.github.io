Years. And what did it take for me to actually finally say &quot;FINE, I&#039;ll play League&quot;? _Aatrox: World Ender_. About a minute of teaser footage of reworked Aatrox&#039;s form in cinematic action. I saw that and said, I need to play him, I need to play this game. Now, I don&#039;t play very often and I&#039;m not very good (this is baby&#039;s first MOBA for me, pls be nice) but it was this character that got me to go from almost exclusively playing simulation games like Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims to trying out a game like League of Legends. So, Aatrox holds a special place in my heart for that reason. \r\n\r\nBuuuuuut not just that reason, once I started to read his lore and hear his lines (especially his long move lines) I started to get a real feel for his character. Fallen hero archetypes are among some of my favorite types of characters; what does it take to make a good man go bad and all that. His range from mournful and reflective to lashing out in anger like an animal backed into a corner really made me emotionally attached to him. Yeah, he&#039;s a bad guy, but I can&#039;t help but feel a little bad for him. I mean just the thought of being imprisoned and sensory deprived for millennia is so frightening and viscerally horrifying that I couldn&#039;t help but get chills reading The Cage. That&#039;s a horrifying existence. Aatrox is a tragic character. And I **love** tragic characters. \r\n\r\nAnd yeah, Aatrox has done some pretty horrible things, he is objectively a bad dude, but sometimes I can&#039;t help but want to hug him. He&#039;d probably crush my spine into dust, but y&#039;know what? Worth it. \r\n\r\nAlso I really enjoy his appearance; his whole imposing aura. I love how his horns frame his head and face, his smoldering gaze, and his broad wings with almost lava-like glowing veins. I find him horrifying in an almost handsome way, ~~I find him cute~~.  I even have a stuffed Aatrox plush, that&#039;s how much I like his current look. \r\n\r\nI want to give a special shout out to WAAARGHbobo. I can tell you put a lot of care into the narrative of my boy, it really shows and I appreciate that. Every time I see you make a post and answer some question about Aatrox&#039;s lore I can feel the love you have for the character coming through. It makes me happy whenever I see a new Aatrox fact from you and it makes me happy to know someone else loves my boy. He is in good hands. \r\n\r\nAnd, uh, yeah! That&#039;s it that&#039;s the post. I&#039;m cutting myself off before I start turbo gushing about Aatrox. I know he&#039;s a very divisive character, especially among those who used to play him pre-rework, and I respect that, but personally I&#039;m really happy with current Aatrox. I play him a bunch (I&#039;m not great at him, but just playing him makes me happy) and I like talking about him. \r\n\r\nAnyways, if you don&#039;t like Aatrox, instead of coming to this post with something negative to say I would like to invite you to say something nice about a champion that holds a special place in your heart, a champion you DO love. Who are your fave champs and why do you like them? You don&#039;t have to tl;dr gush like I did, but hey, I&#039;m not gonna stop you!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-02-05T06:48:04.007+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw shucks, thanks!\n\nI do love Aatrox ( I’m unfortunately terrible with him even before he got nerf’d ).

Fittingly, i think, as she was designed to be a “tough mentor” character who pushes people to be their best, motivates growth, forces people to fight for what they believe in (both within “the test” and outside it) and leads people to fight for humanity in the face of undeath snd other horrors.\n\nAlso leading an extremely powerful organization  and having a variety of secret knowledge puts her in a sort of Nick Fury role— who arguably is in more books and movies than any other marvel character.","replies":[{"poster":"Bjartan","date":"2019-02-05T18:02:19.002+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Odin !

Do you mind me asking which stories you prefered working on so far? Which ones you'd like to explore further? I'm genuinely interested in knowing that! :O","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-02-06T01:50:28.216+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure.  But some of the ones I like the most-- I am exploring: Sejuani, Ashe the Freljord and... well stuff I can't talk about.    \n\nBut in all honesty, I started out as a comedy writer,  back in college I was always doing punch up and adding jokes for other people's scripts, going to comedy clubs, etc..   But as luck would have it, when I got my first real non-development, non-spec work it was on _the Walking Dead._  It changed the trajectory of my career and what gigs I was getting offered-- and to a certain extent what work was expected of me. (Dark gritty).     Not to say I don't like dark and gritty.  But I always thought I would end up on a comedy or comedy/action show.  Then fast forward a bunch of years (my wife and have a kid) and I end up on a video game, but I am still thought of as the dark and gritty guy. In part because most of my portfolio is mainly that tone now and in part because Riot was obsessed with gritty, adult GoT at that point.  So I wrote a bunch of that-- because that is what was asked for...\n\nBUT...\n\nKled was probably the most fun to write. He was the character I was given the most freedom that I've ever had at riot.  Also Spike's VO performance nailed the lines-- I totally want to work with him again-- if we redo Wukong I'll sign up!      (Side note: DunkMaster Darius was super fun too-- but I don't love the performance--we were rushed for time.)  I like Kled alot, my only real regret for Kled is that LoL leadership forced us away from Edmundo's original visual design. Kled was definitely more a goblin-king looking creature-- which was both grosser and potentially funnier.  (Side note: Edmundo's genius for \"character\" is very often overlooked at riot imho, because he not the most amazing draftsman.  But his characters clearly have a personality that is usually vivid and unique.)  Also that Ian Henry wasn't really given a fair shot at the design stings a bit. \n\nOverall, I'd love to do a buddy comedy thing a some point. (probably not with Kled... well... maybe with Kled.)","replies":[{"poster":"Falrein","date":"2019-02-06T06:52:57.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The comic about Ashe (and the Freljord) is indeed very, very interesting and you managed to make me like a character who doesn't really appeal to me to begin with, so I can consider your exploration a success.\n\nNow honestly I had no idea about your past as comedy writer! I'm even surprised I must say, seeing how you nailed the gritty and dark part!\n\nSo... Kled uh? Interesting. I must say he is really funny! Not my type of character but his VO is actually really cool (I love what he says when he kills LeBlanc haha!). \n\nI guess Kled is one of the characters that can fit into the comedy thing, but I can think of some others like Lulu, Veigar, Nunu... ~~Yordle sitcom when?~~ Anyway I hope you'll have a shot at that!
