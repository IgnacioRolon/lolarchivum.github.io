Any way to disable the unwanted animations would most likely help tremendously as my computer cant render them as fast!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T04:01:04.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We actually included a nifty little feature in the new client that can do almost exactly what you're asking!
