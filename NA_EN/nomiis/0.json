Ooh good ol' Rito.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, if you have seen what has been going on?\r\nPeople have been complaining about FPS drop, after the new patch (7.9), where their FPS was at a playable amount (most about 80-120), and now, suddenly, people are playing with 10-40 FPS :) _I am not one of those people, but i have friends with these problems, and i'm a techy person, so i have tried everything i could to help them, with no luck._ \r\n\r\nAnd i also see, that you once again just tell people it's their internet etc. etc. And we all know, it's not. Even me, with a $2000 PC, can see a difference in FPS. You did something, that ruined a lot of peoples playing expierence, and still telling them it's **THEIR** pc, **THIER** internet.\r\n\r\n**GET ON IT!**","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T02:53:55.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically those FPS issues are related to some kind of hardware or software interaction, and not at all linked to connection or network issues. On top of that, low FPS can be caused by a pretty large amount of different factors, like driver updates, how software is configured, etc. \n\nSince it's not you who was having the FPS problems, it's going to be a little hard to try and diagnose the main issue causing those frames drop without being able to get information as to what was happening during the drops. We can start by going through the steps in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) but hit me back up if that doesn't work and you can give a little more details about what was going on during at the time of those fps drops.","replies":[{"poster":"Nomiis","date":"2017-05-13T10:29:47.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, i knew that was the post i would get. As i stated in my post, i have tried EVERYTHING i could, drivers, client repairs, full pc resets, ingame settings, even some Windows settings, and i have gone through the whole FPS guide multiple times, and much, much more, i spent hours upon hours trying to fix this issue, with no luck.\n\nAnd, when the FPS drops is usually start as minions spawn. When not near minions & champions, the problem rarely occurs, it's worst when fighting minions for some reason. I have no idea what it's caused by, but i'm pretty sure it's an issue with Minions, Shadows or Particals.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T20:40:37.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! Those steps may not always fix the main issue, but we can sometimes use them to help narrow what's really going on. Since you mentioned that it's only happening around minions, you may actually be onto something there. \n\nIf some of the game files pertaining to minions and such are corrupted or somehow damaged, it could cause some frame drops. You also said you've already tried a repair which would have been my next suggestion, so let's go ahead and get you in touch with our tech guys through a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) where they can do much more digging.","replies":[{"poster":"BatiW","date":"2017-05-18T17:32:32.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've been playing on a macbook pro for 3 years now, with no issues whatsoever, but after the patch my fps drops from 70 to 01/02.. i have tried the whole fps guideline lol provides and i'm still having the same issue here. \nthan i started a ticket, we did some step by step stuff, ending with r3d game logs and hextech repair tool analysis and his final report was that my \"XBOX gameDVR\" was causing the fps drop, but that's just the funny part, i don't have such a program on my laptop and when i mentioned it to tech support through the ticket he never responded back to me...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nomiis","date":"2017-05-14T10:10:45.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay. I'll go ahead and contact your tech support in a bit. But, one of my friends got the issue fixed i belive, he messaged me and said he reinstalled in whole intire PC, reinstalled LoL once again (6th time..) and it was fixed? I havent heard from him since, so i'm not fully sure. My other friends and other players still have the issue though. Yesterday i also did some more research, and talked with my friends, and found out (as i said in the first post) that it started to happen after the 7.9 patch, for all of them. Anyways, i'll quickly send in a ticket, thank you for your time!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
