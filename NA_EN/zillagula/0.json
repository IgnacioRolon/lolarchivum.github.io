It&#039;s not about the damage duskblade provides.\n\n\nWhat makes duskblade **INCREDIBLY** broken is the &quot;Nightstalker&quot; passive. No, it&#039;s not the damage portion.\n\nThe thing is, at the bottom of your screen (above your abilities) when you have duskblade you can see if Nightstalker is up. Let me quote the passive:\n&quot;After being unseen for at least 1 second, your next basic attack against an enemy champion deals x&quot;\n\nI know alot of people don&#039;t know about this, but I&#039;ve abused it for a while. If you haven&#039;t figured it out yet, I&#039;ll tell you exactly what&#039;s wrong.\nThis passive allows you to go in a bush and you will ALWAYS be able to tell if its warded or not.\n\nIf the bush isn&#039;t warded, the Nightstalker passive duskblade provides will be at the bottom as per usual.\n\nif it IS warded however, your passive will start fading away. You may not be able to break the ward like you can with the &quot;Blackout&quot; passive, but this means it becomes WAY easier setting up ambushes. You will know where the enemy team has warded the entire game after buying this item. \n\nAnd yes, this passive is broken. Vision is incredibly powerful but duskblade negates that. Assassins that knows about this interaction are always safe standing in any bush as they can see their Nightstalker passive being up.","replies":[{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2017-11-24T21:12:38.082+0000","up_votes":100,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2421}}  I thought the broken stopwatch was the most broken item because it is the only broken item","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2017-11-24T22:05:35.267+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/000/681/what-you-did-there-i-see-it.thumbnail.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-11-24T23:23:42.108+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}} Pre6.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-11-25T00:02:19.768+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean also after 6.

If Gunblade needs to be nerfed/removed then most of the items (for other classes) also need to go away.\n\nBoth of them are cancerous items with horrendous designs that for some reason have a chunk of burst damage attached to them. The first step in properly balancing assassins would be to remove items like that for some that actually offer a niche like movement speed from Yomuu's for example. Other items don't have to go away nor be nerfed, some assassins would simply get tweaked. Also, they are generally too good when compared to other items so they simply MUST be built every game. Woo, so many itemization choices.\n\n> Truth is, the problem is not Duskblade alone (although early game it does its job pretty freaking well), it is its junction with other lethality items that makes it broken because they all bring your armor down to 0 in the blink of an eye and after that you will surely \"consume\" the full damage of its passive. Not to mention that Gunblade is equally broken to Duskblade ONLY when you are ahead, and Duskblade is broken even if you are behind (not tooooo behind of course, and even then ...).\n\n...what? The whole point of Duskblade is the fact that it's so stupidly OP on its own. Other lethality items have nothing to do with it and are actually pretty balanced when you look at them. Duskablade gives all the stats that an assassin could wish for alongside having overloaded passives tied to it. First thing that needs to happen is the removal of CDR on it and the removal of the stupid slow that melees still have for some reason.\n\n> While with Gunblade, you not only have to wait (although I agree its cooldown should be a bit bigger ... 60-40 seconds (per level) seems fine) to deal damage as it does not provide you any magic penetration whatsoever (to allow its passive to reach its full potential).

Why are you even mentioning magic pen on that item?\nGunblade is the same thing as Duskblade. Really good stats alongside overloaded passives. It has an incredibly stupid chunk of burst damage that also applies a slow and it becomes impossible for someone to escape the assassin that's approaching them (which is sorta like the slow on the duskblade as well). The sustain only makes it even less interactive since you have unnecessary healing on champions that shouldn't get so much sustain. Try pairing Gunblade with the new rune, Ravenous Hunter, as see how \"meh\" the sustain from it is. Also, any champion that takes Gunblade benefits a lot from the sustain, not just Akali.\n\nYou should put aside your biased opinion as a Katarina main for a minute and acknowledge the fact that because of these items assassins will never be balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Ęsdeath","date":"2017-11-26T14:20:44.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Other lethality items have nothing to do with it\n\nYou genuinely claim that getting more lethality (and more damage) is entirely irrelevant towards the damage that duskblade offers - But I guess for you it has no usage whatsoever ... lel?\n\n> Honestly, you have no idea what you're talking about.
