Or is there some cap on how many i can buy? I think for mystery skins if you're only missing a few skins it won't let you buy a mystery chest. Just wondering if it works like that in this case as well.","replies":[{"poster":"iahim98","date":"2017-11-08T23:55:39.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bought my last 9 champions that way and 1 extra that I didn't realize and opened with the rest (oops), so if there's a minimum is over 10 buys, and as you can see, it lets you buy even if you have none left.
