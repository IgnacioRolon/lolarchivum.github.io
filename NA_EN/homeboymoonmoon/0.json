One thing that I seem to struggle with is picking supports against the enemy support, adc, or overall team comp. I just can&#039;t seem to find out who I should play during champ select sometimes. I know the simplistics like \r\nAll in &gt; sustain\r\nSustain &gt; poke\r\nPoke &gt; all in\r\nI just wanted to know some more in depth strategies when picking supports. My best supports consist of Janna, Zilean, Blitzcrank, Zyra, Thresh, Karma and Morgana. If anyone could help me generate a list of when to pick which of these champions in specific cases that would be greatly appreciated. Pop me your season 6 rank and help out if you can.\r\nThanks - Ribbet","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-14T04:57:06.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick for synergy with your adc or for an obvious hard counter, if you are low ELO (anywhere under plat, really, for these purposes).\n\nPeople just dont counterpick, and their skill/understanding of mechanics is often so awful that counterpicks often do not really work as expected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2016-12-14T04:42:01.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"generally i pick my Support based on my adc before picking based on the enemy is i dont have a clear counterpick.\n\nFor example, i will pretty much always pick {{champion:25}} into {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}}, and {{champion:201}}  into {{champion:21}} , generally, but otherwise, I pick based on the adc.\n\nI find that having a support that works really well with your ADC is often better in most situations than simply having one that is good against the enemy as you can always work well together is situations outside of just laning phase.\n\n\nif I have an {{champion:236}} {{champion:81}} i usually go {{champion:267}} or{{champion:201}} since Ezreal likes on hits with his Q. With Nami, your E goes procs on Is basically a free {{item:3025}} for him at level 1/2/3, and Braum passive gets proc'd by his Q. Lucian in the same vain can proc Nami E 2 times with his passive and proc Braum 2 hits of Braum stun very fast.\n\nIf i have a {{champion:222}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}}, i will generally pick {{champion:117}} since she helps bolster their DPS and Movespeed, both things they really benefit from.\n\nIf i have a {{champion:21}} I general go {{champion:37}}  because your Ulti goes well with hers and your Q poke early game helps bolster her Q poke for huge amounts of lane bullying. If not I go \n\nIf i have a {{champion:202}}  I go {{champion:40}} because the AD shield and peel Janna provides as well as the MS from her passive is very powerful on Jhin since he gets huge amounts of AD scaling and is vulnerable to being jumped on.\n\nIf i have a {{champion:119}} , I make sure to pick someone with early kill pressure and engage like{{champion:89}} since Draven needs to snowball.\n\netc etc\n\nSee what works by thinking these little things through in games. Play a few normals and experiment.\n\nOverall, pick base don what your team needs first and foremost.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alaric The Sic","date":"2016-12-14T03:51:19.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just 1 trick it. \n\nFind one you like. Spam it for a couple hundred games. Watch high Elo 1 tricks play it. Get  Gud. \n\nNever pick blitz into morgana or Braum. Ever. You have no impact on the game. If you get counter picked as blitz your main role at that point is to peel for Adc and to roam mid or roam jungle with your jungler and look to make plays else where. At least that's what I've found successful when I get countered.  Blitz wins every other support match up ezpz so long as you understand positioning.   Also if it's a team of 4 tanks. Don't pick blitz. \n\nI'm s6 plat blitz main. \n\nTrundle. Blitz. Taric are all super strong. \n\nPs.
