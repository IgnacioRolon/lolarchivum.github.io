Sorry to add to all the other comments of the like but its the reality:  this new client is an horror on performance!\r\n\r\nWe live in an age of high speed performance for website loading time in less than 2 seconds, and special optimization for ultra fast loading experiences on mobile with Google AMP and so on. \r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a lot of hard work went into building this new client but as long as the speed is not fixed this is a failure.\r\nThere is no valid reason for this client to be so slow, sorry to say this is sad and simply unacceptable...","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowstarthe1st","date":"2017-03-02T01:21:33.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issues, with the new client running so much slower than the old one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T00:12:36.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As with all Beta software, there are bound to be quirks or issues along the way. Performance and optimization are certainly big goals for the Client update team as they continue to migrate features into the beta client. Since I don't work on that team, I recommend leaving your feedback on our [**Client Discussion Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion), since this feedback could potentially help that team out a lot.\n\nFor now, I recommend using the Legacy Client until some more improvements have been made to the Legacy Client that will improve the experience for you.","replies":[]}]}
