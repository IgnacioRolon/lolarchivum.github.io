Hi! This is my first post that nobody has ever talked about. It's about client updates. When it's downloading, it takes way to long then it should be. My internet is fast so I'm sure it has to work. And the weird part is that it's literally 24.6 mega bytes. And here is another weird part, When it's like 1.5/ 24.6 mega bytes, or some random number, it would just go back to zero mega bytes after a few seconds. Like it seems like it downloaded 1.5 megabytes but the time I look away and look back, everything restarts to 0.0/0.0 mega bytes. Even when it's patching the game, after it's downloading, it will show the play button being ready but right when I make a lobby, it says I can't queue up. And so, I exit out of the lobby and you know what? It starts downloading again. Then after that I do the same thing over again and it happens again! It takes a while for it to \"actually\" download. It this happening to anyone else? I appreciate for your time. Now stay cool like zed  {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T04:47:43.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}} is much cooler first of all (dear lord my jokes are horrid, someone stop me)....\n\nIt sounds like your client might not be able to download the patch correctly if it keeps trying to repatch over and over. Sometimes this happens if an older file doesn't get removed properly, so let's make sure to double check for that. I'd suggest grabbing our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running it with **reinstall and clean uninstall** and let me know if that does the trick.","replies":[{"poster":"Jearbear Sloth","date":"2017-11-27T03:32:40.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It helps quite a lot!

How long does it take for the Repair Tool to actually download the installer?  It's been on this step for almost an hour now... and I don't recall it taking an hour to download it manually.  My internet is fine, I keep checking my download speed just to be sure.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nFinally downloaded.  Tried 3 times to get the game to launch and it kept crashing before it would even start.  Finally got it to start updating the patcher to the new version and it hasn't even finished 1% over 40 minutes.  This is ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}]}
