This has only happened twice and both were after i was just in a game. I know it's still running though because if i launch the client again then it says i need to terminate the instance of league that's still running. It isn't the most important problem, but it's pretty annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T15:34:26.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashing when selecting hextech crafting is something we've been looking into, and found a few possibilities that may be causing it.  To help rule out those factors, I recommend disabling or removing any third party apps/programs that interact with League.  Examples of this are programs like play.tv or Overwolf.  Hopefully, this gets you fixed up.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Sunglow","date":"2016-08-19T23:25:43.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any third party programs, but I appreciate your support and am glad that Riot is looking into this. I think its a pretty minor bug (doesn't drastically affect me or anything).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ultra Animal","date":"2016-08-17T15:27:41.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been happening to my friend an I as well. Not sure if the problem is on riots side or ours. Maybe their's an association with windows 10 or specific brand of pc hardware but prob not considering we run battlefield 4 on max settings without crashes.","replies":[]}]}
