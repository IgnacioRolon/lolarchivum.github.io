I know 60 FPS is already great and I can play the game well, but I am used to 200+ FPS and would like to get it back. \r\n\r\nMy device specs are:\r\nASUS ROG GL552VW-DH71 15-Inch Gaming Laptop, Discrete GPU GeForce GTX 960M 2GB VRAM, 16GB DDR4, 1TB (ROG Metallic)\r\ni7 6700 processor\r\n960m Nvidia GPU w/ 2GB memory\r\n16 GB RAM\r\n1TB HDD\r\n\r\nI have already browsed some forums and turned off VSync in both the LoL client as well as the nvidia control panel. I have already set the framerate cap to unlimited, and have also tried FPS caps of over 60 to see if it would at least get me to 120 fps. None of these settings have made any difference, and I am still stuck as 60fps. \r\n\r\nI have already updated the GPU driver to version GeForce Game Ready Driver v372.54. I have also made sure that i ran the league client by right clicking the launcher and selecting \"Run with graphics processor nvidia...\" to make sure its running with the GPU rather than integrated graphics.\r\n\r\nWould anyone have an idea of what else I can do to get my framerate back?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-22T17:52:35.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you installed the Anniversary update, which enabled the Xbox Game DVR feature.
