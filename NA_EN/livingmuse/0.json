Thanks guys. \n\n\nNote: My account was accessible and played a game when my friend tried it on his own computer.\n\nNote: I am on Windows 10\n\nI put in a ticket but sent in 3 afterwords, before realizing it kicks the ticket to the back of the line its been about 3 days since i last reported and I have still yet to hear anything back. Is that normal? (I just play the game, I enjoy it and try not to dive to deep into the community because of the toxicity I have witnessed so I am not familiar with how they handle anything really)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T22:10:31.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the troubleshooting done so far, and I'd like to help!
