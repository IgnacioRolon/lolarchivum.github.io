He was strong to a limited degree, but that was it.\r\n\r\nBefore, he could push well, and if the player was good clutch time, he could change the tide in a team fight, but now he&#039;s just ... bland. He could never be a Kat, or a Brand, or Kassadin, but he was what he was: Reasonable.\r\n\r\nI have all his skins and enjoyed playing him before he was turned to ethereal toilet paper.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work, Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"TÃ¨rminus","date":"2018-01-22T22:39:40.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure his being dead is why he currently has a ~52% win rate and a nearly ~12% pick rate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-01-22T23:47:41.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good riddance.\n\nNow they might finally realize that, like almost every champion that got a class update, he needed a full blown VGU with substantial changes to become a healthy addition to the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-01-22T23:44:34.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss AD Malz.... like a lot...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-01-22T23:10:19.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wait for Malzahar to be gutted, and I hope he stays that way until he gets completely overhauled in however many years it takes for that to roll around.\n\nIf the ONLY way a champion can be viable is by having an obnoxious laning phase with zero interactivity in his kit then that champion is poorly designed and needs to be bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-01-22T22:58:54.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the strongest midlane picks in dead?
