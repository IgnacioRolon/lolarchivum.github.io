The most striking result has been that people view a group as having \"balanced\" gender representation if there are only 17% women. Given that women make up ~50% of the general population, that's a huge gap between what we see as balanced and what *actual* balance looks like from an objective, numbers-driven perspective.\n\nWith that in mind, it's not entirely surprising that you'd look at those stats and conclude that champion representation is relatively balanced, with only supports and tanks as outliers. But I'd encourage you to look again: Marksmen are the *only* class that has anything like a balanced representation. Actually, Supports are *less* skewed than (+10%) than the total numbers or the Assassin/Fighter/Mage numbers (-17%).\n\nSo I'd look at the same numbers and come to a completely different conclusion, namely that there are only two classes where the numbers *aren't* screwed up: Marksmen and Supports. (Though I think we can all agree that Tanks are the most unbalanced class and that development of new female Tanks should probably be given priority at some point.)","replies":[{"poster":"Lissanna","date":"2014-08-29T18:49:22.823+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I'm the type of person who primarily plays female characters across different games (e.g., my WOW characters are almost entirely female). For any role I want to play in League of Legends, I can actually find a decent female champion that works for me. I can actually avoid male champions if I want, and I appreciate that I can make that choice. In every role, there are at least two possibilities for me to choose from, and I do appreciate that much.\n\nHowever, the relative balance of females as characters in games like League of Legends should ultimately come down to how much people want to play them and choose to play them. If you make 20 or 30 female characters no one plays, then having equal numbers of male and female options becomes actually a false choice (and would ultimately hurt women players by actually having weak female champions that were avoided). So, on-paper representation of equality has to mean more than just having % values coming out to be equal for male and female characters. What should also matter is how much people play them in practice (and understanding if increasing availability would increase frequency of people playing female champions, or whether more female champions would attract more female players), and how well those champions are designed.\n\nIf League of Legend has somewhere around a 10 to 20% female player base (estimated example), then having 33% of the characters be female is actually relatively representative of the League of Legends population (even if it doesn't reflect the population of the world at large. So, for figuring out representation of women characters for league of legends, 33% may just end up being more sustainable in the short-term, if people just simply want to play male characters more than female characters. What gender people want to play is ultimately a question Riot could answer with data of their own, and what gender people want to play ends up having to shape the game design in some way. In the end, it is really a complicated problem of what a target representation number should be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Septimus","date":"2014-08-30T06:38:51.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":o well said!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garlyle Wilds","date":"2014-08-28T11:40:56.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I think sometimes it's a little tricky to classify champions into just a single role (see Leona not being in Support, nevermind awkward characters like Fiora that are supposed to be a Fighter but actually almost play more like an Assassin right now), this is interesting to see actually number'd out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-08-28T08:57:29.575+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yeah i can believe this red fell for this thread also.

Tackling issues without a level head is counter-productive and hurts your argument more than anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrToasterWafflez","date":"2014-08-28T14:57:10.229+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL- The AD Carry is a always ranged and if you think champs like vayne are weak...my god","replies":[]},{"poster":"vins","date":"2014-08-28T13:11:39.029+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kaceytron is that you?{{champion:134}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"YwP987Eu8i","date":"2014-08-28T04:57:16.775+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"le epik gd mey mey lmao xD xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"CobaltBlue64","date":"2014-08-28T04:46:35.519+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I am a guy and I think it is fair to say we need more close combat female champions.

How many women do you know that are stronger or larger than the average man? If *ranged* was synonymous with *weak* then does that make Graves and Draven weak? I think you just pissed on the wrong mustache.\n\nHell, look at my name. Two names generally attributed to females, but nobody would call a valkyrie or witch a *weak* creature!","replies":[{"poster":"Lissanna","date":"2014-08-28T20:34:51.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"While the average female has less muscle mass than the average male, the distributions are still largely overlapping. There are some females who have larger muscle mass than some males (the female bodybuilders can do amazingly impressive things). So, in a video game, where characters are animated, there is no biological reason why we couldn't have some females being more muscular and less skinny. It looks like the female tank role in particular is really the only one underrepresented (with the other roles having a reasonably large representation of female characters). Thus, having one or two more female tanks in the future wouldn't be a bad idea, but not for the sake of representation - but because that means there are likely more untapped character concepts in that role that could end up being really neat.","replies":[{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2014-08-29T04:53:30.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree wholly with your point about tapping interesting archetypes and concepts. Imagine for example a large, motherly character, a tank or tanky support, who is literally taking care of the other champions. In fact I could imagine Braum being done this way in an alternate universe (though I would miss the moustache).\n\nI think it is worth pointing out that a lot of league's design is drawn from archetypes and tropes meaning that characters are developed which match things we expect to see in a fantasy world. Leona is very similar to a Valkyrie for example and Karthus is very much a Lich, Ahri does double duty as a Kitsune from Japanese myth and the more general trope of a seductress. This means that tropes that wildly differ from what we expect from both the real world and fantasy (for example, a female executioner with a muscular build who would satisfy the tropes Darius currently fills) are less likely to show up (not that I would mind, that concept could be incredibly cool) because it resonates less with what we, the audience, know. We are less likely to say \"oh, I get that, that's cool\" and more likely to just tilt our heads and say \"what's this supposed to be?\"\n\nOne way to circumvent this is to tie the character to some other aspect which is gender neutral. For example, women can be mothers, and seductresses, and Valkyries, or they can be more gender neutral things like psychopaths and punk rock powerhouse punching persons (okay, I went overboard with the alliteration there). Jinx and Vi actually do this very well. Though they are female, their defining characteristics are tied to gender neutral tropes, Jinx is a psychopath/supervillain (like the joker) and Vi's character is tied very much to her steampunk and punk rock aesthetics.\n\nTLDR: It's not all Riot's fault for using female archetypes and non-burly women can still be defined by things other than their gender","replies":[{"poster":"Lissanna","date":"2014-08-29T18:57:49.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right. I actually think having 50% female champions really isn't a realistic goal worth asking for, because it may not actually reflect the demographics of characters that would be relatable to people. It is still possible to ask for more creativity and innovation if there is evidence that a company is taking the easy route to designing characters at some point along the way. Non-stereotypical characters (e.g., muscular women whose boobs are covered) might make interesting contrast if that is a character model type that isn't well represented. If done well, counter-stereotypical examples can potentially stand out and become popular if they resonate with enough people and are done well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
