In addition, {{item:3068}}  is similar to {{item:1409}} in earlygame, except that it gives + 60 armor. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I know that as {{item:1409}} is cheaper, and gives the features of both {{item:1039}} and {{item:1041}}  as well as a smite improvement, it is absolutely legit that it be inferior to {{item:3068}} . However, in my honest opinion it is still too weak. This is why I personally build {{item:1039}} + {{item:3068}} on junglers like {{champion:154}} , {{champion:32}} ...\r\n\r\nHere are my ideas.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we make {{item:3068}}  deal no bonus damage to monsters, so that it would not be an option for junglers.\r\n\r\nSecond, we make {{item:1409}} a more viable choice for junglers, especially in earlygame :\r\n\r\n{{item:1409}}  :\r\n+25 armor\r\n+300 hp (nerfed from 400)\r\n+10% bonus health (nerfed from 15%)\r\n\r\nThis means we need a new build path : 2625 gold = {{item:3711}}  (1000 gold) + {{item:3751}}  (1100 gold) + {{item:1029}} (300 gold) + 225 gold\r\n\r\n=&gt; Some armor would allow junglers to take less damage when they clear their camps. I think it&#039;s annoying having to build armor in addition to my jungle item to be able to jungle without taking too much damage.\r\n\r\n=&gt; +400hp=&gt;+300hp and 15%=&gt;10% nerf : As we add armor to the item, we have to nerf the hp it gives.\r\n\r\nIf we apply my ideas:\r\n\r\n=&gt; In earlygame, with only {{item:1409}} you would get 330hp and 25 armor (value : 1380 gold) instead of 460hp (value : 1200 gold). (+180 gold value in earlygame)\r\n\r\n=&gt; In lategame, with a full tank build like {{item:3047}} {{item:1409}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3193}} {{item:3083}} (+1950 bonus hp with my Cinderhulk, +2050 bonus hp with the current one)  you would get 495hp and 25 armor (value : 1820 gold) instead of 707,5hp (value : 1885 gold). (-65 gold value in lategame)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the item is a tiny bit less powerful in lategame, but there is a true difference in earlygame, as you get some armor to clear the jungle.\r\n\r\nThis means {{item:1409}} would just be more balanced\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, {{item:3068}} would still be better than {{item:1409}} (as it gives +425hp and +60 armor for a value of 2330 gold).\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, I hope you like my idea, if you don&#039;t please tell me why in the comments and maybe we can try to improve it !\r\n\r\nRito please try this on PBE :D","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-06T00:44:56.537+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just bump the HP bonus from 15% to 20%.
