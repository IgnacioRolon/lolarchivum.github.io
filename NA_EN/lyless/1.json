It's not a crime. You should just not overdo it. Leaving the champion select gives you a short time out penalty in addition with a small amount of LP loss in ranked (3 if you dodge occasionally 10 if you do it frequently). The LP loss scares off most people, but unless you're nearly at your \"dream ranking\" (the ranking that you've been trying to achieve for so long and need a lucky winning spree to achieve because it's above your level), LP doesn't mean SH*T. Your ranking is purely based on your hidden MMR (which doesn't get a penalty). LP will always follow MMR with a lag.
