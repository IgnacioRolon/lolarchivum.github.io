You are a real stupid Bronze person for wasting her CC potential as a top laner. She doesn't fare as good there as a Nautilus would. And second, she has one of the best team initiation of the game, using her ult to chain multiple enemies and rendering them helpless, and letting your team deal loads of free damage onto them.
