Your team has 4 people who could possibly troll or disconnect (because you never do, right?), while the enemy team has 5 people who could. \nNo, you're not going to carry 1v5. But the chances that all 5 enemy team members are better than all 4 of your team mates is fairly low, especially since matchmaking tries its best to balance out the teams. You only have to be good enough to make up the difference in skill level. Or, even better, foster an environment where teamwork and vision control win out against superior skill (yes, it happens). Bronze is full of people who don't know how to close out games, who go hunting through the jungle for the last man alive rather than just taking out inhibitors (or the Nexus), and by the time they've gotten the last person (if they even do), the rest of the team has respawned and is ready to defend the objective. Don't be that guy, know when it's better to take objectives, know what objectives you should take (In rough order of importance: Nexus, Inhibitors, Towers, Baron, Dragon, Red Buff, Blue Buff, Scuttle Crab; obviously situations will change this).\n\nThe most important thing? It is better for 5 people to follow a bad plan than for 2 people to follow one plan and 3 people to follow another. Yes, even split pushing requires the rest of your team to be in on it. If there's no pressure in the other lanes, if the enemy team doesn't lose anything for sending 4 people to kill you, then you will die repeatedly for little to no gain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GroundRuleDouble","date":"2015-08-04T17:38:17.578+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's impossible to get out of B5 with that attitude.
