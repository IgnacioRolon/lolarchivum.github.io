And it doesn&#039;t work for me. The only I can learn is in game. Watching video for me is like watching a movie. It wouldn&#039;t help me become a better actor, by watching a great actor act. You have a base level skill. So, if you wonder why some people don&#039;t progress in this game that&#039;s why. Their are multiple ways to learn anything. I wish people on this board would learn that.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-08-30T17:44:20.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You also won't get better unless you know what your flaws are and go into games with the specific goal in mind of not making one of those mistakes in particular until you've eventually fixed all the mistakes you know about.\n\nJust playing the game without a goal in mind will at best only increase your ability to fluidly combo or to cs, not your actual overall mechanics are game sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyless","date":"2015-08-30T17:46:48.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Sword Saint,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6EuE0EIt,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-30T17:44:20.549+0000)\n>\n> You also won't get better unless you know what your flaws are and go into games with the specific goal in mind of not making one of those mistakes in particular until you've eventually fixed all the mistakes you know about.\n> \n> Just playing the game without a goal in mind will at best only increase your ability to fluidly combo or to cs, not your actual overall mechanics are game sense.\n\nGuess what?

You need to analyze the player's actions, try and understand why the player did what they did, and see how you can apply it to your own game.\n\nUnderstanding what is going on is crucial to getting better at anything, whether you are watching others play, viewing guides from higher level players, or even reviewing what you do and how you do it.

I cant tell you how many countless times i see greed be the main factor for poor decision making with lower elo players. I have 2 accounts, one in Gold 5 and one in Gold 1....and i still see it even in Gold. Lower elo's only want to play team deathmatch. People get greedy, so instead of making the smart decision and just walking away, recalling, or letting it go...they chase across the map for kills, stay in lane too long at low health, or greedily walk around the enemy jungle hunting for kills and getting themseleves killed. I only use this arguement b\\c i learned how to hold myself back from doing these things by watching streamers and videos. Just saying that EVERYONE can learn from watching others.
