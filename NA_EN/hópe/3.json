Give her only ranged plants, as I feel like the melee plants are a waste of her seeds.\n2.  Let her plants scale a little better on what she builds.  If she builds HP, they are tougher and last longer.  If she builds damage they do more damage but lose a little HP and life span.  Balance this around her core items in both lanes of {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}}.  If she builds armor, maybe her plants have a chance to ignore damage equal to the average damage reduction of her AR and MR, but building armor and MR lowers plant damage (ignore her base and growth stats for this one).  Maybe give her seeds the ability to be stepped on by ally champs for healing.  IDK, just spitballing on the last one.  \n3.  Have auto attacks lower the CD of her passive by up to a second.\n4.  What if her Q and E left slowing zones for a second or two after you cast them?  Maybe they deal a tiny bit of damage if an enemy walks into them, so even if you don't get all the enemy champs with the initial cast the thorny vines that remain have a little residual zoning power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrostQueensPlane","date":"2018-04-21T16:15:12.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Billion dollar company, can't walk and chew gum at the same time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2018-04-21T13:02:07.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What if they just reworked Zyra.  \n\nSo something like this.\n\nPassive:  Every spell that Zyra lands on an enemy/enemies plants a seed within their skin.  The seed last for 4/8/12 seconds (Levels 1/7/13).  After the duration of the FIRST implanted seed, the seed will sprout. \n\n1 Seed:  The seed sprouts drains 1/3/5% of the enemies current hp (Only to Champions and monsters).  After the draining is complete; Zyra can go over to the plant to pick up the hp that has been drained.\n2 Seeds:  The seeds sprout causing the enemy to be slowed by 40% for 1.75 seconds also dealing 3% of the enemies current hp. (Yes 3% to not make it overpowered)\n3 Seeds:  The seeds sprout causing the enemy to be rooted in place requiring them to kill the singular plant on top of them.  The plant's hp is 40+10/lvl+ 10% AP.\n4 Seeds:  The seeds sprout causing the enemy to be pulled towards Zyra (100 units) and is stunned for .5 seconds.\n5 Seeds:  The seeds sprout causing a reverse chain reaction, starting with seed 4, going to seed 3, onto seed 2, finishing off with seed 1.  Also instant proc upon 5 seeds, no delay.\n\nNote:  Only 5 seeds will proc them all, if there are 4 seeds, it will not proc 3, 2, or 1.\n\nQ:  Zyra uses a vine to whip her enemy, upon killing an enemy the vine will release petals that penetrate through enemies.  Vine whip damage:  70/90/110/130/150 + 35% AP.  Petal damage:  40/55/70/85/100 + 50% AP.   CD:  6/5.5/5/4.5/4  Mana Cost:  40/45/50/55/60\n\nW:  (Two effects).   1:  Zyra leaves a seed that goes invisible lasting for 45 seconds.  Upon entering its proximity the seed will latch onto the enemy revealing where the enemy is for 8 seconds.  (This will also proc the passive).  Second effect:  Zyra can infect the plants around the river.  Honeyfruit:  Each plant has a seed inside of it also converts current hp to max hp in passive.  Blast cone:  Every enemy hit by the blast cone also have two seeds implanted.  Scryer's Bloom:  Each enemy hit by Scryer's Bloom will have the W revealing apply after the Scryer's Bloom is complete no seeds implanted.  Charge System:  Every 12/8/6 (level 1/7/13) minions that zyra kills she gains a charge.  Up to 4 charges. \n- If plants are removed increase duration by an addtional 45 seconds, and change number of seeds implanted from one to three.  Proximity does no damage, but reveals.  Passive does all of the damage.\n\nE:  Zyra uproots tree roots, pushing her enemies back (all around her) (stopping all dashes and blinks because its too large for them to blink over).  Push back:  (from zyra)  200/250/300/350/400 units.  Damage:  80/100/120/140/160 + 40% ap.\n\nR:  Zyra pulls calls forth plants to surround her.  Healing:  5%/15%/25% Max HP.  Damage Reduction:  15%/25%/35% (until shield is taken down).  Shield:  30% AP.   Zyra's spells (not including W which can not be cast) deal an additional 15% AP.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-04-21T19:51:09.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of her affecting the Map Plants and they idea of her E doing a pushback and blocking dashing/leaps/blinks.

Look at how the mini change, affected her.  Any change that is done to her now, only impacts her as a support.  If we want to see her where she truly belongs.  Things have to change.  As long as she has plants that auto harass, she will be taken to the bot lane.  That was a bad mechanic and should have been addressed a very long time ago, but they double downed on it.  So that is why she is the way she is today.\n\n2:  I really didn't think about the numbers per se.  As if I had more time or spent more time to talk about it i might have been able to make better numbers.  The goal for this was to throw out an idea and see how people would feel about it.  I think this 1:  Is thematic of the Plant person feel.  2:  Still stays in line for things that could/would happen with plant people.  3:  Is still decent.\n\n3:  The reason why I included damage reduction + a shield is for shield busting.  Aka Irelia (atm, but we all know they are going to be adding that mechanic to more champions since they continue to add more and more to everyone nowadays)\n\n\nBut on a serious now, how do the passive and W make you feel?\n\nQ:  Is like a Lissandra Q, but the petals pierce instead of getting blocked by minions.  Hence lower base damage.\n\nE:  Is like Syndra, But has no stun behind it.  Which allows it to have more damage tacked onto it.\n\nR:  Is tricky tbh.  I couldn't think of anything thematic that would make her feel like a plant person, or a person with plant based abilities.  I was thinking of making her ulti.\n\n- Creates a path of petals, where enemies caught inside must still inside the path of petals.  (They can still flash out of it).  Enemies can not dash, and all of Zyra's spells ricochet off of the walls. (aside from w.)  each spell hitting a champion at max 2 times.  (So Petals would bounce around inside the path until it reached the end of it.)  (Roots would slowly push everything AWAY from zyra until it got to the end of the path.)  (note that Zyra could use this from behind the enemy lines forcing everyone caught in it to by pushed towards her team.  Its like a Taliyah ulti but the instead of one thicc wall, its two thin walls + a poppy W while inside the field.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-21T18:29:41.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the passive is interesting, but each tier needs to do more damage than the previous to avoid a feeling of \"punishment\" for landing more skills.\n\nI do really like the W.
