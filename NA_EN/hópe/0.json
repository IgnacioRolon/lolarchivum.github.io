You can get a move line, then a ward line, then an ability line, then an attack champ line, then another attack champ line getting triggered off of a minion all one after another, and it's just a lot. I just added a little cooldown for VO between all those lines, and then added a bit more off a cooldown between attack and move lines. It's not a huge difference, she just feels more open when you play her now. Hope that works for you! Hit me back here if in patch 8.2 she feels like she doesn't talk enough!","replies":[{"poster":"Diggity Jones","date":"2018-01-10T17:57:42.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vonderhamz,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=F4RXWtOi,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2018-01-05T18:13:54.918+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s for the skin as a whole across all languages - We want to make sure that she feels more dynamic and fun to play, and I totally agree with Hope on this one; I was actually the guy who implemented her, and she just has so many dang things that cause her to talk.
