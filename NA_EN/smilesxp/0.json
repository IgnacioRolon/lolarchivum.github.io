You're still gaining honor at the normal pace, but it's good to keep in mind that not every will rank up at the same pace due to simply playing a different amount of games and getting a different amount of honors in each game.","replies":[{"poster":"Heinous Bearclaw","date":"2017-10-30T22:13:44.359+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"It seems like people who don't play every single day don't rank up as fast, or even at all.\n\nDoes the system check for a certain flat frequency over time, or does it scale proportional to frequency of play?\n\nPut another way - will someone who gets honored for 90 out of 100 games played in a month advance at the same rate as someone who gets honored for 9 of only 10 games played in the same timespan of one month?

The reason being the person who played 90 games and got honored in all of them....well that person now has about 81 more honors than the other person. \n\nMore games being played and getting more honors is obviously going to rank you up faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Heinous Bearclaw","date":"2017-11-01T17:54:13.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's utterly absurd.\n\nWhy in the world do two people with the same percentage of games honored over the same time period rank up at different rates? It should be a proportional measure - not a flat one. Anything else is intrinsically unfair.\n\nHaving more raw honor points is not indicative of being a more honorable player. Remember - the person who got 81 more honors also had **_90 more chances to earn honor_**.\n\nEach player was honorable for an equivalent portion of the total games they played - 90% each.  But despite having identical ratios of honored games to unhonored ones, the player who has more free time automatically gets the bigger reward? How is that remotely fair?\n\nSuppose the person who played 100 games only got honored in 20 of them. That's still over twice as many honors as the person who got 9 honors in 10 games. Do they still rank up faster? Because if so, now you're rewarding someone with only a 20% rate of honorable games more than you are rewarding someone with a 90% rate. That's insane.\n\nRaw numbers are meaningless. **_Consistency_** should be the primary factor, proportional to total games played. Otherwise you punish highly honorable players who don't play very frequently, and disproporionately reward far less honorable plays just because they play more frequently.\n\nPlease pass this concern up the chain to your fellow Rioters. A grave mistake has been made here, and it needs to be addressed as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T00:52:14.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simplest answer? This isn't a percentage based system or you would have honor rank 5 after only one honor. It's fine to disagree, but doing so here in H&S doesn't do much good since we can't make design changes to the game. This kind of feedback is great to hear, but it'd be most effective posted under General Discussion or Client Discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Heinous Bearclaw","date":"2017-11-02T12:25:24.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be ridiculous.\n\nObviously it would have to have some minimum requirements be met in order for it to register and for a player to earn progress in the system, which would be trivially easy to implement.\n\nRanked play operates in a similar fashion, does it not? And yet no one gets Diamond after one game. You have to play a certain number of qualifying matches, and you have to maintain your rank over time. I see no logical reason a similar system couldn't be - and isn't - employed for honor ranks.\n\nAlso, I politely asked you to pass this up the chain and ensure the proper people hear of this concern. Please don't turn around and chastise me for posting in this section of the forums when I didn't create this thread here - I merely took part in the broader existing conversation.\n\nOf course, you may rest assured that if you don't bring this to the attention of your colleagues, I certainly will be doing so as time permits me. I'm quite fine with you personally disagreeing with my point of view, but I hadn't expected a simple customer request to be so flippantly dismissed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kitoandasu","date":"2017-11-29T06:36:14.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Heinous Bearclaw,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=WPTccFdV,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-10-30T22:13:44.359+0000)\n>\n> It seems like people who don&#x27;t play every single day don&#x27;t rank up as fast, or even at all.\n> \n> Does the system check for a certain flat frequency over time, or does it scale proportional to frequency of play?\n> \n> Put another way - will someone who gets honored for 90 out of 100 games played in a month advance at the same rate as someone who gets honored for 9 of only 10 games played in the same timespan of one month?
