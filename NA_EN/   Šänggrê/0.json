After my two chat restrictions, I reformed for 9 months. And I got full honor. Suddenly one game, I say bad a couple of times, noob also, because a feeding alistar in ranked was spam pinging me and saying way worse things. So it was supposed to go back to chat restriction cause I reformed, but it went to temp....??? Then eventually I got a perma. I never say anything worse than trash, and I rarely say that. just noob and bad sometimes. I don't know how saying bad and noob a couple of times skips my reform?? it was an error to ban me because I wasn't reported for 9 months and reform is a thing but I guess its bugged. I lost my level 210 account that I spent two years on and hundreds of dollars to an error in reform. Each time I go to riot support, they say that it \"wasn't an error\" but they don't even explain why. And it wasn't an error anyways sooo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-06-22T04:22:40.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"can you please post the reform card and the other material?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-06-22T03:44:58.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=   ŠängGrê,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bv4m4Juk,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-22T03:06:49.790+0000)\n>\n> I do not deserve to be banned!!! remove it!!\n\nI asked you over on boards feedback if the ban was a forum ban or an in-game ban.
