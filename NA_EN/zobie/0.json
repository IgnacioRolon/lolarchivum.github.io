But I don't know the account information so that I can access the ticket? Because the support made a new league account, and made a new ticket for me, but I was never told the information, so i'm confused. Riot please.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T04:26:31.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The agent didn't create a new account for you, they were asking for an email that isn't attached to a League account since (most of the time) hackers have access to the signup email and can get in the way of account recovery. When you gave them a different email, they sent the next ticket to the email that you gave them. If you remember what email address you gave, you should be able to check it and find the ticket there. If you're still having problems, feel free to just send them another ticket and start over ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
