I would open the app, the banner would pop up, and nothing would happen. I deleted the app, and I'm trying to reinstall it but I can't even reinstall the game because UserKernel isn't responding and the same exact thing is happening again. I open it, the banner pops up, and nothing happens after that. It says LoLLauncher is open, but I don't see it. This is really annoying as I've restarted my computer multiple times when it was working just yesterday and now I can't even reinstall the game. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T03:51:10.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you able to reinstall if you reboot your Mac and uncheck the *reopen my applications* dialogue?
