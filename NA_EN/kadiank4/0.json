This all occurred at the time of a game too. I was completely unaware that I was on the wrong patch as it had let me join a game, select my champion and then proceed to load into the game where it gave me the error message \"You have disconnected. Check your internet connection and try again.\" clearly I had not disconnected as my partner was loading into the game fine and we use the same router. I decided to check my connection by using \"Google\" and other such websites.\r\n\r\nI was not able to join that game and my friends were not able to Remake the game because it had believed that I had indeed connected to the game. When, I hadn't.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be resolved. The problem came from the Beta Client not updating my game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T18:04:15.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client will allow you to login, but disable you from joining any queues or hitting play as it patches you to the current version.
