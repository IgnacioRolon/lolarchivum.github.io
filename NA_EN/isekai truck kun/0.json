If you've been punished by the reports system, that might also flag your account to be kept from the alpha client, depending on what the punishment was for.\n\nAs the alpha continues, they add increasingly large numbers of players since the client is becoming more stable as time goes on. Maybe you've just been unlucky, and you'll get in soon. This last cycle they added draft queues, and in the next one will be including Ranked. At this point riot says they're opening it up to \"hundreds of thousands\" of testers. Good luck :)","replies":[]}]}
