One of the abilities would have to be a pull/grab with the frog's tongue. A toad looks like it would be a better tank, but as far as I know, it's only frogs that have long tongues...toads have to get close to eat their prey. The frog would have some type of poison that could inflict magic damage with basic attacks. The frog's ultimate could be something like a giant pool of puke that inflicts damage and slows enemy champions. As far as the last ability, I'm not sure. Fogs have such a variety of colors and looks that you can play with. They can also be very deadly.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-04T03:38:23.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Toads have long tongues too, never fear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strzyga","date":"2015-01-04T02:08:18.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So a frog tank?\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTznwGR5DVee6c6IEUYrAtW0B_XPkO_AzNL7f0wq1vqLbx2x_tJ\nHeres some concept art for you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strzyga","date":"2015-01-04T00:12:09.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnHvitKPsWximhg6_s31v0BBNxbZsU4DdONe8JaVvsyDekqMqB","replies":[{"poster":"BloodShotEyz","date":"2015-01-04T01:58:16.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been wanting this way before this guy was developed.
