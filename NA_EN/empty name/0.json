When I logged back in the match said it was played (which we did it was a full match) but I didn't get ANY  ip, or lp for ranked and this was my ranked Provisionals game, it was suppose to be my 8th but it says I only played 7 EVEN though it's recorded in my match history a FULL game was played. Please give me the lp, and ip for the match I worked HARD to win. This has directly affected my ranked placements and is affecting my time which I had to wait for hours also for the client to finally be fixed. I am providing the link too so you can see, it was the Corki game I played in the set of ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T22:57:42.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This all sounds like you might have had some problems with a ghost game as well. Op.gg isn't our official matchmaking stat site, so that data can often be pretty incorrect. Most likely, the match hasn't been properly recorded to our servers which is why it looks like you've only played 7 matches and why you haven't received the IP/LP. After enough time that match should be recorded to our servers and you'll be able to see those stats.","replies":[]}]}
