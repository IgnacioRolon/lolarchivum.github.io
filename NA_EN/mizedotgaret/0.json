We'll restore a backup version and try updating again after you restart the patcher\". After I hit restart, a dialogue box popped up saying \"We have restored this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.\" After I hit the OKAY button, the first message pops up again and I am stuck in an endless loop. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the client multiple times. I'm not sure what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-12T21:50:54.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a looping patcher issue today that caused errors like this.
