Basically, no matter what, it always filters &quot;foul&quot; language. This is hardly only my problem, as it seems many others I meet in my games have the same issue. I even went into my files and made sure to change my chat filter to 0/1 (it was set to 5, what ever that means). And still doesn&#039;t work. I&#039;m not sure if there have been other posts where Riot has addressed this issue as an actual issue they are working on. Even if they had, I am certain this is very low on their priority list of things to do. While its technically not a huge deal, in this day and age, its the principle of not being censored for the sake of pc culture.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-21T03:38:02.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After I had been on the beta client for a while the censor turned back on, presumably due to an update on the client settings. Once I turned it back off I haven't had an issue with it since.\n\nTry making a support ticket if nobody replies here with a fix and see if they have one for it. Maybe some other people are being affected too.","replies":[]}]}
