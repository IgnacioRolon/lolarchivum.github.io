There used to be settings to set maximum download speeds etc, but I can't find that anymore.\r\n\r\nRun Hextech repair tool showed no issues. Disabling Avast (which nothing else ever requires me to do, by the way), didn't help.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it would literally be faster for me to download the whole thing as a .dmg or .zip from your-average-low-bandwidth-budget site via the browser than via the dedicated client. What gives? Is there any way to fix this or change the download limit?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T17:12:47.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running on wifi at all?
