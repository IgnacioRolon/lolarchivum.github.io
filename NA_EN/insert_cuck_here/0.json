(champ riven included) (riot pls just this once lemme get what i want ) ","replies":[{"poster":"Win1Ocent","date":"2016-06-26T08:41:09.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel ya bro, i was just as pissed when they released striker ezreal again, after promising to not ever release them again.

At the end of the day Riot Games is a business or a company that needs monetary influence to survive and keep the League of Legends FREE. I am very sure none of you would want our game to become (Pay-To-Play). Another thing all skins are purely cosmetic, nothing more than pretty pixels. Now if you wish to spend you're money on them that is you're sole choice, yes we know some skins should stay legacy but what if someone new would like to buy that particular? Then Riot seeing that a large group of players would like to buy that skin, they would release it for a short period of time, so that players would get a chance to get it and bring in profits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Treeofwar","date":"2016-06-26T08:23:35.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are giving something for those that got it originally they are selling it again because the game grew dramatically during season 3 and 4 but you could not get CS riven after season 2 so its unfair to the new players that they could never get the skin and it is not their fault either.","replies":[{"poster":"Insert Cuck Here","date":"2016-06-26T08:25:21.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"and it isnt my fault either. release a similar skin. dont release the original thing. its not fair to the skin owners . i would kill for pax tf and sivir, but u dont see me saying it should be in my collection cuz i started playing the game yesterday? it makes no sense.\n\nthe compensation will most likely be some garbage icon that no one cares about. i paid big money and yet again idc about the money but the point still stands. its not fair.\n\nik someones gonna come tell me riot can do what they want, but lying shouldnt be one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-26T08:30:10.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It wasn't really a lie though.
