Please fix.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently was in the middle of play League of Legends when suddently my game froze and it said Attempting to Reconnect? After exiting and going back into client multiple times, it did not work. After a solid 30 mins, I was able to go back into my regular loading screen. But it said I had 20 min leavers?? Now I have afked before but just being disconnected and getting Leaver doesn't seem right. Is there a fix for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-12T04:45:57.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately there isn't really any way for the system to tell the difference between an intentional AFK or a loss of connection, but in the long run both leave your other teammates at a disadvantage, hence the leaverbuster system. Both essentially hurt your teammates in the same way, and these are more to protect the community from constant afk/leavers. \n\nIt really sounds like this was caused by a loss in connection with our servers, but that doesn't mean your internet wasn't working. It simply means it needs a little help getting a solid, stable connection with our servers. Personally, I would first check out my DNS settings as well as your firewalls/antivirus with the steps outlined in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Let me know if that's not helping immediately though!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrohammsWrath","date":"2018-01-12T22:19:23.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My buddy just started up a match and when the loading screen launched a error message popped up and said league couldnt launch because his directx wasnt up to date or something of that nature, and he checked his drivers and they were up to date. he hasnt dodged or left the game for a few days and he immediately got a 20 min buster. that makes perfect sense (sarcasm)","replies":[]}]}
