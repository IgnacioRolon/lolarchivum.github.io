Not only has Aurelion Sol not received a skin since release, they have yet to release ANY in-game content related to the champion. Not to mention that ASol has been disabled in the game for DAYS now. If Yasuo had a bug, they would fix that champ REAL QUICK. ASol bug? Riot doesn't care a bit. I've played this champ since release date and it's been almost nothing but nerfs since then. The (relatively small) playerbase has succeeded on the champ in spite of Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-07-17T17:21:09.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that moment when caitlyn gets a legendary skin and pool party skin\nzoe gets a skin \nand xayah and rakan get 2 new skins all before\n{{champion:136}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:240}}","replies":[{"poster":"Block Hopper","date":"2018-07-17T17:30:08.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep and all three of those Champions that haven't gotten a skin all have seen professional play to a fairly significant extent","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-07-17T17:21:47.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hells bellsX,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jmGdL8gs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-07-17T17:21:09.322+0000)\n>\n> that moment when caitlyn gets a legendary skin and pool party skin\n> zoe gets a skin \n> and xayah and rakan get 2 new skins all before\n> {{champion:136}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:240}}\n\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:163}} {{item:3070}}\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:427}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Block Hopper","date":"2018-07-17T17:28:58.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jmGdL8gs,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-07-17T17:21:47.966+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3070}} {{champion:163}} {{item:3070}}\n> {{item:3070}} {{champion:427}} {{item:3070}}\n\nHOLY SHIT I FORGOT IVERN EXISTED AS WELL LOOOOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-07-17T17:23:42.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tailyahs getting an ssg skin \nand HOLY SHIT I FORGOT IVERN EXIST","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-07-17T17:16:51.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, no.
