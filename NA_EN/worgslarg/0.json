It's difficult to compare a Mage to an AD Carry or a Tank to a Support because they're roles, mechanics, playstyle, theme, and kits are all different. Here's what I think in terms of roles:  \n\n**Best Designed Tank:** {{champion:54}}   \nI believe Malphite is the best  designed tank because of his high armor scaling, great interrupt, CC, AoE and single target mixed damage, and overall tankiness. For a giant, sentient rock, Malphite fits the bill perfectly.\n\n**Best Designed Jungler:** {{champion:72}}   \nI believe Skarner is the best designed jungler because of his low cooldowns along with self reducing timers, quick clear time, strong, spammable, low cost AoE damage, high survivability with a shield, high mobility, great dueler and brawler, line-style slow, and the greatest form of CC with his suppression, Skarner makes a great bruiser in the jungle. He is a scorpion made of crystals!\n\n**Best Designed Mage:** {{champion:34}}  \nI believe Anivia is the best designed mage/caster because of her weak resistances, rebirthing opportunity, spammable CC, high burst damage, great interrupt and confusion inducing wall, AoE circle of wintry death, and good poke. Anivia players value timing and precision, making her a great mage. Her theme is also executed very well.\n   \n**Best Designed Support:** {{champion:37}}  \nAlthough she may be weak as of right now, Sona is by far one of the best designed supports. She has great healing and sustain, spammable poke, mobility, and engage. She brings a lot of utility which is what a support should do.\n\n**Best Designed ADC:** {{champion:133}}  \nQuinn (and Valor) is the best designed ADC because of her strong poke and attack damage, AoE blind, scouting power, great reposition, and an amazing ultimate bundled with gap closers, blinds, and an AoE execute. Quinn, the falconer, makes great use of the theme.\n\nOf course, these are my opinions and most people will not agree with me. But hey, thats all part of the discussion!","replies":[{"poster":"4est Tree","date":"2014-05-16T20:01:12.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wouldnt consider malphite's ultimate a great interrupt by any means. kassadin's q is a great interrupt becuase its a lot cooldown and that is one of its main functions. malphite's ult is an initiation","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainWednesday","date":"2014-05-16T23:47:49.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can still be served as great interrupt.

She's not my favorite overall, but I think Riot captured her feeling right.\n\n{{champion:254}} - I think she was pretty well executed as a punching machine.\n\n{{champion:69}} - She pretty much nails the concept of a poisonous snake-medusa lady.  \n\nSo those are the best ones.  \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTo me the worst are:\n\n{{champion:28}} - I can't tell if she's supposed to be a melee auto attacker or a Q spammer.  Her last nerf left a lot of Eve players wondering what she is.  So if you can't id her archetype she's got to be bad.\n\n{{champion:103}} - I love Ahri's concept but I'm not sure what she is anymore.  She's not mobile without her Ult, and even when she has it, it is limited.  She's not really a mage now, but she's not an assassin either.

You take one look at his splash art and think - roving armored tank machine. Then you pick him up and what is he? A powerballing team-tanking gank monster. Every part of his kit feeds this fantasy - his powerball is perfect for the \"armordillo\" concept.\n\ni love the synergy between taunt, ult, and def ball curl. Again, with the armordillo concept it makes total sense that Rammus' primary way of fighting is to just ball up and let the enemy just get destroyed while they waste their time trying to break his shell. Even his passive is perfect- as a player you understand that this is a character designed to stack armor, and pretty much nothing else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rubitonabuilding","date":"2014-05-18T12:47:32.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support: {{champion:16}} {{champion:26}} \n\nJungle: {{champion:120}}  {{champion:32}} \n\nADC: {{champion:42}} {{champion:21}} \n\nTop: {{champion:27}} {{champion:266}} \n\nMid: {{champion:103}} {{champion:63}} \n\nThose are just my favourites in terms of each lane/starting place. \n\nRole-wise, I have to say I love Voli and Malphite as tanks, and as much as I hate him in game, Talon is the best assassin ever. I don't play her, but Sona is a pretty solid support when played well, and Ziggs is the best AP carry by far.\n\nSome people might argue with me and that's fine, but I really think Ziggs is the best champion Rito has put out. He doesn't have an innate burstiness (cough LB), so he takes some skill in fights, which IMO is more fun. Bouncing Bomb skill-shots and timing/placement of ults and satchels are key. People say he's useless without blue buff, but I just get Tear of the Goddess early, and farm up my mana with that. If I'm lacking mana mid to late game, I get Iceborn Gauntlet. \n\nBeyond play-style, Ziggs has the best character/personality IMO. The crazy explosives-obsessed yordle aspect is awesome, and his care-free, oblivious nature is hilarious. \n\n\n{{champion:115}} \"Whaddya mean, it doesn't look safe?\"\n\nMaybe I'm biased, as I was quite a chemistry nerd in high school and still love explosions (the legal type, of course), but I just love everything about Ziggs.

As it stands right now, he's very overpowered.  He's like Lee Sin, except instead of bouncing back and forth, he dives in and pentakills the team with no risk.  I feel with number tweaks to make Tank Jax less effective, like they did with Vi, Jax will be balanced. As for who I think the best designed champions are, here is my opinion\n\n**Best Tank**\n\n{{champion:12}} \n\nThe cow has seen better days, but he's THE tank.  He definitely embodies the idea of getting in your opponent's face and tossing them around.  Braum is an honorable mention here.\n\n**Best ADC**\n\n{{champion:51}} \n\nPeople cry about Caitlyn being overpowered, but she is the \"Renekton bar\" for marksmen.  She has solid damage, abilities, and escape options.  Vayne is an honorable mention here.\n\n**Best Support**\n\n{{champion:412}} \n\nDo I really need to elaborate on this?  Thresh is just an amazing support.  He has a great kit for helping your team out.  Braum is an honorable mention here.\n\n**Best Mage**\n\n{{champion:115}} \n\nZiggs is great for very similar reasons as Caitlyn.  Great escape options, and solid damage.  Ahri is an honorable mention here.\n\n**Best Assassin**\n\n{{champion:157}} \n\nI consider Yasuo more of an assassin than a fighter.  He has some great juking potential, and he has great sustain, poke, gap clear, and crowd control.  Zed is an honorable mention here.\n\n**Best Jungler**\n\n{{champion:77}} \n\nHe may not be meta anymore, but Udyr has some of the best jungle clear and sustain out of any champion.  He can easily burst down champions, and despite his vulnerability to crowd control, he's easily one of the best carries in the game.  Vi is an honorable mention here.\n\n**Best Bruiser**\n\n{{champion:126}} \n\nJayce just has a fantastic kit.  I'd say despite the clear cooldown and mana constraints on him, Jayce definitely embodies how a 6 ability champion with no ultimate can still be a ton of fun.  Lee Sin is an honorable mention here.\n\n****\n\n*Worst Champions*\n\n**Worst Tank**\n\n{{champion:6}} \n\nUrgot is just... I don't even know what Urgot is.  He's ranged, but he has lower attack range than Thresh.  He's a tank, so why is he ranged?  His ultimate just doesn't make sense for his kit, and honestly nothing else really does either.\n\n**Worst ADC**\n\n{{champion:22}} \n\nCue the downvotes.  Ashe just doesn't have anything that really makes her a worthwhile ADC.  Her passive is atrocious, she doesn't have an escape, and she doesn't really have poke either, despite having formerly the longest range in the game.\n\n\n**Worst Support**\n\n{{champion:53}} \n\nThis guy is not a support.  He's a bruiser who's been overnerfed.  His kit is very toxic in terms of the kind of gameplay in bot lane.  Post 6 he'll start to take CS, and he just doesn't belong in bot lane in this meta.\n\n**Worst Mage**\n\n{{champion:34}} \n\nAnivia is extremely squishy and doesn't have the damage to back it up.  She just all around isn't very fun or satisfying to play.\n\n**Worst Assassin**\n\n{{champion:28}} \n\nHer kit is just putrid.  The only think assassin like about her is her passive, and it's the easiest stealth to reveal.\n\n**Worst Jungler**\n\n{{champion:33}} \n\nRammus has some very strong ganks, but when it comes to sustain, he's just way too lacking.  His Q is his bread and butter however, and there really isn't a use to it outside of the jungle.\n\n**Worst Bruiser**\n\n{{champion:41}} \n\nGangplank has a serious identity crisis.  He's supposed to be a duelist, but has no attack speed steroid.  He's supposed to be a carry, but is massively outscaled by pretty much every duelist in the game.  He's supposed to be great in teamfights, but his ultimate is just not good enough.  GP is my favorite champion, but he's not fit for purpose.  Jack of All Trades, Master of None.\n\n**Worst Champion**\n\n{{champion:83}} \n\nAlas poor Yorick.  Yorick is the embodiment of how NOT to create a champion.  He has no counters, yet he is completely useless past laning phase.  He's not fun to play, nor play against.\n","replies":[]}]}
