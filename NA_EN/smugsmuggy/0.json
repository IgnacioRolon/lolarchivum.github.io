Thanks!\n\nThis is currently happening to me in NA. I've tried every single fix I've found and put four-ish hours of effort into it, as I had a tourny match today that I am currently missing soon (1hr25min). I'm on Comcast and I contacted them and they reported no outages nor maintenances in my area. No fix I found anywhere on any forum, even from 3+ years ago on the old boards have worked. Changing ports, uninstalling antivirus, resetting modem, whitelisting the league application and their sub-applications (LeagueClientUx, etc.), synching time clock, repairing client, doing everything in the Hextech Repair Tool, swapping to EUW and back, running as admin, etc. The one thing I refuse to try is reinstalling because my in-game settings are very specific (my master volume is 56 for example.)\n\nI've sent in a ticket and its not been answered on within 7 hours; hoping they respond and its a fast fix so I can make this tourny. Let me know if you or a different rioter sees this and can contact me somehow to fix it, or if you have found a fix/have suggestions I didnt list. Send help.","replies":[{"poster":"IrrationalLancer","date":"2017-07-23T18:55:13.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reinstalled the client (also deleted the cache and logs), didn't help.

I live in Illinois and I have Comcast, so there's some context to this screenshot. https://i.imgur.com/hx7ApaE.png This DOES WORK. This IS A FUNCTIONAL FIX/WORKAROUND. I am using Hotspot Shield, it was easy to set up (it asks for credit card info but you can just close that and it still lets you use the VPN) and it allows me to 1) Log In to league, 2) make games and queue, 3) get through champ select, and then 4) get in game but with high ping. You can then CLOSE the VPN once you're in game and after you reconnect (the automatic 'reconnecting' blue bar at the top when you dc from a league game) you have your normal ping and no packet loss. \n\nKeep in mind, this is all my experience. Please test this workaround in a custom game (practice tool's where I tested it) and make sure you won't hinder the experience of others if you enter matchmade gameplay. \n\nUnfortunately, Comcast told me the issue's on Riot's end, and Riot's told me the issue's on Comcast's end. Hopefully eventually someone sorts everything out, but as you can see by my recent soloq game https://i.imgur.com/XFS3EJM.png , I guarantee you my ping is normal and I have no packet loss ;)\n\nLet me know if I can help anyone potentially contact their ISPs; I suggest following this https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/I0gap1Fv-stuck-on-authenticating thread, being sure to use the SECOND ip listed (185.40.65.1) to test their route, then explain the results to a representative. This is NOT, however, an issue that a physical technician would need to go to your house for, as far as I'm aware, so I don't think anyone should go through that trouble as I was specifically told (at least with comcast) that those technicians will have no idea what this is/are not contracted to fix anything like this.\n\nIf anyone has further issues and wants to contact me since I think I've got a pretty good grip of the situation, my NA LoL account is Bes, my twitter is @BesLoLNA, my Discord is Bes#1481, and my reddit account is BesLoL (you can pm me there, idk bout this forum I dont really use it).\n\nI really don't want anyone to go through the 6+ hours of effort to fix this issue that I did, so please feel free to contact me if you think you'd like to do the workaround I've listed but its not going quite right for you. And as always, use Riot Support, as they were quick in responding, although its not 'fixed' they gave me an extremely viable workaround which is what I've shared with yall here.\n\nGood luck lads.","replies":[{"poster":"IrrationalLancer","date":"2017-07-24T17:07:09.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for all the effort.
