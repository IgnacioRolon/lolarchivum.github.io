I tried several times to play league of legends games after the update but the same thing happened every  time.  That thing was when I went through champ select and was loading into the game, at some point my computer would freeze, I would not be able to click anything or move my mouse anywhere, along with a loud humming noise going through my mic. I tried reinstalling but it still did the same thing. If anyone could answer this problem I would appreciate it. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSioxor","replies":[{"poster":"XxFrozenxXSK","date":"2016-08-20T19:47:20.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! \nI had the same problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sioxor","date":"2016-08-20T15:23:56.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this worked thank you!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T15:10:50.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few reports of some players crashing after the recent Windows 10 update.
