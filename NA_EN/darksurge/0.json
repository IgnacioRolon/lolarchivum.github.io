Picture Vladimir wearing a t-shirt in similar style to dunkmaster Darius clothes, swimming trunks, maybe with a thin jacket to keep the coat style animation and a sunvisor to keep the weird hair style. In his left hand he has a Melting blue popsicle which would replace the red orb he ussualy Carries around.\r\nWhen using Q the effect would match the popsicles blue Color.\r\nWhen using his W he would turn himself into a pool of melted vanilla and maybe strawberry or choclate ice cream.
