I love, love, love her tails! \n\nMy only feedback would be, watch for gameplay issues regarding her Q (does she have her passive up yet? Blue v. green.) I'd also pop her through a colorblind mode filter in Photoshop, to make sure spells and her model aren't hard to see on Rift! \n\nAs always, steller work with your concepts! <3","replies":[{"poster":"SlownD","date":"2017-06-26T19:29:59.019+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG *--*\nThank you for the tip, I will make some changes in her Q to become more visible\nThanks thanks <3\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-26T19:40:34.359+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FilDaFunk","date":"2017-06-27T11:51:12.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could the tails light up depending on stacks?
