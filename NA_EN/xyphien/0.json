I went over it for the second I was able to before almost dying (Enemy was in our base) and nothing happened. I'm just trying to know what that was about. I looked it up, can't seem to find any pictures or information on it. This has been the third game I've played in almost a year so I'm not 100% sure what all changes happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Raven Is a Bird","date":"2017-10-29T23:34:07.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you have an arcade corki on your team?
