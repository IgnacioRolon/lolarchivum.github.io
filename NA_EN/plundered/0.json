You should be able to resolve this by temporarily disabling any Firewall/Antivirus you have running, then head into your League installation folder (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends). Once inside this folder, delete the file named **LeagueClient.exe**, then launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (r-click, *run as administrator*). Once you've done this, you can attempt the upgrade process again.\n\nOnce the process finishes, you can re-enable your Firewall/Antivirus programs. Please let me know if this resolved the issue for you! ^.^","replies":[]}]}
