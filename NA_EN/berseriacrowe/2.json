I was merely doing what I thought was right and a good idea, and I even mentioned that I did not have the ability to post anywhere else and so I believed I was doing it correctly. If an admin does not want to move it over, that is fine I guess. I feel like I got punched in the gut for trying to do a good thing, I won't post it again. I'm sorry and I learned my lesson.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T03:28:48.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about that, we don't actually have any tools that let us *move* posts to other boards otherwise I'd have gone ahead and moved it for ya. You probably weren't able to post on any other sub-board since it was your first time posting and your Boards/Summoner level hadn't synced up. Looks like you're all synced up and Level 30 here now, so you should be able to post anywhere.","replies":[]}]}
