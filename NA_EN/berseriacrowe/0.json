It's not the same as the previous IP Chroma sales, so it may not have everything or the same expectations of previous sales.","replies":[{"poster":"BerseriaCrowe","date":"2017-11-08T19:53:20.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid I don't understand.

The Essence Emporium has all chromas that are 6 months old or more available (similar to how we did past IP Chroma sales). Legacy chromas like Headmistress Fiora Chromas are also not included. [https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014872088](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014872088) The text in the featured tab does look confusing tho. The featured tab is meant o say that those chromas \"purchasable with blue essence\" can be found in the skin > Chromas tab. We were looking to help explain where to look for the Chromas, but we unfortunately confused some of ya. We're working on updating it to be more clear.","replies":[]}]}
