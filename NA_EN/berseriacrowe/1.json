When the new system starts in the preseason, will the shards be more expensive to upgrade to permanent? (Will it cost 6.5x the current cost to upgrade to permanent or will it be more/less, making it more important to craft them now or later?)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-31T22:40:34.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK, the costs are being altered slightly, but not just overall increased. They're working to make essence more meaningful across the board. I don't believe everything is just going up in cost, but the values will be balanced a bit I think.
