I don't hate league I've had a lot of fun playing it but I've had this question for quite some time and it's been in the back of my mind. Is there a program, a code, a set of codes, an algorithm, anything, that would increase or decrease your chances of winning? I've been on losing streaks that lasted up to 25 games not straight of course it would take all week to get there, then it would stop followed by extremely long winning streaks, then sometimes an even ratio of wins and losses. No matter the answer I will continue to play and support League of Legends. However I would like to know if there is a factor that could determine whether or not you lose a game besides the skill, but perhaps people you get placed within a team and I know sometimes it is a skill thing, for me at least._\r\n\r\nPS if your having a bad game just watch these videos that are totally not midget porn!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKrlYt_IFwc&amp;t=5148s\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY52Zsg-KVI&amp;t=10789s\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL6zY0LvGRM","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T00:46:05.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't really a program that would help you win more often that's not an illegal script of some kind =\\ . \n\nY'know.....technically this doesn't really belong in Help & Support but these videos are just the heckin' best. \n\nIT STAYS","replies":[{"poster":"ImposterJoe","date":"2017-10-11T21:10:31.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick reply sorry about the topic being posted in the wrong category I wasn't too sure on what topic to put this question under.
