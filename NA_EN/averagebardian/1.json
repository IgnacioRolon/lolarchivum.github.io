Very recently (after the most recent patch) I've been having problems logging into the game.  I'd sit at the login screen for hours waiting for it to go past Authenticating. When it does go through the client itself is EXTREMELY slow to load anything that isn't on the home page. If I tried to Queue up the button that you press to go into queue would just turn grey and do nothing.\n\nIn a few instances that i actually managed to play a game I'd play with no lag network issues(small hiccups here and there But still relatively stable) The problem comes around again when the game ends and i have to go back to the client to see post game statistics where it just says \"Waiting for stats taking too long, would you like to skip this?\" I'd be there for a good 15 minutes if I'm lucky before it even decides to show up. What's weird is that this wasn't reflected in the game at all.\n\nI suspect the problem is with the client itself. I went through standard troubleshooting procedures\n*checked network connection\n*Used hextech repair tool \n*reinstalled league client.\n\nThe problem seemed to be fixed until i finished the first game where it all started again.\nSome help would this would be massively appreciated thanks!\n\nP.S\nI have logs from the hextech repair tool if that'd help resolve this problem faster!\n\nedit:\nhttps://puu.sh/xxxMY/012a2bd837.png\nHere is an image of me trying to repatch the game in hopes of fixing the problem as you can see it's moving pretty quickly with a decent download rate  so I don't know whats going on with trying to get past authenticating....","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-12T18:24:30.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection is unstable, so it's going to hiccup at uncertain moments.  It sucks that the guide didn't help though.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to the NA Authentication server:  q.na1.lol.riotgames.com\n\nRun it for 5 minutes and let me know what you find, I'm curious to see if there are any hiccups along the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OmenzLagerMan","date":"2017-09-12T15:35:13.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happned to me once and it turned out that i could  not login at all, but I downloaded a VPN and then tried to login and it worked. turns out that my ISP was blocking league of legends and VPN helped. However, in your case you seeem to login but sometimes can not....anyways try a VPN.","replies":[]}]}
