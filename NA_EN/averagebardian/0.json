Not very active here but an issue arose which i thought was important enough to warrant a forum post. As most of you are aware there's an issue with the patch that prevents you from connecting to the login( Which in this case is solved by running through a very technical troubleshooting method)\r\n\r\nA few moments ago my power went out for a grand total of 3 minutes.(summer blackouts) And I happened to be in the midst of a ranked game. I have a fairly beefy set up so I was able to boot up within  seconds. and get back on the game within a five minute time frame-- Or so I'd think. I opened up  league launcher and I'm greeted with \"We're unable to connect to the login server, Please check your connection\" I'm completely bewildered by this and it wasn't until i read that little tool-tip that there was a REAL problem with connecting to the game. It took me about two minutes to solve the problem thanks to Riot's troubleshooting steps. So i get back into the game, Missing about 10 minutes but I still manage to get about 10 minutes of play before we decide that the game is too far gone and surrender. I get out of the game and there, slapped with a leaver buster penalty for circumstances completely out of my control.\r\n\r\nMy issue isn't necessarily the punishment. My issue is more so the fact that someone like this is live and disrupting service for what I assume to be thousands of other people. Why is leaver buster so indiscriminate in serving punishment even when there were attempts to get back into the game and during those hiccups after patches?","replies":[{"poster":"AverageBardian","date":"2017-06-14T16:16:39.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Thanks for the swift response. My leaver buster was caused by the server issue, otherwise I would've gotten back online and back in the game within five minutes of disconnecting which- I don't think is enough time for leaver buster to issue a punishment.  My issue was the \"you may be offline problem that's currently known to be happening since the patch. I'll send in a ticket, Here's to hoping that It'd help resolve the problem.\n\nI know that Riot doesn't remove leaver buster status from the FAQ so I hope It'd help others avoid it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T16:01:41.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your detailed info here, and sorry for the trouble you've been going through- it definitely sounds like a journey.  We're looking into issues right now where players are getting a 'you may be offline' error.  Is this an issue you're getting as well, or just an unable to connect notice?  This will help determine if your specific case is on our side or your network.  \n\nRegarding leaverbuster, the system will treat everyone equally.  All leaves still cause other players a negative experience, and unable to tell a if someone legitimately disconnected or just pulled out their network cable.  Still, if your leaverbuster was caused by our server issues then we want to take a closer look.  I can't make any guarantees, but hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll see if there's something we can do!","replies":[]}]}
