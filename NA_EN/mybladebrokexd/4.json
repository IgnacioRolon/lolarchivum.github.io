A hell of a lot of people don't like the gamemode. Go on the boards when it's released, you will literally only see complaint threads about shaco. \n\nThat's such a basic explanation of the gamemodes though. I didn't say \"its the one where you do shit faster\"\n\nYou missed the point. I loved urf too. Everything about it, the april fools day week where urf was out and everyone say and played that instead of normal 5v5 or ranked 5v5. It was about the buildup, the novelty of urf, and the rareness of it that made it good. \n\nI think what RIOT did was they realized \"holy shit, urf is best when it's on april fools week and its a novelty thing\" so they are bringing that back. \n\nOk, i thought about the people who want urf\nI still don't want urf.","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2016-07-24T01:17:11.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"nobody cares you don't want it\n\n\nthe boards majority DOES","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-07-24T01:26:41.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too bad that a majority of the boards is a minority in the league community.
