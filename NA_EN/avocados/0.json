She has zero sustain and her waveclear is pretty bad. She has good mobility and catching tools, but that just makes her a better midlaner, imo. She can grab the water element with her W and root people and engage as her jungler comes in for a gank. Perfect setup. \n\nBesides, Riot said openly that she's supposed to be a solo-lane assassin. Again, she has no sustain, so I don't think she'll be amazing top. I'm thinking mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Larry1190","date":"2019-06-16T20:12:51.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They say she's supposed to be a solo lane ad assassin but I sure as heck hope she is better at jungle...","replies":[]}]}
