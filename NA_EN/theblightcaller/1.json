A random cannonball orbits Graves every time he reloads. I haven&#039;t seen this posted anywhere and I wasn&#039;t sure if this was the exact place to post this, as this is my first time creating a discussion on the boards. If there&#039;s a way we can get a Riot member to reply to this that&#039;d be great. I really love this skin and I don&#039;t think that it being 750 RP excuses something like this. Thank you all in advance!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-11T23:27:00.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Blightballer,\n\nThe video you're referring to is a pre-release video, which means it was taking when the content was still being worked on during the PBE cycle.
