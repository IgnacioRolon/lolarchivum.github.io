I&#039;m not gonna rant about my team the game was ugly  our mid fed I tried to counter gank in the begging but I couldn&#039;t keep up with my lanners feeding. from the first time I ganked and got a kill stopping Fizz from getting the killing auto that would of first blooded our {{champion:101}} who was ignited. I thought I could help these teammates, but they were beyond help. \r\n\r\nI  hate playing a game i know I&#039;m going to loose in order to chase LP especially when my teammates aren&#039;t even attempting to make the game a match. I cant  stand the 40min waste of my time energy composure. \r\n\r\nI want riot to add a optional dodge feature in champ select maybe 2 dodges per hour or so. its ridiculous how you can expect solo players to climb off this random team play.  I tilt pretty easy when it comes to this type of thing  i regret being toxic but its pretty funny how i try to communicate in a pre game lobby and they reply don&#039;t worry its fine. I&#039;m duo bot gg :)  this champions really strong i just bought him.. Xddd or silence. \r\n\r\nRiot a dodge feature would be nice \r\n\r\ni would  love to chat about the positives and negatives of a dodge feature in the comment below.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-08-31T04:28:23.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the early stages of League there was a dodge mechanic, however it was too RNG so it was removed.\nAnd is now a special mechanic for Jax and Shen.","replies":[{"poster":"ThaneBrood","date":"2017-08-31T04:34:06.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shuyin178,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m6qqnTyT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-31T04:28:23.894+0000)\n>\n> In the early stages of League there was a dodge mechanic, however it was too RNG so it was removed.\n> And is now a special mechanic for Jax and Shen\n\n i heard about that, but i mean a dodge queue feature to avoid these matches.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-31T04:52:58.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, it's called logging out and logging back in.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
