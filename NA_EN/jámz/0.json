Seeing as how they haven't, it probably means they don't know what the issue is. And of course you don't think you're biting anyone's head off. You're the person who wrote it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The23rdGamer","date":"2019-08-26T14:37:27.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ABiEdEan,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2019-08-25T07:33:59.229+0000)\n>\n> Do you have anything concrete to relay?

It can still be in beta because they're still testing it.\n\nAnd it does work, I played Clash last night, all three matches were smooth sailing as far as performance goes. Couldn't have run better, honestly.\n\nIt's not going to work *all the time*, especially if it's beta, but if it doesn't work for you doesn't mean it works for nobody.
