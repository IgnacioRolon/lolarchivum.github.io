Riot does not care about the players in the game.  Just if enough people report you, you are screwed.  They don't care what set off the player.  They don't care that players think it's funny to troll others, and flame then, then when they get pissed off enough to do something, and others report (who did not stand up for the player to begin with) they get banned.  Got perma banned for going off in a game finally after being told \"you suck\", \"your getting carried\" whatever.  Look, I don't usually care, but when sitting at 7/8/8 and had 2 dragons, 1 rift herald, 1 baron, and had been helping team, and flamed by the 4/14 top lane and team doesn't stand up for me, I get tired of it.  It's not 1 game it's many, then when finally say f it and don't help, and flat out tell other team, I hope they win since toxic team, and I get perma banned.  RIOT does not care about player base.  Uninstalling after a few more minutes anyway and won't be back.  They lost someone that has spent hundreds of dollars on game, but they don't care, won't care.
