I would maybe shift some power into the E by reworking the E and W together. Maybe make it so when Varus auto a target he gains a E charge, up to some cap, and he could only cast E at like 6 stacks, but can increase to a cap, dealing more damage based on the stacks. You could heavily reduce the CD, basically make it the same as Sejuani&#039;s E, and allow him some actual sustained trading pattern. For this you would maybe remove his E stack mechanic and just make part of his ultimate or part of the E damage and no longer proc'd by his Q.\n\nAatrox (War):\nFor Aatrox, I know a rework is coming, so I wont dwell on this now. I would say I hope he turns more toward a team fight Juggernaut, kind of like Urgot, with some split pushing power. Until then as a band-aid fix, I would make him unstoppable during the entire Q channel, and increase his auto range to 175, maybe increase the missing health heal on his W to 10% aswell to offset bramble making him close to unplayable.\n\nKayn/Raast (Death):\nI think Kayn, Raast specifically is in a good place, maybe a little too strong. I think overall he is fine.\n\nPossible Darkin (Jax):\nWe don&#039;t know what Jax is exactly. I theory exists that he is a troll like Trundle, or possibly a Darkin. I like the later theory and know that he has had some trouble being a VERY old champion in term of design. I would maybe go with a similar direction to the Xin Zhao update, incorporating his W into the passive maybe, and add a new ability altogether to add some gameplay interaction.  An idea would be to maybe make the current W range and damage be added while the ult is active or when at full passive stacks, then add something like Leorics ult in HOTS, swing with incredible force while pressing forward, knocking them back maybe and healing based on enemies hit by it. Maybe another one would be a a melee range only attack deflect, with much shorter range than Fiora W, and would simply punch and knock back anyone in front of him.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-12-06T23:24:22.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's likely the other two aren't existing champs. One's going to be female. I'm betting on a Mage. We're also still missing a Support Darkin. After all, that seems to be the theme: A full team on the rift: Aatrox top.
