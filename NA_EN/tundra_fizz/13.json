This means that whenever Riot adds (or changes) new icon art, the changes will immediately take place within BEK without a required update\n* Implemented a spoiler tag for the enhanced thread preview. This is a future feature that Wuks is working on so I need to get this in before he makes his update live\n\nAs always, Chrome users should have their extension automatically update, but unfortunately auto-updates for Firefox and Opera aren't a thing yet.\n\n---\n\nQ: What is the Boards Enhancement Kit?\n\nA: It enhances the boards providing many additional minor and major features. I don't feel like rewriting everything out now, so in the meantime [I'll just link all past features here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/3V6I7JvK-forum-enhancement-kit-fek-40?comment=0000). Most of those features don't exist in the current version, but they will make their way back soon.\n\n---\n\nQ. How do I get a custom avatar, badge, and title?\n\nA. All you have to do is post in this thread with the images you want your avatar and badge to be. Avatars can be any size, but must be no larger than 500KB. Badges must be 36x36 pixels. Acceptable file formats for avatars/badges: .png .gif .jpg\n\n---\n\nThis thread may be used for requesting avatars, reporting bugs, requesting features, or anything else relevant for BEK.","replies":[]}
