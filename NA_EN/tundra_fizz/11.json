At least that's what it appears like, and what I hope as well.\n\nI'll keep the original post intact below for archival purposes I suppose.\n\n---\n---\n---\n\nPlease either read the whole thing before commenting, or at least the tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nSo I'd never think that I'd come to GD for advice regarding relations, but I figured that there's a bunch of people here and that maybe a few could give their input as to what I should do. Yeah I know the whole thing about \"asking GD about stuff like this\", but there will be some people that take it seriously.\n\nTo start... some of you may remember a FEK update about three months ago in that my boyfriend recently broke up with me which caused me to be quite devastated.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/cg2zx6Ey-fek-30-preview?show=flat&amp;comment=05d3\n\nI am over that now and we've remained friends despite the breakup (it was rough at first but I did get better), but then something new became known. The reason he originally broke up with me is because he told me that \"he isn't interested in guys anymore\", which is totally cool and I respect that.\n\nA couple weeks before my boyfriend broke up with me, a friend of ours (Konpaku Youmu) introduced my boyfriend and I to one of his other friends who I'll call Teemo (not using his real name so a League champion will do). Anyways, as it turns out, my boyfriend has actually been dating this Teemo guy since like a week or so after we were all introduced.\n\nAs an excuse for breaking up with me, my ex-boyfriend told me multiple times that he is no longer interested in having a relationship with other guys. He also mentioned that if in the off-chance he does begin to like guys again, he will come back to me.\n\nNow the reason I know all this is because of a certain event that happened yesterday. Teemo and my ex got into a huge argument, and lately my ex has been spending a whole bunch of his time with some other guy who is one of Teemo's friends. This made Teemo really sad so he came to me and explained the whole thing, saying he's scared that he doesn't think my ex loves him anymore.\n\nThis got me a bit ticked off because Teemo is one of my friends and it sucks that this had to happen to him, so I decided to confront my ex-boyfriend about this. However, he decided to just ignore me or try to hide from it or something I dunno.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1swzMje.jpg\n\nNow as of right now, I'm not angry, sad, or anything like that because I have already gotten over my ex a while ago. I'm simply disappointed that a person thinks they need to create a huge web of lies in order to fulfill their own pleasures. Especially how we have been together for about nine months and he just runs off with some new guy within a week of meeting him.\n\nAnyways, I do not think I should ever associate myself with my ex, and maybe Teemo again. On the other hand, Teemo did eventually come clean so I'm sure he isn't a bad guy at all. What I think happened is that my ex-boyfriend convinced him to stay quiet, which he has up until now when the truth was revealed. Perhaps I could maybe remain friends with Teemo.\n\nSo I'm not really certain what I should do at this point, any help or advice GD?\n\n---\n\ntl;dr\n\nMy ex-boyfriend broke up with me three months ago, saying that he turned out to not like guys after all. I did not know that this was a lie and he actually just dumped me for another guy that was introduced to us both near that exact same time by another friend of ours.\n\nI finally found out about this yesterday because my ex-boyfriend and the guy he dumped me for ended up getting into a huge argument, and now the other guy is afraid that my ex doesn't like him anymore so he told me everything and how my ex has been spending a whole bunch of time recently with a new third guy while ignoring him.","replies":[]}
