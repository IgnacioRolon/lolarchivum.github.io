While running programs that require a lot of processing power (Counter strike, Dota, installing new programs, etc.) my monitor will suddenly shut off and the keyboard and mouse stop working.","url":"http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-1883535/monitor-shuts-keyboard-mouse-stop-working.html","image":"http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/medias/img/th_pic.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. The keyboard, mouse and monitors shut down. They are turned off and the monitors go into \"Power Saving Mode\".\r\n2. The computer stays on and the sound continues to be heard.\r\n3. Playing LOL is a certain way to cause the shutdown to happen fairly quickly. The error can be replicated by playing LOL.\r\n4. The error also happens when one does NOT play LOL. It happens when no games are played, but it happens more often and more rapidly when playng games.\r\n5. The problem becomes progressively worse, and it also happens that the PC turns off, and sometimes that the PC will not boot, but makes a white line across the monitor.\r\n6. When a white line appears over the monitor one must turn the PC off and then hit F2 while booting. Then make no changes, but click to \"save changes\", and then exit so that the PC restarts itself.\r\n7. Rebooting via F2 slows the malfunction down but does not fix it.\r\n8. I built my own PC, and it seems that others who had the same problem also built their own computers.\r\n9. This is a serious problem and nowhere on the internet can I find a solution. Others have had the same problem as far back as 2013.\r\n\r\nToday is 16 April 2017. Please email me within one month (not after that) if you have a definite and concrete solution - not just an idea to try.

Your best bet would be to have someone take a deeper look into what might be going on, but you can hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as well!","replies":[]}]}
