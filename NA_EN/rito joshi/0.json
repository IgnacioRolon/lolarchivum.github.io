I looked into this for you, and it doesn't look like that particular refund is eligible.  Per our[ refund guidelines](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ), in addition to refund tokens the purchase has to also be within 90 days.  Items beyond that can no longer be refunded.  Let me know if that helps clear things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Joshi","date":"2017-06-13T11:06:03.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Did this exactly but not working:\nhttps://youtu.be/y9xmG0GmpSg","replies":[]}]}
