{"poster":"Hyp3rfocus","date":"2017-11-18T21:47:41.144+0000","title":"A summary of all the issues (according to the players) for Riot.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":360,"down_votes":20,"body":"Hi \n\nI&#039;ve been stalking the boards a lot since the preseason started, and there is definitely more negative feedback than positive, so I&#039;ve decided to make a quick summary of all the issues for Riot to see.\n\n1. **The blue essence system is very unwelcomed.** - Whether or not the numbers add up in the long run, and you do make more BE than you would IP .. the system feels very unrewarding the way it&#039;s set up.  Leveling is becoming a chore, instead of an enjoyable grind. Many people don&#039;t seem to like the RNG factor of BE gains you get, and if you end up needing 50-150 BE for a champion you want, you have to play 10 more games to level up, just to get it.\n\n2. **Turrets are ridiculously weak.** - Even before preseason this was a complaint that seemed to just get thrown under the rug each time it was brought to the surface.  Personally, I believe that a turret should be a safe haven for you; something you feel safe underneath (if you&#039;re losing lane hard or the enemy decides to bring 3-4 people), but it&#039;s not.  Now instead of trying to protect a tower vs 3 people, you know it&#039;s better to just back off cause it&#039;s becoming impossible to win against tower dives now.  Mechanics and strategy should be rewarded when you tower dive, but now all you have to do is stick a level 6 tank underneath it, he tanks 3-5 shots, and walks away with half his health left.\n\n3. **Games are too short/snowball too quickly.** - This has been happening since the beginning of season 7 and I think even before that as well. I do agree that having a 40-50 minute game every game would get old, and thus I&#039;m glad that they are shortening it from that amount.. however now every game feels like when one team gets ahead, they stay ahead. This just isn&#039;t the right approach to a game like League.  Most of the genuine excitement this game offers, is the crazy and unpredictable teamfights, the comebacks, and knowing good teamwork can defeat 1 or 2 really good players.  I think they are ignoring this a little too much, and if you don&#039;t want to drastically change it, at least fix it up to make it so laning phase doesn&#039;t decide the game.\n\n4. **New runes and masteries have everyone doing too much damage.** - This kind of goes with #3, but it&#039;s definitely a reoccurring topic on the boards.  Some people are enjoying this change, they feel like instead of having a few broken champions, now they can all be broken, which turns into a balanced game.  My personal opinion on this issue is that the more damage > the shorter the games >  the less excitement .. so I think they do need to reduce some damage or add some more defensive stats so that every damage champ doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s supposed to be a burst champion.\n\n5. **The Riot company feeling like it&#039;s becoming more and more neglectful.** - My opinion on this one is not that strong, however there are some things I&#039;ve noticed over time.  Too many people feel like Riot just doesn&#039;t care anymore.  This game has gotten huge since it first came out, with eSports, merchandise, the number of players has increased dramatically.. I mean you can&#039;t talk to a gamer anymore without them knowing (or playing) League of Legends.  I love that this game has had so much success, because it really is an amazing game and it&#039;s not difficult to fall in love with it.  Success is great, but Riot, you don&#039;t want to be a company who gets big and then stops caring about your players.  Just because there are opportunities to make more money doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s always the best way to go.  There are so many people who&#039;ve been with this game for 5+ years, we are here cause we love the game and we don&#039;t want to go anywhere else.  Treat us like your children/friends/family ... not like customers. As EA has shown us, even a loved company can become despised because of greed for money.\n\nIf this post goes well, I will make another one in a month or 2 stating the positives/fixes or some more negatives if it continues to go that route.\nIf you disagree with what I&#039;ve said, please don&#039;t take it personally.. feel free to voice your opinion and let me know how you feel.\n\nTL:DR-  1. The blue essence system is very unwelcomed. 2. Turrets are ridiculously weak. 3. Games are too short/snowball too quickly. 4. New runes and masteries have everyone doing too much damage. 5.

The blue essence system is very unwelcomed.**\n\nWe've definitely seen a lot of feedback around the new leveling system. Some of the things you mentioned (like being just short of the BE for your next champion), we're planning on addressing next patch by [adding BE to first win of the day and reducing the grind at higher levels.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hAaYMrEs-leveling-and-rewards-early-impressions-and-adjustments)\n\nIn regards to how leveling feels, we're keeping an eye on this as well. We do think leveling is a better long-term system for league, so we're probably going to spend some time seeing how the 7.23 changes feel before making any additional changes - but we're watching.\n\n> **2. Turrets are ridiculously weak.**\n\nTurrets have a tough job. They need to balance between being defensible areas of the map while at the same time not being so strong that the whole game revolves around turtling underneath them. That said, [Maple Nectar mentioned that they will be getting a small buff in 7.23. ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/PXqgGQss-riot-why-are-turrets-made-out-of-wet-toilet-paper?comment=000e)\n\n> **3.

Average game time hasn't changed too much, but that doesn't mean game pacing is necessarily where it should be. We'll check back in after gathering more data.\n\nI would like to hear more about this from you guys though. Sometimes when I see this feeling expressed on the boards it's in a super exaggerated \"All games are decided at 10 minutes\" kind of way - which isn't the case (at least in my games, but maybe that's because there's no lead too great for me to throw away.) \n\nIf you'd like to talk a bit more about what your ideal pacing of a game of league looks like - I'm all ears.\n\n> **4. New runes and masteries have everyone doing too much damage.**\n\nProbably true! Preseason is always a bit unbalanced, since so many changes are happening at once. We haven't seen too many extreme outliers this year, but there's certainly more tuning to be done. A lot of people are also running squishy assassin comps without a real tank, which could be supplementing this feeling.\n\n> **5. The Riot company feeling like it's becoming more and more neglectful.**\n\nI'm really sad if that's how you feel. The reason most of us were drawn to Riot in the first place is because we care about players, and wanted to work at a company that reflected that care. \n\nIt's certainly more challenging to keep in touch with players now compared to the early days- chiefly because there's so many of you!

Now I don't think I've played enough games compared to others this preseason to know 100% what I'm talking about, but here's my shot at it:\n\nI think one core issue is that Runes were always an early game crutch. And it seems like Riot, as is the theme with most changes this year, really wanted to hone in on Runes as an early game mechanic. However, since it was also being combined with many unique aspects of Masteries and the Keystone system, some late-game options were also added. This had led to a conflicting feel with the Runes. Most still seem like early game dominators while things like CDR-related runes and Gathering Storm don't always even feel like they have an impact. \n\nAnother issue is, ironically, just how great and unique these Runes are. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but some Runes like Lethal Tempo can replace the need (or at least delay it) for some champions to invest in items for certain stats. For this particular example, the fantasy it to obviously break the attack speed cap for a few seconds, but 30-80% is a decent amount and can easily be seen as at least a temporary substitute for buying an Attack Speed item while a champ buys an IE or BT instead. \n\nLike I said, I haven't really had the time to test too much out so far, so I can't go into many other specifics. But at least from what I've seen, it seems like some champs can Rune-away their early game weaknesses, if you will, and just get straight into forcing fights and dealing damage, making it seem like damage itself is the problem. I do love most of these changes that I've tried and the uniqueness and utility that they bring to the game. But as for game pacing, it seems like some champs are already set early game just because they synergize so well with the changes. And everyone has many more resources during laning phase than before. \n\nI don't know if this is necessarily a bad pace, or if it goes against my ideal, but I do play a lot of late-game champs and it does feel like their fantasies are being a little shunned in favor of those who can snowball. And I can also say those late-game champs aren't having as much trouble early game either, so sometimes even I'm the one to do the snowballing. But it still seems to conflict with some runes being meant for a late game that doesn't exist as often as it used to. \n\nThanks for reading!

I hope we can keep finding better ways to show it.\n\nCalad, As much as I appreciate the rest of what you are posting in regards to the rest of the list, Point 1 remains the same, regardless of if you add BE on a win and reducing the grind. The system of having to level to get any kind of BE (in addition to a lot of posts flying around about how the numbers aren't lining up), cannot be ignored. Regardless of if it's \"better\" or \"worse\", the feel of not getting anything and slogging through match after match is not an appealing one. Even if you were to give BE to the FWOTD, it does not resolve this issue, and feels like you guys at Riot are \"doubling down\" on forcing us to utilize a system that is getting a lot of flak, for a variety of reasons. This is not a good practice. This is in fact, the opposite of a good practice, because the main issues surrounding it aren't being addressed. FURTHER, the fact that a small reward of BE is being tied to a once a day thing, and that the amount is seeming to be paltry at best, FEELS like it's something that Riot cobbled together in an attempt to settle down the masses.\n\nI'll be frank with you. The way that this system has been handled, from even before Runes Reforged was a thing, needs to be addressed. Too many Rioters (not necessarily yourself) have either written off things the community has said, given false information, or other unsavory behavior. As I do not want to call attention to anyone in particular, I'll leave it at that, but frankly, I have read some things on these boards in the last few months that make me question Riot as a whole. Don't throw away loyal players. Don't throw away your fanbase. Open a discussion with us over these issues. Including BE. Because let me tell you. This isn't going away. Not even with a \"BE First Win Of The Day\" thing implemented.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-11-19T08:22:18.517+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Calad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EcEJ44p4,comment-id=0027,timestamp=2017-11-19T06:28:46.769+0000)\n\n> We&#x27;ve definitely seen a lot of feedback around the new leveling system.

Levels and such are cool but sense this patch has started and I have hit level 36 I can't even  afford one champ in the 6300 range just from what I have earned.

Even so, some people are angry because they care about the game as fans and players and want the devs to care as much as they do for league's sake. Testing that kind of loyalty is not good and you should know that while I don't speak for others here on the boards, I speak for myself and those that agree with me on my points in regards to what I am saying RN. \n\nSome of the post and responses i've seen from rioters have been well written, but poor at addressing criticism. as if you people at riot are afraid of acting unprofessional or proper but also not able accept it when people are angry with the decisions you have made as a company. Personally responses like your's on no.5 are the ones that I will say honestly, infuriate me because you are like other rioters when it comes to pointing-the-finger-at-you-in-rage, this reply is justing using the same well written words to deflect anger and hostilities from players and some of them have gotten a significant amount of downvotes.\n\nIn Short my issue with Riot atm is that the fake pleasantries that I see in rioter's replies is just a means to try and pacify players and avoid scrutiny while doubling down to bad decisions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only 1 Objective","date":"2017-11-18T22:15:10.750+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"id like to add something to #1 \n\norange essence feels really useless now also.

Since the change I've made about 1200 blue ess through 7 levels, many shards being worth a pathetic 90 BE. The old system would have me with relatively 2k or more in my pocket, given how much I play.

Counting the first win of the day bonus (575), and the necessary xp to level at level 30 is 2496, you will still need to play several more games to get the same amount of BE/IP, and that assuming you disenchant what you get from the chest (from my experience, everything is often immediately disenchanted, as I already had the champions). The system is **far** too reliant upon a single dice roll in order to determine the BE you get, and you often don't get to make use of the shard price of BE for several reasons. First, the only way to get BE is to disenchant, which means any time you hold onto a shard, you lose potential BE (and, with expensive champs, an entire levels worth of BE, as you get those individually, rather than packs of 5). Second, you are never guaranteed to get a shard price for many champions, as these champions are far rarer to get from the chests. Third, you are not guaranteed to be free from duplicates, even within the same chest (I got 2 Nunu shards from the same chest last night). This means that their desire to make, in their own words, \"easier to unlock the champions you want\", backfired horribly, as it is actually far harder to unlock any desired champion.\n\nThe rate at which you get BE also begins to fall heavily as the amount of xp per level begins to rise significantly, almost doubling from the requirement at level 30 (2496), to 4600 from 174-175.  In the current system, that means that you will most assuredly be earning less BE than you would be IP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-11-19T00:55:53.546+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Apex ADC,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EcEJ44p4,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-11-18T21:47:41.144+0000)\n>\n> 1. **The blue essence system is very unwelcomed.** - Whether or not the numbers add up in the long run, and you do make more BE than you would IP .. the system feels very unrewarding the way it&amp;#039;s set up.  Leveling is becoming a chore, instead of an enjoyable grind. Many people don&amp;#039;t seem to like the RNG factor of BE gains you get, and if you end up needing 50-150 BE for a champion you want, you have to play 10 more games to level up, just to get it.\n\nThe biggest issue I have is that Riot's math doesn't add up to what we're seeing.  I played 38 games in the last 4 days and have 900 more BE than I did on Wednesday.... that's just awful.  It is, objectively, worse than the old system.  My problem is that Riot misrepresented this system and some of the fanboys want you to believe it's better when it CLEARLY is not.  Even if it was (which it isn't), it feels less satisfying.  \n\nBy the way, I love Riot's logic to this preseason, \"You can now grind for new levels and see your progression\", what about showing us visibility as to how we're doing with our honor level, \"nah... that feels too much like a grind\" ... WHAT?!?\n\nAs to the other issues...\n\nTurrets are too weak, but that's mainly because everything and everyone does too much damage.  Playing support feels insanely awful right now, you are not only levels behind everyone else but you're even more squishy than ever. Sure, turrets need a buff and a pretty sizable one at that, but the damage needs to be lowered across the board.  \n\nGames are decided in the first ten minutes.
