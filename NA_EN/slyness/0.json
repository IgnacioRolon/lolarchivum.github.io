The Vayne change is more annoying than anything. Yes, in the hands of an Iron IV vayne, the change does nothing but get her killed, but in the hands of a remotely decent one, trying to kill her is more of a chore than anything else since you have 1 second to attempt to hit her before she tumbles away again to 500 range where you won't be able to hit her again. I'm fine with her being mobile. It's the fact it has a stealth attached to it that is the problem especially since the buff was massive with ZERO things taken from the rest of her kit. If she only had the tumble aspect and not the stealth then some melee champions can at least stay on her since they can more easily tag her with some CC's to make the tumble less effective. You have 1 second to attempt to tag her (if you are in range at all since she can be anywhere in a like 600 radius from where she Q'd) before she poofs again. It just isn't fun to play against.

If you had done that, you would have realized two things: 1. Not all bugs can be caught before something hits live, and 2. Bugs occurring on live that do not appear on PBE are a very real possibility. Look at Azir: absolutely flawless in the PBE, but on release?

Smaller bugs are caught too, but you can't just report a bug and get it fixed instantly, the developers need to understand how to recreate the bug, and then shift through the code to find out what to fix. Sometimes that can't happen before the patch goes out. \n\nPBE has never been used for balance, and if it has, it's more than likely it just appears to be because of PBE. Skarner and Darius are the two attempts we have of Riot using PBE as a balance zone, because the PBE community just isn't reliable. Plenty of folk are there just to try new skins, no one uses the Ranked Que seriously, and there's a laze faire atmosphere in Normals. It's just not a place you can get accurate data on balance options, if there are changes, it's usually internal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jhins Girlfriend","date":"2019-01-11T17:25:56.300+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"They might as well call it the Skin Test Environment.","replies":[]}]}
