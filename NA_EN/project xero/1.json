I hope that helps!\n\nmy dear porocles, be you male or female i mean no disrespect. however i have gotten this tired canned response, as have many others every time we bring this issue up. now i would be more then willing to believe it would be just my connection, if 5 other people in the same game at the same time told me that their pings where also sky rocketing up over 200 ms making the game barely playable. at that point i'm starting to believe that it's not the players connection but a issue with the servers themselves. this is not the first time this has happened either i have brought up a few different times that there have been other matches where i and other players would experience this mass lag at THE SAME TIME. and it was either ignored by red's or made into a joke by the rest of the community who saw fit to claim that it was the players fault not riots. now it's 2017 and if i was to go out and get a better connection and still be running into these issues, i would know for a fact that someone is jerking my chain. the people i play with, i'm pretty sure have wonderful internet providers with decent speeds, so i would like someone to explain to me how a room full of 10 players can have 5 players all at the same time experience massive lag spikes and then sit there and say it's the players connection? i'm not trying to be rude, i'm not trying to be disrespectful i'm just stating what i know and what i have seen. take it with a grain of salt, but this is the 5th time i have been in a game with other players and we all experienced the same lag spikes. and this is the 3rd time i've been put into low priority que because of it. \n\nso please do whatever you have to do, but please please please look for a fix to this instead of saying it's someones connection and packet loss. because i walked through allowing ports to connect to this game for a better connection and got jack shit i pay my internet bill on time and in full to assure the best speeds. my internet company is close to chicago ( we are both in michigan one state away but if you where to drive or travel there it would probably only take a day to reach if you knew where you where goin.)  so please before i rip my hair out, before i scream bloody murder and have to quit a game that i put almost as much time in as i did killing floor on steam (near 500 hours) and so much of my money that i cannot get back. (a few hundred easy with champs and skins) fix the connection issues. guys it's 2017 it's ok to admit your servers are not perfect, no one is going to linch you over a few tech issues that can be tweeked and made better. i'm not the only player it's happening to, i wont be the last so please take it from me. it's not the players connection to your servers, so please take a look into them see what can be done to make them run maybe a little smoother and please don't be afraid to say \"we know the servers are not perfect\" that's all people want half the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-26T17:54:07.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude, I know this has been frustrating but I see no history of tickets from you or any results from the logs that have been requested.  Yeah, server issues can definitely happen and we're not blind to that.  We make sure to post [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) tickers and be transparent with such cases whenever we can.  If everyone or even 5 members in your game were having connection issues at the same time, then something could certainly be going on.  Could be server issues, hiccups, or even those players were all on the same ISP or location with a sudden issue.  However,  in the two games you were marked for leaver last week, you were the only one.    \n\nOpen ports and a solid connection doesn't make you immune from having issues reaching specific servers like our game servers, so we need more information to work with.  I don't know what's causing you to have a connection issue, but it's not our game server because there's no issues with it currently or at the time of your leaves.  What I can offer is assistance with troubleshooting to find the origin of the issue, and hopefully get it fixed.\n\nWe want to help you figure this out, but that can't be done through confirmation bias or assumptions.  What I need to see are results, and that requires logs.  If you decide to take that route, feel free to grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and send it to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our tech team will be happy to assist individually, so we hope to hear from you in a ticket.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
