What kind of questions and ideas do you have for him? I can see many things being brought up about him, and I'm honestly curious what you all think.\r\n\r\nSome of the things I was thinking was...\r\n1. Will Bard's ult have any effect on Dominion Turrets/Any Mode Nexus/TT Altars?\r\n2. As it is-- Bard's E seems to be literally useless on Howling abyss, due to the lack of walls outside of the stage limits. \r\n3. A lot of people are asking, how often will the little chimes appear? They seem to be close together in the video, but I notice suddenly no more appear.\r\n4. What roles can this guy do? He seems like he could be an EXCELLENT jungler (free experience just for doing what you do anyways? OP.) and could work as a roaming mid as well. Another thing someone brought up is have Every lane solo-- solo top, solo mid, and marksman bot-- while having the jungler in the... jungle and bard following him around, and going where needed.\r\n\r\nSo, GD, any thoughts on any of these points/questions or any of your own?","replies":[{"poster":"Rabid Llama","date":"2015-02-24T22:05:02.930+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! I can answer these questions!\n\n1.a. Right now, it **does not ** hit Dominion Turrets (it's cooler to just hit the people channeling, and they serve a very different purpose than turrets on SR)\n\n1.b. It doesn't hit Nexuses (Nexies?) or Inhibitors - there's no reason to hit the enemy Nexus besides trolling, and I like the symmetry on the spell. I'd like to keep it focused on clearer plays, too.  \n\n1.c. In general it doesn't hit untargetable things, and there's nothing to hit on the TT altars, so nope :)\n\n\n2 - I'm interested to see how he plays out on Howling Abyss - he can cut the base wall corners and end up way into the lane, and can jump from brush to brush in the middle of the map. He can flank pretty hard, and might be a big force multiplier for an Udyr or similar. We'll see. Can always up his Chime spawn rate to compensate!\n\n3 - Right now, the chimes show up two at a time about once a minute. Definitely a balance lever, though\n\n4 - That remains to be seen. Jungle Bard is definitely *possible*, but I'm not sure if it's viable or not. As for double-jungle with a support, his W and E definitely synergize hugely. If that's a thing that happens, I'll be super excited.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2015-02-24T23:28:04.423+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rabid Llama,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=OIuxIenq,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-02-24T22:05:02.930+0000)\n>\n> 4 - That remains to be seen.

I wasn't thinking of it like that, moreso if you're trying to save your OWN nexus-- say your team got aced, and you're the first alive-- and you need about 10 seconds at most for the rest of your team to revive. Could you delay defeat by putting your own nexus in stasis?\n\n\nPoint 2-- Wow, really? Exactly how far would he be able to jump? Cause if he just went forward, he could go on the southwest wall (right before you leave the base on the ghost side) and go forward, and end up all the way in the enemy team's base. And as for chimes-- they could be real trouble for him, trying to collect them at least, especially if they spawn too far forward, kind of like Zac's blob's flying towards an enemy.\n\nPoint 4-- I'd like to see it. Imagine a Jungle Rek'sai with a roaming support Bard-- instead of doing the obvious tunnels, Bard could put a portal through a wall into a lane, rek'sai following through, then using the tunnel as a gapcloser on the person he's ganking.

Or any champion (Kha'zix, Tristana, Aatrox, etc.) mid jump?\n**I've seen Jumpers get stopped mid-air when stunned by like a Sej ult, so it should just freeze them in place**\n> \n> What happens if you use Tempered Fate on people currently in Nami's Q?\n**Again, they are targetable. So they are stunned, then frozen. Then the duration of the stun expires while frozen, so they are free to move when un-frozen.

Enemy GP should be able to cleanse it, since he can even cleanse suppression, but I don't know how it would code for an allied GP.**\n> \n> What happens if you use Tempered Fate on Zac mid-ult?\n**See above - should freeze him mid-air.

His harass is a q, which will only slow 90% of the time. Competitive players will be able to dodge a lot more than most players so getting a snare/stun (Whatever you want to call it) will be a lot harder. \n\nShrines post laning phase won't be much. I foresee them as surviving a last tick of ignite (if placed well) or for speed boost catching/running. \n\nTunnel would be create interesting game play. As stated running into a fight from fog/terrain. But not too terrible much can be done.\n\nHis ultimate is his saving grace for competitive play. Both saving allies and getting good engages off. That being said the range and interaction will be intriguing. \n\nLike I stated there are better supports that will take over.

I imagine there wouldn't be an effect on any of those things as it could be potentially a complete disaster on any other map. I could potentially see the Nexus, but I think that's probably unlikely.\n\n2. You're right this would be entirely useless, so that would be quite disappointing to get stuck with, but Riot has always had their large focus on SR, for obvious reasons, so I doubt this will change much if at all.\n\n3. I'm also very curious, and do they occur everywhere on the map, or exclusively through jungle and river areas. Like would you have them in lanes if you were roaming through?\n\n4. I could see him working as a jungler, might be difficult due to the lack of damage he's likely to have, but the whole, skillshot that stuns from hitting walls as well as other enemies/minions/monsters, could work to a pretty good advantage, plus with the extra XP from chimes and damage from meeps, he could be the fastest leveling jungler in the game with some pretty solid clear times.. Someone suggested potential for mid and top lane, though I find a hard time picturing him for that just because it's difficult for a solo laner to leave without having pushed your laner out, and Bard is lacking in damaging abilities to do that effectively.\n\nAs for my points now.\n\nI actually really like the concept of this \"Support\" he's going to come out of the gate a little OP, as I'm sure we all expect, but I think he can be very healthy for the game. He'll teach supports how to start roaming and influencing other lanes properly, will force ADCs to not lean on their support like a crutch in place of their own leg, also provides a lot of opportunities for major plays. I would bet he'll walk out with a high difficulty rating, while he seems relatively simple, you have to balance your roams with helping your ADC.\n\nAnother thing is that he'll be a support that's actually capable of dealing with minion waves pushing in, with some decent base damages from what I can tell, he'll also have the meeps to make his auto attacks a bit of a pass through skillshot, meaning he'll have some manner of wave clear if his ADC died, and will be able to defend his turret rather effectively if he's been roaming and such like he should. He's going to be a heavy impact support for the entire game, in all places of the game, so it could cause a bit more interest in supporting, but I won't hold my breath on that.\n\nFinally how exactly do the health packs work? Do they stay for Teemo shroom lengths of time? Steath ward lengths of time? Is it a Shaco Box? A Maokai sappling? It obviously says it takes a few seconds to charge, but afterwards does it just hang out forever? How many of them can you have out? Does it operate like a spell with a CD or like a stacking item with a recharge?\n\nI'll admit it's got me curious to try supporting with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2015-02-24T21:05:34.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While he seems relatively *Simple","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2015-02-24T21:40:54.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for the proofing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-02-24T21:06:56.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He E can be casted in the air on HA.

Unless Riot gets lazy, it should affect Dominion Turrets and Nexus turrets. It shouldn't affect fountain obelisks.\n2. It might work with turrets and inhibitors...

Structures (destroyed or not) count as terrain for abilities like Nautilus' Q; I don't see why Riot wouldn't allow Bard to use his E on them. His E's usefulness on ARAM will depend on whether the portal ends right after the first terrain it goes through, or if the portal actually goes to the end of its range (if there is another bit of terrain to \"link\" with).\n3.

His passive chimes randomly show up just as you're farming the jungle anyways. Start Q, get a good leash, have meeps up every now and then to help the farming. He's pretty much got a vayne condemn (but with a double stun) on his Q, so that mixed with gift of heavy hands, and setting a health pack down before starting a camp can really keep him from taking much damage. As you keep doing your jungle business, farming, ganking, etc, he'll keep getting chimes, which will as well power up his meeps-- making them stronger and making more of them. This'll keep making his jungling faster and faster, but I'm not sure how fast it progresses. (It'll probably work on tiers like with Rengar Bonetooth and Cass's new passive.) \n\nAnd to continue a bit on that, keep in mind his chimes give him mana, a speed boost, AND exp. Combine that with placing health packs down (when off cd) before doing camps and he'll have practically infinite sustain in the jungle if you play your cards right. Seriously. Devourer enchantment on this guy could be scary.\n\nAnd about the skin, I'm curious as well. I'm hoping he gets a voice too (And one with character, like Braum or Sion). As for what the skin will be, a lot of people are saying Santa Bard, which would be a pretty easy remodel for him.

I'll definitely try it once he's released, but I think we really have to consider who he's going up against in terms of other junglers- Lee Sin, Jarvan, etc. He'll have to clear relatively quickly and sustain enough during his first clear to be comparable to what will be his competitors.\nJungle would be a logical place for a roaming-based champion to thrive, but Riot seems to want him to be a roaming support, not a ganker or jungle-farming carry.","replies":[{"poster":"VentusDragoon","date":"2015-02-25T01:49:54.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, all of what I said was simply speculation, as we don't know his numbers yet. ...I got a rioter comment, holy crap.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Owltears","date":"2015-02-24T22:57:09.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the little spirits around Bard like the Japanese tree spirits?
