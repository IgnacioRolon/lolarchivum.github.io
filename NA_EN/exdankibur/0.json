I spent about 2 days on this one so it looks pretty good imo, still a few noticeable cloth physics errors but my software doesn&#039;t actually have cloth simulation so I did it with homemade effect combos. Anyway, take a look!\r\n---\r\n{{champion:86}} The Login Screen\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-cFCq47cw\r\n----\r\n{{item:3802}} Original Splash\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lGeQRuIzRMY/WIEPOEBZ-WI/AAAAAAAAcaY/IaSACZu8TqYbp7Ug1F0Ku6ng4hZ8TG9QgCLcB/s1920/garen-1920x1200.jpg\r\n---\r\n{{item:3462}} Insights\r\n-\r\n{{item:3631}} Programs Used: Adobe Photoshop CC 2017, Hitfilm Pro 2017","replies":[{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2017-10-07T23:32:37.642+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"does this hurt anybody else's eyes?

I'd love to see more of these.\n\nA few notes on this one:\n\n* The camera bobbing makes the whole thing hard to follow. I'd recommend keeping the background stationary.\n* The character at the top of the steps moves a little too much. It's actually slightly distracting, especially since the work there isn't as good as it is on Garen himself, so the column keeps moving behind her.\n* You didn't animate the two flags on either side of the staircase, which seems a little odd.\n\nOther than that an a bit of blurriness, though, this is phenomenal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monsta Moo","date":"2017-10-08T12:56:15.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from the camera \"bobbing\" I really like this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChemicalBuster","date":"2017-10-08T05:10:28.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"howd you do that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phat Pat","date":"2017-10-07T23:07:48.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is sick.
