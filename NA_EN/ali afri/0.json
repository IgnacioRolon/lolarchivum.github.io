Started off aggressively but aggression got nerfed along with assassins in general and jungler healthiness. \n\nThat resulted in a full blown control mage meta midlane that lasted basically until assassin rework with few breaks in between.\n\nToplane liked beefy champs with damage like Darius/mundo, early game champs like Riven/renekton, teleport was a near \"must pick\" for all of them though, until cinderhulk hit. \n\nMarksman role was mostly unchanged and focused on early game bullies.\n\nJungle started off with divers like lee sin and jarvan but then Cinderhulk hit and tanks became the only junglers more or less.,,,,,or rather they took over all lanes. \n\nThen this all kept going until the juggernaut update, then we only had juggernauts.\n\n\nWhat i am saying is, things werent all that great back then either, metas were often stale or completely dominated to the point were season 7 ardent+tank meta looked diverse.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2018-06-22T23:53:42.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think your time stamps are a little off with the metas..

The only people who would are those who champs were meta. Back then if your champ wasn't meta you auto lost, now it just puts you at a disadvantage.
