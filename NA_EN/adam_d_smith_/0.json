I shouldn't have to use up my ult so I can safely check baron/dragon pit for wards. I also dislike aggro'n every jungle camp I decide to walk past.\n\nIf you really wanted to perfect the ult passive on blitzcrank; make it so it doesn't activate on lane minions when blitzcrank is in a bush so that he can safely hide instead of it giving away his position as has happened to me...\n\nBasically his ult passive is more trouble than it is worth but not really cause the damage is kinda insane...","replies":[]},{"poster":"La覺sv覺s","date":"2015-08-06T20:27:25.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem, i want the WIJU WIJU SOUND!
