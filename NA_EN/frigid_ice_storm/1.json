A strong, fed jungler can make the enemy jungler not want to gank because of the risk of a counter gank ending with him getting further behind, and a jungler with kills that is ganking is better than a Garen getting the kill, or a non-hyper carry getting the gold.\n\nAs long as your team gets the kill, you have more global presence, more gold actively on the map, and your team still gets the gold for the kill, and the assist money. A kill is money, money is an advantage, an advantage is pressure.
