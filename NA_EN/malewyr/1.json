Which is why i laugh when kids make threads saying \"oh im depressed Gd pls halp\" Well no shit, if  you take this place way too seriously imagine something on the level of a family member being killed or something. I've seen depression and I know you children wouldn't last 24 hours with the symptoms I've seen. Ya'll need to grow up and have some fortitude in your lives.   Now go get \"depressed\" because I said gg ez after a game LOL","replies":[]}
