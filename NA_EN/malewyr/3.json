Because the pressure that the clearly winning lane has will allow which ever lane that&#039;s behind to get gold through objectives, farm, and possibly if one of the  other lanes slightly wins just  steamroll the game.\n\n\n\nplease jungler use your fucken brains and stop costing me games because of  your ignorance. \"hurr durr i don&#039;t have to gank because le lane is winning mang\"\n\n\n\nThis game is not hard to understand . There are certain rock paper scissors elements that you can exploit. If I',m telling you to gank my lane so i can win the game why wouldn't you?  Do junglers deep down have this superiority complex that makes them have to control every game of every season? Fucken listen to your teammates and stop throwing games because \"muh jungle pride\" \"world against junglers dood\" mentailities","replies":[]}
