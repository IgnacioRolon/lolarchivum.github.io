Any idea how I can go about getting this?\r\n\r\nAnd I play Garen a lot (funny don't hate me) and so I attempted to unlock the Garen Dreadknight Skin using the twitter offer powered by Woobox, and I've been given a code, which I've tried entering using enter code etc, and it returns with \"There was a problem fulfilling\" etc...\r\n\r\nDoes this everytime? I'd really like both the Tristana and Garen skins (don't play Alistair so) but both seem unobtainable?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\n\r\nAny help!?       [I HAVE AN IMGUR ALBUM WITH PROOF IF NEEDED]\r\n\r\nLuke / LSA","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-07T23:07:17.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Kokua said, it seems like these codes aren't working for a majority of players lately. No worries, poro bros got you fam.

You could either submit a ticket and request the skin to be added to your account, or wait here for one of the poros to come back to help you. I'm sure you'll have those skins pretty soon!","replies":[]}]}
