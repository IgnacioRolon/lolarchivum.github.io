This is a big one, and probably the main reason we don't see more big money coming into LoL, like the 76'ers acquisition of Dignitas + Apex. In the NBA (sticking with basketball for the sake of the 76'ers tie-in) once you have bought in to the league, you are guaranteed your spot. No matter how badly you do, you are still allowed to stay. This makes buying an NBA team a relatively safe financial investment, because even if you do poorly, the money machine will not die. In the LCS and some other circuits of LoL, a team that does badly gets relegated to challenger / challenger equivalent and becomes much less visible, reducing or even destroying the earning potential. This makes a LoL team a very risky financial investment. This is unfortunate, because LoL is by far the most watched scene in ESports; as such it should be a secure gateway for big money to enter ESports, find a foothold, and expand into other games.\nLook at NRG, Shaq himself bought in to LCS (with other investors), got some solid players but did poorly for 2 splits then got booted. Huge financial loss. Now look at the 76'ers buy in - if they do poorly, that team (LoL Team) is GONE, and they are sinking LOADS of money in. Meanwhile, the 76'ers (NBA Team) have made a name for themselves by being easy wins for other NBA teams, despite repeated acquisitions of great talent, and they get to stay, figure out a formula, and rebuild.\n\n\nJust a few thoughts, sorry for the essay.\n**TL:DR** - If Riot really wanted investors, there is a bunch of shit they should be fixing. But they aren't, so they clearly don't care for more investors.","replies":[{"poster":"Leon Etoile","date":"2016-10-10T18:30:36.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) They can control the competitive scene; the issue is the have monopolized the profit. It's not the same thing.\n\n2) A big part of turnover is what makes it popular; anyone can do it. So, at anytime you can be replaced b/c of incoming talent. Another issue to turnover is salaries. Players can make more money through boosting and streaming than playing professional (that's back to number 1).\n\n3) The relegation system does not deter investors. I'm sure you are aware of how Soccer/football leagues work? While also being in every region. They are ran with relegation systems and have billions coming in. The issue goes back to point 1.  You can still profit when being relegated through \"parachute\" payments from tv deals.\n\nSoccer/Football leagues are the model for esports to follow due to global competition and fan bases.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-10-11T01:32:38.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are correct about Soccer / Football using these models.\n\nHowever, you can't really expect that to work for something that isn't already established and widely respected.\n\nAs much as it sucks for it to be this way, many people still laugh at ESports.","replies":[{"poster":"Leon Etoile","date":"2016-10-11T16:48:52.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many still laugh at Soccer / football.. what's your point?","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-10-13T13:52:48.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People within the sports community laugh at it for various reasons.\n\nHowever, ESports have yet to earn the respect that traditional athletics have.
