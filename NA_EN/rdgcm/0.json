I have roughly 20 Mbps dl, sometimes the LoL patcher goes down to like 50 kbps, (ive literally seen it go down to 0 kbps, what the fuck) and then around the 80% mark when it applies patches, it fails and resets the whole fucking process from 33%, why is it doing this and what can I do to fix it. Ive turned off peer to peer connection and it still happens.\n\nAlso when I exit the launcher it brings up the error report window.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T00:44:22.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Failure at this point during the patching process indicates that your patcher is unable to maintain a solid connection to our patching servers.
