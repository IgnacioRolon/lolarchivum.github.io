It appears that for the forseeable future this account is destined to remain in bronze. \n\nA list of mistakes I REMEMBER making on this account that have lost me games:\n\n- Inefficient warding (reason I wrote a guide for efficient warding on the forums a few days ago)\n\n- Not expecting bronze players to do the correct thing, overly aggressive not expecting the enemy to play the situation properly\n\n- Grouping when I know we can't win the 5v5 because someone is beginning to rage to group (this is not the ragers fault but my own)\n\n- Not helping struggling lanes enough despite the fact I had TP\n\n- General misplays (hey they happen)\n\n- And I am sad to admit I have lost one game because I things were ugly and in my head I quit instead of trying to win, so mentally being a little girl\n\nThese are the reason I have lost games on this account, not the feeders or trolls or AFKs. Yes those games have happened, those are not the games that have KEPT this account in bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnSeenDeath88","date":"2015-03-08T00:17:51.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I placed S4 a few weeks before end of the season, after the season ended I fell to S5, reset comes I go 3-7 in placements get put in B5.  Now I'm at over 200 ranked games this season highest I've made it is about 60 points in B4.  Though I have carried many games, I ward a lot, try not to chase.  With all that said I have came across many teammates that just feed and feed and feed early game.  I've done it several times, but on games that I do well in I can't help but think a lot of it is my other people on my teams fault.  There's only so many times I can gank you from top without losing my tower and letting say a fiora get fed off minions, I can't be in 3 different lanes at once plus continue stacking devourer and get dragon as udyr jungle.  \n\nI swear if people would play a bit more passive in lane instead of trying to go all out they might have better games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RitoCantFixMe","date":"2015-03-07T23:49:38.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't focus on the map a lot :({{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-03-07T23:54:45.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OHHH DON'T GET ME STARTED ON HOW BAD I AM AT THAT!! xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainTatertits","date":"2015-03-07T23:27:54.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dicked around  a lot last season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-03-07T23:23:24.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. **Just learned stutter stepping. **\n\n2. I want to find ways to help my team get fed, (Perhaps gank when im pushed up or idk) but i find my mind blanking back to bronze in games.. ** I forget about us being a TEAM**, and because I forget theirs no I in team, it hinders our victory. \n\n3. Im **bad at zoning**. I try, but i never seem to do it right. \n\n4.** I get thirsty for kills** and later regret it.  (OMG THAT BLITZCRANK ONLY HAS 10 HEALTH!  *jumps in and gets killed by their jinx*)\n\n5.** limited champions in some roles**.  Im trying to learn new ADCs, Ezreal and kalista.. I main tristana.. but I find myself having a hard time getting used to/fed ad them..  Also thinking about trying Ashe and Caitlyn... \n\n4. **Cant play every role.. My main problem.. Jungle.. ** I can go anywhere but this role.. and I tell people as soon as I see im last pick. I don't mind supporting.. I have lulu or sona its my second favorite role...  but.. god forbid if I jungle..  {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}} \n\n6. I'm easily bullied sometimes. Unless I have a pretty agro support, im pretty easily bullied out of lane..  even at top or mid, im sometimes passive..  or sometimes I go way too aggressive... so I guess **calculated aggression** is an issue for me..","replies":[]}]}
