There's already too many game boss champs (and no Galio isn't one of them):\n\nJarvan is pretty much a must ban, and so is Nasus. Zed, Kha are generally must bans with current generation of Duskblade. Even Akali's been buffed to very little counterplay. Then, there's the potential Vayne, Kog ma, Twitch (depending on the skill level of the players in that elo, but even then, Kog and Twitch generally are game disruptors). The only reason Taric isn't a perma ban is because of his low pick rate, because a good team can just abuse the crap out of his ult. Brand can pull huge games even with large death rates simply because of his consistent and high scaling burn.\n\nAnd then there's the fact people waste bans on healers because of their win rates (not really OP; just high win rates because they enable the others to carry). Or waste bans on personal preferences..... or Blitz..... \n\nThere are legitimately about 18 must ban champs atm, and we just keep adding more/not nerfing them.\n\nIt's kind of sad that some champs are just designed to be raid bosses whether they play poorly or great. Cho, Nasus, and Urgot.... even if they fail in lane, are so oppressive that mid/late game, the team either has a choice to zerg them to kill, and risk their 4 teammates either ambushing or pushing a lane, or those 3 will just yolo push a lane alone, while you deal with the other 4. When you have to choose between wiping 4 and losing a lane, and wiping 1 while the other 4 wipe a lane, that's just too much power in 1 champ. \n\n(I'm not even saying Nasus an Cho an Urgot are OP. They're easy to kill. BUT they do generally require a group to kill, where most other champs are 1v1'able, and they just have such turret control it's sick)","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-11-03T22:09:24.068+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm gonna be honest.\nI do not think there are any must ban champions currently around.\n\nI haven't really seen a champion always being banned and people are more likely to just ban their lane counters.\n\nI personally just ban Evelynn on instinct, she's been a huge pain in the neck lately.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-11-03T22:55:53.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelynn's pretty annoying in High Elo because she matches the high elo pace momentum. In lower elos, she's garbage, because teams don't create openings for her, yet expect her to carry/snowball. And she has at least 40 junglers who counter her hard, much less meta laners. And after she's behind, the game's over for her until 40 + minutes, if it happens, because she simply has no farm left in a game with no jungle left, and team fights zone her out.\n\nJarvan however pretty much always scores well, acts as a severe low CD flash burner, does some of the largest nonconditional % damage in the game, and has very few counters to his scaling/movement.\n\nYou've probably also noticed post rework, even after the nerf, Galio's become a big player. He can pull 30k damage in the same game he soaks 100k damage taken now.\n\nAs people learn how to play Urgot, he's becoming a serious pain now too.... Now that everyone figured out ALL his passive attacks can proc Frozen Mallet, engaging him has very few outs.... you either need a team fight or he owns the lane, and often the jungle around his lane.\n\nI think bans are all about the elo you're in. Kha probably gets more bans at high elo than low, simply because he is the king of solo ambushes, far outstripping Eve, simply because of Duskblade's freedom to slaughter. Janna used to get the bans, but not anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-11-04T16:43:49.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an Eve main and you don't need openings for her.\nIn fact, it's the opposite.

The 0/5 feed runs don't happen in lane. In other words, people all generally farm a lot, and death/kills don't get out of control. It becomes a contest of who CS's best. Eve who is on track with lane farmers gets more kills, because no one is hyper fed, and teams play better in coordination. If I gank bot in Diamond at level 4 vs Level 3 ADC/support, they are going to die. If I gank bot in Silver at level 4 vs level 3 ADC/Support, 90% of the time, even though gank is pinged, they don't even react. They will wait until after I've burnt a charm, done a strong engage, but am now running away with 40% hp, because my bot completely ignored the gank.\n\nThe failed gank wastes time, resources and potential XP.\n\nAnd even when I start a Silver game 5/0, the very lanes I ganked and killed in, begin feeding. After I succeed in a level 6 double at bot, my bot proceeds to feed  the other team 30 seconds later when I'm headed top and can do nothing about it.\n\nWhat you read and are describing, is the ability to execute skills successfully. Yes. Higher elos will react to skills greater. But Low elo, while they don't react to skills greater, are easily fed, and your gank no longer is effective. You can land every skill and by the time you are on cooldown, Urgot or Cho are still 60% HP. The mid feeds an Annie 6/0, so ganking Annie is now a death sentence, and if Annie groups to push lanes, she's not only fed, she's protected, so you can't snipe her. If a Jinx is fed 7/0, she can just stand behind a 3 tank wall with a mage and she's pretty much immune to an Eve snipe. If you try to go in on her in her 5 man posse, you're dead. If your team feeds her a passive proc, she's going to catch you in a team fight and pop you like a bubble.\n\nAnd, if you don't ban Jarvan, he's going to invade you pre 6 and make your farm hell, put you 2-3 levels behind, and snowball while you don't. He can just get around better, and snowball before eve can even try.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-11-04T21:11:51.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had some conversations about Eve in the past.\nThe two of us, so i know where you're coming from. Even i've had games where i completely execute early ganks to perfection (without level 6) and then fall off hard later because the lanes i've given kills to (and were leading) failed to match the enemy team's strategy of early grouping to make up for the lack of gold and are not killing people left and right + taking objectives.\n\nWhen you turn around in this game, all that you've done as an assassin starts to fade away and you being fed no longer matters. Eve can't push a lane, she can only stalk people and kill them one by one. If priority targets are not approachable, you have to either wait for that opportune moment to strike or just be forced to blow your load on the first target that engaged your team in the hopes you'd enough damage to weaken them severely and get a kill or let your team clean up.\n\nIn lower ELOs, this is the problem.\nSince Eve is just an assassin with no other things to do, when games become like this, you need to rely on your team to correctly make a basic counter-strategy and resist the enemy team as best as they can. That way, when they are preoccupied with poking left and right, you are able to strike from behind on unsuspecting enemies.\n\n---\n\nI didn't have any problems with Jarvan myself.\nHe can be strong as shit to deal with for any champion (if he goes glass cannon) but he can also be a pain in the ass to deal with when being tanky. The trick i've used to fight against him is to let someone else eat his gank and damage so that i can charm him and make sure his ult turns himself into a sitting duck before he manages to one shot my poor teammate. That's why in those games i level my charm second.\n\nElise has been a problem for me.\nI think she is just overall more safer to use than Eve but doesn't share her assassin fantasy. Elise can take a few hits, can dish out respectable damage and (being a form swapper), doesn't have problems closing the gap and duking it out with someone. Eve's pretty fragile in this regard so you'd really want ideally to be able to blow up a target or chunk them pretty hard for them to back off. And melee range is a big no-no for her.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-11-04T22:39:31.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main QQ about Elise is her spiders can block her. Like you do with Jarvan, I generally let Elise attack someone else while I'm behind her. Then I have an easy shot at her sweet behind. If she manages to get her W off to get spiders to attack me, my E should wipe them. At which point it becomes a cat/mouse game.\n\nMy problem with Jarvan is twofold:\n\n1) they always invade early and hard. I mean level 2 early, before Eve has a strong escape, and before she has stealth. Eve can't afford a hard pressed invade on the first 5-6 minutes of the game. And, when they play like that, the generally control your jungle with well placed pinks/wards, and know exactly where you are and there's not much you can do about it early.\n\n2) They always arrive late to a fight so I've already blown my skills trying to assassinate an adc or support or mid. Especially annoying when I don't have Flash or Ult.\n\n(I'm a little less afraid of Jarvan than I used to be, but the ones who invaded were helped by Xin's so that played a role too).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-11-05T01:22:47.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Gold elo I just ban Ezreal.

Her passive allows her to sustain in lane for a long period of time, she has short range, chain cc, and a self-defense option in her ult. She has poor AP ratios as well, with only her Q having scaling exceeding her base damage before 400 AP, and her W and R requiring 500+ AP for it. Meaning she benefits much more from CDR and {{item:3001}}  than the options typical of burst mages.","replies":[]}]}]}
