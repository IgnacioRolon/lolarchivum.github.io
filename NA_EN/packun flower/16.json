(Rant, down vote, whatever)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":76,"down_votes":24,"body":"I would like to continue to see nerfs to this champion but I believe that her kit will never allow her to be truly balanced unless it actually loses something. I know Riot likes to adjust numbers little by little but Camille&#039;s kit design is just way to cluttered and as a result she gets a crazy ton of free power AND protection. Camille has a severe Identity crises now because her kit&#039;s chaotic cluster doesn&#039;t allow her to pick an actual proper class and focus on it.\n\nCamille has:\n\nAssassin Damage\nTank Stat Growth\nFighter/Jungler Mobility\n\nThat is seriously not good. Riot needs to seriously sit down and decide what they want Camille to be, because right now she is everything and its making her the best champion in the game with all kinds of free power.\n\n**Assassin Identity**\nIf they decide they want her to be an assassin then several things i feel really need to change.\n\n- Increase Ad Ratios and true damage on Q slightly\n- Increase AD Ratios\n- Change her passive to a more damage based one\n- Reduce HP and Armor/Mr Growth\n- Remove Bonus Movement Speed on Q\n- Remove healing on W.\n- Remove Bonus Attack Speed on E\n- Remove Stun on E.\n- Remove splash damage on E\n- Allow Ult to actually be escapable\n\nI honestly think the Assassin identity for Camille honestly fits her character the best, keeping the burst and mobility will allow her to make split second judgments on when to assassinate a target. Camille Already does this but she get the free Tank growth stats and escapes to get in and get out without any risk and all reward. Having to force her to go more damage will mean that a bad assassination call could be fatal and punishable for her.\n\n**Tank identity**\nI really dont understand why Camille would need to be a tank but for whatever reason, if they want her to truly be one then I believe several power shifts need to change.\n\n- Increase passive shield strength.\n- Increase healing on W.\n- Remove True damage on Q.\n- Reduce how far she can leap with E.\n- Remove splash damage on E\n- Disallow E to leap over walls.\n- Remove bonus attack speed on E.\n- Remove bonus damage on ult.\n\nLike i said, I really don&#039;t understand how tank play would fit Camille&#039;s character at all but for some reason they wanted it, if that&#039;s what they wanted her to be then this might work. it would remove her crazy burst and true damage which a  tank should never have, but allow her to be more meaningful in fights with her utility.\n\n**Fighter Identity**\nThis is the second class i think would fit Camille as well. Balanced out mobility and damage would be the best bet here and i think would make the most sense for her character in terms of being fighter rather then an assassin.\n\n- Change passive cool down to a solid 15 seconds at all ranks.\n- Increase movement speed on Q\n- Reduce Armor/Mr growth\n- Remove reduced Damage on jungle monsters for W\n- Reduce true damage on Q\n- Reduce healing on W\n- Remove splash damage on E\n- Reduce bonus damage on ult.\n\nI think with these changes this allows Camille to be an actual fighter. She&#039;ll have the damage and mobility for some great plays but she wont have the burst of an assassin or the survivability of a tank to back it.\n\n**Closing**\nI am actually pretty baffled that Camille was allowed to break a lot of champion design rules and fundamentals upon her creation and the result we got was this unstoppable permanently banned monster who does literally everything and is not fun to face at all. Am I salty? Probably. Will I be down voted? oh you know it. Will that stop my voice or opinion from being heard? not in  the slightest, and thats all i really care about it. it helps me vent .\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2017-02-22T22:36:12.511+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":8,"body":"Honestly, I don't think an inescapable ultimate has any place in League.\n\nIf you are playing a squishy champion and you get caught in her ultimate, you are just dead.
