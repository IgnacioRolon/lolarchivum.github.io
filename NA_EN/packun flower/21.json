Tank itemization is pretty solid and tanks do what you expect them to on the tin. Most tanks are also ideally played as a support, where they focus on innitiating fights and locking down priority targets or counter innitiating and peeling for allies, having the bulk of their power placed in utilities rather than damage.\n\n-------------\n\nFighters have a huge identity crises in LoL.\nThis is almost exclusively due to itemization, as itemization is literally broken down into offense and defense with AD/AP and HP, communicating the general idea those are counterbalanced, and itemization plays a huge roll in communicating to players what a champion is going to do.\n\nRiot really should have done something more on the Strength, Agility, Intellect angle for giving champions a core damage attribute that indicates \"does damage while being tanky\" pretty clearly (Strength), rather than the awkward and contorted methods of allowing champions like {{champion:102}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:122}} to be tanky DPS through having kits that demand tanky builds, but allow solid bases and really mixed damage that stays pretty relevant the entire game without investing in damage.\nAll tanky DPS fighters do fall off eventually end-game though, and throughout most of LoL's history they generally operate more as soft-carries than legitimate hard-carries like most marksman.\n\nIt took until this season before Fighters really saw their own items in things like {{item:3748}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}}, and a range of marksman and assassins abusing that itemization (classes that have plenty of range or speed to work with), further strengthens my point that fighters, particularly tanky DPS juggernauts, are at odds with LoL's existing itemization.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2016-04-17T19:04:23.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks have high damage numbers at the end of the game because they have good base damage, stick around for a long time in fights and do consistent damage at most points of the game, not because they outdamage carries.

Now, theoretically, they could buff the base damage and remove the Armor scaling, right?\n\nWell, that could make his laning stronger, and make AP Malphite much more powerful.","replies":[]}]}]}
