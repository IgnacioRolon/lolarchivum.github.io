Do not see as many of them now.\n\nA lot of the times you just get beat by a superior team. If you are bad, you will find an excuse, and if you are a good player you will work on improving.\n\nSome games are unwinnable, even if you play very well. But the likelihood of that occurring for the other team is about the same if you are approximately the same elo.\n\nI really think simply playing consistently well, is enough to climb out of most different Elo divisions if you have not hit your skill ceiling. When you begin to have more bad games than good ones, you are likely playing against players that are simply better than you and you need to look at other aspects of your game in order to improve.","replies":[{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2016-11-01T07:29:35.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Swiftstrike4,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T8GtAzYV,comment-id=000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-11-01T07:20:59.857+0000)\n>\n> Some games are unwinnable, even if you play very well.

The way DQ matchmaking works is that when a premade is formed, the system assumes they have an advantage for being premade, and so matches their team with a team of significantly higher skill. But not all premades have advantages, sometimes they're just friends of friends that happened to queue together for the first time and don't even have voicechat. Which means that the poor solo sod got shoved into a totally unfair and lopsided match just because 4 random people decided to queue up together for the party rewards or whatever. \n\nBut of course, just because they don't really know eachother, don't think for a second that they will have any hesitation before jumping onto the soloer for a scapegoat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2016-11-01T06:57:30.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BladeSteel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T8GtAzYV,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-01T06:51:52.167+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m pretty sure about 80% of the &quot;im a solo que person w/ a 4man premade&quot; just think so because the other 4 people on their team don&#x27;t agree with them or are &quot;bad&quot;.\n> Just saying....\n\nProbably. \nI just complain about the ones the never talk.... it just irritates the living shit out of me.

SOme personal experiences anyway:\n\nFirst of all DQ consists of two seperate changes, with their own set of problems: The new champions select and the unification of team and solo q.\n\n**1. The new Champion select:**\nGuess the goals were to make people able to play what they wanted more often, while also removing the good old \"mid or feed\" syndrome. It was quite succesful in that regard. For me personally however, it does a lot of things worse than the old system\n\n* First of all the state of the support role.\nIt's gotten so bad, that Riot actually has to threaten the players into playing support/fill once in a while. In the old days support was something that everybody was required to be able to play half decend. You would get that last pick once in a while and that was fine. In return you rarely got blamed for not beeing able to perform that well, if you didn't get your prefered role. (personal experiences may differ though :P)\n\n\n* Champion select in general was alot more interactive. It had it's own unwritten rules (first come, first serve), and as long as people were obliging by these rules it could actually be quite interesting and fun. From what i remember there always was alot of communictaion about who would go where, what to pick etc. Players COOPERATING ... and that was silver and gold. Now i am platinum and i rarely ever see any of that. Everybody just pre-picks  that one champion they main and be done with it. I am no exception either.\n\n\n* Since everybody started maining champions and roles, the game atmosphere got alot more dense. With that also came more ingame toxicity. For me, the system basically traded pre-game toxic behaviour for in-game toxic behaviour. \n\nIn my opionion, the toxicity issue never was a problem with champion select itself anyway. It always has been a problem with the generally toxic community and lack of supervision of champions select (pre-game chat not beeing part of tribunal reports etc.). The new champion select for me is like saying: \"Well, since your are a bunch of asocial a- holes anyway, let's make a system tailored towards asocial a-holes!\"\n\n\n**2. One Queue for everything**\n\n* Again, my personal experience: Since these changes where introduced, my friends and me got into kind of a smurf frenzy. We are a group of 2 plat, a few silver and 1-2 bronze. In Team Queue we could just play ranked together anyway. Now it's almost impossible without smurfs. I myself am guilty of boosting my friends a little, because there was just no other way to play together with them.\n* There is also the infamous 4-premade situation of course. I myself only experienced this twice, but what an experience it was! You just can't do anything in those games. You are completely cut from your teammates coordination, while having to face well coordinated ganks etc. from your enemy. It left me completely disoriented. I don't even remember how those games went. I just remember the feeling of never ever wanting to experience that again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ff4sk","date":"2016-11-01T08:23:27.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh please, don't act like people haven't been exposing the issues of dynamic queue since that shit got implemented.\n\nBut yeah lets play ignorant and ignore all the arguments brought out against it that made riot make the decision of removing that garbage.\n\nHave fun getting boosted on flex queue and waiting 30 minutes for a game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-11-01T07:59:31.227+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You guys do know that it's not actually going anywhere, right?

Or a duo botlane, or a solo lane/jungler duo. It made sense to allow duos in solo queue when there was only one queue, but not now that there are 2 queues. Premades should go into their own queues regardless of size. And tbh it's really weird that they didn't make duos go into the flex queue, because it makes trios a lot less viable and flex soloers all that much on demand. It's a move that really, REALLY compromises the health of the flex queue and so I have a feeling the flex queue will be a real flop in the end.\n\nI don't mean to be a negative nancy though, I'm happy we got rid of that abomination that was 4-man premades and all and this is definitely an improvement.
