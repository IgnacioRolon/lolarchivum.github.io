Stay near tower. If you stick near tower all game and farm evenly, she will fall off mid game and eventually will have to roam or get jg to come if she wants to be of use. Farming evenly with laner = loss for riven.\r\n\r\nissue with this: People rush in my face early game and overestimate their bulk and underestimate my passive. YOU CANNOT OUTRADE RIVEN EARLY! don't feed her one kill then complain shes broken. Shes a snowball champ among many other champs, she gets the lead, you farm under turret simple as that. its not game over when she receives one kill, ive had people turn 2 kill leads around on me plenty of times.\r\n\r\n2. Use CC. If you interrupt her Q combo, itll be forced on a longer cooldown and she will have to escape. Also stops her mobility.\r\n\r\nIssue with this: People always try to OUTBURST her or out trade her. No dont do that, if you see a riven dont try to take her head on with another bursty top laner. For example {{champion:92}} vs {{champion:127}}  this is something youd wanna choose if you see a riven. Dont be that guy to go {{champion:92}} vs {{champion:11}}  or some bad matchup like that, yes yi is strong and could kill her late game but youll feed her till then. Lissandras CC prevents riven from all ins and stops her burst short. \r\n\r\n3. Stop complaining. \r\n\r\nIssue with this: You ever heard people say, when your angrier you play worse? 100% true. Your not goku you wont go super saiyan and turn a 2-0 lead in her favor into 1 HKO in yours. NO! Dont feed a riven watch her snowball and complain about brokeness afterward. Learn the champion before spewing out unrealistic numbers and getting upset because you fed her.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is not an angry post what so ever, its just people unnecessarily post random and sometimes false information about a very easy to counter champion. Just because she can out lane a few champs doesnt make her broken in fact, {{champion:112}} can burst almost anyone down hes a better syndra, {{champion:55}} is still just r=penta {{champion:114}} can 1v1 almost any top laner. Yes thier all very good but whenever they are played they dont win 100% of the games, i feel like thats what people are making her out to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-03-17T01:07:14.064+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. So if riven freezes her lane near her tower you can't play the lane anymore?\n\n2. This means you can only use your CC defensively and you are basically playing riven's lane where she can just keep poking you down with Q-W-E away and use remaining Q procs however she pleases.\n\n3. I can see why you are upset when people are complaining about your main, when I started to main Irelia she was trash tier now shes getting nerfed again on PBE after becoming strong. Riven's kit is inherently overloaded, there is no real arguing with that. She has way too many weapons (3 dashes, hard CC, a shield that scales off of AD) to have the low cooldowns she has which is her major issue. She is due for some cooldown nerfs to she actually has to think about her play rather than being able to spam E-W-Q then have it all come up when she uses her last Q. I enjoy Riven and think she is fun to play but she does have some issues with her kit that make her pretty annoying to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-03-17T01:13:20.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. Lane management is a part of League.  You can unfreeze it easily enough if you know what you're doing.\n2. No, you can use your CC however you like, just make sure it's used well relative to what Riven has left in her kit.\n3. Whether she needs nerfs or her usual counters need buffs is a matter of debate, really.  There's a reason Riven drops off once in a while, and it's not always because of changes Riot made.  Unless you main her there are clear times when the meta does not favor playing her.","replies":[{"poster":"OoohCreamy","date":"2015-03-17T01:16:20.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i appreciate when people take a constructive view on her role THROUGHOUT the game.

Any champ, le blanc, zed, pretty much most mid laners, are even worse tbh mid game when fed.
