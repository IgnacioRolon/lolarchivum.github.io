HELP","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently bought an asus strix 1080 graphics card and whenever I open up the lol client the GPU clock goes to max (1671) and the Memory clock also goes to max (10012). I don't think the client should be using this much of my gpu but I might be wrong. Also I got this card to be able to run at 144hz (also for using it for video editing) and it stays arounf 144 for maybe 5-10 minutes then drops to around 100 or lower. Please help if you can!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T15:58:09.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this on the updated client?  What happens if you select low-performance mode in the client settings?  Processing power should only be increased slightly during champion select.  You should post this over on the [client discussion boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) for our testers and client devs to take a look at.  I'm not sure why that would happen, unless there is an optimization issue between the card, settings, or client.  Thanks for the report!","replies":[]}]}
