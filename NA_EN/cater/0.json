For some reason Riot wants Ahri as their flagship champion, giving her buffs that lower her skillfloor from patches after patches.\n\n3.15 mana buffs\n4.12 mana buffs\n5.2 Insane movespeed buff that makes her laning phase a joke and removes her dependence on her ultimate.\n\nEvery single one of her changes just removed her skillfloor. I must admit that 3.15 is somewhat meaningless, but before 4.12 as an Ahri, you had to make sure you land every Q or you were going to run oom and just get bullied to no end. It was something you had to practice over and over to be consistent. Back then it felt awesome to kill someone pre-6 with the last drops of your mana.\nAfter 4.12 with the -15 mana on Q, you could spam Ahri's Q for eternity, at least noobs have about 10% mana left all the time, while I'm always at 75% pre-6 opposed to 50%, what a buff to Ahri mains, it really helped us.\n\nAhri's weakness has always been her early game, one for her mana problems, which is totally nullified by Riot's attempts to make Ahri noob-friendly, and two because she synergies way too much with her ulti, meaning that she is a bit lackluster without it.\n\nBut here comes 5.2, where Riot decided to give Ahri a movespeed buff on her Q, so her pre-6 is not bad anymore, since you are ungankable, you can miss all your spells and be okay, and you are not gonna run oom anyhow. Heck, you can have no idea how to use Ahri ult, spam it and you can still stick around and be remotely useful.\n\nEvery single change ever made to Ahri, since patch 3.13, was in order to lower her skillfloor, so that everyone and their mother could play her. I know that everyone likes Ahri, boys wanna put it into her, while girls wanna have a body like hers, but that doesn't mean that a champion is supposed to be the easiest thing to pick up. Honestly, giving meaningless buffs to a champion is a huge fuck you for the mains, it probably won't change the fact that they are going to play the champ, even in ranked, while it lowers the chance to play her, since she becomes popular because she literally takes 0 practice to do decent, so people pick her and ban her.\n\nI do understand that some people are like \"Ahri is my favourite champion and I want her buffed\" but seriously, if you refuse to play your champion in ranked because she is not top tier, you don't deserve to play her at all. Every true Ahri main had to play through the anti-Ahri meta with Kayles and Lulus preventing us from getting kills, they also bullied us in lane along with silence LB, Yasuos and Braums negating all our damage. Honestly, whoever refuses to play their \"main champion\" just because they are not freelo, should have no right about commenting on balancing. Like I enjoy playing Diana and I think she is a fun champ, I would probably do her too, but I'm not willing to put my time into her to master her, therefore I'm not here crying for buffs.\n\nHonestly, a lot of champions would be top picks with -20 mana on their first ability to max and 0.05 AP ratio. Like Lux and Viktor would be tier 1, but I guess Riot doesn't want to suck them off, they are just not as attractive as Ahri.\n\nI also must mention, while every champion is getting their buffs little by little, Ahri is the only champion that got an UBERMEGA buff with 5.2, the balance team probably didn't give a damn that Ahri had over 55% winrate on PBE either, they just want everyone to have fun while playing her.\n\n\nAll in all, can we get changes that separates the lowest of the lowest Ahries from the decent ones?\nWhenever I played against an Ahri, I usually played a lanebully(Syndra, Cass) and they usually ended up being something like 0/5. As soon as she got DFG, her damage output became decent, what's the reason to poop on her if she can be okay outside of laning? Why even encourage everyone to play her with mana buffs?\n\nNow with the changes, I was watching Oddone's stream, saw an Ahri, going 0/4, builds lich bane, void staff and 1v1s the 4/3 top lane wukong, while Ahri had no cs. Then she yolo spirit rushes into a Vi and Zed without having a zhonyas and dies, while overall, she had a better impact on the game than Zed, while getting pooped on with a garbage build.\n\nGive patch 3.15 Ahri back, plox.","replies":[]}
