Those texture rebalances weren't half assed visual updates they were done so everything blended together seemingly. \n\nAnd that's only 1 of the problems, they'd have to go through and make all the new quality textures, make optimizations and fix a slew of things, when there time can be better spent balancing the game, fixing bugs, or releasing skins/champions.\n\n\nEdit: Idiots that downvote factual evidence is hilarious, you don't make it any less true just because it makes you mad, all you do is hide the truth under piles of more garbage comments.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-12-23T16:10:20.605+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except there were multiple skins for summoner's rift which they refuse to let us have for a few years now....","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-12-23T16:14:06.387+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Are you talking about those skins from the old summoners rift?
