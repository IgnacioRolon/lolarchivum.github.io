{"poster":"Lee Sin Q","date":"2017-05-29T19:33:48.154+0000","title":"Honest question to Yasuo mains","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"First off, as a Lee Sin main, I have my gripes about the champion.\nI think they need to give him a clear identity as to his purpose and stick to that.\nHis problem is he needs to land Q to be useful. However, he&#039;s giving the opportunity to ult you and land Q or ward hop to land Q. On top of his high base move speed ( why do they give mobile champs high base speed?!?) it&#039;s pretty hard to miss and if someone dodges Lee Q it&#039;s usually because the Lee Sin messed it up. I think his kit is overbearing in that sense, that there&#039;s so much utility in his kit to help him land his Q (did I mention the E slow?)\n\nNow, I can admit to Lee being stupid in that regard.\n\nCan Yasuo players amid that Yasuo is stupid in his own regard?\n\nHow many times are you playing vs a Yasuo, as a melee champ, and you&#039;re dodging his Q&#039;s (he has one skill shot and can&#039;t hit that? WHAAAT?? lol) and then you&#039;re like okay, he has no window to pop you up. Then he hangs back and Q&#039;s minions to set up his tornado. Okay, that&#039;s annoying? Where is the incentive between Q&#039;ing minions and champions? Should there not be a difference?\nHow about when you&#039;re dodging his tornadoes and then he DASHES ON TOP OF YOU and knocks you up.\n\nThese are mechanics that bail out bad Yasuo players who can&#039;t land his only skill shot. The same thing with Lee happens here. It&#039;s not necessary.\n\nRanged is a short argument but basically your poke is kind of negated from wind wall and YES it&#039;s on a high cooldown but he dashes constantly so if you have skill shots, it requires you to put in a lot more work to land it than he has to to dodge it. If you do manage to hit him, you better hope it&#039;s not an ability you need for long because his wind shield is up. On top of that, he has a Q mechanic that allows him to long range poke ranged champions back if he hits Q&#039;s on minions. Is that really necessary? On top of his passive which gives him a SHIELD, is all that really necessary?\n\nI mean.. is it that hard for Yasuo players to admit, maybe, just MAYBE Riot made his kit a little too well rounded to handle so many different threats?\n\ntl;dr: I hate Yasuo mains and I hope we can sky rocket that ban rate to 100% lel\n\nEdit: Hilarious that I'm getting down voted. If you're going to downvote, defend your case. I'm not saying Yasuo is OP. He's not in that category right now. I'm saying why can't people admit that he has problems that need to be addressed?","replies":[{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-05-29T19:35:24.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"And yet despite this supposedly uber amazing kit, he's not OP","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-05-29T19:54:28.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Very few people call him OP, even though some boards users tend to see \"unfun to play against\" as \"mimimi OP plz nurf\" while it has nothing to do with each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Lee Sin Q","date":"2017-05-29T20:13:21.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I wouldn't say he's OP.

The first of which is that his wind wall just makes any projectile disappear even if its literally .1 second from hitting him.... But it does have a long cooldown early on, i just hate that thing.\n\nThe second is that his Q tornado applies on hit effects. This includes lifesteal and Grasp of the Undying and Warlords Bloodlust etc. This to me feels like an extreme amount of utility that also knocks people up, costs nothing, and comes up after 2 Qs that hit that has a cd thats lowered based on attack speed.\n\nThe on hit effects on tornado can be taken off and ill be perfectly happy with him even though i will still be annoyed by him.","replies":[{"poster":"Buildermann 13","date":"2017-05-29T23:54:28.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do wish his w could be more like a karthus/anivia wall in its placement","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-29T20:01:01.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with Yasuo is that he was designed to be a melee ADC, and everything in his kit was designed to let him survive in the botlane (passive shield to survive poke, windwal to neuter anything ranged, endless mobility to get in and out of melee range quickly). The problem is that the melee ADC concept doesn't work in LoL. Due to the lack of turnspeed, ranged characters can kite melees to oblivion, and anything that gives a melee character enough tools to survive such a lopsided battle gives that character more than enough power to completely dominate the fairer melee v melee matchups. \n\nBoth melee ADC projects (Morder and Yasuo) failed for the same reason, they were given overloaded kits for botlane and then proceeded to dominate the others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sujiren","date":"2017-05-29T19:52:43.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Depends on his winrate if its 50% or more then he is, yasuo is supposed to be high skill cap, he is not supposed to have a winrate of 50% and above globally,  that just means he is overtuned.","replies":[]}]}
