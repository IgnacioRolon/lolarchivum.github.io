I am 3/0 in them ATM, each win with {{champion:15}} .  \r\n\r\nI feel my strongest suits with ADC, is keeping up farming mid/late game, and i teamfight well and can usually stay alive.  I can use QSS well and build defensive items before i &#039;need&#039; them to prevent too many deaths.  My weakest point is early game farming and trading.   I am basically trash and start throwing until i get a full {{item:3031}}  and i become much more confident once i get a {{item:3087}} . {{champion:15}}  is the only ADC i can play well, and I own {{champion:429}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:18}}  but my skill level is much lower with them.  {{champion:15}}  is my comfort pick and she has served me well, even against bad matchups like {{champion:67}}.    Another obvious problem is that if my support and I don&#039;t mildly  synergize or the aa minions or are too aggro it puts me behind because it stresses me out.  Even in normals this happens.\r\n\r\nI can play {{champion:37}}  and {{champion:201}}  well enough, and usually become a threat to the enemy team with {{champion:37}}  because of my aggro playstyle with her and become a secondary AP carry with basically a {{item:2049}} .  Adc is my primary role, supp my second best, and while i can play mid, i would sooner go into a jungle role with {{champion:33}} , avoiding top at all costs.  \r\n\r\nDo you have tips on what ADC&#039;s would be a good alternative to {{champion:15}} , like {{champion:81}}  {{champion:104}} {{champion:51}} etc?  And any advice on how to get better at laning phase and winning the CS battle?  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not asking good questions but feel free to add anything you think may help me out.  I just want to improve because I belong in low silver at the moment and i don&#039;t want to be there because i think i can improve","replies":[{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2015-07-24T18:41:35.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just keep working on your weak points until you are ok at them and then keep improving until you get good at them. it's easier to improve your weakest points than it is to improve your strongest. to win at csing, just don't miss any of the easy cs. you can also try to push the wave to their tower which gives you an edge, but you have to watch out for ganks.\n\nget to level 2 first also in lane by killing 7 minions. when you get to level 2 first, you should be able to fight and win in a trade or at lest make it safe so they can't engage on you and get to level 2 before you.","replies":[{"poster":"Chatillon","date":"2015-07-24T19:08:05.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard that about the weaker points :)  Thanks for your advice :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Feed Daddy","date":"2015-07-24T22:40:54.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Vayne\n\nYou'll git gud","replies":[{"poster":"Chatillon","date":"2015-07-26T19:36:25.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then i would become what I hate the most in this world....a good Vayne player","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-26T00:05:02.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One way to win trades is to be the initiator.
