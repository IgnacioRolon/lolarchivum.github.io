But when i got the item it doesn&#039;t work at all. I don&#039;t know if its a bug or if Jayce&#039;s R just doesn&#039;t count as an ultimate ability. This was really disappointing because i felt like it would be a really good item on jayce.","replies":[{"poster":"R33LNAUTI","date":"2018-06-03T17:26:54.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just made a post about this also, the essence flare will not trigger if you cast anything before landing the next auto after ult on any champ i've tested, so if you were Ulting on jayce into hammer form and using Q as a gap closer then it wont trigger, only way is to ult, auto, then use ability. Can confirm it will work on jayce if you dont cast anything before auto.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-06-03T12:24:59.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could it be because Jayce R costs no mana?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-06-03T11:44:30.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in b4 buying 6 {{item:3508}}  on champs with 0 ultimates such as {{item:3070}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:60}} {{item:3070}}  qq probably doesn't work with nimbus cloak, presence of mind, ult reduction ~~cap~~ ultimate hunter","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2018-06-01T02:12:13.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, basically, you're saying that it doesn't give CDR to Jayce's R?
