I only have 227 wins, 24 champions, and 2 rune pages. Nonetheless, I have maybe 4-5 champions I can pick with my eyes closed and confidently play with, maybe 10 champions I&#039;m pretty good with. Been playing in the jungle since I hit level 30 (not lately though). Is it worth it for me to pursue ranked, or should I get more wins, etc, before I try it?\n\nHere's my stats: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Lunathil","replies":[{"poster":"wRZcGiWq62","date":"2015-04-13T00:51:36.278+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know you're ready for ranked when you dont mind hearing \"WOW NOOB GO KILL YOURSELF AND DO THE WORLD A FAVOR!\" every single time that you make a mistake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-04-13T05:03:46.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to have a wrong idea what ranked is about, methinks.  Based upon what you are saying, you look to be taking the wrong approach to it\nRanked Queue is a separate queue for semi-serious competitive play.  It comes with leagues so that you can have milestones that can give you a very rough estimate of your improvement in play.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nThat's all ranked is.  If you want a queue with a record of matches because you want to improve your own play at League of Legends, then ranked is for you.  Give it a shot!\nOr don't!  The majority of players don't bother with it either.  Do whatever you want.\n\nP.S.
