I've already played them to the point where I play every single other character with an assassin mentality. My question is, as an assassin jungler, is my job to simply pounce on the enemy APC or ADC and take them out or should I just throw myself into the teamfight? I always hold back for a good chance to get the ADC and/or APC, thus either leaving me the only one alive...or sometimes I die anyways...or we win the teamfight. \r\n\r\nQuestion is: Should I hold back in a teamfight, as Kha'zix or Rengar, to find a opportune moment to take out the ADC or APC? Or should I just jump right in the mosh pit? \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Cullens","date":"2015-02-27T20:13:13.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Kha I don't like to jump right in unless I'm super fed, you need to get the resets on your E to get out if needed. I like to evolve W and E before team fights really start, use W to poke teams down and once there is someone low enough to kill thats when you go in, you aren't normally tanky enough to just jump in with everyone high on health","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dincht","date":"2015-02-27T19:28:03.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though Kha and Rengar are assassins, both play differently in team fight. \n\nKha'Zix - When I play Kha, I usually try to hold back in team fights because of his abilities. His Q deals more damage on isolated champions, and in team fight, people usually grouped up together. I usually wait for the enemy team to be half hp or almost dead before going in and cleaning up the fight. (Assuming that the teams are even in CS and Kills) Or what you could do is jump to their back line and chase away their ad carry or ap carry until they're isolated and then assassinate them. (However I don't advise on chasing them away from team fights if you're not fed or ahead) Also if you're super ahead, you can do 4-1 where you split push w hydra and assassinate anyone who's trying to stop you.\n\nRengar - I don't play play Ren very often. But He's great at initiating fights. You want to catch the enemy by surprise when you're playing Ren. Try to force a team fight with bushes around so that you can hop around! I see tanky Ren more than assassin Ren nowadays. lol\n\nI hope these help! \nSorry I don't main jungle so I can't provide you with more detailed informations! \nIf you have any question, feel free to add me and ask! I can try my best to help out!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-02-27T19:09:24.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It completely depends on your team comp.
