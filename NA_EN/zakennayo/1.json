Sona hasn't had decent damage output for almost 3 years now.  If you're referring to any point in this game after season 3, every Sona nerf has been based purely on Rito prejudice against the champ and Meddler's personal desire to remove her from the game.  As things stand, she's officially considered a troll pick:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/9Pv7v6hv-im-repeatedly-griefed-for-picking-sona","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-04T21:08:06.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sona was nerfed for being too much of a bully in lane as a support, while also being able to heal herself and allies.\n\nLast I checked, Xerath wasn't exactly setting records for healing done in a match.","replies":[{"poster":"Zakennayo","date":"2017-04-04T21:12:03.034+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrCyanide,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mHgWnqY2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-04T21:08:06.071+0000)\n>\n> Sona was nerfed for being too much of a bully in lane as a support, while also being able to heal herself and allies.\n> \n> Last I checked, Xerath wasn&#x27;t exactly setting records for healing done in a match.\n\nThey why not tone back that heal?\n\nOh right, it ate up a huge chunk of mana and made it next to impossible to use as an actual sustain method unless you're severely ahead.\n\nBut they still toned it back. So the cost/effect doesn't match up to shit. Shield is still nice though.\n\nIf we're talking about bullies, why hasn't Morg been gutted into oblivion? Her Q hitbox is so out of the actual zone that it curves to hit at times!\n\nOr why haven't they toned down Leona's perma stun? Once she lands her snare, its GG to whoever got snared.\n\nWhat about Ali's insane knockup and immense tankyness! He can eat turret hits at 6 depending on build.\n\n\nBut no. Sona. Someone who has to get into range of all these abilities, among others, to hit her Q, was nerfed.\n\nWhat.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-04T21:23:43.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> They why not tone back that heal?\n\nBecause they didn't find the heal as oppressive in lane as the poke damage. They nerfed her problem area.\n\nSona's sporting a 53% win rate right now, higher than any of the other Supports you listed. It would seem the nerf was not enough to make her weak by any means.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#/roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zakennayo","date":"2017-04-04T21:08:49.444+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You'd think that annoyance would be more recognized.
