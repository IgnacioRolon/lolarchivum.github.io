Jungling was invented to gank. Back in the day..the days where you coul6d not level up in jungle past level 6 with ease, Ganking was needed to get leveled up. Ever since they added to the jungle making it possible to level up, junglers have gradually forgotten the whole purpose of jungling and something in their heads made them think its to farm farm farm.\n\nSaying \"I cant be wasting my time babysitting a lane that is YOUR job to do well in\" just sounds like you dont even give a damn about the team or whether you win or lose. you're just in it to see your build grow.\n\nSo let me explain how junglers ganking benifits the team. If a jungler enters a lane and doesnt kill anyone. it puts pressure off the lane giving your team breathing room and possibly saving the turret...turrets are vital to winning the game If a jungler does get a kill he gets gold. If he doesn get the kill and just assist, he gets assist gold. If theirs no enemies in the lane due to killing them. bam turret wide open for the taking. 400 for first turret destroyed and 300 for every other turret.. Ganking helps the team win the game by offering a big advantage in the lane. either a 2vs1 fight or 3vs2 fight. If jungler were to get kills plus turret. thats about 900-1400 gold in a matter of a couple minutes. \n\n\nNow when the turret falls. Guess what that does? it frees up the lane so those laners can also gank. \n\nEver wondered why junglers that gank often tend to win the game?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fury and Emperor","date":"2014-11-22T23:43:19.212+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the new S5 jungle.\n\nBe glad when the jungler doesn't die to the jungle and instead limps home with 100 hp.
