I understand that a lot of the time it will either be my fault that I died or not  contributing enough to help in team fights (whiffed ults and all). After the nerf I decided to try being a tank and pretty much soak damage and buff the team and surprisingly it has been effective. If anything I am a good distraction and with item slows I can end up dying, but contributing to our team getting an ace. I cant say its perfect as I have only done it in normals, ranked silver, and now ranked gold. \r\n\r\nIs it viable or am I going to get my come-upins soon?","replies":[]}
