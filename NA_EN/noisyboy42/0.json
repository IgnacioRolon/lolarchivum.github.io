I have a Dell laptop with an i5 core. I've been playing league for a while and had no problems and then all of a sudden i started getting hard freezes when I would spawn at the beginning of the game in the fountain on 5s. I kept playing games to see if it was a fluke or not and every time in a 5s game it froze at the beginning. So then I went to 3s (regulars and customs by myself) and Ive gotten mixed results of when it freezes. Every time I go after vielmaw it freezes, sometimes in the beginning it freezes, sometimes at the end when  a nexus explodes it freezes, and sometimes it just seems completely random. through the process of this I've downloaded AVG and done major comp cleaning and I also tried a dell driver update, and still no change. I seriously don't know whats going on and would appreciate help. And this all started October 7th.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-12T23:02:05.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using Windows 10?  An update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing this exact freezing problem for some players.  Disabling that bar should fix the issue!","replies":[{"poster":"NoisyBoy42","date":"2016-11-12T23:05:45.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am on windows 10.
