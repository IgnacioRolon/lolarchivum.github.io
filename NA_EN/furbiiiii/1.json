Since i bought it, I have noticed that it's performance is not what i should expect.\r\n\r\nI mean, i can be in Google Chrome viewing a page, and in the moment i scroll using my mouse, the laptop like freezes for a milisecond and then continues. Same happens when playing videogames, i can be playing at low/ultra details, 60+ frames per second, but every now and then i get a frame drop and then it goes back to where it was before, it's super annoying and shouldn't be happening.\r\n\r\nI always thought it was something with the game, that it was not well optimised but it seems to be the computer.\r\n\r\nThings i have done: \r\n\r\n1. I reinstalled Windows 10 using the software provided by Microsoft.\r\n\r\n2. All my drivers are up to date\r\n\r\nWhat could it be? my laptop specs are:\r\n\r\n6th Generation Intel Core i7-6700HQ Processor (6M Cache, up to 3.50 GHz)]\r\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 4GB GDDR5\r\n8GB Single Channel DDR3L 1600MHz (8GBx1)\r\n1TB (5400rpm) Hybrid HDD with 8GB Flash\r\n\r\nAll these things occur with the laptop plugged or not, it doesn't matter. Gaming, i have used Balanced and High Performance battery mode but i don't see any difference.\r\n\r\nBenchmark i did using HDTune:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/wf68f","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T23:19:35.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be issues with your other system drivers or hardware.
