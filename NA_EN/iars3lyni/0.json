I cannot seem to find an answer. So we dont have exact sizes, but what DO we know, I would suggest putting all the information we have all in one place, here on this forum page or a wiki of some sort. If there already is and i am just missing it, Someone please tell me. Im all of a sudden obsessed with the Map and the Lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IArs3lynI","date":"2019-07-08T20:36:31.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i know there was a certain \"team\" (or what some people called it, \"department\") who officially made the map.

However, we specifically did _not_ put a scale indicator on the map.  \n\nInternally for Rioters only we do have scale indicators (and I made a document with a few example distances and estimated travel times in different weathers/times of the year, etc) but we chose not to have scale on this map.\n\nAt this point, using the references and examples, some of which I mentioned above, people can get distances that are in the right kind of scale, but we've not publicly shown distances yet in hard numbers.  I'm not sure if we're intending to in the near future.\n\nI'm sorry that's not the answer you were looking for.\n\nI'm not sure if I've misunderstood, but were you asking about the size of the buildings on the map, so you could work out the size of the continents?  Because the map is not a literal representation - it's not a satellite map.  The Runeterra map is stylized for clarity - the mountains are shown steeper than realistic, the rivers are wider than realistic, and the icons are symbols more like a Disneyland map than a photograph from space.\n\nI guess, I'm still unsure if I've answered your question or not.\n\n(Also, Runeterra isn't an island, but I suspect that's the tiredness talking :) )","replies":[{"poster":"IArs3lynI","date":"2019-07-10T23:02:04.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is good so far, but with no real concrete information, since there no official information about the size of Runeterra, ill just simply wait then","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-07-07T10:45:25.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say Europe and North Africa is a good example size going into middle east a little, with Ionia being the size of India.
