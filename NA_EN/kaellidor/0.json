In your eyes, they either get the satisfaction of laying into someone playing meek, or they get the satisfaction of knowing that you're _easy pickings_ to provoke and start a flame war with.\n\nBut, I've learned that, when it comes to a flamer or troll; the most painful wound you could inflict is to ignore them.

You have a right to **defend** yourself from what others do to you. That's not the same thing. Defending yourself means you preventing harm to come to you.
