You'll continue to accrue more low priority games, but you're more likely to get banned if these leaving is intentional.  Otherwise, leaving still causes other players a negative experience.  Your best bet is to stick to customs and troubleshoot whatever is causing you to leave.  If you're having technical issues, I'm happy to try and help just let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anderi","date":"2017-12-06T21:27:14.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot will not ban you for one time, not even for 10 leaves, instead you will get the 'Low Priority Queue' status, where you have to wait 5,10,20,30 minutes before you get placed in the queue for a few matches, usually 5 (you get a countdown as a notification after each match how many you still have until you remove the 'Low Priority Queue' status) . \n\n[LeaverBuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)\n\nYour ban is highly probable for some more serious violation.","replies":[]}]}
