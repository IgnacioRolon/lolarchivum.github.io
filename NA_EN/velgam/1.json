It can be that i'm stupid. It can also be that you only think you have a case here. humor me?\n\n> If person is consistently playing poorly they are not ready for ranked/competitive play\n\nThe point of ranked is to differentiate the good players from the bad ones and to make a playing environment where the good play VS the good and the bad VS the bad. \n\nIf a player does not play well, consistently, it does not mean he is not ready, it means he is not good. If he is not good, he should be made to play with the bad players.\n\nThe bad players are not the guys in normals; they are the guys in ranked bronze. \n\n> troll/inters/RQers/feeders clearly do not take it seriously\n\nwhich is exactly why I switched to ranked: not because I have skill (last month i was b5), but because in ranked, the mid lane assassin that is ahead is actually getting objectives instead of running away from objectives trying to prolong the game and stat pad. \n\n> or lack the skill to be in there\n\nhow much skill do you need to be in ranked? lets quantify it: bronze level of skill? silver level of skill? gold level of skill? If you put me in a gold game I will consistently and reliably feed my ass off. Similarly, once I got more skilled, I outright toyed with them B5s; none of them could play well with me in the game.\n\nYou mistake what ranked is. Ranked is not a mode for the people who have the skillz. It is a mode for the people who want to play with others of their own skill level, and to merit playing with better people through improving themselves. \n\nAnd also you mistake how skill works. It's not an absolute measure, it is relative. A player like me can play quite competitively, against people of my own skill: But in your skill level I will just feed. \n\n> so why punish 4 other players \n\nThere you go again, treating the other guy's failure as an act of aggression against yourself. Stop playing the victim.\n\n>   I am seeing people's arguments but none of them hold water, especially yours.\n\nI don't see that I've made an argument yet. Just trying to understand your point of view, and see if you have a case and what that case is, if you have one. \n\nHere is my point of view:\n\npeople who are casual and do not take the game seriously are one type of player.\npeople who intentionally feed and grief are a second type of player\nand people who suck but want a serious game are a third type of player. \n\nthe three types of players deserve different treatments:\n\nThe \"casuals\" deserve a laid back playing field where nobody really cares much about winning and losing. So we'll make a game mode like that and we'll call it \"normals\"\n\nThe people who suck deserve a good game against people of their level, with the people who do not suck spared from playing with them. We'll make a second game mode for them and call it \"bronze\", and put the good players in \"silver\", \"gold\", etc. That way they silvers and gold don't have to deal with their braindead zombie play style, and they don't have to deal with the casuals not playing to win. \n\nthe people who grief we remove from the game or \"reform\" them because nobody wants to play with them. We'll do that with \"reports\". \n\nYour solution is basically to take \"bronze\" and mix it up with \"normals\"; And I do not see the advantage or justification in doing that.\n\nYou are just taking from the bronze players the advantages of ranked games and throwing them into a game mode where the other players don't care and the matchmaking is so lenient the games are often a contest of who's team has the most high MMR person, and you are putting into the casual games pool a bunch of players who want to tryhard.","replies":[{"poster":"Velgam","date":"2017-06-03T21:51:52.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who go out and troll on purpose in ranked do not take it seriously.\nThere are players in bronze that don't  totally suck\nI'm not mixing bronze with norms, that is already done\nYou all not understanding still what I am proposing here, this isn't ban bronze players from ranked, there are people who do bad and lose but did nothing to warrant a report, which is why it needs 4 players + 1 from the enemy team.\nIf you constantly go 0/12 game after game after game in ranked, why play it? practice in norms, it not harm to take some time from ranked and play in norms for a bit, then go back into ranked, this is to help them improve, this is to keep them from tilting themselves, this is to keep players from all elo from trolls and those on tilt who keep spamming ranked when they need some time to cool off and reevaluate and reflect on what they are doing wrong in games","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-06-03T17:26:53.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Velgam,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=471jO5xL,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-06-03T15:54:25.849+0000)\n>\n> Simple they all have the same thing in common, horrible kda, when i say horrible I&#x27;m talking 2/13/2 kind of kda, now there are people who have bad kda but still help the team thus they would not warrant this ranked ban as it need to be from all 4 teammates + 1  from the enemy team, this is just giving them to cool off and play some normal games and polish up their skills, to see if they are in the right mind set for ranked on that day.\n\nIts fine to had horrible KDA.
