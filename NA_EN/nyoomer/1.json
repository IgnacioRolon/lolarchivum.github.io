If it's crashing randomly without any kind of error message, it could be due to corrupted files somewhere in the installation. Try running a quick repair and let me know if that helps. If not, try to explain exactly what happened when things go wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyoomer","date":"2017-11-15T00:20:28.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sorry, I forgot to mention something else.
