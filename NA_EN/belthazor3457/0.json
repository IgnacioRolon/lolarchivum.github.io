Let me repeat that: Kills are worth 1 point, Relics 3. So while helping in teamfights is nice and all, if you don't have a chance at a multiple kill and a relic sometimes it's best to go for a free relic and even out a losing fight. Not to never help your team, but if you see the enemy has 3 members at 50% hp maybe it's best to leave them be and get a relic. \n\nAlso sometimes it's best to sacrifice yourself to save a relic. Because remember, a kill is worth one point where a relic is worth 3. If you can slow down someone doing a relic long enough for your team to arrive  and get either a revenge kill or the relic then you will have gotten a net gain. \n\nLosing an Ascension is not always a bad thing, if you hurl 3 members onto a desperate Ascension and lose all three with no kills the enemy will have gotten a huge gain, more than the 5 normally. Remember that if the enemy gets an Ascension and you kill them before they can get any kills it's as if no one got it in the first place. If you didn't lose members to a smite battle then nothing gained or loss. Of course try to steal it, but tunneling on it with all your member may not always be the best option, try using one Champion and some AoE poke from afar to steal, even a single DoT spell can get you the buff.\n\nSucceeding in Ascension is both learning advanced concepts and strong judgement. Every point above is pointless if you don't think about how they're being used in a specific situation. Knowing how points are distributed and how to delay and score points is crucial, as much as getting the best Champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-09-13T04:36:13.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite pick to get ascension is Vlad.

I think people still don't fully understand Ascension as a game mode, and as you said, capturing relics and controlling Xerath is more important than battling all the time with the enemy team. I have been called for not helping them when i was racking some points for us getting free relics, but i have won some games with that strategy. Like you point out, it is better to inform your teammates about this map's objectives before the match starts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2014-09-13T21:19:32.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to win Every time: {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"promezeus","date":"2014-09-13T20:00:57.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ww cause epic sustain and decent damage that and he uses all stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeralyos","date":"2014-09-13T15:33:01.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like Xin Zhao for the mode. Great frontloaded damage while being reasonably tanky. I scoop up loads of kills with him regardless of if he's ascended, and when he does ascend, he becomes an absolute beast because of his relatively good AD scaling and the fact that the extra AP allows his W heal to outscale the reduction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charm","date":"2014-09-12T18:16:53.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just tanky bruisers.","replies":[]}]}
