I look at my other teams and they give me the same error. I haven&#039;t played on the teams in a month or longer. It may be a glitch, I may still get rewards. I will keep you guys updated on this issue. It has also been two days since I first noticed, may have been weeks since I don&#039;t check often.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-11T21:50:57.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Intro Bot,\n\nEnd of season rewards started rolling out today.
