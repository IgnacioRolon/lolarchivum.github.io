I am a Sona main and she is my favorite champion. At the moment I own Arcade skin. With Christmas around, I am definitely going to get enough RP for  to afford at least an Ultimate Skin. However, now that Silent Night Sona is on sale, I am quite perplexed. If I buy the Silent Night, I might be able to afford another champ skin.

Why only get one of her skins when you can take somebody's credit card and irresponsibly spend money for in game cosmetics like half of the League of Legends community!
