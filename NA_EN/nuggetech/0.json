In fact all the champs that have reached lvl 5 on my account are mages with the exception of MF. Yet no matter how bad or good I play, and no matter what I try, I always lose to them. Since tank is becoming meta it is already hard to kill them and I target the squishy targets. \r\n\r\nSupports, ADCS, and my mid-laner are the two options I have. I can take care of the support and try my best to not lose my lane. But as soon as an ADC say a Vayne pops up no matter what, I will lose to them. Their dmg is way too high and their items make sure they always survive fights. And in a game where my mid laner is AD and the jg is twitch, its a lost game for me.\r\n\r\nI really don&#039;t know how should I build in this scenario. Please help me out guys","replies":[{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2017-12-10T13:27:28.051+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":"**Pro-tip**: _play Vayne or other ADCs that you think are \"op\", you will probably see their weaknesses first hand when you get abused on them - then you will know how to play against them. Here are my tips from experience_\n\n1) Zhonyas, honestly tabis doesn't matter because it's better if you're able to 1-shot them with sorcs\n\n2) You shouldn't find yourself in a situation where Vayne can 1v1 you. Literally you should NEVER ever be in a position where Vayne can safely 1v1 you. That means in a teamfight don't \"run for your life\" the second Vayne tries to go for you, kite into your tanks and she will eat CC and she will get 1-shot. \n\nThats where Zhonyas is super important - if Vayne wants to try and assassinate you in the backline - she will HAVE TO put herself in a very dangerous position and if you pop zhonyas, she now finds herself completely boned (cause she used her single target DPS on you - and can't kill you anymore 100% boned).\n\n3) SAVE FOR CC FOR HER. Looking at your previous game Vayne _did not buy QSS_. The second she gets CC'd she is 100% BONED. Don't show out your Q willy-nilly, the cooldown is long enough for her to kill you. (As lux), Save your Q for when she pops out of stealth. Trust me, you will 1-shot her long before she can kill you if you hit her with Q  + E + ult no matter how fed she is.\n\n4) **twitch jungle** This is actually up to your jungler to abuse. All you can do is play pretty far back and not take bad trades (aka stay healthy). \n\nTwitch has freaking completely shit ganks - his only benefit is \"suprising you\". If you are FULL health, not pushed up further than 1/2 lane, then you can literally just walk out of his gank.\n\nALSO - be very wary if your enemy goes into you \"randomly\", assume twitch is coming if you don't see him on the map. Don't be like \"oh this guy is so stupid I win this trade\". No. You're probably going to die.

It's just that they have too many get out of jail cards.\n\nNot only are they the only duo lane, the bot turret is the most valuable one as it is near to the dragon pit. Due to this, they have the jg and support to take care of them. And if the adc gets a double kill before 5 min by chance, it ends up in their favor. I think the items are way too strong in case of ADCs and cheaper. Rabodan is one of the strongest APC items and it costs way too  much\n\nAlos, mage mid-laners have no choice but to go AP while ADCs have many options","replies":[{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2017-12-10T17:53:02.284+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't build rabadon unless 1) enemy is super squishy or 2) you're snowballing hard. IMO rabadons is a bit too expensive - but its important not to get hung up on Rabadons. You don't NEED rabadons - in this meta you'll do PLENTY of damage to 1-shot the shit out of people without it. \n\nWell imagine this, Vayne has a \"get out of jail free card\" in a _sense_ with her tumble - but remember, she also has effectively HALF of Lux's range. This means that she should HAVE TO use her tumble aggressively to get near you - AKA putting it on a 2sec+ cd where she's immobile and within 500 range of your team. In a teamfight she can only condemn 1 person. Who is she gonna condemn? Your ADC so they can't DPS her? Your tank so they can't CC her? She has no good options and any option leads to death. \n\nAlso imagine you hold onto E for her, she tumbles forward (cuz she has to) and the second she pops out of stealth you hit her with an E + auto + E-recast while auto in the air. Easily takes off 2/3 of her health late game. She hits you 2 times in that process (maybe chunks you for 2/3, lets say even through shield). Press Zhonyas. What can Vayne do now? She's 1/3 health, no tumble for 1 second, and she has no shiv proc, and no silver bolts stacks on anyone targetable. She's fucked. \n\nRemember, you CANNOT, I repeat, CANNOT find yourself in a 1v1 situation against her. It's like finding yourself in a 1v1 situation against Master Yi.

you survive a mage rotation he have to wait like 7/10 sec before he can do any damage (especially with the lack of damage and CDR that the item you mentioned would give,the only decent is

i have 20 or more kills and the whole time i'm fighting while my ADC got stomped and is playing the whole game bot afk farming i will outdamage him,but still my damage output (not damage over the whole game) was just a bit higher than him \nthen we are talking about my main,not a random champion,i see you main ADC (should have noticed that from your points,you almost never played a mage),and i

reach 300 AD/2.00+AS with some ADC (300*250% = 750,add any damage buff that every ADC or ADC item have),you named 4 items,but  i said \"full build or almost\" (because with 4 items her W would deal

it is to pump out those autos when Kha comes out of stealth in your face\n\nagain,we are not talking about assassins,but about mages\nit's the same if you are playing a mage,the only difference is that they mainly focus ADCs as they deal more damage than mages\nwith a nice support (and eventually {{item:3026}}) a kha will never kill you unless you are out of positioning\n\neven you admited that ADC are too strong,there is a reason if an ADC can't be replaced while a mage can,or that ADCs are the first focus and they are the ones that you don't want to die and usually gets tons of

I usually go all in on damage/mag.pen ... relying on my positioning and team to stay out of danger. If you think particular opponents are troublesome, build defensively accordingly, but not before youve finished 3 items. Honestly, in bronze, I would just build straight damage, it will help you snowball ahead, and youll be able to kill tanks. Later ELOs require some more strategic buys where you max/min damage/defense.\nFor example, I like to take velkoz, if the adc tries to duel me, I pop barrier and all in them with my combo. Unless they're way ahead, they don't stand a chance. Always know your opponents. If you're up against vayne, don't let her break your channel with her E, but that's understood, every game, be aware of what you need to do to outplay your opponent so you're not surprised... if you see an Ashe, be ready to side dodge if you see her getting too close (especially if her support is pushing up with her), since she's likely posturing up for an all in combo.\n\nI see you like to play Ahri/Lux mid.\n\nFor Ahri, you should be able to kill the ADC from your combo. Use your R to close the gap then charm, then use your other skills Q/W, and other 2 Rs to skirt around them hitting killing them. The ADC should never stand a chance if you land your shots. Don't use your Q to run in, because you won't kill them and then you're vulnerable. W is only good for a few extra bits of damage. If you need to, land a few Q's from the edge, then when you think you can combo them, then go in with R.\n\nLux. Again, they shouldn't be able to get anywhere near you. If you miss your Q or E you're likely dead. Use E to zone, then Q once they are slowed. Or use Q to force them into E if they want to dodge. If you hit Q and E, then R them. Lux is relatively predictable with her strategy, so practicing so you're comfortable landing E right at max distance is what'll raise your skill cap. You may want to start taking comet, especially for lux since they can't dodge it when you hit them with your spells.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2017-12-11T20:05:40.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Żügżwäng","date":"2017-12-12T05:18:40.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you replying to comments that clearly aren't written for you lol.
