Just say which champ(s) is the one you hate the most. For me: - \r\n**Top**: {{champion:122}} He is the reason why I don&#039;t play top. The BS heal and the frickin ult is too much for me.\r\n\r\n**Jungle**: {{champion:35}} Picture this. You are a Katarina against a Veigar. You bait his &#039;E&#039; then go full on ham on him. He still has his ult but you some how outplay him. And manage to kill him with just 5% of HP left. Satisfied, you are about to go back. When suddenly you are ignited and get shived. Before you know what is going on you are dead. When you look at you kill feed, it&#039;s {{champion:35}} like a serial killer he is.\r\n\r\n**Mid**: - {{champion:105}} The &#039;E&#039; ability\r\n\r\n**Support**: - {{champion:53}} The fckin hook. As soon as he hooks you, you are dead.\r\n\r\n**ADC**: -{{champion:67}}. 1v5. Need I say more. The only ADC that can 1v1 her is Draven. Other wise she will completely shred your 500 Stacks Nasus or your tankiest Rammus. It does not matter at all.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, the champ that I hate the most is {{champion:157}} . Not because of his flashy as ***k abilities or his angsty dialogues. But its the player who make me hate him. Not because they are toxic. After all, Riven, Udyr and many other players are notorious for being toxic as well. Not because they like to spam their dashes like a madman esp. when I play mid. But it&#039;s because they are unreliable. You don&#039;t know whether the Yasuo on your team is going to feed or carry like a boss. Whenever I have a Yasuo player on my team, the result has always been a loss with a few rare wins. But the Yasuo on the other team is a frickin god.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. This is not a generalization. Just something for fun. Every champ requires is easy to learn but hard to master. And we are human beings so obviously we are far from being perfect. I doubt every toxic player is a jerk in real life.

However, as a direct result of this, she builds ARTIFICIAL damage, usually in the form of Spellblade and Echo, which actually do do damage.\n\nAfter that, Sona is also the worst healer in the game, but even with Windspeaker's and any of the several Windspeaker items, her minuscule heals can stave off a basic attack, which many fights are determined by just 1 basic attack.\n\nYou did not lose to a Sona, that's literally a mathematic impossibility.  What you actually lost to were artificial stats created by OP items while your team was already 10k gold behind.  A Nami could've 3v1'd with the exact same setup, cause Nami actually has usable numbers on her own even before adding in artificial ones on top.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MXXXXXL","date":"2017-03-11T19:27:43.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eternal791,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bxzxAtE0,comment-id=001b,timestamp=2017-03-11T17:11:13.593+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:53}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:24}}{{champion:17}} \n> \n> Like anyone with who has high damage, stuns and invulnerabilities is super annoying to me, cause I just think that kind of kit shouldn&#x27;t exist.\n\nWait who has a kit with high damage, stuns, AND invulnerability?\n\n**EDIT:** Wait a minute, must be {{champion:432}} duh, he deals more damage than {{champion:11}} , has more CC than {{champion:127}} , and can make baron and dragon go invulnerable... so op.","replies":[{"poster":"Fourth Shot","date":"2017-03-12T18:56:59.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"45% winrate and he is op ??","replies":[{"poster":"MXXXXXL","date":"2017-03-12T19:52:19.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes wonrate iz 101% thas how op he iz","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-03-11T14:28:28.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:67}}  every time they're on my team, 0/8 39cs after 12mins.\n\nevery time they're on the enemy team they play like gosu.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcus Diabolus","date":"2017-03-14T03:29:16.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top : {{champion:48}} No matter the matchup, I always seem to lose to this guy.

However, after the laning phase ends, my team always seems to get Quadra'ed (or penta'ed if she got that fed) by her mid to late game. I'm then forced to leave base just to kill her and immediately return back because she undoubtedly tore at least 80% of my health off and it gets damn annoying. I don't even need to go though that much effort to kill a well protected ADC. \n\nBot and Support are more or less Peeve free.

That's only 50 more than Caitlyn's base attack range, 25 less than Nami's W and about 300+ less than: Blitz' Q, Thresh' Q, Morg's Q and pretty much almost every support.  Sona has one of the shortest ranges amongst all supports in general, not even just mage supports.  Fuck, her bubbles are only 400 units, they barely even count as \"ranged\" matching only Graves' and Mini-Gnar's ranges for the lowest range in the entire fucking game.  Hell, since the bubbles are spells, even that's not a fair comparison since every support ranged spells' ranges are a minimum of 500+ EXCEPT for Sona.\n\nSona is literally the shortest-range support in League, in complete contradiction to the fact she's also the squishiest character in this game.","replies":[]}]}]}
