There is nothing stronger in it, point blank period. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I have never liked how strong Warmogs has been in ARAM and it&#039;s removal is a step in the right direction. However Riot has forgotten entirely what the whole point in having Warmogs was in the first place, a mid to end game answer to the anti-fun early game that comes with facing an enemy with superior range than you. \n\nThere is just nothing you can do as a melee dominant comp verses a ranged comp, here&#039;s a list:\n\n1.) You cannot abuse the enemies&#039; mistakes like they can with you as a melee vs ranged comp. Actually, they do not even need to abuse your mistakes and they can make tons of them. \n2.) You cannot safely attack minions even under a turret as a melee champion which means you can neither lifesteal or collect gold. This COULD&#039;VE been negated by Warmogs much later in the game when it was already likely that your team was push to atleast their inhibitor, now it is impossible.\n3.) You cannot safely collect the regen relics, which is a double edged sword because they used to only work for one person. Now many people can use it which makes ranged comps even stronger because they can leach off an allied team proc&#039;d relic because of their range but you cannot do the same with theirs because of their impervious zoning capability.\n4.) You must get into their huge zone of dominance to be able to apply cc abilities while they can get in your face under your own turret without fear of being punished.\n\n1 and 2 are enough to be a gamechanger for melee vs ranged comps, but I have only scratched the surface of how gigantic the power difference is when facing a ranged comp as a melee dominant comp. IT doesn&#039;t make matters any better when Ranged champions have viable options to seemingly infinite in League terms for mana sustain, meanwhile melee comps have to make due with being mostly mana-gated.\n\nI&#039;ve lost over 90% of my ARAM matches since Warmogs was removed because I refuse to **ABUSE YES I SAID IT, it is exploiting** a flawed system and have only Ranged and strong ARAM champions for this account I use in ARAM. Whats even worse is I have been very toxic on this matter ingame because it is plain and simple BULLSHIT that I have to get teammates who hold onto {{champion:84}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:35}} \namongst many others when the enemy gets \n{{champion:103}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:236}} {{champion{{champion:25}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:4}} :117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}}{{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:143}} (who I wouldn't doubt has a 75% winrate in ARAM)   \n**EVERY FUCKING GAME** and I am NOT exaggerating, just look at my damn match history. It is so disgusting I can&#039;t even stand looking at league because all I can think of is how Riot effectively let little scummy scrubs run free with their sometimes boosted ARAM accounts with nothing but ridiculously oppressive bullshit run scott free with ZERO counters other than having more of the same shit on your own team. This has absolutely destroyed any amount of \"fun\" I used to have with League.\n\nSomething HAS to happen. Whether Melee champions get 35% more lifesteal off of minions, they get % more armor/magic resist, Ranged champions have doubled mana costs, Turrets take 50% less damage from Ranged.... SOMETHING because ARAM is just horrendous and the whole &quot;adding 30~ champions to the rotation&quot; crap did NOTHING to balance the fact of WARMOGS being gone forever.","replies":[]}
