Imagine having to create a new model and animations for around 500 skins. \n\n2)the origins each have their own color theme.\nSoulstealer vayne simply wont fit in with the pure white of nobles.\n\nNot to mention a girl with unicorn horns in the elitist imperials.\n\n3) despite using the same characters and items, tft is a seperate game to league. Purchases dont span multiple games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-20T02:53:41.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like they chose to use skins like alternate champions instead, so this is off the table without creating a ton of confusion.\n\nTFT champs also already have several chromas, in effect, which would be a gross amount of work to allow using every skin with them at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-09-20T13:10:28.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have currently set it so you can't use skins on purpose. It gives them a method to introduce different origins/classes for the same champion.    \n  \n   E.g. Cutpurse TF is currently set as a Pirate/Sorcerer using Pick a Card . If they used Musketeer TF instead, then you probably would get a Noble/Ranger using his E and will be manaless.      \n\nNext split (around 2 months time), they plan on rotating out the current sets of champions and introducing new sets of champs with different origins/classes with the use of different skinlines. Riot did mention that they would want to use skins from the project universe (project, battle cast, program) and odyssey universe (Oddessy, dark star, cosmic).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grundle47","date":"2019-09-20T02:56:42.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you didn't have to buy the skin again specifically for TFT if you already owned it in the main game then this would probably get me back to being interested in buying league skins again.","replies":[]}]}
