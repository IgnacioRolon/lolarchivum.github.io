Okay if its not clear I'll try to explain this one.. This thing called Autofill, whenever you want to play after a while, that thing is turned on, and basically, it doesn't matter what lane you pick it will always give you support no matter what, and that is just basically a forced thing to do as I see, and so far I haven't one at least one when they force me to go support, I literally have to lose a game to play other one in my lane and win the game ?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T02:51:10.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"[*Autofill*](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/ranked-updates-now-live#patch-autofill) is only enabled when queue times are lengthy and *not healthy*.

I would rather wait for a game that I might actually do well in vs. being forced to play a role I'll likely lose in.  Also, playing  a role I'm unfamiliar with only leaves me open to harassment and trolling.  Riot, how is losing a game for my entire team worth a faster queue time?!  Makes absolutely no sense.  If someone wants a faster game, then THEY can choose autofill on their own, imo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skateboard B","date":"2017-01-02T06:46:28.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=MgVEivMG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-04T02:51:10.329+0000)\n>\n\n> Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nI have questions. Like it's been said, the community at large seems to prefer quality of games (people playing in their best roles) to the speed in which they get into them. I'd rather wait 4 minutes to find a match than get in one in half that time and have a jungler who hasn't a clue what he's doing.

I came all the way back here now because I just got autofilled twice in a row. I picked top/mid and got jg. Okay, that's fine; I'm still not happy with autofill, but at least there's a little variety. Won that game, should've been autofill protected. The next game, I picked the same roles, and got forced into support. My top laner lost, and I was stuck in my least-preferred role for no apparent reason. Not only is the system inconvenient, but it also seems broken. That's LP that I won't get back, and since that was my second game after being promoted, I'm back at 0 LP with a good chance of being dropped again if I lose the next one all because of broken promises and crushed dreams.

I switched from blind pick to draft with the update that let me pick two main roles, and I didn't play when autofill was enabled.  Now though, there's no escape from it.  It feels as if I've been lied to every time it happens, \"You picked two roles you wanted to play, but you're going to play this.\"\n\nIs the only option to deal with autofill \"Suffer every time it happens\" or dodge?  I was happiest with teambuilder, even with hour long queue times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gaming Egan","date":"2017-02-20T17:23:51.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are far too many posts complaining about autofill for me to look for a serious one so I am replying to rioter within an autofill related post to ask/propose a solution.\n\nRather than allowing people to choose only 2 roles to play thus needing autofill, have you considered changing it to choose what roles you don't want to play? \n\nI mean there are a lot of players that would rather support than jungle, but they want top or mid more. I bet there are also a lot of players that would be okay with all but one role, a fair percentage of which may chooses something other than support as the hell no role.\n\nI for instance would pick ADC and sometimes JG as my not playing roles and I've had friends that would put Mid and sometimes Jg or Top and ADC. While there are a lot of people that hate support, there are other roles people just don't like so why not let them say, \"I don't want to play these 1 or 2 roles\" thus letting the game search for 3-5 roles per person rather than 2 or fill?\n\nIf you have already considered this, can you tell me why it was rejected?","replies":[]}]}]}
