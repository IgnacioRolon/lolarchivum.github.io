Since on my latest game of Kog'maw where I went 23/7/26 with 77 cs in 15:26 of time, I got an S rating. But I didn't receive any mastery 7 tokens for Kog'maw, which spawned the question I had above.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-09T18:16:38.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, it looks like this was completed in ARAM.
