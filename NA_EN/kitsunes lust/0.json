And this &quot;nerf&quot; is completely counter-able.  i personally don&#039;t see anything wrong with this. its fine by me. you just gotta play more like a fox. play more clever, play more wise, play more safe, and use your ult only when you need it. 20 seconds isnt&#039; terrible.\r\n\r\n*  when you get lvl 6, you should already have close to a lost chapter by then, which is already 10% CDR, which is 117 second CD R.\r\n*  if you have transcendence, that&#039;s another 10% CDR at 10 minutes\r\n*  if you have ult hunter thats 5% at 0 stacks\r\n\r\nadd it all up 10+10+5=25% CDR at 10 minutes with ultimate hunter at 0 stacks and lost chapter. so 25% of 130(2 minutes 9 seconds) is 32.5 seconds shaved off of your ultimate, bringing its CDR at rank 1 now down to 97.5 (1 minute 37 seconds) CD, lower than the current base cdr.\r\n\r\nand late game comes, and say you have all 5 stacks of ultimate hunter and you have 40% CDR (20% from Ludens Echo 10% from Transcendence and 10% from any other CDR item you wanna build).\r\n\r\n40% CDR + 15% CDR from ult hunter= 55% CDR of 80 second R at rank 3, shaving 44 seconds of your ultimate, bringing it down to a crazy 36 seconds. if my math is right anyways.\r\n\r\nstop whining guys and instead work around it and adapt to it. i ain&#039;t no diamond or plat player. i ain&#039;t no pro, but i know how to adapt, instead of freaking out over a nerf. everyone gets nerfed here and there. you just gotta adapt to our environment....\r\n\r\nthat is all....\r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2018-10-04T16:20:54.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure ultimate Hunter is multiplicative and not additive.\n\nSo you get 15% CDR on the reduced cd, not the bass. I.e. a 100 second cooldown with 40% CDR plus 15% ultimate Hunter gets 60 seconds less 15%, or 51 seconds. NOT 55% CDR on 100 seconds for 45 second cooldown as you're implying. \n\nAlthough I agree with the point that the nerf isn't terrible. It DOES hurt though. It gives all the assassins that do well against Ahri Windows to kill her when their ult is back up and hers is still down (assuming she uses hers to escape their first one). She already had the same cooldown as them, so now hers is 20sec longer. E.g. Ahri can Dodge fizz fish with ult, but he'll have another ready 20sec before she can escape again (meanwhile he can troll pole every charm)..","replies":[{"poster":"Kitsunes Lust","date":"2018-10-04T16:44:53.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ValyrianBlade,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Xa7jk9pM,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-10-04T16:20:54.619+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure ultimate Hunter is multiplicative and not additive.\n> \n> So you get 15% CDR on the reduced cd, not the bass.
