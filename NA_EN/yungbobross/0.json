It can be really hard to tell since the stun is so short but it has messed up some of combos and I have even had it where I would spit an enemy onto ally cc like a jinx snare and the enemy was somehow able to flash away before they were snared even though I spit them on top of the trap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2018-01-31T21:49:07.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crash BandiWHOA,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=Y5AkAkGy,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2018-01-31T11:53:29.376+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d say this isn&#x27;t a problem with exclusively Trist, but everyone [at different times].\n> \n> Tahm Kench has had a numerous amount of bugs for awhile now and I&#x27;ve seen nothing done about it.

It can be really frustrating when your W just decides it does not want to work... :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2018-01-31T05:01:31.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe he doesn't like the taste of magical rats?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-30T21:48:10.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvote for valid post","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darrothan","date":"2018-01-31T18:43:40.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone give this guy a hug","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2018-01-31T13:51:07.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a problem where I couldn't eat enemies","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toxikk Beast","date":"2018-01-31T05:03:51.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the same problem, but instead of tristana, It was jinx.. had no problem eating minions or other allies/ enemies.
