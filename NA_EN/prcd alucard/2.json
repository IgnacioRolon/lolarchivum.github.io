Normally you see me making champion concepts and ideas or flexing creativity somewhere but basically I am here to talk about ranked today.\r\n\r\n* Main point of what I am going to write here is going to go over **Rewarding the Individual Player vs The Team.**\r\n*  No This is not an mission to say** Trolls, Griefers**  and** AFK's** are the sole reason for this.\r\n* Target is mostly **Solo Queue**\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay lets talk about ranked, First and foremost let me get this out of the way. Yes ranked is team work, in fact league of legends is a team game and involves team work. I understand this and have been playing this game since the start of S2. **My goal here is not to steer it away form team work** because that's not what I want, nor what Riot wants I'm sure.\r\n\r\nWe have this neat LP system, showcasing hidden mmr to set where you stand as a player. **This mmr is your bread and butter**, it represents how much LP you earn/lose per match.~~ Strange how you don't see this important tidbit considering it is everything. You can however with the help of 3 party sites such as MMR calculator and such~~, but that's not what I am here to discuss. I want to talk about the concept.\r\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong this idea is solid on paper. players get **10 games** to play and based on those games are ranked between Bronze or Silver. (Higher considering your last seasons progress) Then after they are placed in their rank they have to gain 100 LP to advance to the next bracket of 5 ultimately to do a promotional at bracket 1 to move into the next rank. Simple enough.\r\n\r\nThis is where that hidden mmr comes in handy. This number is always changing based on if you have won or lost a match. Much like the **elo system** the lower the number the \"**Worse**\" players you get matched with and higher the \"**Better**\" player you get matched with. (I put those in parentheses because in theory there is no bad player right? All based on skill level)\r\n\r\nNow this is where I start to **Disagree** with the plan. As sure this is all good and for most for the players that have okay ride the \"**wave**\" clear of bronze ","replies":[{"poster":"PRCD Alucard","date":"2015-03-07T21:21:50.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ignore this guys, Rito did not upload the other 4 paragraphs, too lazy to retype them.
