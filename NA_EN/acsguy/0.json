I found a temporary solution, but it doesn't work all the time, and I'm getting really irritated. I've seen a few others with this same problem with them getting the previous Windows 10 update and being unable to play without crashing. I've gotten a 5 game leaver buster because of so many \"leave\" games in a row, when in reality I've just crashed at the very beginning and can't join in without my team already remaking. I know this isn't a problem that Riot caused, but I'd really appreciate some way to fix this. Thank you for your feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T17:45:15.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the biggest pain points as of recent with Windows 10 has been the Game Bar. The Windows 10 Anniversary update enabled a new feature in the game bar called *Game DVR*, which has been causing PC freezes and forcing some players to restart their PC to bypass. \n\nA lot of the time, this can be resolved by [disabling the game bar entirely](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html). Let me know if this worked for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Acsguy","date":"2016-10-02T23:16:14.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for the solution, it works just fine now.
