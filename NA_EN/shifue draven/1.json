It annoyed me more then anything since the only times i think one other time this happened was for an issue like this and it has to happen in a ranked match when i have actually been climbing and finally got out of bronze just to lose points from a failure on your end.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T21:12:54.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened was the client ran into some corrupted or missing game files, and since it realized you were going to crash because of those files it decided it was best to repair/patch those up before you played. If the game had proceeded without repatching, you would have crashed out of the game regardless most likely. \n\nYour pc's version of the client wasn't working properly and needed to fix itself. It probably would have been way more infuriating to have been in the middle of that match only for it to repatch then instead of before the match started.","replies":[{"poster":"Shifue Draven","date":"2017-09-30T01:39:23.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it's more infuriating that it let me get to champ select on a ranked game and decided to bug the hell out and make me redownload the game that worked fine about 12 hours ago i did not get an update or anything. and the fact i lost lp on this. if the game is messed up when it loads it should not let you play. This needs to be looked into cause losing 20 lp for a fault in your game is bs to me considering the time i put in on this game and the annoying crap i already deal with while playing like broken champs and toxic fools.","replies":[]}]}]}
