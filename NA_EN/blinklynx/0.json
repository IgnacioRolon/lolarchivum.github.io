However the overwhelming majority of the playerbase disagrees. Everyone has their own opinions on why the new HUD is shitty, but all in all i see a good 3/5-4/5 people in each game who agree with me. What are my reasons?\n\n1. Im used to everything being in its original space. Looking around for the same information is annoying. When I want to see my CS and Score I look up, not at the minimap. When I want to see my team's death timers i look to the left side not the minimap. When I want to see enemy armor/ad/mr/ats etc. I click on them and look up into something that isn't microscopic and now clumped even more with irrelevant things like CDR and Attack range. When I want to check my EXP till next level I look bottom left not next to my abilities. \n\nLooking at all those things in a split second vs. looking around for 3 seconds can change your gameplay tremendously. In game things go by fast like in a car. If you spend more time looking for things distracted with all this bulky clumped up non player friendly interface, you're going to miss cs and take harass at the least. \n\n2. It's all bulky and clumped up. I scaled my HUD down to 30-50% and still the death timers on both teams stacking up above the minimap are extremely annoying. \n\n3. There was nothing wrong with the original interface anyways. All information was accessible with a quick Tab or hotkeys and to be honest the new interface doesn't give you much more information. Also, what the hell is the point of being an aware and active player? Being more aware than your opponents should give u an advantage. Why shouldn't pressing Tab that your lazy opponents aren't willing to do not give you the edge? Why does everything have to be right in front of you? You can't use ur head a bit? \n\n4. 90% of the people who say the new interface is okay are infrequent players in comparison to the amount that more dedicated players play. I understand it wouldn't be difficult for someone who only plays 1-2 games a day at most to get used to. \n\n5. What bugs me most is that they \nA. Didn't give us a clear option to revert to the original HUD.\nB. After the more tech savvy players figured out how to change the config in the league files to get the original HUD, they fucking fixed that and now we can't revert at all. That says that they don't want to give us a choice. Wtf kind of attitude is that from a game developer? \n\nI'm glad you like the new HUD but at the very least they should offer to have the original interface available for less versatile players.\nP.S. Idk why it made my points go 1 1 2 3 4 it's whatever.
