My SN is based off an old dragon in the original EverQuest named Talendor. That was the most influential game that got me into both games & music.

Clearly you can see her hair is dyed, also the contacts are bluish grey. Very rare eye color with its genetics tied to Turkish decent.","replies":[{"poster":"Lùmen","date":"2017-08-13T20:36:53.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, fix your attitude. \n\nNobody could care any less for your unpopular opinion and you are not entitled to judge anyone or say how they should look like.","replies":[{"poster":"tribunalisrigged","date":"2017-08-30T20:01:30.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RemarkableIdo,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=4ZksQiUF,comment-id=0008000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-13T20:36:53.581+0000)\n>\n> First of all, fix your attitude. \n> \n> Nobody could care any less for your unpopular opinion and you are not entitled to judge anyone or say how they should look like.\n\nLmfao are you saying stats and facts don't matter? you're insane. I'm an architectural engineer who works in the military industrial complex with some of the most intelligent people on the planet. Facts matter, statistics matter, her urge to be something she's not tells you magnitudes of info, mostly to hide her self worth.

What i said is all factual and scientific. If you don't like facts you most likely have some kind of severe mental issues. Maybe you aren't well enough to be around normal people.

You can complain all you want and keep making stupid ignorant insulting responses, still doesn't make you right.
