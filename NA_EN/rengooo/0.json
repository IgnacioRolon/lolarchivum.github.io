The problem was she didn't GET behind. Or very rarely. Her kit was strong more or less due to her W. Her W blocked the next attack & gave AD. IE +15 on level 1 if i recall.

It just wasn't something that was supposed to happen. Her weaknesses was supposed to be teamfights. She couldn't stick onto one person enough with all the utility. However her old kit made up for that in one ability. She was literally considered a female Yi.\n\nNot really here to complain.

Dealing about 1-3k dmg based off of armor. This is due to each person getting hit & 5 hydra procks. After this everyone while not necessarily dead would be in a worse for wear state.

If I'm playing top lane twitch, vayne i can deal with her especially with twitch right now who imo is the strongest adc in the game but alot of people really suck at playing him.\n\nYasuo for most of my champions i can deal with him fine but its the exploits that riot refuses to fix or inform players about and yasuo mains abuse crap like this like the tower ult exploit, i think one of his animation cancel combos did get nerfed but it was a pain to deal with especially if he was fed and you couldn't shut him down for whatever excuse it is. Yasuo has also been popular for far too long and i think over long popular champions should get nerfed out of the high tier meta which will be healthy for the community so players can learn to play new champions or champions that have made a comeback with recent buffs or item builds or reworks.\n\nI also hate yasuo players's mentality they just get super salty if they lose no matter what team they are on and they dont really care about anyone but themselves this is similar to the old days with Riven but at least riven (from what i know of) doesn't have way too many exploitable moves and doesn't block all ranged moves in the game.\n\nSyndra is super easy to play even i suck at mid lane (and i main support) so many times I will just press R even if im a feeder and I will just get a kill of a squishy (obviously the adc) I guess syndra shouldn't be on my list since alot of supports or at least one team member has a skill that can protect an ally but if their defenses are down you can just point n click n press R and destroy the enemy's adc with no effort.","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2017-05-02T14:18:19.920+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok. So syndra's kit is VERY VERY countable. There's a delay on all her abilities (In theory) \n\nHer q has a delay, her w is two cast and hence has a delay, and her e is based off the first two abilities. Her ult actually does have a short duration before it starts that allows you to zhonyas or something of the sort.\n\nHating yasuo's mentality is a bad mentality in itself. Just because they play yasuo DOES NOT mean they are toxic. I don't care if the majority is, lumping even 1 innocent person makes you just as bad if not worse then the people who you are judging. \n\nFiora's kit is designed for 1v1s. Something you can do if there is an inconvenient location for her passive is to walk out of the passive zone, when you re-enter a new location will be decided. This can be done by both the Fiora and the opposing player. In genearl while fiora can hit the back two or opposite two points, it's dis-advantageous. By doing this you forcing the Fiora to do one of two things.\n\nA) Go for it, hence taking more per trade due to lacking a proper escape. \n\nB) Wait it out, in which case they are losing part of their healing/poking chances\n\nFiora's ult also isn't really something that should be hurting you a lot. If she's using it on the frontline, she shouldn't be able to get it off due to utility. If she's using it on your backline, your frontline isn't doing it's job. I know in reality there are always things around that, and it never plays out the way you want it, but that is the general way to work around it. As for traps, I'm not quite sure who your referring to.\n\nThe \"Trap champions\" who deal any significant amount of damage with those traps are:\n{{champion:74}}\n{{champion:17}} \n{{champion:57}} \n{{champion:96}} \n{{champion:35}} \n\nOf course there are more, but those are the ones that come to mind. With teemo you should not be struggling with Fiora, she's going to get harassed out of the game. \n\nHeimer same thing\n\nMao might be difficult to work with against Fiora, but your more valuable in a teamfight.\n\nKog should do decent\n\n& if your playing Shaco top, god help you.\n\n\n\nMy point is people over-estmate and state the power of certain champions and it get's annoying. And my overall point was, those champions HAVE been touched. Don't act as if they haven't. Don't act as if Lee hasn't. Everyone mocks a 5 ad change, but image taking a scale, and balancing 2 completely diffrent materials. Now, lets add in hundreds of other scales that all have to be balanced. Now on top of that let's put a weight on top of some of those parts (items & masteries) & those weighs have diffrent effects for each one of the scales. And oh, did I mention every time you try to adjust one scale another scale changes?","replies":[{"poster":"LEEROY KLEDKINS","date":"2017-05-02T19:47:36.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem with dealing with her passive is that you have to try and shield it away from her direction or waste time leaving her sight then return and hope the mark isn't on the right side for her to burst you down.\n\nI feel like im playing Mario Party when I'm against or playing as Fiora and its not a good thing to have, yeah this makes me take less damage or no damage at all but this also wastes my time in getting cs and puts her at an advantage.\n\nAll yasuo mains are toxic all of them have never been nice and I just mute them on my team and i ban them from my draft games even if the are first pick, I do not like his fanbase at all, I will not have him on my team regardless of how good he is. Do not defend yasuo mains, they are cancer to the game no real human being likes them. only the cancerous of people like yasuo. End of story.\n\nAs teemo recently fiora has been destroying my recent match ups as teemo. \nNo matter how many times i harass her even if i get 2 kills ahead she will destroy me later because ap items have been nerfed hard and tank builds have become more useful than ever even magic penetration doesn't help.\n\nSo if im playing as a marksman on top i will counter fiora as twitch or vayne, AD is far better than AP in this meta which makes playing teemo so useless.\n\nAlso this could be a country difference but every person on top that is against a teemo in EUW always gets a oracle lens or sweeper or control ward and most players i see try their best to avoid walking out of the minion line. People know where teemo mushrooms are, teemo is another joke champion that is so easy to destroy in lane as anyone and if you lose to teemo in season 7 then... I cannot help you sadly.\n\nAs for Syndra R? Only counterable if the right ability and champion is within the area to prevent her from one shotting.\n\nShaco top is a joke, I don't get why people struggle against him you must be so bad if you can't beat a shaco on top lane.\n\nKogmaw? All he ever does is tickle me ever since he lost his rework he is another joke champion unless he has janna or lulu.\n\nMaokai is a good pick for the team fights but alot of people dont play him","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2017-05-02T23:13:21.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yea.\n\nSee.
