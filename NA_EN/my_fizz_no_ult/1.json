We're trying out a common player request, for lore at PBE. :-)\n\nWe often see a lot of players getting upset about new champs and VGUs on PBE, because there is no lore context around their VO and visuals, and so head-canon and speculation run wild. It's actually surprisingly painful for us to get the bio ready for PBE, without everything else we'd normally put into the champ/faction update, but I'm happy for this to be the new normal if it helps portray the character better/more completely.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2018-07-18T20:50:52.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagined the reason was something similar, I definitely like the chance to better understand the champ when it's revealed, past releases caused quite a lot of confusion and misinformation (that lead to unjustified critics).\nThanks for trying to give us the bio earlier! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-07-18T16:00:35.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats really good to hear.\nI remember the confusion that was happening here on the boards during the release of {{champion:145}},where everyone(me included) thought she was actually inside the void and it caused all kinds of misconceptions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-07-17T20:44:45.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be any moment.
