Fair. Svasa. Anar.” Riven continued the mantra, memorizing the words. “Erzai, son. Dyeda…”\n\n> “That's fa-ir,” a voice called out from the shadows of the forest.\n\n\nI am very confused, what is the correct pronunciation of this word, \"Father\"\n\nAnd, is it a common tongue or just a local dialect? \n\nBut I guess it is a common tongue right?\n\nBecause it mentions Riven learned the Ionian Common Tongue, and this word appears another time in Yi's new story.\n\n(_**Yi lives in Wuju, an small island, below the big north island, so I guess it should be the way of common tongue's pronunciation**_)\n\n\n\nBut the thing is,  \n\nShould I pronounce them the way we spell English:   ** /feɘ/ for \"fair\"**  and **/fæ: ɪɜ/ for fa-ir** ??\n\n\nOr should I pronounce them as some latin languages (Italian and Spanish)  : **/fa iɾ/ for \"fair\" ** and  **/fa: iɾ/  for  fa-ir **??\n\nHope rioters can resolve this big question if you can offer an IPA for these Ionian Words it would be grand !!{{sticker:sg-ezreal}} \n\nYou know this \"fair\" has been translated in so many ways in different versions:\n\nIn English and other latin alphabet-use languages, it is \"fair\" still,\n\nbut in Japanese version, it is \" fa i ru\"\n\nIn Mainland Chinese version, it is \"yi bei\" and \"yin bei\" for \"fa-ir\" (the corrected pronunciation by Yasuo), which is the most confusing one!!\n\n\nBut, in Taiwan Chinese version, it is the same as \"possible\" English pronunciation:  \"feiye\" for Fair, and \"fa ye\" for \"fa-ir\"\n\nIn Korean version, it's 파이르 (pa i reu) (since in Korean there is no **\"f\"** sound)\n\n\n\nSo, which one should be the closest one to understand the pronunciation of this word, **fa-ir**?","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-06-25T15:10:58.723+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"The better question is how can I say 'Daddy' in Ionia","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-06-25T17:40:45.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"fa-ir-sama","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trist mid opop","date":"2019-06-25T17:44:40.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Academy Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BZdX7bNA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-25T15:10:58.723+0000)\n>\n> The better question is how can I say 'Daddy' in Ionia\n\nSay it as following: D A D D Y.
