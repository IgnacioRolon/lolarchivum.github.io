Any money spent in the game is for something purely cosmetic, or enables your lack of patience.  Any money that you spend allows riot to pay their employees, and continue making this game better.  Riot is generous for allowing us to play this game, for free.","replies":[{"poster":"YELLOWSUPERCARRY","date":"2018-01-06T07:08:07.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever tried farming the points needed for just 1 Champion that is above 6k? I can say I already play a lot for my circumstances, and I still can't farm up enough IP or blue essence in a reasonable amount of time to buy a champ I want, so I just cash up and buy it immeadiatly. You can't just say it's \"free 2 play\", yes it is \"free\" to join and play with the free weekly rotation of champs they offer, the rest of the champions are still locked. And not everyone want's to play every day at least 10 games to just be able to play any champ he wants. Not everyone has the spare time. League of legends is not just a game for the hardcore playerbase, there are a lot casual players that enjoy this game. And they won't be able to get the desired champs fast enough. Maybe now with the gamble boxes and the level up boxes you may be able to be lucky on a champion you wanted.\n\nThis is not meant to insult anyone, i'm just stating my opinion how the system looks from my perspective.\n\nthanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}
