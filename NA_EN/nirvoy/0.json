League of legends will now restart. Please try restarting the client\" been getting this error for the last hour. I went out after playing league in the afternoon and left my pc on. When I came back later at night I tried to log in and every time I log in I get this error. Already tried to repair the client, disable firewall and changing DNS. So I need some professional help to get this fixed. I run windows 10 and use BitDefender and ISP is TimeWarner Cable. Any help is appreciated, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T16:50:44.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your network is having a problem connecting to our servers, so repairing game files won't necessarily get this fixed.
