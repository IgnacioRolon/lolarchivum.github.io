Because it's evidence of underhandedness.  Or underfootedness, if you like.\n2. There's actually another currency clue in there to find.  Good luck!\n3. Maybe you want to ask S.D. that.\n4. Because they need the grain.\n5. I swear by it, certainly.\n6. 'Ionian Silver' _pomace_, actually.  Honey fruit seeds are so last year.\n7. Increasingly.\n8. Trade agreements are generally on a per family basis.  But some places turn away everyone.\n9. Strange sounding phrase, isn't it.  Very _uncommon_, and unlikely to turn up in normal conversation.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-12-02T16:27:13.304+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just realized, with number 9, that phrase is a password isn't it? to make secret trades with demacians?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jon1174","date":"2016-12-02T05:04:27.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"GOLD HEXES! thats what they use in Piltover, I fount it,also can i get a pdf of this map so i can make it a wallpaper","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-12-02T05:07:52.179+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jon1174,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=l5U0E8Gx,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2016-12-02T05:04:27.730+0000)\n>\n> GOLD HEXES! thats what they use in Piltover, I fount it,also can i get a pdf of this map so i can make it a wallpaper\n\nThat's one of their denominations!  The Progress Day story has another :)\n\nI think a few players have pieced together a jpeg of the whole map somewhere, though I'm not sure where.  It'd be faster using that than waiting for us to maybe get a pdf out there (esp. because we'd want to get one for every language too).","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-02T05:08:36.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this what you were reffering to?
