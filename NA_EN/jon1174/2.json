I really do care about this stuff (maybe too much, all things considered).\n\nBack to the point, Miss Fortune's first name was first released in her original bio.\n\nQuoting from the wiki:\n\n>For those who brave the harsh seas of Runeterra, attaining one's own ship and crew is the pinnacle of success.\n>\n>_**Sarah Fortune**_, a well-respected (some would say legendary) bounty hunter from Bilgewater, was able to achieve this feat just after her sixteenth birthday, etching out her name as the go-to gal for resolving special troubles. \n\nWhile it's true that Riot hasn't released full names for every champion, they have released quite a few either through the old bios, League Judgements or other avenues.  For example:\n\nShauna Vayne\nJericho Swain\nGaren and Luxanna Crownguard\nKatarina and Cassiopeia Du Couteau (if that's still canon)\nPrince Jarvan Lightshield the Fourth, Exemplar of Demacia\nSona BuVelle\nEmilia LeBlanc\nMalcolm Graves\nFiora Laurent\nAnnie Hastur\n\nHell, the only name that has been revealed in the past year's worth of story events was Tobias Fate.\n\n(Of course, this is all under the assumption that this stuff is still canon.

(I quoted and linked it.)\n\nI'm just curious if the name Yorick Mori is official canon from Riot, confirmed after months of debate within the company despite no reference to the name in the VO or the official bio, or if it's a similar situation to the \"Graves now vapes\" thing Cactopus joked about over on Reddit about a month ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-09-12T22:05:21.094+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Yorick Mori is officially canon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-09-11T14:40:12.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TerraRising,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=s6RmNQTY,comment-id=0004000100000003,timestamp=2016-09-11T14:26:47.597+0000)\n>\n> Fair enough.
