I really do love hearing from you guys, especially when you've been around to see the back and forth that is {{champion:266}} !\n\nOnto the matter at hand. Allow me a moment to alleviate some of your stress, and we know you guys have a lot waiting for this change. Many of our Summoners are highly concerned with the new client being \"forced\" upon them, but rest assured that this will be for the better in the long run. It's become incredibly hard for our developers to continue supporting two completely different clients since everything essentially has to be done twice. This not only makes bringing new content take longer, but opens up the possibility of things going wrong since people are hard pressed to get things working on two platforms. \n\nBy no means do we ever think that the main issue relies on your own internet speed. It can come across the wrong way, but when we try to troubleshoot connection issues it's not to say that we think your internet is \"bad\". The internet can be a fickle mistress. You can be blazing across web pages and youtube videos at the speed of light, but sometimes a network can have a hard time getting to certain servers. It doesn't mean your internet sucks, or that our servers are having issues, it just means some weird shit is happening. Most of the time when we suggest that dreaded \"connection guide\" or \"FPS guide\" it's not meant to be an end all be all solution, but it definitely helps us figure out what is _**really**_ going on. It might take a little bit of back and forth troubleshooting sometimes, but rest assured that if I can't get things straightened our here that our tech guys will do everything in their power to get you back on the Rift. \n\nFinally, neither client by itself is really in a perfect state as is. We're constantly evolving and trying to find better ways to get things running. For instance, we've added a low-spec mode on the new client which could actually be of great use to you when the time comes! It's designed to help players on lower end machines by reducing the load your pc has to carry while in a match. I've personally seen a good increase in FPS alone across different machines with this option alone. \n\nAll in all, rest assured that we're here working for you guys, all of you guys. I absolutely would not be here at all if I didn't feel the need to be helpful! If something's not working, take advantage of your resources here at Help & Player Support. Put us to work and we'd love nothing more than to hear that you're back on the Rift, thanks to our hard work!","replies":[{"poster":"EmperorPengu","date":"2017-04-21T12:29:39.108+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey broporo I keep seeing this poro in the top of my screen on the new client.
