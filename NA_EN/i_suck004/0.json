So a permanent chat ban would stop most people from making a new account and keep on flaming since you still have your account you still have your rank you still have your skins, and instead of a 14 day account ban you get a 14 day chat ban.\r\n\r\nYou could argue as the support i spoke with (Yadon) did saying that you already have options to turn the chat of. BUT you can turn the chat on again as fast as you turned it of, ofc it stops some people from being toxic but it doesn't stop all the players from being toxic since you can turn it of that easy.\r\nAnd let's say you really don't want to implement this new chat ban system, at least make it so you can't turn your chat of or on once you're in game since that would also stop people from being toxic if you already have the chat turned of. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading this // I SUCK\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-11-16T22:48:53.635+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it is not the case for old forum threads.

The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \t\n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nThis was just with infinite chat restrictions, so imagine how much worse itâ€™d be with actual perma-mutes.

Obviously, chat ban is just for chat offenses. If and when a player escalates to gameplay offenses, then they would receive the gameplay ban.\n\nChat ban for chat offenses.\n\nGameplay ban for gameplay offenses.\n\nEasy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-29T18:48:17.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's punishment system used to hand out stacking chat restrictions, such that consistently toxic players basically had a permanent chat restriction. Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"rYogo roFup1 fya","date":"2019-11-16T13:44:48.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"good job want banana","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-08-29T23:55:58.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because perma chat bans caused players to express themselves in even more damaging ways, like trolling and griefing.","replies":[{"poster":"rYogo roFup1 fya","date":"2019-11-16T13:42:09.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol so  whats problem then ?? perma chat ban them and if they cant type they troll or grief  so what? permaban them for grief troll . like there isnt people like that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2019-08-29T17:59:04.765+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They tried this, when people couldnt flame they just trolled.","replies":[{"poster":"rYogo roFup1 fya","date":"2019-11-16T13:42:37.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"tried? so ban them for troll then easy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-08-29T17:58:49.118+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"In the past Riot tried long-term chat bans, and it resulted in an unacceptably large increase in non-chat toxicity from those players who had chat bans.
