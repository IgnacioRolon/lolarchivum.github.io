Second thing is how riot will punish someone who do not like their role during the champion pool picking and took others lane on purpose? for  example when i am top, there are always some player chat:&quot; i go top&quot; and then just pick a top champion when his lane is not top lane. same for other lane. how did riot punish for player like this? because this is 100% belongs to ruin others game experience. if i took ur lane without ur permission would u be happy?? next time i will do these too if riot not gonna do something about these two behavior, because I can&#039;t even report them for that when the game is over. so riot tell me why should i be a good player and play the game so painful when other bad player doing these stuff and u don&#039;t give a damn?","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-09-15T06:36:25.701+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't report for that since it's not \"your\" CS.
