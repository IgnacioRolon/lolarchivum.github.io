But ive tried to change it to another color and it won't work. So if someone could help that be great. And does this feature only work if the game is in colorblind mode?

In the past, players were able to change the color of their Health Bar incredibly easy by editing a few installation files in League of Legends.  However, since we updated how the Health Bars appear in League of Legends, it is no longer easily possible to edit the color of the Health Bar.\n\nIf you are in colorblind mode, your Health Bar will appear Yellow, and if you do not enable ColorBlind Mode, then your Health Bar will appear Green, and your teammates in Blue.  Currently, this is the only color scheme offered for Health Bars.  \n\nI hope this helps alleviate some confusion!  If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to let me know!","replies":[]}]}
