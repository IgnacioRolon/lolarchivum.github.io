Essentially 2 things might be going wrong. Either that usb device to simply taking some processing power away from your pc causing these issues, which might not be easily fixed if your pc simply can't handle it.\n\nOn the flip side, one small note a lot of us tend to forget. Your pc does have sound drivers as well. Do me a favor and check for any *sound* card AND *graphics* card driver updates. Test that in a custom game after updating and hit me back up with the results!","replies":[{"poster":"Yato05","date":"2017-09-21T03:14:36.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
