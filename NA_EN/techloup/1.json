I recently finally hit 4800, but he is back up to 6300?! I'm not sure why he is, so if anyone knows why I would like to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T23:00:52.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that's pretty strange. We haven't lowered Zac's IP price quite yet, so I'm not sure why you could have seen a 4800 price on him. If you happen to have a screenshot of that, feel free to shoot it my way so I can figure out what happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Techloup","date":"2017-07-29T23:51:13.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry that I do not have a screenshot. I honestly may have just gotten it mixed up somehow. I made this post to see if anyone else had seen him at 4800, but so far it appears that my eyes messed up a bit. Thank you for your concern though! I hope to be able to play league smoothly one day, my current laptop has frame issues even on very low (and after lots of optimization attempts). It is an old laptop though, I'm sure I'll enter the rift without these issues a few years from now, it's just hard to want to play competitively with such an inconsistent frame rate. Thank you so much for the concern though, and I apologize for my rude behavior in the above post. I love league and hope to be able to really play it well some day! Thanks again for letting me know his price wasn't dropped Broporo!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-30T01:44:42.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries bud! I'm here to help so feel free to question and rage as much as you need ^_^!\n\nI wanted to comment on those frame issues as well. Even if you know your laptop is old, we should still be able to help out a bit. Let's double check for any possible missed driver updates, but you can also try turning on **close client during game** in the client options to see if that helps at all. Hit me back up and let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Techloup","date":"2017-07-30T13:23:06.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have close client during game on, but I may have missed some driver updates. Although I'm not sure how to update them. I've also followed the riot support site's recommendations to follow to lower frame rate. Those helped a tad but my game still stutters in heavy team fights. Would my frame issue have anything to do with my CPU being 2.3 GHz? Also, if you could possibly let me know how to properly update my drivers that would be amazing, but I understand you have other players' matters to attend to.

If you can figure out your graphics card, type that into google with drivers, for example Nvidia Gefore Drivers.
