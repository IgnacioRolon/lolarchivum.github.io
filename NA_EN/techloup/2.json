I was unbanned for using hate speech (kys) in an AR URF game around September 1st. I used to wonder why I wasn't going up, but recent searching has shown me that I haven't gone up because I haven't become a nicer person from the experience. I really DO want to bring a more positive vibe to my games, but I don't remember what I say in chat during times of stress. So my question is if some kind Rioter can check my chat logs and display negative attitude that I have been giving off. I really want to earn my way back into the honor ranks, but I need to know where to start. Thank you to anyone who reads this and wants to help. GLHF!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T04:30:33.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that can definitely be a little frustrating sometimes not knowing exactly what might be holding you back. I went ahead and looked over some of those logs, and it does look like there have been more instances of homophobic slurs and such, which just aren't okay regardless of any context.

I'll submit a ticket and delve deeper into what exactly I was saying and where I'm going wrong. Peace to you and GLFH!
