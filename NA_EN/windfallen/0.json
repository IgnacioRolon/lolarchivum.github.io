In fact he's one of the easier/more forgiving assassins to learn. \n\nZed has a high skill floor, indeed. The amount of plays you can pull off with his shadows are nigh endless. Though the skillfloor is also very very low as assassins go.\n\nNo matter the matchup, he can still farm the lane really really well unlike akali. Second tapping R is a get out of jail free card when you botch your attempt... Talon doesn't have this luxury when the enemy survives his burst. Not to mention he's not limited by mana and he has a %magic damage execute on his passive ability. This passive during the lategame is strictly better on adcs and squishy mages than Garens ultimate ability. Isn't that sad?\n\nAlso, your splitpush is amazing as Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"ccseancc143","date":"2015-03-29T04:01:54.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main Talon and I play Zed all the time. He is alot harder to reliably execute assassinations on the enemy carries by a long margin. Garen literally is resource less. There is a reason Garen is 450 IP because riot wants beginners who have 0 mechanics to learn with him since he is easy. If You have Zed to  a beginner he would do 10x worse with Zed no doubt in my mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Windfallen","date":"2015-03-29T10:23:58.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I shouldn't have said you were wrong, because you aren't. At all. Zed is very mechanical and has a lot going on with his kit that takes some understanding.\n\nI own Zed and Talon and I personally found Talon a lot harder to play. I still kinda stink with him, because I die after bursting my target in a team fight most of the time. Zed? I just stopped playing him after I was sure I fully understood his kit and the way shadows work with shurikens, so i can play against him better. In the meantime it was so very easy and sort of frightening the way a full combo can 100-0 most mid laners.\n\nGaren really is built for beginners. He's pretty forgiving. Still. Don't /laugh at him.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JFRANKSTA","date":"2015-03-28T21:13:18.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you kidding me? i main top and garen is one of my faves but real talk if you die to garen as zed you're bad","replies":[]}]}
