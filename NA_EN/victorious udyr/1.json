People get branded for the rest of their lives for that. Krepo almost lost his job and his future because this guy started lying about him, I think a perma ban is appropriate, even Gross Gore said that it's deserved and that he fucked up so at least this guy regrets it, but nonetheless he deserved a severe punishment, also you should consider that Krepo is employed by Riot as a caster and analyst so they have to look out for their own.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SloPro11","date":"2016-05-02T17:31:44.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he just passed information he already heard, he wasn't the one accusing him, besides he probably wouldn't mention it ever again even if not warned, yes he did fuck up and it was a big mistake but I still doubt he deserves perma ban which basically ruins his career.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KOC rule","date":"2016-05-01T07:55:16.886+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't like watching some nerd Meteos playing the game like he was deaf and not interacting with viewers and being toxic\n\nMeteos interacts a fair amount with the chat/donations lol.
