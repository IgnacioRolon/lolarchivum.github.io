If I got him low he just popped shield and it was like I was fighting him all over again. I get that he&#039;s supposed to be tanky but if I am sated, have botrk, lord domonick&#039;s and spirit visage I should win the exchange correct? He won every time. I get him low he swallows me and spits me out then he pops shield and it&#039;s like I never attacked him in the 1st place. Perhaps I didn&#039;t build right please take a look at my match history and see if I built wrong because I don&#039;t understand how I could have lost I even had red smite. Except for one item that is more tank oriented than damage he didn&#039;t build any damage items.

A lot of her power is in her ability to close distance reliably to get onto the target of her choice. That's not very useful against Tahm direct, given you're not going to be bursting down a tank, assuming similar XP/gold, and he's absolutely fine with people putting themselves in his face.","replies":[{"poster":"OlafRagnarson","date":"2016-01-09T22:30:03.201+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tahm is tough for like, every one.

While I disagree that Tahm should be a hard match up for vi I appreciate you answering my question all the same. I mean if that's the case as you said then he should be classified as a bruiser rather than a tank. If you nerf him I don't think it's his damage capabilities that should catch a nerf but the shield because imo that is what makes him unbearable at present. It feels like I have to fight him twice because of it god forbid he builds a guardian angel.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MxWhiteKnight","date":"2016-01-10T20:14:54.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair\n\nA) He DOES have high HP items which afford him to lose hp W you for some regen time and then pop E.\n\nB) YOU HAVE NO HP ITEMS . . . .

The damage is basically unhealable.\n\nYou CAN'T call nerfs on a champ when your build isn't even correct to deal with that type kit. Volibear would've done the same thing to you too.

I had blade of the ruined king which does 6% of the targets current's health , a lord domonicks that gives me 15% bonus physical damage against champions with more health than me and 40% Bonus armor pen (which is what you are supposed to build against tanks), I was sated (Which really doesn't need an explanation I killed a fed swain with this same build) and I was vi which means every 3rd hit i took away 20% of his armor ( so that's more or less 60% armor pen I won't even take runes into account) and gained attack speed (putting aside the as I got from being sated and botrk) the nerf I'm calling is to his shield it's not his entire kit which when he pops it is like fighting him all over again. I don't mind that his stacks don't reset once he uses an ability what I do mind is that I had the tools to take him out and because of his sheild you more or less have to fight him twice because while he swallows you he's able to heal up negates more or less the damage you initially dealt to him. He does Ap damage so I built mr, he built health and armor and I had both my passive and the tools to take that away from him as well as being sated that's not ok.

Oh sure, Vi with a ton of attack speed and BoTRK is nice and all, but in my experience she works a lot better with a tankier build.\n\nThe second thing that I think went wrong was that a very tanky Tahm Kench is almost guaranteed to make you regret fighting him. Crawling out of bronze into silver while playing support, something I found that counter-intuitively worked was singling out Tahm Kench damage-wise but using cc on the enemy marksman. Tahm is forced to use his devour defensively, he takes a ton of damage (likely pops his shield to stay safe) and the trade is generally won.\n\nI don't think that there are too many great match-ups against Tahm 1v1, maybe Malzahar and Velkoz could take him down easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaoBushido","date":"2016-01-09T08:33:37.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, next patch is next week and patch cycles are 2 weeks so nothing for at least 2 weeks\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#balance","replies":[]}]}
