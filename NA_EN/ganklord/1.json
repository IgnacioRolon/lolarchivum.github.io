Shes already super cancerous as a support. If she were to ever get plant AI improved her W would have to actually cost her mana and IMO probably some HP considering her plants can tank skillshots and tower shots. They only die to multi-hit aoe because of the stupid forced 2 hit hp which goes to 4 if she ults.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArmiPagan","date":"2019-06-18T23:30:22.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What we need is a NEW ZYRA SKIN like yesterday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PopCorn Chick3n","date":"2019-05-29T16:09:52.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi GankLord, \n\nI suggested some Zyra mini-rework and wanted to put the RNG power from her passive to her kit in a more skill expression way. \n\nThese are my suggestions:\n\nPassive: Remove RNG seeds. Plants are now enraged for 2 second when enemy champion(s) are hard cc.\n\nQ: Increase range from 800 -> 850 units, slow enemies by 25% that got hit. Cooldown changes from 7/6.5/6/5.5/5 -> 7s at all rank. If Deadly Spines hits a Seed, it sprouts into a Thorn Spitter, which remains on the battlefield for 8 seconds.\n\n\nThis would help Zyra to be able to compete against other mages in mid lane and a little bit safer to poke. The slow makes sense since they are spikes and explode from the ground and help Zyra to follow up with her root.\n\n\nW: Zyra periodically stores a Seed, up to 2. Unit kills grant 20% charge toward a Seed, increased to 100% for large units killed and enemy champion takedowns.\n\n- Vine slashers are now required 2 auto attacks instead of 1 to be killed. Melee can still one shot range plants. This would make melee plants a bit tankier to deal some damage before they accidentally got auto by melee champs and die. Maximum of summoning plants change from 8 to 4.\n\n\nE: Increase projectile speed from 1150 -> 1200, and root enemies by 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5s instead of 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2s. If Grasping Roots hits a Seed, it sprouts into a Vine Lasher, which remains on the battlefield for 8 seconds.\n\n\nR: (Suggestion 1) Zyra summons a huge plant dealing magic damage to all enemies in the area as its thicket expands (old passive model). After 2 seconds, the vines pull inward, pulling all enemies caught in the thicket to the center of her big plant(similar to orianna ult but pulling enemies to the center instead of pulling enemies to the opposite side).\n\nPretty much a wombo combo ult.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/zyramains/comments/bsl7mx/suggestions_for_zyras_mini_rework/","replies":[]},{"poster":"PadoÂµch","date":"2019-05-29T06:38:05.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanna play my main Mid again.
