It also forces every Yuumi into a boring playstyle that EVERYONE (Players who like her and hate her) ABSOLUTELY DETEST. NOBODY wants to just.... Sit there and be 1/2 a champion till level 6 and even then, you only become 3/4s a champion.\r\n\r\nHer W needs to be brought in line with ALL the rest of the CC in this game:\r\nA CC causes a lockout from W for 1-1.75s for a total duration of 2-3.75s\r\n\r\nThis will give yuumis in the early game a CHANCE to survive some engagements.\r\n\r\nNow, lets talk Q and her base stat growths as well as her passive mechanics.\r\n\r\nYuumis Q was nerfed 40 damage at all ranks. During 10.1, she got 10 damage back at all ranks leaving it a total nerf of -30 all ranks but she has a 1s 60% useless slow.\r\n-Yuumis Q is a laughable, joke of a skill. DO THE RIGHT THING AND REWORK THIS GARBAGE. I get it, its a unique interesting skill- that nobody likes or cares about except the people at Riot game.\r\nIf this ability cannot deal damage, it needs to have CC (the reasonable slow 80% for 1s is fine) or, she needs a new Q.\r\n\r\nYuumis passive popnblock is useless past level 3-4 as her stats are pathetic and even ADC in the 10.1 meta can DESTROY her.\r\nLet alone REAL meta picks like Yasuo, Swain, Volibear, Heimerdinger.\r\nCounting CC in teamfights as you do with assassin types is also useless on yuumi as its not the CC that kills her nor even 'burst damage' she can just get killed with 4 autos. LMAO.\r\nREMEMBER! W now has a 0.5s channel time unless you are jumping from ally to ally so you have to CC yourself for .5s PLUS travel time to perform your passive which is 100% unreasonable to do level 9ish and up, even in a teamfight with all skills blown.\r\nThe changes to the support items legit makes her passive opressive 3-4 and nearly useless after till 9 when it just flat IS useless.\r\n\r\nCmon riot. Just move on. This was a good idea but its a failure of implementation.\r\n\r\nPS: Nerfing how long her Q can travel is not enough to make that skill allowed to have its damage back.\r\nIf you want to give it damage, NERF THE PROJECTILE TURNING SPEED.\r\nThat is the only way to fix that ability to make it as intended.\r\n\r\n-Yuumi lover","replies":[{"poster":"Ratrose","date":"2020-01-19T01:20:00.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe MYCA ( make yuumi a champion again)\n\nKinda sucks they removed her form game becasue of afking farming  \"pro\" games. \nThey should just rework  or delete her totally since they cant sort her out as she is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2020-01-19T00:21:25.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> IMAGINE being CCd on ANY champion for 6-7 seconds!\n\nIf \"CC\" means \"a champion can't jump away, becoming untargetable\", then I guess {{champion:1}}  is CCed for 10 years already.\n\n> This will give yuumis in the early game a CHANCE to survive some engagements.\n\nShe already can survive them, by actually staying out of range and/or dodging shit, like everyone else is supposed to do\n\n> 1s 60% useless slow\n\nA spammable hard-to-miss longrange 60% 1s slow is useless, ok.\n\n> Yuumis passive popnblock is useless past level 3-4 as her stats are pathetic and even ADC in the 10.1 meta can DESTROY her\n\nIf you blindly walk in for the auto, then sure.

TRY running damage on her. TRY IT and get trolled. \nThe range was nerfed 25% on the 'max damage' end as well.\nThe slow is 20%.\nYou dont even know what you are talking about.\nLMAO.\n\nThe difference between yuumi and Annie is that annie has move speed. Yuumi has the worst run speed in the game next to perhaps kog and anivia. Also, annie has more armor, HP and MR than Yuumi. Not to mention a stun. They are not even close to comperable.\nAnnie can get hit and 1v1. Yuumi cannot. Period.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-19T01:38:14.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you want to bring her W in line with other champions, it shouldn't have the power to make her untargetable for several minutes at a time, not to mention granting her the benefits of a teammate's movement speed and mobility spells.

When she attaches to an ally, she goes wherever they go, at any movement speed, through dashing, etc. She doesn't even need Flash. This is in addition to being able to dash to an ally in the first place.
