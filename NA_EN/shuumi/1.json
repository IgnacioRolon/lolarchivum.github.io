Nobody cares that they have to switch around who they play, we care when we're literally forced to play other champions because the odds are against us for not conforming. With tanks, you can go from Maokai and Ornn to Doctor Mundo and Ornn (because Ornn is busted, let's be honest). But bot lane, you can go from Caitlyn and Tristana to Draven and Lucian, then still get smashed out of lane by Mordekaiser or Irelia. If an ADC can't make it through lane, they're useless. Tanks will always be viable, even if they get smashed in lane. Damage soaking CC bots will always be able to at least do something, while an ADC that gets smashed in lane is a detriment to the team.

Correct. And the exact same thing for adcs. Even when weak, adcs will always be playable. Just because bruisers are suddenly allowed in botlane, hasn't changed the fact adcs aren't playable anymore. Only difference is that tanks are less dependant on gold, since they have a ton of value through their kit, rather than items and auto-attacking. This has nothing to do with them being viable or not in the meta, it is simply how hard they can get snowballed. You're completely unable to see my point, because you somehow think that adcs are unplayable, which they aren't at all.\n\nLet's compare tank playrates to adc playrates, shall we? (Data from op.gg)\nWe start with Lucian being in the number one spot, with 29.12%, Ezreal in number three with 22.70% and Kai'sa number four with 20.67. Let us scroll down and see the current popular tanks playrate.\n\nSo the first real solo-lane tank that isn't Singed is sitting at number 54, 7% pickrate, Malphite. The second most is Shen at 5%.\n\nDon't you think its funny how \"Even when weak, tanks will always be playable\", yet when tanks are weak they are barely played. Meanwhile, \"Even when weak, adcs will always be playable\" isn't valid, yet when adcs are weak they are still dominating pick and winrates bot. Almost like the argument is completely invalid.

Top lane has WAY more variety than bot lane has ever had, even now. Of course the play rates are going to be lower when there's more consistently viable options in the lane, meaning you have more options to counter pick. You're not getting the difference between ADCs and tanks, despite how many times I've said it. \"Tanks will always be playable\" or \"ADC isn't playable\" has NOTHING to do with whether or not you can lock in as that kind of champion. It has to do with their game impact. Tanks will always have a spot, no matter how bad they are. They're big, beefy, have CC, and get to work as soon as they're out of lane. They will ALWAYS be playable, even if they get set behind. This means that no matter how far behind they fall, they can still do their jobs and tank up damage and CC enemies. ADCs are BARELY playable right now. There are some exceptions, yes. Lucian, Kai'Sa, Ezreal, and Draven are all doing well. However, with every other ADC, picking them into a bad matchup disallows for then to do their job. They cannot properly DPS without items, and they can't get items if they're shut down in lane. You're ignoring the fundamental differences between ADCs and tanks, and just harping on that no matter how much I say that your comparison is stupid.  As for the buffs, literally only 4 ADCs got buffs. Just as with that, a few got needed, as champs like Kog'Maw, Varus, and Kai'Sa all build Guinsoo's Rageblade in their core build, making them weaker all around. Tanks haven't been buffed because they don't need to be buffed. They're not weak because of nerfs, they're weak because of bruisers and Conqueror. If bruisers that use Conqueror became more situational, tanks would be right back in consistent play. Just like if ADCs got some sustain back and towers weren't made of paper, they'd be right back in consistent play. It's getting very frustrating to argue you because you clearly don't understand what changes make other champions strong or weak, viable or unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Davaken","date":"2018-06-28T07:31:58.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will have stop this argument because your huge bias towards ADCS makes you impossible to reason with.

You talk like someone who has never played a real tank top or jungle before. Okay, let's say I pick a tank like Rammus in the jungle in Diamond 5 elo. Because some random dude on boards told me they were always viable, so they must be right? Let's say I get matched against Xin Zhao. First of all, I need to be prepared to get invaded at my second buff. I am completely dependent on my teammates, on whether or not I will be able to get it. I will also have to give up every single scuttle in the game. It will be harder for me to gank due to having worse ganks and because I die if Xin counterganks me. I also have to constantly ward both Drake and Herald, since he can solo it, and if he does I won't be able to stop him alone. \n\nOkay, so I give the entire early game up, because I'm playing a tank, because some dude on Boards told me they were totally viable.

There is a reason tanks are bad right now, and your argument is based on your personal opinion, not what the actual game state is.\n\nThe more I argue with you, the more apparent it becomes that you don't seem to have any actual clue on what the current game-state is. You use shallow arguments like \"Tanks will always be viable due to them being tanky and having cc\", when that game CLEARLY isn't reflected in the current reality of the meta at all. I usually dislike rank shaming, but I think this lack of basic game knowledge comes from the fact that you're bronze, which means you're either new to the game or doesn't take it seriously at all. I have been playing tanks on a high level for years, and I can tell when they aren't viable in the damn meta no matter what shallow claims you make without actually backing them up with data or reasoning.\n\nI'm done with this argument.

In your example, Rammus has his Q knock back and his taunt. You can keep an assassin or the enemy Xin Zhao locked up for a couple of seconds while your carries kill him. Of course you're going to get invaded by him. Of course you can't duel him. Your entire argument is \"oh no tanks can't do a job they're not meant to do\" in that example.

I pray I never end up in a game with you, because based on how you think about tanks, you're never going to CC anything and I'm going to just be a feast for assassins.  Enjoy your future ranked games, high and mighty D5. Hope you don't demote to plat anytime soon.

This led to players becoming bored with the little thought output needed to progress. This can be summed up by players being upset from the game they knew changing.\n\nWoW's been fixing its issues since Legion and oh look... the population is growing and coming back.\n\nLeague, on the other hand, has been pushing for shorter button-mashing gameplay. Why plan a duel out when it will only last 1.2 seconds? Until League goes back to what players actually found fun, players will continue to leave.

It also makes for a dumber game that makes players that are slower at combing better because they can do a larger chunk faster. \n\n> Like even Ghostcrawler himself said, the game is constantly changing to keep it fresh.

They&#x27;re so focused on posting more and more new content to keep it fresh that they&#x27;re straying so far away from balance. \n\nI was trying to ask that about assassins one shotting. Where do you draw the line and say hey, assassins shouldn't be able to 100-0 that champion. How do you decide that an assassin should be able to get in, get a kill, and get out while divers are basically one way assassins, and tanks are basically immobile divers with slightly more cc. The game is just too messed up now where all the classes are too overlapped, and streamlined. You really can't fuck up and over build defense, or over build damage and make yourself useless. The only way you can fuck up is ap on an ad champ (or visa versa). Basically we are playing a dumbed down Lol. \n\n> Alas, despite my complaints, I continue to play out of addiction.

I have a very large friends list of players that haven't logged on since season 4. Some of them haven't logged on since season 2 when they nerfed healers and tanks. Back then they were already saying that the game is going to go to crap if riot just pushes damage. I wish there was just an unaddicted stick that I could get hit with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leverette","date":"2018-06-25T11:40:41.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are _reasons_ games succeed; it is not just random, therefore it is not a matter of mere opinion as to why any particular game is successful.  No one understands that better than the players themselves.  I will not tolerate irresponsible excuses like \"people will leave\" that deny accountability.\n\nSure you can't keep or please everyone, but don't hide behind that excuse.  A game that listens to its players will not simply die from a decade of age.  A declining playerbase only ever means that you're wrong and should fix yourself.  Neither success nor failure is ever guaranteed.  You're never so ahead that you're allowed to get complacent and devalue your players, and you're never so behind that perseverance, integrity and respect for your players won't uplift you.  Warframe is a beautiful example of the latter.\n\nAlso, World of Warcraft has actually been _growing_ for two years straight.  That's because Blizzard has officially announced they are putting a higher emphasis on player feedback and returning things to how they were when they were more successful.  They learned their lesson about placing themselves above their community.  Now, over the years, Riot has become a bit more cynical toward player complaints/disagreement, and more defensive in their decision making.\n\nI support Riot and want to see them continue succeeding.
