So when installing LoL it gets through the first part of the download perfectly. But when it hit like 43%-44% it closes without warning messages or anything. So i recently took a look at the logs and saw a bunch of errors. Some that relate to \"httpconnection\", \"getunexpectedrunningproccesstring\", something about \"anonymous-namespace'::CalculateWorkStep: C:/jenkins/workspace\" and a bunch of files that dont say error in fron tof them but they say warn. So if someone would respond I'd be glad to share the neccessary files to fix or at least try to fix any of my issues. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T22:47:26.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"At 43%, the patcher is attempting to download and update files but might be preventing by a poor network connection.  Go through the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, and that should hopefully clear a path for you.  As long as you don't receive any errors, let it continue processing until it's complete.  Remain patient and let it do its thing!","replies":[]}]}
