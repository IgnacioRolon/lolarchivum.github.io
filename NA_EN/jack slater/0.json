Even when i just go into a custom game on my own it seems like every other click my champion takes way to long to move and quit often jolts forward so i don't see the animation at all. So far I've just tried fiddling around with the setting but when i'm getting above 200 fps and 30 ping i don't see how that can be the problem. \r\n\r\nAny help from someone smarter than me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-02T22:38:26.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be experiencing delays in-game caused by *Packet Loss* or tons of buffering! These sorts of issues are terribly annoying and are usually a result of specific network settings that conflict with League and cause issues between your PC and the servers.

Since you're still seeing issues in-game, I'd recommend we run some traceroute logs to find the source of the issue. I recommend grabbing a free networking app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to complete this. After loading up the app, plug **185.40.65.1** into the host field before starting the trace. After it's run for 5 minutes or longer, export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
