We really wanted the bond between Tristana and Riggle to feel as real as possible and I think we did it based on the community's reaction to her. :P\n> \n\nLike I said before, I really did get that. Even though they have their issues with each other (Riggle is CLEARLY not happy to be made to dance, and Tristana seems to get frustrated with him sometimes), it's stuff like the laugh animation, some of the quotes, and even the horribly depressing death animation shows there's still a close bond, and they'd have each others backs.\n\nI think some of my favorite quotes from this skin are from buying items. \"Uhhh... don't lick this\" for Bloodthirster, \"Nope, no, don't chew that-!\" (Riggle chews that)\" for Statikk Shiv, even a quote for Sunfire Cape that Tristana's would probably never buy.\n\n> If you have any more questions let me know, and I can most likely answer them!\n\nYou did the Riggle ward too right? I'm honestly trying to decide whether to get the Riggle ward, or if I should stick with the Fist Bump ward I already have and have gotten attached to.\n\nAlso, a few lines that the wiki list as \"Unknown Champion Responses\", are those referring to the Dragonslayer skins? If so, nice touch!\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, one more thing; is Riggle's name a reference to the old Wriggle's Lantern item, or was it just a cute name because it sounds close to 'Wiggle'?\n\nEDIT2: The video promo calls it \"Dragon Trainer's Video Guide, Volume One\" Is this a hint towards other Dragon Trainer skins in the future (Don't worry, it'll just be between us and the whole internet)\n\nSpeaking personally, which part of the skin did you work on, or what was your favorite part of it's development?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-12-04T23:10:59.549+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Interesting; was it intended to be a Legendary level skin back before she got her VU, or did the update give you the ability to use new tools to make it a Legendary?\n\nYeah even back then she was going to be a Legendary, but once we started concepting we quickly realized that he old model was going to restrict us greatly. Not just from an animation standpoint but from a modeling standpoint as well, she was so tiny and compact that her proportions compared to Riggle's just didn't feel great.\n\n>You did the Riggle ward too right? I'm honestly trying to decide whether to get the Riggle ward, or if I should stick with the Fist Bump ward I already have and have gotten attached to.\n\nI did! I'm super appreciative to the animation team who allowed me to animate the ward. Since I'm currently being mentored by an animator at Riot I was super excited to get to work on an asset for League! I'm super biased in my opinion (for obvious reasons) but I would say pick up the Riggle ward since it's so friggen cute and it's one of our only wards that's actually a living creature! :3\n\n>Also, a few lines that the wiki list as \"Unknown Champion Responses\", are those referring to the Dragonslayer skins? If so, nice touch!\n\nWe did have plans for those lines to be triggered when you were near a champion with a Dragon Slayer skin, but due to some technical issues we weren't able to hook them up. :<\n\n>EDIT: Oh yeah, one more thing; is Riggle's name a reference to the old Wriggle's Lantern item, or was it just a cute name because it sounds close to 'Wiggle'?\n\nIt's more of a reference to the fact that he can never sit still! He's always wriggling around in Tristana's hands!\n\n>EDIT2: The video promo calls it \"Dragon Trainer's Video Guide, Volume One\" Is this a hint towards other Dragon Trainer skins in the future (Don't worry, it'll just be between us and the whole internet)\n\nI think it's safe to say that, like with most skin lines, we won't stop with a single Dragon Trainer. When more skins come out and who they are for are up for community speculation at this point.\n\n\n>Speaking personally, which part of the skin did you work on, or what was your favorite part of it's development?\n\nI was primarily responsible for the QA portion of the skin. I made sure we found and fixed all the bugs and that the skin itself was up the the quality bar that skins team has set for Legendary skins! \n\nThe best part of the development of this skin was seeing Riggle come to life, we kinda already knew how Trist would act but Riggle was a whole new character!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-04T02:56:59.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Siachi! \n\nI actually wasn't a part of this skin's development, so I don't have a lot of context here.

I LOVE this one.  ALso, even though I'm a Tristana main, I never liked the \"march\" dance, so I LOVE her little \"puppet Riggle\" dance.  All the little touches are great (riding Riggle while ghosting is great).  Awesome job to all the team.  One last thing, maybe its just because I love the skin so much, but I swear it even PLAYS a little bit smoother than even the default skin.  I'm not sure if the animation is quicker, or just smoother, but it is all around just an amazing job.","replies":[{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2015-12-04T21:56:58.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with you there; the marching didn't really do it for me (Just kind of bland considering some of the other dances champs get, but she's a soldier so I can understand that).
