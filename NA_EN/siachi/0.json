I did take a bit of a break from Gnar after hitting mastery 7 (Long story short, being frustrated by an inability to get an S kind of kills my enjoyment of the game), is this why it changed in the first place?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T18:40:42.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, the background is set to most recently played and not mastery.  It's a solid idea, though, and makes sense to me!  Be sure to share your feedback on the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards.
