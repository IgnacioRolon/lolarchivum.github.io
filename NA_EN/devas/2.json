A few weeks ago i tried transferring my account from EUNE to EU West but instead of getting transferred my account got stuck with the message \"Your account is in the process of transferring. Please try again in a few minutes.\" I've tried contacting Riot support but I've received no answer. Then i tried writing here in the forums and i was advised to contact support directly through the email which i did yet i still haven't received an answer from them and it's been 4 days already. I'm not one to judge a companies speed at replying but still it has been way to long. Could anyone help me out on this? The accounts name is xNeonas. Cheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T01:05:56.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like this transfer must have finally gone through successfully. It looks like it's sitting safely on EUW right now. If you still can't get logged in by now then hit up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asap!","replies":[{"poster":"Devas","date":"2017-09-08T11:06:08.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried logging in it's still in EUNE and it's still giving me the message that the account is transferring.
