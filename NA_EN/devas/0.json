A few weeks ago i tried transferring my account from EUNE to EU West but instead of getting transferred my account got stuck with the message \"Your account is in the process of transferring. Please try again in a few minutes.\" I've tried contacting Riot support but I've received no answer. Then i tried writing here in the forums and i was advised to contact support directly through the email which i did yet i still haven't received an answer from them and it's been 4 days already. I'm not one to judge a companies speed at replying but still it has been way to long. Could anyone help me out on this? The accounts name is xNeonas. Cheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-07T17:59:33.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Putting in a ticket was a solid plan so we can help you directly.
