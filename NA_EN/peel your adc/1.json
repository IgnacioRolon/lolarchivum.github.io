You know you have the map pressure and can melt a tower the moment you get a wave to it. The enemy team knows that as well. However, your own team doesn't know how to abuse that information. They won't force a lane towards their side to keep them split. They won't put down any wards outside of a 1000 unit radius around whatever they're around. They'll put wards in bushes directly next to them.\n\nWhen 4 people decide to leave after you have made progress, you don't really know where they'll come from since a 3 ward limit gives you only so many choke points such as from behind, a point on the river and the nearest lane entrance. It could be the entire team coming from one path you didn't ward and you won't know until its too late. Is your death worth it? No. Because your team is to petrified to even push up a wave. Sure the enemy team blows 3 ultimates on you, but you can bet your ass they will still find a way to win versus the 4 incompetents that matchmaking placed you with.\n\nGrouping gets you killed.
