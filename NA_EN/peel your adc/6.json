It&#039;s cool that Darius and Teemo punish you from level 2, but they can&#039;t itemize pure damage or else that&#039;s just a free gank waiting. Now on the other hand, people like Vlad, Gnar and Olaf have the harassing suppression to keep him down and can literally live in top lane until the rest of their team eventually shows up.\r\n\r\n2) Time is not on your side. If you aren&#039;t knocking down his ALLIES&#039; (not his) tower by the time he gets an item or two, its a downward spiral. Your jungler not showing up the few moments he wasn&#039;t under his tower? Regret. Backing over pushing? Stack city. Stack stack city.\r\n\r\n3) His team is his biggest weakness. If his team cannot understand that sitting under a safe objective while Nasus pushes a lane, abuse it. Ride that 1/5 Jinx to the bank and farm her for money. Transition their lack of waveclear and numbers into a tower. And then another. And then an inhibitor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for how to play AS nasus.\r\n\r\n1) Acquire a way to stay alive in lane until you run out of mana for the first time. DO. NOT. RUSH. SHEEN. With certain mastery set-ups, you can aim for Glacial Shroud + Kindlegem to get you to either 30% or 40% within 8 minutes and focus on stacking the entire game rather than surviving until Frozen heart at 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n2) Losing some cs to not get chunked for health is always better than dying. If I&#039;m going back, I will toss down spirit fire and get a few extra gold then back and teleport into safety.\r\n\r\n3) Ask for a gank. Believe it or not, Wither is crippling. And even more crippling when a Xin Zhao jumps on you while you do that gerbil-powered-computer-loading-screen run to your tower. Burned flash? Doesn&#039;t matter. You&#039;re not getting anywhere. Then they come again and give nasus free gold. Works better if lane bullies (COUGHCOUGHTEEMODARIUSRUMBLECOUGHCOUGH) can&#039;t run away (Fk u riven).\r\n\r\n4) Spam the crap out of pings and tell your team to back off of any fighting until you actually reach a tower. Then they can be fodder for all you care. Use them as bait for +6s. If they make this game a challenge, get your money&#039;s worth out of them.\r\n\r\nWith these tools, everyone shall find the cane much easier to play around.","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-04-15T14:18:27.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did pretty good agaisnt {{champion:75}} as {{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Peel Your ADC","date":"2015-04-16T01:23:35.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did pretty good against  a rammus once as Tryndamere.\n\nGreat idea all the time?

Your damage in lane will force him to get magic resistance instead of armor, which means your ADC can dice him up later on.  Mordekaiser can also punish Nasus  even if he is playing passively, since Mordekaiser can poke Nasus while hard pushing the lane and building up his shield to maximum.  At maximum shield, Morde can afford to trade a shot with Nasus' turret in order to poke Nasus while he tries to farm the pushed wave, and then Morde can put his shield on the cannon minion to DOT damage Nasus as he tries to CS.  This will force Nasus to lose CS and back out frequently while his turrets are whittled down by the minion waves.  If Nasus refuses to back out while low health, you can burst him down with Q + E + R and then use his ghost to tear down his turrets (or kill his jungler if he tries to stop you).\n\nNasus will need to have his jungler camp top for him if he is to stand any chance, which means your jungler will be free to take objectives in the meantime.  Mordekaiser also scales pretty well when it comes to teamfighting later on thanks to his powerful AOE damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Peel Your ADC","date":"2015-04-19T05:43:33.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scale well\n\nPowerful aoe\n\nMorde liking jungler attention like he's Fizz or something\n\nAre we in season 2 where mordekaiser is useful or something?

Stronger lane phase, scales just as well, completely destroys Nasus in teamfights with his ult. \n\n:D\n\nWouldn't recommend Riven as above guy did.  She naturally shoves wave, which Nasus likes, and she loses all her kill pressure once Nasus gets his first armor item.  Nasus has an easy time sustaining through Riven's harass and he has a far stronger midgame as a result.  Riven also loses lategame for... obvious reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-16T03:56:31.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not true, depends on the Riven.
