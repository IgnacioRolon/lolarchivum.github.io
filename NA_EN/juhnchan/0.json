I couldn't pick a champ and lock-in. I could switch masteries and summoner spells but that doesn't matter when the game is going to kick you out for not picking a champ. I saw my teammates leave the chatroom when I got stuck on this screen for an indefinite amount of time. It just stayed there. I took two screenshots two minutes apart to show you I'm not making this up.  \r\n\r\nI'd like my 3 LP back though if possible. Thanks for looking into the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T03:27:12.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't modify or refund LP for any reason, as the system doesn't let us do this to prevent any sort of abuse. \n\nThis issue you experienced ordinarily happens if your connection to our servers was pretty poor and you weren't able to keep a good link to the PvP.net services.
