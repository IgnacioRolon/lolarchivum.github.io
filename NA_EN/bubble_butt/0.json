A couple of minutes into the game, my ball suddenly disappears. I had not died yet, but it took me a little to realize it was on me but invisible, resulting in my late follow up in a team fight, and losing it. Also later in the game, I had gotten an extra range indicator that was pointing left and wouldn&#039;t go away. It stayed yellow and left no matter how far I moved. It made me believe I had left my ball in the direction.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-14T16:42:48.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for the report!
