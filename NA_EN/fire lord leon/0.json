When i am playing a game sometimes my action will not be accepted my champion will not do anyhting i tell it to, or it will keep going on with the last command i gave it (keep walking to enemy to attack it or walking to some place i clicked) and other times it will just stand there looking stupid. during this time is happening i dont get any lag, i still see everything that i happening and people can ping me or what ever. i have had this happen for the past year or more. it happens in games while i am on voice with my friends and i have to just, \"i cant do anything protect me for a sec\" after a while i will regain control of my champion and he will listen again but its really annoying since i can sit there issuing move commands and everything but nothing happens, and even on some rare cases where i do get lag right after that happens it will use commands, and abliltiyies that i tried doing while he was frozen all at once. i am not sure what is doing it. this even happened while i was also using \"haste\" and at other places that have internet.  i am not sure if there something wrong with my computer causing it or the networks. but i play on other computers in my house and i don't get that not accepting commands issue. i thought it might be something wrong with my computer setting or something so i also factory reset my computer a few times to hope that fixed it but nothing changed.\n\nif anyone has ever had this problems or knows why it might be happening please let me know, i love league but this bug as made me not enjoy the game as much, and i become a bit of a burden to my allies when i just keep walking forward into a group of enemy","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T01:57:16.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is most likely an issue coming from packet loss, which happens after your connection leaves your network. Let's check for this really quick using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Grab the network logs from that game and let that scanner analyze them and take a screenshot and post it here so I can take a look!","replies":[]}]}
