Every year I wait until September to eat my pomegranates. I love the juicyness, the time I sit and watch youtube while peeling it, and everything else associated with it. The pomegranate is my love and my life. I am typing this while eating pomegranate seeds. So I made an appreciation thread. \nHave a poem named _&quot;The Pomegranate&quot;_\nEavan Boland, 1944\nThe only legend I have ever loved is\nthe story of a daughter lost in hell.\nAnd found and rescued there.\nLove and blackmail are the gist of it.\nCeres and Persephone the names.\nAnd the best thing about the legend is\nI can enter it anywhere.  And have.\nAs a child in exile in\na city of fogs and strange consonants,\nI read it first and at first I was\nan exiled child in the crackling dusk of\nthe underworld, the stars blighted.  Later\nI walked out in a summer twilight\nsearching for my daughter at bed-time.\nWhen she came running I was ready\nto make any bargain to keep her.\nI carried her back past whitebeams\nand wasps and honey-scented buddleias.\nBut I was Ceres then and I knew\nwinter was in store for every leaf\non every tree on that road.\nWas inescapable for each one we passed.\nAnd for me.\n                    It is winter\nand the stars are hidden.\nI climb the stairs and stand where I can see\nmy child asleep beside her teen magazines,\nher can of Coke, her plate of uncut fruit.\nThe pomegranate!  How did I forget it?\nShe could have come home and been safe\nand ended the story and all\nour heart-broken searching but she reached\nout a hand and plucked a pomegranate.\nShe put out her hand and pulled down\nthe French sound for apple and \nthe noise of stone and the proof\nthat even in the place of death,\nat the heart of legend, in the midst\nof rocks full of unshed tears\nready to be diamonds by the time\nthe story was told, a child can be\nhungry.  I could warn her.  There is still a chance.\nThe rain is cold.  The road is flint-coloured.\nThe suburb has cars and cable television.\nThe veiled stars are above ground.\nIt is another world.  But what else\ncan a mother give her daughter but such\nbeautiful rifts in time?\nIf I defer the grief I will diminish the gift.\nThe legend will be hers as well as mine.  \nShe will enter it.  As I have.\nShe will wake up.  She will hold\nthe papery flushed skin in her hand.\nAnd to her lips.  I will say nothing.\n\nI actually haven&#039;t read the poem, idk if it&#039;s horrible or not. \nHere&#039;s a picture for the road. \nhttps://www.drfuhrman.com/images/Misc/Pomegranate_Image.png\n\nTl;dr: I love pomegranates.","replies":[]}
