I was just in a game when several people were calling me %%%% and making personal attacks about my weight based on a game. I was shocked to find out that I had been banned as a result. It seems as though riot does not investigate games but instead looks at the number of reports, as 2 of the people I reported for VERBAL abuse were in a party of 3. Is this the community that Riot games wants? I did not want to believe the things I have read about the toxic environment of riot as a company and yet here I am seeing that they have no respect for women or the demeaning insults that are thrown around in that game. I challenge any riot employee to review the game chat and show me why I deserved a ban when I was the subject of the abuse. I urge anyone who has been subject to this to add me and share your story. This company survives off of the players, is this the kind of environment we want from the company that we fund an support on a daily basis?! Lets see how long this post stays up, anyone can add me on FB, Vek Fi and I will be sure to spread the word any ways I can.
