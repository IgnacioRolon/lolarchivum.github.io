I don't know what changed but every since then my patcher has been stuck at 33% / telling me update failed. Last night it made it to 99% so i left it on overnight with no success. It never made it past, i received a \"update failed\" message. I have looked all over the boards/forums and found 101 ways to fix it, but none have worked. I don't know what to do at this point so i figured I would start my own discussion. Please suggest ideas, I will try and reply if it worked or not as the suggestions come in. I have already tried to repair my patcher with no success that also got stuck at 33%\n\nPlease \"up-vote\" it so I can find a way as soon as possible and possibly help others who share the same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T21:22:06.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting the \"Update Failed\" message at both 99% and at 33% all seem to point some sort of connection between with our Patcher Servers.
