Immediately i notice a weird kind of lag, i figure \"meh it will prob fix itself at the game goes on some file probably didn't load all the way\" BOY WAS I WRONG. That whole game my MS/PING stayed the exact same at ~50 BUT my FPS was bouncing from 60 (my normal) down to 6 and back. I wasn't opening and closing anything, i wasn't watching youtubes in the background. So i thought maybe that was just 1 game. So i started a custom game messing around on zed, it was fine for say 3mins? afterwards it went right back to the bouncing of FPS. I would just like to find out if anyone else has experienced this recently, what cause it for them, and how they fixed it.
