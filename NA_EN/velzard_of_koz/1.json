After restarting client and going to game, I no longer have the shard or my essence but I don' have Ahri unlocked.\r\n\r\nCould this be fixed? I don't like seeing all the grind I've done be wasted for this client.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T21:14:33.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pulled up your account and wow.....Hextech really tried to screw you over there didn't it. \n\nJokes aside, I've literally never seen this happen before. It seems like in your hextech history, Ahri was added and then *for some strange reason* Hextech removed her. I went ahead and added her back for you, but if this ever happens again please hit us up in a ticket so that we can monitor it for possible bugs!

If I recall well this might be first champ I redeemed in new client after it became mandatory (though I used it before) so once I get enough Essence I'll see how other shards will react (maybe it's just Ahri being so charming even hextech got con_fused_).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T22:31:16.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my GOD that joke was good xD! Honestly, what happened on the backend in your hextech crafting looked rather odd and definitely should not have worked the way it did, so we're thinking this was probably a once in a blue moon weird glitch. Like I said though, definitely hit us up if this happens again!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
