Can't say for sure if this is a setting or issue with the mouse itself.  What happens if you try a different mouse entirely?  Resetting your config could help as well, it's worth a try!\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-12-22T20:46:42.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I will try to test what you proposed, but will not likely be able to report it within day as it happens so weirdly randomly might take few days before I am sure it's not happening again.","replies":[]}]}]}
