It completely ignored the Moutain Dragon that defined the rift. It even states four were slain but skips the third.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HXmD4DO.png\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's a nice smiley picture but that Infernal had no business burning in the lands of rock.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2019-11-22T18:34:51.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for reporting this!
