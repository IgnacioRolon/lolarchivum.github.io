I apologize if my initial thoughts in the following post were jumbled, please look below to my response for more logically laid out statements. &lt;3  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst and foremost, I like Ashe. A lot. Well not a lot, anymore, after all the thematic/back story changes she became less and less appealing to me, but damn I still love a good Ashe game.  Since I've started playing in S2, I have played what has got to be over 6000 games with just Ashe (over 2 accounts, not in ranked SORRY).  She is still what I consider my best champion and play her when I know I won't get kicked/dodged on for picking her.\n\nI like the changes, a lot! But i have a few concerns.  First and foremost, her passive. The auto attacks always slow? And what's more, it applies extra damage based on how much she's raised her crit chance?  Doesn't this just sound like Draven all over again?  I get mechanically it is different, but it is going to cause the same issues as Draven's old passive until it is nerfed into the ground or changed...wont it?\n\nSecondly, her Q. It's cool.  It is shiny. It shoots lots of things. But I do feel like the skill needs some polishing.  What is it for in regards to her kit? What about this whole stacking thing? The stacking mini game for extra effect seems kind of frivolous, and I can already see it getting nerfed into uselessness until we repeat with another rework on her Q.\n\nI like the changes on E, however I liked the ability to sit back and farm until I ended up a few items ahead for being able to play safe and avoid aggression.  I guess what we're saying here is that we're taking away from her own power and giving it to her team (which should come back around to her anyway).\n\nThe R is unchanged. Still cool. I still like to pretend I'm Jinx. Pew.\n\nLastly, and slightly unrelated, can we please -still- change back Ashe's voice to the recording prior to the most recent? I get the changes you were trying to make to her thematically, but I can't keep doing this annoying, immature, teenage girl thing.  She is a Queen, not a brat.  If not, someone explain to me how to replace the file on my own ]:\n\n{{champion:22}} Byrnes\n\n\nPS: this is just my two cents/initial feedback.  I don't usually do this kind of post, or any kind of post, but I felt like I needed to say something about my favorite champion, even if it was short and unimportant. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-04-29T00:05:46.797+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Byrnes,\n\nIt sounds like you care about Ashe quite a bit. If you have specific questions, I'd love to answer them, but it was hard to decipher from your post what your exact concerns were, and what was more theoretical. If you could list out the specific concerns, I'd love to answer them. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Byrnes","date":"2015-04-29T05:05:40.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding! I certainly wasn't expecting a red on my little post! \n\nSo my initial thoughts summed up now that I've had a day to think about:\n\n* Every auto has a slow due to her passive? No matter what? I can't presently think of specific reasons why that could be bad, but it seems odd that the skill would always just be toggled on.\n\n* I'm scared of Draven syndrome with her new passive. What I mean by this, is that the passive (increasing damage with crit chance) sounds a lot like the old Draven passive, though mechanically different.  The reason Draven's was removed was because it just felt like the passive wasn't actively doing anything once the numbers were balanced - if this is the case with Ashe's new passive, it just means we'll be doing another rework soon after her release.\n\n* I like the idea behind Q. To me though it is odd to have a stacking system that then grants a special AA.  Maybe it isnt so much the mechanic seems weird so much as we just dont have one like this in the game yet, but it just doesnt feel right this side of the rework.  I could be wrong though! Is there currently a visual for the strength of the stack for enemies to see?  What if you had to hit the same target X times in a row, make it like a Vayne E (and so you could show ice rings around the enemy).\n\n* I am presently a huge fan of the W.  I am going to have to wait and see how it feels once i can play with her. I'm a bit frightened we are taking laning power and shfiting it to team fight power, but I'm assuming the constant freeze auto will balance out her laning.\n\n* I agree with the other two who have commented about her E. Also, a lot of things that used to be global have been killed off one by one. Like my concerns with her passive, will going in this direction line her up for another rework some time from now?\n\n* I still can't stand the new teenage-y voice over she has. This of course is irrelevant, but being that she is my favorite and all time most played champ I feel like I need to reiterate.  The voice over itself is perfect, I love the voice actor to pieces, but I just cant picture Ashe as a free spirited princess brat over he previously grounded Queen-y ways.\n\nThank you again for responding! And I am sorry my first post wasn't so clear :D","replies":[{"poster":"SlowChemical","date":"2015-04-29T08:46:49.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In response to your Q statement, I feel it does fit her. Ashe was extremely dated, and I honestly thought her kit worked better mid than it did as an ADC. I feel her lack of mobility makes her feel better when she's bursty. Her new Q helps her burst down targets before they even get to her if they make a mistake, in addition to her ult. I think it fits her theme really well personally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shinizaru","date":"2015-04-29T01:02:50.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to agree with the comment below mine. As an Ashe player myself, right now, my path is pretty easy to know. If I'm going to be in a lane I can't win, level e once and farm it up. If I'm poking, w first. If I'm wrecking someone's face with a Blitz or something, all about the q. Believe me, I love Ashe. Her play is just so stale right now, so I LOVE THAT YOU GUYS ARE GIVING HER THIS REWORK. SO MUCH.\n\nBut the e does present some issues, as FatedTitan brought up. Make it a tough choice, do I scale up my q and get more damage? Or do I go with my e and get some better vision control? As it stands now, I'd level it once and forget about it until the last thing to work up. Letting it scale will at least create some arguments in my mind if I should go for vision or damage, y'know?\n\nI also want to discuss the W. THIS. THING. Please tell me, since you're adding a new damage ability, (WHICH I'VE BEEN BEGGING SILENTLY FOR FOREVER FOR ASHE. Poor girl.) that she's going to be getting a mana cost reduction on the w? As it is, it takes so much that poking a few times and I feel like I can to never use mana again. Adding another damage ability would just kill her mana. Can we either up her base mana a bit or lower the mana cost on that? It's a legitimate concern if I'm trying to run a poke lane, y'know?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2015-04-29T00:25:38.611+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the overall direction of the rework, but my concern is that E.  A global vision ability like that, especially early, is extremely powerful.  I think it'd be better suited if you let the range scale up with rank, with the last ranking making it a global.  That way it's not too powerful early, but allows great utility into the late game.  I'm not saying to make it trash early, like Noc's ult range at 6, but keep it at it's current spot and let it move out every rank until it's global.","replies":[{"poster":"Byrnes","date":"2015-04-29T05:56:31.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I replied above saying that I completely agreed with this statement, and I do!  I also pointed out that most global abilities have been removed one by one from the game, I believe Morello went on a rant a while back saying we were moving away from that direction.  If this continues to be the case, which I don't have any real estate in anyway, would this mean we are setting up an E ability that will eventually be changed out again anyway?  This echoes my concerns with her passive being Draven-esk.  I don't dislike the setup, but if the previous examples went poorly perhaps we could tweak these in a way that we won't repeat those situations.\n\n{{champion:22}} My aim is steady!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LaMaLiCkEr2","date":"2015-04-29T08:28:34.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"finish the word you ueer","replies":[]},{"poster":"TEHLAWLFlRM","date":"2015-04-29T05:19:40.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ashe went so long with a stupid passive that basically rewarded her for not attacking... I think it's due time her passive actually rewards her for staying in Combat which ADCs should do in fights.  Ashe is not op and never will be, her Ult is her only get out of jail free card along with her kite which really doesn't matter against an Akali who can just rengage.   \n\nI think people need to play her and test it out before they start complaining about her rework, she wasn't the best pick for ADC among others and hopefully with this change we will see more ashe and less tristana and other top pick ADCs/","replies":[{"poster":"Byrnes","date":"2015-04-29T05:49:16.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologize that my thoughts have upset you.  What you want from Ashe is not the role of Ashe, though.  You may want Blitzcrank to heal you, because he is a support, but he cannot because that is not what he was designed to do.  Ashe isn't meant to be a hyper carry adc, she is meant to be a utility champion.  Even on the rework page they go to great lengths to make sure we understand that.  You are completely right that she needs a buff in that area though, hell she needs a buff in both areas - she could use some more utility and the ability to be relevant as an adc.  I've played her for years and thousands and thousands of games.  She is my highest win rate, third highest damage dealt (to champions) average, and my favorite pick for adc if my team is able to have her. But like most niche picks she is needed when she is needed.  She is arguably one of the best adcs, she just wasn't built to handle the last 2 seasons.  Even before the rework post came people were already talking about how she is arguably one of the best adcs to handle the current shifts in meta.\n\nHer ulti is not a get of jail free card. Clearly you've been playing with Ashes who can't position or gauge and engagement.  Im sorry there are bad ashes and that most people who play her are inexperienced.  Let's be clear - Ashe is, and has always been, the easiest adc to play.  But she is also one of the hardest to master (especially considering her lack of role in the past seasons metas).  A good Ashe can be the most frustrating experience for any player to face. Anyway, back to the ulti: if someone is using it that way they aren't doing it right.  A well coordinated ultimate can easily sway every team fight and ultimately lead to a victory.  If you can land a good ulti with a comp built around a utility carry, whatever you hit gets deleted. Easy.\n\nI completely agree about the testing her out before complaining.  I do hope my post didn't come across as a complaint so much as a concern.  Though mechanically different, her passive has the same feel as Draven's old one.  They ultimately had to remove that passive because in order to balance it they had to make the numbers incredibly low and weak until they just figured it would be better to remove it entirely.  If the purpose of this rework is to finally bring Ashe up to date, then giving her a passive like Draven's old one is already heading in a questionable direction.  Now don't get me wrong, I took no issue with lowering the effectiveness of Draven's ultimate - it still felt good even if it did basically nothing - but clearly the consensus was that it had to be removed, so if Ashe's feels the same it too will be removed.  As for the Q, the interaction just seems odd.  I also worry about clarity, will an enemy adc have to remained clicked on to Ashe for the duration of laning to make sure they are following her Q stacks?  Or will it have an eventual visual like Vayne's? \n\nAnd, lastly, I personally like Ashe where she is.  And I'll admit it right now I'm 100% selfish in doing so.  I like that I'm a rare breed. I like I can get laughed at for picking my Ashe and then carry harder than they can.  It feels good to specialize at something someone else doesn't.  And if the purpose of this rework is to bring her up to speed, we both know if she becomes good there is a set of nerfs coming her way to put her right back to where we started - just with a different kit.  You can't have strong utility picks, they are too hard to balance.\n\nAnyway, I hope my response was satisfactory to your's.  I've let a lot of changes go by without saying much one way or the other. But Ashe was my first champion, my only champion in fact for almost 5k games straight, and still my favorite to pick when the situation calls for it. Hell, I have an adc only account where the majority of my games have been Ashe support and I'm ranked platinum on it (I don't suggest doing this unless you really, really, like Ashe). But this, this is important to me.  The future of my favorite character is important to me. \n\n<3 Byrnes","replies":[{"poster":"TEHLAWLFlRM","date":"2015-04-29T06:41:04.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ya didn't bother reading past the first sentence when you assumed I was upset so i'm just going to assume like you did that the rest of your walls of text have nothing of interest to me or make much sense.\n\n<3 Tehlawlfirm","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Byakuya Kuchiki","date":"2015-04-29T00:10:38.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"what changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Byrnes","date":"2015-04-29T05:57:23.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure why you're being downvoted, but here is the sauce!\n\nhttp://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/champion-update-ashe-takes-aim-pbe","replies":[]}]}]}
