Ive seen a few of your posts recently begging us (the community) to approach asking you guys things like this in a calm and rational matter, so I shall do as such.  I admit right here, right now, I am disappointed by the new Karma skin.  And that makes me sad.  But while my questions indirectly refer to the skin, I'm not really here to talk about it specifically.\r\n\r\nBasically - what or who is Karma?  And what or who is she to you?  According to her bio she basically went the sacrifice route, both spiritually and physically, and ended up not only surviving the ordeal but saving the day.  She gave up her teachings and ways and became this sort of battle priestess of doom (copyright?).  Due to her magical Ionian powers of doom she doesnt need to be iron clad, and so her (new) base model is epic and well representative of her and who she is described to be.  However, we don't see this in her skins.  In fact, based on the selection, she's sort of become a bit of a joke champion.  I love the first two skins (amazing on the reworks of those), but I don't love them or how they portray her - I love the way they look aesthetically. This third skin (technically fourth due to the original?) is a third skin that has nothing to do with her or her theme.  I suppose it can be reasoned this was her pre-war, but even then that feels off.  But, again, Im not here to look at the new skin Im here to ask: will Karma ever get a skin that portrays her accurately?  A battle priestess of doom.  Or will she forever get joke skins (joke being funny skins, not joke as in \"this is so bad it is a joke\")?\r\n\r\ntl;dr: To me she is basically Irelia but instead of having power fall into her lap, she made the choices to become the powerful woman she is.  I want to see this portrayed in more than just her base skin.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, love you all...this is intended as honest questions because she is my favorite champion...certainly most played at this point, even though Im TERRIBLE at this game.  <3","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2014-09-11T20:16:20.310+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is a really pretty mom-type character who soothes me with her voice whilst she blows peeps up with gentle Ionian grace.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-09-11T21:08:02.297+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"In before \"Matron 'Karma' Morton\" (Chicago) legendary skin.  \"When you're good to Karma...

I'm so with you. And I'm glad that you can formulate your thoughts clearly and cleanly. I've failed about her pretty much when I've made tons of pics for Dark Gravitation Karma, but I hope that there are people who will eventually make something decent and likeable for the majority and Riots. I'm hoping and waiting. ","replies":[]}]}
