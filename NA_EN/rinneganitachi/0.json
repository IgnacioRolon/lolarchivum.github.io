It might be related to my new laptop, when I first got it, I couldn't do anything because I couldn't click at all, I was able to fix it but can only right click now, if anyone can fix that I'd also be happy about it (I use a HP Pavilion x360 laptop, it costs about $800, hope that helps), but right now I just want to fix my mouse freezing, it'd help me a ton. Just for additional info, I know it isn't because I'm not clicking for some reason, early I did a test with Teemo, I used his W and spammed my right click mouse button and couldn't move for at least 2 seconds, it is the same with others (and as I'm sure most of you know, 2 seconds is A LOT in LoL, especially during a fight where this happens even more).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T23:53:16.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I really don't think this is related to your new laptop, so rest easy knowing that ^_^!\n\n\nTwo things come to mind initially for me, either your config settings went a little wonky (in which case those keys would NEVER work), or this was caused by some packet loss affecting your connection. Try running a traceroute to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1 for me really quickly with the tool [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/), and post those results here so I can post a look.","replies":[]}]}
