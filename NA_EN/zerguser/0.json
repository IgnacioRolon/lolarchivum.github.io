WELL let me explain where it is I&#039;m having a problem. I would like to put in pictures  of end game charts, but I&#039;m unsure how to, so I will run you down 2 of my games today that also seem to happen more often than not and I can&#039;t help that; but these two specific games chapped my rear end. \r\n\r\nGame one: My K/D/A: 5/6/8 as Caitlyn. In this game I had a Xin Jungle that just kept trading 1 for 1 and then decided to troll me, telling me I fed and that I&#039;m bad and what not, while he had 7/8/7, a 6/9 top laner, and a 3/10 support. 3 of my deaths were due to an Irelia than my team fed (which she is still cancer) ulti through wall, q, e, q dead.jpg Super cool. The rest of the game turned into people just flaming each other, giving up objectives for free (aka taking wolves or other jungle camps as towers get pushed down) fun stuff, right? Okay so now that the rough details of game one have been established, I will get the point of the title of this post after game 2.\r\n\r\nGame 2: My K/D/A: 4/4/5 as Caitlyn. This game? 3/10 mid 4/8 support (who would not stop taking cs from me), and 3/7 jungle. Trust and believe when I say that I tried to corral these goofballs, but there was no stopping that train. AKA we had one dead, they were all up and everybody else on the team wanted to make a play for baron; As in take baron, not set up for a fight, not anything like that, but take it. After repeated attempts of saying we needed to defend and not go baron, I decided not to join them. Zyra presses R, Leona ults, their team cleans up shop, takes baron, and starts just rolling face on keyboard in all chat. Other examples of great plays this game are: Four top to kill irelia, and keep pushing tower, meanwhile mid lane, 2 take me under tower, and take tower, while bot laners take bot. Again, I tried to corral them, ping, type, all that fun jazz. Conclude game 2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point I&#039;m trying to make here is that at the end of the day, how are we supposed to climb? I&#039;m not saying im the best player, but I got set on a losing streak after climbing to silver 3, then getting knocked into 4, got a few wins, and knocked back down into 5. Again, im not the best player, but plays and people like above consistently happen everywhere. Had a Kayn jungle the other night throw the match because the top laner made him mad. I didn&#039;t have high deaths as the ADC, but he literally started walking into the enemy team and standing there. Then blamed it on him being drunk and just having fun. I understand, again, that I&#039;m not the best player, but as I got into silver 3, my hopes of reaching at least gold before season ends, were high, and just constantly running into players and things like this in this &quot;elo hell&quot; are knocking me back. Any real experience players out there have any good advice on how to get out of this? \r\n\r\nI try and do my best to make plays for the team, I am well aware, and don&#039;t care about me getting fed. I&#039;ve been there, and gotten over that, one person can not take a team that throws and feeds to victory. I was a 23/8/9 Kai&#039;sa and somehow lost. I try to help other lanes and do my best FOR THE TEAM, but I&#039;m stumped on how to climb out. I play customs with my plat friends and keep up just fine, not saying I deserve plat, just looking for advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamaitachi IV","date":"2018-11-10T13:22:41.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so I just op.gg u, and turns out:\n\n1- ur cs is bad, in the 2 games u mentioned, if u had more cs (10 per min or 9 per min), you could've easily carries such game.\nLook at the irelia cs on ur first game, then look at ur cs, u'll realize 1 reason to lose more.\n\n2- In that same game, u put litterally 0 wards..... 0.... ZERO....\nno control wards, wards, or any type of vision..\nwhat is it to be expected ?\n\n\nNow of course I can't watch the games, but surely there are some mistakes in the laning phase, and some bad positioning in team fights, that led u to lose.\n\nMaybe u can work on those 2 points (cs and wards) before blaming team mates !?\n\nOne more advice, in low elo, once u enter the game type \"/mute all\"\nand disable the ALL chat in the settings, and get used to \"not typing in chat at all\", not even \"ggwp after game\" and u'll win more <3","replies":[{"poster":"zerguser","date":"2018-11-10T18:41:26.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do genuinely appreciate the advice and I'm not defending my position on how I played. I know I made some bad plays, and my CS needs lots of improvement, but if you also check some of my other matches, I do very well across the board. That being said, my ward score was very low because my support literally just started following my jungle around and with them having a Leona support and their ADC forcing the wave to tower, I couldn't go out. \n\nI'm not saying I did the best in those games, but with the plays and such things happening that did? Even if I had perfect CS and good vision score, at the end of the day, I wasn't gonna be able to turn the game around, such as mentioned where I rick-rolled lanes with Kai'sa. \n\nI'm not placing the blame solely on my teammates, but at the same time what all am I supposed to do in situations like that?\n\nDo I just go bot while they're losing 3v4 mid and focus on my CS? Like these games with these players do tend to happen often, even in times where I do very well. \n\nI whole heartedly believe I could of done better in those two specific matches, but even in the ones where I do well, how am I supposed to carry the team?\n\nAnd I hear about doing the \"/mute all\" and turning off all chat until you're up above gold, I might just have to do it now. I've heard it too many times not to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VanDeadly","date":"2018-11-10T04:44:14.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just posted a very similar article today because I feel like league is just about ruined for me.
