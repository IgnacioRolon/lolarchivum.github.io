Note: I have messed with my input.ini file to try to put my left click as attack move to no avail, but since it has stopped working I have restored my keybindings to default, repaired my files, and even deleted the input.ini file so that the game could make a new one with all having no effect . Would I have to reinstall my game in order to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T00:06:54.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you delete the *persistedsettings.json* file in addition to the *input.ini* while logged into the League client? This is the only true way to reset your files and have the system create a fresh set for you. Alternatively, (if you don't use item sets) you can just delete the entire **Config** folder while logged into the client, then hop into a custom match to confirm the change went through.\n\nI hope this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"IShouldGetASuit","date":"2016-11-16T23:15:27.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply -- been busy with school, but thanks for the help! All the forums I read didn't mention another file besides  _input.ini_ so this really helped! Thanks a lot! (BTW the new client looks great too!)","replies":[]}]}]}
