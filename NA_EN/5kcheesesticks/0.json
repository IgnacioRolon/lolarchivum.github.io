I hate the way Riot treats the non SR portions of its playerbase. Any other game company wouldn't be able to get away with this.

They don't even enforce on bots in normal tt, meaning if you want to go try the mode in norms you'll get put up against bots for a while or against full enemy teams while you have bots.. if you go into ranked it's only the people who know it inside and out but that's difficult to obtain until you get yourself a squad of dudes who are willing to jump into a match against 3 bots and be stuck doing nothing while they don't know the mode.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-08-03T12:27:49.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM had the same number of changes and managed to be several times more popular.
