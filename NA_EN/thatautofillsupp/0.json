While Riven sure is prone to attract toxicity in the respective player due to her feast or famine nature (high expectation resulting in a huge disappointment) she does not even have the most toxic players - proof is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Arbj9sT5ZHqRdG5kWHdLYk9TTnFMSTJSdFY1V0k4YlE&usp=sharing#gid=0).\nLooking at these numbers while keeping in mind that only a rather small portion of players is actually toxic and getting punished you have to realize that only a little portion of Riven players is especially toxic. She is not even within the top 10 of the most toxic champions (barely in the top 20!).\nThis just shows the astonishing discrepance of the percepted toxicity and actual toxicity of Riven mains - which results in a very negative attitude towards Riven, which should actually make Riven players more toxic (seeing how toxicity attracts toxicity) - and yet Riven is not in the top 10. Another proof of the negative attitude towards Riven players is that I received downvotes for a completely harmless statement which doesn't even fit to the picture of a toxic Riven player. \n\nAnd now for the last paragraph which some might find to be offensive, I am actually hesitant about writing it down, however here it goes:\nI was able to actually prove that Riven players actually are not even that toxic. In addition to that my own perception of Riven players seems to be better - why is that so? I don't even play Riven that much (go and take a look at my op.gg) and tend to meet quite a few Rivens. \nCould it perhaps be that the reason for a lot of you people meeting so many incredibly toxic Riven players is your own attitude?\nExample: when a Riven player makes a statement ingame that could be completely neutral you might take it for offensive and act somewhat negative towards it. This would decrease the general moral within your team and would probably offend the Riven player and increase the chance of him acting toxic. If he shows toxic behaviour you feel that the Riven stereotype of Riven players got confirmed yet again and thus end up having such an overly bad impression of Riven players.\nDisclaimer: this doesn't have to be true for you. Maybe you just had incredibly bad luck with Riven players/just tend to remember the negative Riven players more even though you act neutral/friendly towards them. \nI also do not want to deny that statistically speaken Riven players act more toxic. However it's_ not even close_ to 50%.\n\nKind regards from someone who used to play Riven but had to realize that his mechanics suck and his true strength lies withing decisionmaking.","replies":[{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-08-16T19:00:26.574+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny thing, not sure if unrelated or not but both riven's and vaynes pick rates dropped ~3% the same patch that the anti-toxicity ban waves rolled out.

If you take the %flamers of the Riven mains and the % flamers of the average champion there won't be a big difference. If you meet a Riven player the chance of him/her being a flamer is pretty much as high as it is with most other champions.\nThat means that the people here who are saying more than 50% of Riven players are toxic are simply wrong.\n\nBut why do I care. Well, that's an interesting question. Personally I am not offended, I couldn't actually care less. \nThe thing is that bugs me is how people are willing to blatantly make numbers up and believe what other people say just so that they can hate a group of people. \nThis is a dangerous phenomenon. Basically what happens is that there is a group of people who due to some reasons has a slight tendancy to behave negative (in this specific case it's due to Rivens f/f nature) gets a somewhat bad reputation. People continue to exaggerate when it comes to the actual magnitude of the bad behaviour. Loads of people who did not even see this negative tendency to the moment when they heared how bad the group is supposed to be suddenly believe that they are actually bad.\nAfter that their mindset towards the group gets extremely negative and they only remember the most negative represents of said group. A huge circlejerk begins, suddenly a lot of people start hating this group and make some statistics up that aren't true - and still believe them somehow. \nThis is a phenomenon that does not only occur in league. This is a phenomenon that is ATM occuring in my country.

You said it was double the rate of ANY champion. Thus that's proven wrong again.\n\nThe data is still there, it just wants to be picked up.

But then you complained about the lack of source. Now I posted the source and you complain about the bad math :(\n\nExcept Riven doesn't even nearly had double the leave ratio of the average, not even back in 2014.\nRivens leave ratio back then was clearly 0.5%. Half of that would be 0.25%.\nThere are exactly 4 champions who had a leave ratio of .25% and below.\nNo idea how you want to estimate the average, but you are clearly doing it wrong.\nI'd say the average was 0.34 or something an Riven has 0.5.

That's the point, you can't tell anything from this because again, this doesn't show enough information to draw any conclusions. \n\nYou keep acting like you've done the research but all your sources don't actually prove anything, and when you start off by saying things like \n\n> Unless you have some source I really would LOVE to see I have to assume that you just are wrong :/\n\ni'm not inclined to believe you will provide any useful information because you have already made up your mind.

Is it higher than average? Yes.\nIs it the highest? No. Is Rivens leave ratio double as high than that of any other champion? No. Is Rivens leave ratio double as high than the average leave ratio? No.\nIf we were to say leave ratio is proportional to toxicity - which you are implying after all - and take your assumption of the vast majority (lets say 70%) of the Riven players are toxic. Rivens leave ratio is 1.4 as high as the average leave ratio.\nThis would mean that Riven players are 1.4 times more toxic than the average player. This would mean that 50% of the players are toxic (50*1.4=70). Now ask yourself: is 50% of the community toxic?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
