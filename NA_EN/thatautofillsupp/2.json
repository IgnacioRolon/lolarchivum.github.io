Im half health and  trying to fend off a morgana support, so my top laner starts Pinging (Just pings, not targets or anything) Near the other adc so she thinks its me and engages, then dies and rages because she thought i was the one who pinged. Now, i know what most people will say \"Just report her and move on\" blah blah blah. But i think riot should add in Thresh (summoner name here) Pings in the chat just for a bit of hindsightâ€¦. it frustrates me when someone else on the team pings my adc to go in and i get told off because they thought it was me.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-03T02:28:29.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this needs to be done.  The report and move on doesn't work because you can't rely on the person doing it to give themselves away.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatAutofillSupp","date":"2015-01-03T21:46:21.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly and the whole \"circle of blame\" happens","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatAutofillSupp","date":"2015-01-06T08:12:46.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
