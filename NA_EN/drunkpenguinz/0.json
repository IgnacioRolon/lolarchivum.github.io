I even brought it up to my friends, and how I could've sworn I had \"x\" amount of IP more the night before. I brushed it off for a while, but everyday I noticed that my IP was off by more than just a single digit. I recently decided to make sure I'm not going insane, and screenshot my client, as well as my entire screen to show the time and date at the bottom corners (See screenshot links at bottom). Sure enough, after checking the picture from last night, I was missing 164 IP. At this point, I've lost so much IP without realizing it, which I'm sure you could understand my anger. I thought it might have something to do with the new client, but none of my friends are experiencing this. I really need to get this fixed, since right now, it's ruining League for me.\r\n\r\nLinks to Screenshots: Feb. 21- https://gyazo.com/e6488c3970ff0d8f3e45666258a118fb\r\nFeb.22- https://gyazo.com/d5ccf2080d22b0ee111d0ec43f69598b\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot taken on February 22, I included my purchase history, to prove that it really is just disappearing.","replies":[{"poster":"NateDwagg","date":"2017-05-24T03:12:43.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just now started noticing this has began happening to me too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kennitto","date":"2017-05-05T20:40:45.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been happening to me just today too, before i thought i just might be remembering it wrong but I clearly remember having 6000 Ip yesterday and now having 5700 or so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l2k ValiantX","date":"2017-04-20T22:01:37.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lost more IP again last night","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-22T22:18:37.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be a syncing issue on the updated client.  Swap back on the legacy to get everything back up to date, then you can switch back.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Relyne","date":"2017-04-20T15:52:47.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will this issue be fixed by the time the old client goes away permanently?
