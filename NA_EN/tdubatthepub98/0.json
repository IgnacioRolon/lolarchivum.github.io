It takes a while to get to three percent (not thirty-three percent like I have seen others post so it's not connection.) then it just says it fails and to check the logs. Not sure what to do, I'd quit playing, but I do have money still left in my account and I doubt yall have any interest in failing me. I like you Riot, but HELP! or anyone else reading this would be great. \r\n\r\nplease, of course, :D\r\n\r\nTanner","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-07T20:50:44.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it an unspecified error?  I'm also curious if you're still on the legacy client.  This kind of issue can happen if your OS security settings or anti virus is acting a bit overzealous.
