I login today, go through my 20 minute waiting time, and see \"attempt to join queue failed\". OK so I'm mad as fuck now, lets try this again, and the same thing happened twice. I tried reverting to the old launcher but nothing works. I restarted my computer, restarted league, uninstalled and reinstalled, and did a client fix. all to no avail.  All i wanted was to play this game and riot can't even fix its fucking launcher. I am so done.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Warwick the OP","date":"2017-04-30T11:11:32.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply, but it seems to have been fixed.

Since reverting to the old client and reinstalling didn't work, we can probably rule out any issues with the client itself. If everything works okay until the moment your network connects to the matchmaking servers, then something might be blocking that connection. \n\nCheck out the steps in this [**connection faq**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), and we should be able to narrow down what's really happening.","replies":[]}]}
