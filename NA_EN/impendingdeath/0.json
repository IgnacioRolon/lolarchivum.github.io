He’ll suffer miserably against mobile champions on account of his kit. He’ll remain largely unplayable for nearly a year to a year and a half, and then a Riot designer will announce that he’s taking the reins and reworking the champion. After 6 months to another year, we’ll have a new “Veigar.” Except that it will be nothing like the old Veigar. The AP burst mage will be completely transformed, and even the character’s entire personality may be changed. We’ll receive 2-4 hastily worded sentences of lore that explain why Veigar isn’t Veigar anymore, and that explain why we should attempt to care about the character’s personal motivations for being on the fields of battle. The people that loved old Veigar’s evil laugh and voice lines are now attempting to like this new Veigar who doesn’t resemble the old character in any way. He’ll be some sort of hyper mobile champion that doesn’t even play like Veigar used to. \r\n\r\nChampion cohesion feels like it’s at an all-time low. The meta is shifting faster than Riot can balance old champions to accommodate it, and these new reworks are essentially remakes, where so much of the old kit has to be discarded to enable to character to function in a new meta. This systemic cycle of champion neglect and subsequent remaking is incredibly discouraging. The meager amount of lore out there doesn’t really justify why champions are being discarded completely and remade anew with the same name but nothing else, and it’s a very grating experience. I’m saddened that Riot has completely shifted their attention away from the very soul of the game and poured so much energy into forcing the same 30 LCS champions to dominate the meta. Given that other MOBAs are capable of not only balancing the game at high level play but also imparting a sense of life and character into the game, it makes me question why I continue to play this game. In the end, it’s the small hope that Riot will return to its roots and restore the game to the vibrant, diverse battlefield that it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"eyes wide shut","date":"2015-02-15T04:12:36.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"tell me what other mobas are \"balanced\" at competitive play, so I can laugh myself to sleep.","replies":[{"poster":"j j","date":"2015-02-15T13:11:30.855+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please laugh yourself to sleep.

I simply stated the game was much more fun and had more versatility. When mobility was a luxury the game was in a better position than it is today. Also, I never really had a problem with people stacking sunfire capes. Occasionally it was fun to run unconventional champion builds and still be capable of winning. (The twitch, and eve thing were not really broken it was just too abusable vs inexperienced players). There were bugs and problems in every patch some of those bugs that have persisted throughout the entire life time of league. \n\nHalf of them you probably aren't even aware. Riot has fixed a lot of issues like any game should expect to do over a long period of time. But in terms of champion design, itemization, and diversity amongst play styles they ultimately failed and fell into a trap where releasing X amount of champions in a certain amount of time came in front of maintaining or developing the game. Rather than giving champions interesting kits they were less unique as you would expect with more champions joining the league. Though the pattern especially recently has strayed away from a good majority of immobile champions. Champions today have no risk high reward due to how they excel in lanes and are capable of roaming. \n\nI really did like league but it doesn't have the amazing factor for me anymore perhaps for others but as previously stated: promises not kept, balanced that were not rational, increase in mobility, bruisers who build pure tank and do tons of dmg, and poor itemization balances have ruined league for me and probably many others. Those who joined recently would be unaffected as they would not be able to compare it to the past. My expectations for league were baited by impressions I got early on, which turned the game into something I could not fathom. I gave myself a bias where I thought riot really cared about the community and the state of the game. I learned quickly as time went on league of legends would just be the epitome of a game that did bare minimum, did things despite input of the community, made false promises and pretend their actions were just in the process (or give Y instead of X being promised). Those are the traits of what most games unfortunately turn into.","replies":[{"poster":"eyes wide shut","date":"2015-02-18T14:49:06.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, this game was much more exciting and \"versatile\" back when all people did was farm in lanes for 35+ minutes until fully built (froggen anyone?), as evidenced by the fact that a lot of the European lcs teams STILL hadn't broken this habit up to last season. The only \"exciting and versatile\" thing that came from this was watching all the korean and chinese teams stomp all over NA and Europe for multiple seasons. The game was fun back then, but as far as \"strategic and diverse\", it was not even close to anything resembling that in any shape or form.\n\nHas the game made it there yet? no. Absolutely not. But it's leaps and bounds better than it used to be, by a LONG way.","replies":[{"poster":"j j","date":"2015-02-18T16:22:32.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You basically admit you love the increased mobility, and love how balance is surrounded by lcs and only lcs. Precisely why people are fed up with this game. In a good portion of my early day games they were not surrounded by farm fests perhaps tournaments were but that is a safe way of playing and optional. People can take theirs risks or farm (enemies still had opportunities to capitalize on that). Riot should have increased incentives to discourage that earlier on but never really found a solution that didn't involve forcing a meta and increasing the mobility and how most newer champions out performed older champions in every way. That isn't balance and it isn't fun.\n\n I looked forward to the development of the game at that time and expected much greater things in the game to change strategy that didn't involve most of the top used champions with gap closers. Lissandra was probably one of the few I actually admired because she actually had risks had to make choices and didn't have the best lane phase. Her mobility could easily be countered and was not instant. That is the type of champion design that needs to be introduced to league. Diana was also pretty cool until she was gutted. \n\nI think you and I agree on some aspects. I certainly did not like the idea of games being farm fests either. But there should be compositions people pick to decide their agenda prior to the game. League has that now but the problem with that is champion balance. Champions that fit into certain compositions are capable of too much with little draw backs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-02-15T08:44:51.915+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=eyes wide shut,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qylLmmEg,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-15T04:12:36.342+0000)\n>\n> tell me what other mobas are \"balanced\" at competitive play, so I can laugh myself to sleep.\n\nDota 2\n\nIceFrog has buffed things are completely pub stompy without giving a single fuck about what it does to pubs","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-02-15T23:08:48.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CynicalGiant,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qylLmmEg,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-02-15T08:44:51.915+0000)\n>\n> Dota 2\n> \n> IceFrog has buffed things are completely pub stompy without giving a single fuck about what it does to pubs\n\nWrong.\n\nTinker and spirit breaker nerfed over pubs,while they keep being careful with sniper/riki as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-02-15T02:20:06.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":26,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-02-15T02:35:33.747+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Ascendants to the Great Seat of Cymurri had for ages imported their Oracles exclusively from the Ivory Incubarium, high in the hollow peaks of the Zealot's Range, with a downpayment made at the time of the embryo's conception and the balance surrendered on delivery of a mature, well-trained prophet to the Gate of the Graven King.\nRaised by same Pallid Sybils who bred and birthed them, all sanctioned Oracles were anchored by their physical form to the world we most of us share; meanwhile, their souls roamed far afield, barely bound by the airiest astral umbilicus. From such cosmic roamings the prophets would return, speaking words of fire with tongues of flesh. Their mystic utterances were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors, who found in them visions of the future, diplomatic advice, all the supernatural ammunition the line of Graven Kings needed to secure victory in every campaign, whether in the court or on the battlefield. Thus it went for generations, the Graventome's pages filling with the names of triumphant kings and the new domains they had acquired. So it went, that is, until the particular Oracle named Nerif arrived to serve the very last of the stone-helmed kings.\n\n>From the first, Nerif's prophecies were unusual. They seemed not merely to portend the future, but to shape it. The weird soothsayer croaked out advice no one had requested, and suddenly the Cymurri found themselves immersed in conflicts with newfound enemies. The Advisors, sensing a threat to their power, were quick to pin these unwelcome developments on the latest Oracle. They demanded his removal, petitioning the Sybils to reclaim their defective prophet and replace him with a worthy substitute. But Nerif described an ominous dream of the Incubarium's destruction, and within hours came news of the ancient school's destruction in a catastrophic avalanche. Fearing the same fate as the Pallid Sybils, the Advisors withdrew to their counsel chambers, suddenly anxious to avoid the Oracle's notice. The Graven King, however, was a creature of great practicality. He doubted the commitment of his overprudent Advisors. An Oracle of such rarity, he reasoned, ought be used as a weapon to enlarge his domain. He therefore demoted his timid counselors and stationed Nerif at his side. With only a blunt understanding of Nerif's talent, he boldly stated the outcomes he desired, and coaxed Nerif into uttering his wishes as prophecy.\n\n>At first, all was well. The Last Graven King boasted that by adopting Fate's pet, he had made a plaything of Fate itself. He should have taken it as a warning then when, on the eve of his invasion of the Unsated Satrap's realm, he attempted to coerce a prediction of certain victory from his Oracle, only to hear Nerif quietly mutter, \"It could go either way.\" No firmer statement could he force from Nerif's lips. Still, the King was confident in his army. The Satrapy was landlocked, poorly armed, and shut off from all possible allies. He took \"It could go either way\" to indicate that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his plan.\n\n>Of course, we now know that he should have taken the sayer's words more literally. Even with careful study of the Annotated Annals of If, what happened on the field before the Unsated Satrap's palace is almost impossible to visualize. It appears that in the midst of the carnage, the battle began to bifurcate. At each pivotal moment, reality calved and broke into bits. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also stood sure-footed, forging onward to fight. Their minds also split; the warriors found themselves both dead and alive, existent and non-existent. Victory and defeat were partitioned, so that each separate outcome was experienced in simultaneity by both armies. The universe became a hall of mirrors, with all the mirrors endlessly shattering.\n\n>The immediate effect on both parties was insanity. Unable to comprehend the state of being both triumphant and defeated, the Graven King's mind dispersed into motes of madness. The naive Satrap fared no better. The opposing paired realities continued to split and split again, echoing into infinite histories, all of them populated by a bewildered populace that soon lost the ability to feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner.\n\n>Long before the repercussions had played out, however, Cymurri's wary Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever. It was, of course, too late for them. And may well be for us.\n\nYep. Totally abandoned lore.

While Champions like Katarina could just press R\n\nthen whats the point of playing veigar, if other champion can do what he does without the need to afk farm for ages? the way i see it, they are trying to make veigar more mage-ish and less like burst-mage pseudo-assassin.  \n\n yeah it may not be perfect for now, but remember those are only tentatives changes which may be completly different in few updates depending on how veigar does on PBE","replies":[{"poster":"Marinaras Trench","date":"2015-02-15T16:22:15.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with this.
