My internet is fine. Reset it, did all the normal tests and league seems to be the issue. It happens randomly during the game and lasts for 3-5 seconds. Makes playing very hard. Any advice? I have already repaired the league client.","replies":[{"poster":"Asuna3724","date":"2017-10-11T02:33:12.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue where I get ping spikes and the game lags spells and abilities just like the other people are saying. I normally have around 60 ping and it spikes to around 300 when this happens but nothing is wrong with my internet as I have run speed tests as the disconnects happen and my youtube vids have no issue and my voice comms on discord are fine too. It is definitely a riot server issue and it started about 4/5 days ago for me too. Bump this. There is no way random people from around the country suddenly have bad internet, has to be a server issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-10T18:38:36.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection to our game server might be degrading, which can result in these spikes.  Despite having fine internet, you can still run into issues with specific services.  Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on these games so we can get a better overview and know for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iCowgirl95","date":"2017-10-10T00:54:34.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been having the same problem now for the last few days, tried many \"fixes\" and even tried changing my settings to lower graphics etc but nothing fixes it. It lasts anything from a few seconds to a few minitues or in some occasions 10 mintues. It slows my champ down or does a jump with them (one mintue there in one place next they jump to another), there spells or abilities are delayed and using my items is sometimes delayed. My fps / ping will jump from 37 ms to 200 or 300 and stay in the hundreds for a period of time. I know its not my internet cause next game it is fine and my ms stays at 30 to 40 mark. This occurs every few games and is always the same, it makes playing quite annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aenygma","date":"2017-10-10T00:28:05.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problem recently. My ping used to be a stable 34 ms, but now spikes anywhere from 40 to 200 ms. It sometimes goes back down to normal, but spikes again a short while after. It makes the characters warp and puts a delay on every action, it's very frustrating. Tried a lot of fixes too, nothing worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VI OBSIDIAN IV","date":"2017-10-10T00:02:48.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.

It appears to jump between players?? Confusing.","replies":[]}]}]}
