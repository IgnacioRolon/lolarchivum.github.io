With the meta favoring AD champions, costy AP items, assassins, mobility, ADCs, somewhat ranged champions (Lux), and **NO STEALTH WARD**, the new changes have hurt Cassiopeia unintentionally (?).... or was it intentional?\nAnyhow, I think Cassiopeia needs some tweak to bring her back to her position. \nSome of my personal thoughts on how to change her was:\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 1. Cassiopeia&#039;s mana regen is: 10 (+0.85 per level)\n\n 2. When Cassiopeia&#039;s ultimate stuns a champion, per champion stunned, she gains 20 stacks on her passive.\n\n 3. Noxious Blast (Q) can be casted while moving.\n\n 4. Noxious Blast (Q) now costs: 70 mana\n\n 5. Miasma (E) now costs: 80 mana\n\n 6. Twin Fang (E) now costs: 60 mana\n\n 7. Petrifying Gaze heals Cassiopeia for 50/75/100 (+10% AP) when she stuns an enemy champion.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAllow me to explain why I chose these changes. \n**_Firstly, I don&#039;t aim to improve Cassiopeia&#039;s dueling laning phase._** In fact, I actually want to make Cassiopeia's all-out playstyle at level 2 with {{summoner:14}} a little less efficient (though not damage-wise). She had a whole rework just for that, so why try to reverse some of that? **_Meanwhile, I do wish her late game was a little more improved? (Not her damage mathematically.)_** This means that if Cassiopeia successfully survives laning phase without feeding or being too bullied, how well a player plays Cassiopeia will result in a win or a lose. _**So, let the assassins and enemy champion take advantage of laning against Cassiopeia early game- that's how assassins and early game champions were designed and this is how Cassiopeia is designed. However, by late game, the whole game should make room for Casisopeia. Successfully laning with a not-so-well-at-laning champion and going head-on for late game is hard, yet rewarding experience every Cassiopeia player should feel to its fullest. **_\n________________________________________________________________________________ \nWhile I understand Cassiopeia is meant to have mana problems, with new changes that already limit her, mana is the last problem she should really have. **_ For instance, when doing Dragon or Baron, having Cassiopeia in your team is crucial to these objectives._** Lowering the cost of Twin Fang means that after Baron or Dragon, **_Cassiopeia still has enough mana to spam Twin Fang in a teamfight that might erupt after getting these objectives. However, her two main abilities cost significantly more mana early on. This means that the player&#039;s laning phase is significantly limited while his/her late game mainly focuses on the player&#039;s ability to kite, not manage mana. _**\n________________________________________________________________________________\nThis is also where everything intertwines. **_Since Noxious Blast costs a lot more mana early on, this means that Cassiopeia will have a harder time stacking her passive. Hence, to compensate, her passive gives her 20 stacks whenever her ult stuns an enemy_**, and her mana regen is a little better (although having increased mana regen merely means anything to Cassiopeia- a champion who needs a large pool of mana.) \n________________________________________________________________________________\n**_Next, Noxious Blast can be casted while moving. This is extremely crucial to Cassiopeia&#039;s gameplay kit. _**This can improve her ability to kite or chase down opponents. With this new meta bringing greater emphasis on items like Relay&#039;s or Frost Queens, assassins, and tanks with gap closers (don&#039;t all tanks have a form of a gap closer?), **_maneuvering Cassiopeia while being able to move with her Q can mean life or death. _**\n________________________________________________________________________________\n**_Finally, Petrifying Gaze heals Cassiopeia for a tiny amount when she stuns an enemy champion. This has similar intentions as to why Lissandra&#039;s ultimate was buffed_**, except this one&#039;s not as significant as hers in numbers. This heal may seem pathetic, but to stun an enemy champion while **_having a little bit of your health healed for a Cassiopeia player means that one can immediately re position, and then spam Twin Fang (which recovers your health), or just go about slaughteirng the enemy on that spot._**  :) In other words, it will improve her baiting potential, teamfight presence, post-6 laning phase (although her ult has an extremely long cooldown early on), and kiting.\nAnyways, how do other people feel about this change?

There is a reason why she is seeing a slight resurgence in professional play over the last few days (she's appeared 4 or 5 times so far).

I've been playing her during her time on the rotation and she just seems.... off in comparison to every other AP champion currently. She almost has no identy. \n\nHer recommended items indicate a Tear and a NLR, yet her range calls for a Rod of ages to gain much needed health and mana as she's more of a close up immobile mage.. think Annie without the stun on demand in terms of range. \n\nHer scaling is totally off. even if you hit every q, and every w on your opponent, her passive takes AGES to build up. I'm not the best cass player, but in a custom game against beginner bots it took about 10-12 minutes to hit that first tier and a half, hitting all the q's and w's to speed up the scaling. Most games now are half over at that point.. and in the average game it takes about 30 minutes to hit the full 500 stacks. \n\nSpeaking of scaling, for being such an up front immobile mage, once she gets the heal on her e, it's rather pathetic with the amount of damage being pushed out thanks to thunderlords and the burst from all the mobile champions. I'm not advocating that she be turned into Vlad's overpowered healing, but something needs to be done with it. \n\nHer stun is SO short ranged that in team fights, you're going to miss half of the champions you are trying to stun, or you're going to be stunned and killed before you can even get your ult off. \n\nSomething needs to happen to her, because I've been putting off picking her up because she's so feast or famine right now in the current meta..
