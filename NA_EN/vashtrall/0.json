Not a walkthrough or anything, just give me some hints?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T04:12:51.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that flickering pink screen sounds pretty troubling. From your description, it doesn't sound like this is just happening in League, so I'd suggest doing some general pc maintenance to make sure everything is running alright.
