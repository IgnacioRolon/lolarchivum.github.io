One of the most valuable things Skarner got from his rework was having his ultimate interact with the rest of his kit.  Before, you would use your ultimate on someone and they would not move much at all, or in an assassin's case dash to safety after you use your ultimate, while you take half your health worth of damage for being in the middle of 5 people. \nNow, you can fracture (e) the assassin, bring him to your team with your ultimate, and immediately stun them so they can be focused down (using it to make picks)  or ultimate whoever is diving your carries (peel in team-fights).\n\nI'm not saying that his new passive is perfect.

And an assassin that got hit by his ult would immediately use their mobility move to jump out before he could use his E stun, only if the assassin had already gap closed to delete a squishy would your scenario have the most likely chance of happening.\n\nThe only thing I agree with on being better is that his shield is stronger but it came with nerfs in other areas that make it so it doesn't matter much because they reduced his base damage for more scaling so you're encouraged to build damage.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-05-02T15:26:50.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think OP means you apply the E mark, then ult while they are infected by the venom, and then auto to stun before the mark runs out.

Outside of his ultimate, the main basis for individualizing Skarner's basic abilities will only be outperformed by...basically anyone with a stun. \n\nThe at max 1 second stun to 6 second \"cooldown\" on that passive is comparable to virtually every other hard cc in the game, and seeing that Skarner's crystal venom passive is extremely similar to Braum's Passive, and dare I say inferior to Braum's iteration of that ability, to pretend that Skarner can build his niche around that is...very hopeful, to put it one way.\n\nNot to mention his Crystal Venom passive still exists in his current iteration and, just like its previous iteration, is extremely easy to forget that it's even there. Or that since it's usually at such a small duration, its primary purpose is to put a stutter in the enemy's movement, in which case a Passive like Ekko's is _waaaay_ better for that particular job while Ekko's kit offers way more utility _and_ combat potential than current or old Skarner offers.\n\nYou seem to have a pretty stern idea of what Skarner is and what he should be, and that's fine and all but you need to review him from the context of the rest of the game. We already have a lot of sticky and inescapable monsters who do the job faaaaaar better than Skarner, meaning that if you try to balance Skarner around that, you hit the \"accidentally overbuffing his super generic basic abilities or not putting enough power into them and turning Skarner into a stun bot\" problem I pointed out previously.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-05-02T17:17:10.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget that his previous kit had the attack speed and movespeed steroids in the crystals on his Q and his base movespeed was higher. So long as he could get to someone then he could use his Q to speed himself up after them to keep hitting Qs while attacking faster and while dealing that damage he'd stack up his passive for a burst of damage and a stun. Yes, the stun wasn't very long but it was long enough for a successful gank with the help of the laner and in teamfights it meant he could stack up the passive on multiple people even while just focussing on one person and be able to stun several of them. Yes he wouldn't get a stun of 2 seconds like say, Brand, but he could get a maximum of 5 seconds of stun spread out over an entire enemy team.\n\nThe passive was not the lynch pin of his kit but was perfect for accentuating the rest of it.\n\nAnd the current version is easy to forget because its attached to his slow E skillshot. It's made it so whether he succeeds in a gank or not depends entirely on hitting one short ranged slow moving skillshot and then being able to gap close fast enough to auto his target. The reliability of being able to get your stun off with using your Q was far superior to his current E which has made his ganks like they were with his first rework... but worse since he's so slow now.\n\nAnd please don't bring Ekko up as an example of good design choices. He's just Lee Sin 2.0, does too much of everything for no drawback.\n\nRegardless of whether others can do a similar job to Skarner, the sticky inescapable bug WAS supposed to be his niche and his kit was designed around it.

His Q is a short range spammable damage ability, the kind of thing someone who gets up in an enemy’s face would use to give out long term dps, his w is a speed boost for catching people that also has a shield to help him survive being in the middle of an enemy team or taking the damage from someone trying to kite him, his E is meant to allow him or a teammate to close the gap and pounce on someone and his ult is a kidnapping tool. None of these abilities are things that a neutral objective controller would want in their kit.\n\nKnow who DOES have a kit for objective control? Nunu. Nunu has two abilities for controlling things in the jungle, he has his consume for dealing large true damage to monsters to secure them for himself or his team and he has his ult which is great in the jungle and river because of the confined aspect of those places and that fact that he can catch people by surprise with his ult by hiding behind a corner or in a bush to channel for a lot of damage before the enemy realizes it or when they have no choice but to fight in it.\n\nBut do you know what Skarner’s kit IS good for? What he is SUPPOSED to do? Being a champion that catches someone and then sticks to them and doesn’t let up until they’re destroyed by himself or his team. His previous kit was perfect for this kind of gameplay, with the crystal venom passive, w to move in quick, E to slow someone down, and then Q Q Q to stun them and finish them off or Ult and drag them away into your team. \n\nNothing about Skarner's ACTUAL gameplay is of any benefit to taking neutral objectives other than that being where his attack speed and movespeed steroids are. You could put his rocks in front of the each of the base entrances of both teams and it doesn't suddenly make him a good champion for sieging, it just arbitrarily shackles him to only be effective there.","replies":[{"poster":"PoE00dpWDk","date":"2016-05-02T06:09:25.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now you give a solid explanation to why Skarner is suppose to be a sticky chase down champ and it may seem like historically that was what Skarner was but you fail to take RIOT logic into account.

Currently Skarner has to avoid taking unnecessary spires because they say \"hey look I'm here come and kill me OR run away\". The timers show when the buff is coming up, but says nothing about the position or any champions around it or even give vision of the buff itself.\n\nSkarnwr on the other hand simply cannot touch the river spires or even the enemy jungle spires without wasting time (during the laning phase) because it literally says \"run away I'm ganking top/bot!\" Hell even Kindred has the delay on when the enemy team can see her take marks. Imagine if their mark didn't have the delay. You see their jungler top and their Krugs are marked (you are red side) so you go take your \"free\" mark since jungler is literally on the other side of the map. But wait, bot and mid were both looking at the map and saw that swirl instantly go away so you get pincered and die despite taking your passive stack at THE best time. \n\nSkarner is not \"rewarded\" enough for taking spires since they hurt him way more than they ever help him before 20 minutes. It is the epitome of a \"noobtrap\" to touch spires outside of taking dragon WITH teammates since revealing your position to everyone on the map is worse than you maybe catching scuttle faster or ganking.....slower since you have to stop to channel.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2016-05-01T21:38:33.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can someone explain me what does this mean?\n\"Currently on live Kindred and her enemy get 8 seconds to run after taking a camp marked by Wolf.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2016-05-01T23:08:14.915+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say rift scuttler is your mark, you go to kill it, that mark still shows on the map for 8 seconds.

They snowball early incredibly hard, are immune to massive burst via the ultimate unless you CC lock them flawlessly, and can abuse the Maw/Steraks combo to become a high damage tanky monstrosity.\n\nIn competitive play Kindred tower dives on the level of Alistar, breaks assassinations with their ultimate, and can objective control better than almost any other jungler with good stack management. They're a really frustrating champion.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-05-02T16:27:46.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they've just all been picking her in a comp that already has a bunch of squishies in it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
