It may take upwards of 30 minutes to get to your chat, but if you sit tight we&rsquo;ll help you out as soon as we can.

No one above us handles tickets or chats, because we&#039;re perfectly equipped to do so. There is no one higher to appeal to : / \r\nNiccoicelol this company is unbelieveable. \r\n\r\nIf there is no one above you, that means you can do what you wish \r\n\r\nso you are not capable of unbanning my account? \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweeni am capable of doing it, but I won&#039;t because as I discussed, the ban was valid even though you disagree \r\nNiccoiceWhat makes your opinion more valid than mine? \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenwith all do respect, i work here and understand the policies. even though you don&#039;t agree, it is still how the system works. \r\n\r\ni know its hard to get a penalty you don&#039;t feel is warrented \r\n\r\nbut there was negativity on the account many times. \r\nNiccoiceBased on what policy and text do you not agree with my Game 1 Chat? \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenthere was negativity in the chat \r\nNiccoiceOk that wasn&#039;t my question, sorry. Let me try to rephrase the question for you. Based on the understood policies that you know, which part of my negativity in the chat broke those policies? \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenthis is the thing \r\n\r\nill give you examples \r\n\r\nbut this won&#039;t be a debate \r\n\r\nim going to state the pieces and why they&#039;re negative \r\nNiccoiceAlright \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn TrapkweenNiccoice: where is my jungler \r\nNiccoice: stupid \r\nNiccoice: u gank when u shouldnt man \r\nNiccoice: what are you doing dude \r\nNiccoice: im done \r\nNiccoice: gl \r\nNiccoice: reported \r\nNiccoice: calling other players is negative \r\nNiccoice: what are you doing? \r\nNiccoice: u take my cs \r\nNiccoice: then leave \r\nNiccoice: every gank \r\nNiccoice: answer \r\nNiccoice: what are you doing? \r\n^arguing. talking about reports, talking about negativity. this all keeps it in the game going on and on about it. \r\n\r\n- \r\n\r\nNiccoice: this is a team game \r\nNiccoice: you guys need to participate as a team\r\n^not necessary, they know this. be more productive, call out objectives but also know that people dont always listen and you can only control wha tyou can control \r\n\r\n- \r\n\r\nNiccoice: why are you guys playing ranked \r\nNiccoice: if ur not gonna play \r\nNiccoice: im not toxic \r\nNiccoice: im speaking \r\nNiccoice: no swearing \r\nNiccoice: or anything \r\nNiccoice: review chat \r\nNiccoice: we cant teamfight anymore \r\n\r\n^more arguing, this doesn&#039;t help win the game at all. you&#039;re filling chat with stuff that doesn&#039;t belong. i know it doesn&#039;t seem super bad... but this isn&#039;t using chat as intended \r\nNiccoiceYou stated earlier that this is not going to be a debate. So you are a judge of what I type in your perspective without hearing what the opposing party can explain what all that means? Correct? \r\n\r\nWhy do people go to court? \r\n\r\nWhy have a hearing? \r\n\r\nWhy are there witnesses \r\n\r\nWhy not just have 1 final judge who makes 1 call without hearing all sides of a story? \r\n\r\nWhy? Because its not fair \r\n\r\nPeople play this game, therefore they use their time and energy to play it, it controls their lives \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenthey thing is, it is negative, there&#039;s no other explantion needed \r\nNiccoiceThe thing is, it was murder. There&#039;s no reason to have a hearing \r\n\r\nthats your thinking? \r\n\r\nHow old are you katlyn? \r\n\r\n24? 25? \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenthis is a video game, we have rules, here they were broken \r\nNiccoicenot everything is black and white \r\n\r\nThis is more than a video game \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenmy age doesn&#039;t matter, dont need to make this personal \r\n\r\nat this point \r\n\r\ni told you it woudlnt&#039; be a debate \r\n\r\ni gave examples and told you why \r\n\r\nunless there&#039;s something new, i&#039;ll need to close the live chat \r\nNiccoicepeople&#039;s lives revolve around video games, that is incorrect \r\n\r\nYour age does matter because you are immature in your thinking. You do not see things correctly, therefore you should not be judging my ticket \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenat this point ive gone over this \r\nNiccoiceYou are changing my life by not unbanning my account \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenthis isn&#039;t my thinking \r\n\r\nim here to provide context and information about policies \r\n\r\nive done so \r\n\r\nif there&#039;s nothing new, ill be closing the chat \r\n\r\nlive chat ended 45 minutes ago \r\nNiccoiceNo, you were here to provide judgement on my ban \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweenyour account was already judged \r\nNiccoiceby a machine \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweennot be me, but us as a whole \r\n\r\nim telling you why it was upheld \r\n\r\nthe machine has been taught to detect negativity and it has done so \r\n\r\nim sorry but this is final \r\n\r\ni&#039;ll be closing the chat now \r\nNiccoiceWell maybe the machine needs to be re taught \r\n\r\nor shouldnt be teaching to begin with \r\n\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkweengood night \r\nNiccoiceI would like to have this appealed please. \r\n\r\nKaitlyn Trapkween left the chat\r\nRate This Chat\r\n\r\nType your message here","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-08-25T05:01:55.153+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"You go off being personal and insulting Riot by assuming one of their employee's age just because you don't want to take responsibility for your own actions.
