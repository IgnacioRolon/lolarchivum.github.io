I just picked him up and i cannot get enough of this little shit rat, but i really don't like any of his skins after playing the gorgeous ones that have come out recently.(aka nid, jinx, ashe, sivir ect...) \r\n\r\nWhatever you've been doing as of late has been superb, all these new skin are great. I just really wish Kennen would get some of that craftsmanship, ya know?\r\n\r\nI know it wouldn't be a great seller but sometimes... it's not about the money, money, money.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMxX-QOV9tI","replies":[]}
