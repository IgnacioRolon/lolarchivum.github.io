Ganked bot multiple times, we were winning.\r\n-Karthus complains he didn't get any ganks so he starts taking all my jungle farm near mid game.\r\n-I'm extremely behind now and it ruins my game too. \r\n-I'm like okay I will just report you and hopefully you'll be banned after game.\r\n-I decide to split push instead of following my team because I feel it's \r\n\r\na) unfair that I didn't get to farm and now I'm really behind\r\nb) I don't really wanna group when I don't have much on me. I'd rather splitpush.\r\n\r\nI repeatedly told my team that I prefer to just split push and I don't want to join the team fights. \r\n\r\n2nd game: \r\n\r\nI was a LITTLE bit toxic yes.\r\n\r\n-Someone threatened to kick my ass. I said something along the lines of \"I'm 6.5 and built way more than you so I could break you if I wanted to. But I don't want to keep going with this\" \r\n\r\n-Continued to just play the game smooth. \r\n\r\nAutomatically banned for 14 days. Can someone explain this please? I also don't expect riot to do anything but now I am extremely confused.","replies":[]}
