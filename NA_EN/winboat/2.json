Renegades violated code and conduct and deserved the boot and it forced them to sell as they could no longer compete all the more it was some established players which aided the violation which is shockingly stupid a few years ago there'd of got away with it but now esports/league is gaining credibility VERY fast it can no longer be allowed to happen.\n\nother small orgs can no longer compete due to the wage increases etc, business is business.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-05-19T05:36:27.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/competitive-ruling-renegades-and-tdk\n\nhttp://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/competitive-ruling-team-impulse","replies":[]}]}
