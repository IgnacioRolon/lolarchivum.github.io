That&#039;s kinda bad in my opinion cause well shit happens. I think you should have the ability to remake the game under 3 minutes regardless as long as someone is really AFK, or disconnected.\r\n\r\nAlso have you considered feeders that AFK? What if you got a troll who intentionally feeds a kill within  a minute then goes AFK? What then?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyhow like I said, this in itself is a very good chance Riot is doing, thumbs up. I still think it could be improved by what I suggested above, but like I said, I&#039;ll accept this as it is. Honestly not too many first bloods happen within the first 3 minutes so it shouldn&#039;t be a big problem, but the suggestion is still on the table for you guys to consider.\r\n\r\nThank you for this Riot, can&#039;t wait to see it in 6.11 or whatever","replies":[{"poster":"Macanimus","date":"2016-06-19T04:31:44.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot should change it so that people who rq or afk stay in fountain longer than needed or for the 90 seconds like they said in the patch notes, regardless of whether a first blood has happened in the first 3-5 minutes. I have had some games where the jungler fails a gank and then afks or leaves and you can't remake because of that first blood.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Take My Life","date":"2016-06-19T04:23:44.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with most of whats already been stated. although coming out of bronze i already see some flaws with the system. I agree on the aspect of at least we got something right? i think its great riot implemented this for us. although i see another issue. the past 3 days of me playing ranked (currently B1) ive had atleast 1 afk/dc/lagging person in my matches. now i understand that sometimes internet crashes and you lag out etc. but what if a person is in the middle of lane when they start to dc, and most people with bad connection know the pain of hitting 9000 ping and then 10 seconds later you DC. well if during these 10 seconds of just extreme lag if they die then the /remake wont work. there is also the occasional troll on a smurf account that will tank elo in ranked games in order to stay in bronze and troll. this is honestly more frustrating then the flamers, feeders, and the toxic players. for a lot of people this /remake rule will probably help a lot. But i doubt anything below Gold 1 will benefit very well.","replies":[]}]}
