I was hoping he&#039;d launch himself into the sky and rain down a  ton of comets or meteors on the whole rift similar to a Karthus ult but  meteors everywhere raining down, or at least jump up into the air and unleash a crazy magical fire breath AOE down onto the rift. \n\nWell, he isn&#039;t too bad, but just not what I was hoping. The jungle would seem fun, you can just go in hard with your E, try to get behind them  then Q them for the stun, activate W to increase the range and then R to knock them back to your turret lol.\n\nLooks like he would make a good AP tank tho, I&#039;m glad for that. The Tahm Kench eating him with his passive still going is gonna be crazy.\n\nEDIT. Overall, he isn't too bad, same creator as Bard, he did a good job making what appears to be yet another fun champion, not overally complicated and oppressive (until he goes tank AP) but still, I'll most likely end up buying him, he is still a dragon.\n\nAlthough  he don't look super OP, he does look annoying to lane against cause of the ever going passive which will make you dance like a puppet.","replies":[{"poster":"CosmicKiwii","date":"2016-03-08T23:40:12.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was hoping his ult was going to create a star like a super synra q with extra range and extra damage that explodes after a certaiin amount of time","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-03-09T00:35:15.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish it added to his orbit maybe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-08T23:38:16.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it seems like his kit was really designed around his passive. Q explodes after exciting extended passive range. W is just a toggle to make the passive stronger. E is a travel ability and q combo, and ult pushes and maintains people at extended passive length. It's all about the orbs. \n\nDragons dig orbs man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2016-03-09T00:44:46.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Vel'Koz hadn't been created, I guarantee you that his ult would've been a 'death-ray' type ultimate just like our favorite alien.

He seems very weak, and kinda makes me suspect they had a star based move-set they couldn't think of a champ for, and Ao Shin, who they couldn't think of any kit for, so they just mashed them together.\nI got excited at that trailer to..\n\nI'd have put his passive on his W, give his Q some decent range, put his E on his Ult, while adding in a bombing run style attack, and given his E something completely different. Maybe a location based buff, spawning a star.","replies":[{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-03-08T23:00:02.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, he might be good mid lane really if you think about it. The passive is an on going constant thing, while it looks like he does melee attacks, he can still hit all the other ranged mid laners with his on going passive, they would always have to be on their toes because of this, he can also increase the range of it too. If they go in, he can back step and still work with his passive to constantly make them dance for him.\n\nHe seems fun, but just not really what I expected. I'll probably buy him tho, build a good amount of tank/AP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-03-08T22:43:07.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perception is a *LOT* different then what it actually plays out to be, for all we know, Sol, is gonna be the most OP shit since release leblanc.
