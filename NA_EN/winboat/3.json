I would like to know as I do not got access to the signup email I used for this account.\n\nAs of Right now, I&#039;ve never had a chat restriction on this account, never used a 3rd party program. I&#039;ve also never said anything really racist or used that sort of hate speech on the game towards another person. Yes I have been toxic a couple games, but never got a chat restriction for it before which is weird.\n\nSo just wondering why I am now perma banned and why I never got warnings for anything I might have been doing wrong.\n\nI&#039;m saddened but I think if there was a really good reason to ban me forever and skip the chat restriction process, I&#039;d accept the ban but honestly just don&#039;t think there is given what I said above.\n\n\nAnyhow, thank you to whoever from Riot responds back in advance and tells me what the reform card and issue was because right now, i can&#039;t get into my email to check and would love to know.","replies":[{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2016-05-24T05:24:50.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\nSubmit a support ticket","replies":[{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-05-24T05:28:20.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did:)\n\nHopefully I hear back from them. Would like to know, and would hope it's a mistake as Riot never unbans anyone unless it was a mistake. So I'm hoping it was a mistake.\n\nCause I find it weird to be banned forever if you've never had a chat restriction, never used a 3rd party program, and never said anything extreme racist which I haven't.","replies":[{"poster":"Fedora Bot","date":"2016-05-24T12:19:25.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you get an answer btw? Same problem here for me... Never had a chat restriction, never used a 3rd party program... then out of the blue, permanent banned. The funny thing is I didn't even get an email from them, not even a generic email as I've seen from these posts (youve been banned until feb 2222, 2700 something). I hope this is a sick joke...

I'll accept it cause I was toxic recently, although I feel the first step should have been chat restrictions which I've never had in game.
