I&#039;m currently in reform and I have a few questions I&#039;m curious about.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. what is the threshold for what is considered toxic and what is general talk? What I mean is, is it alright to express disappointment? I had an ori (who im pretty sure was trolling) in my last game who went 0/17, and I wanted to report her for int because she had 2 rabadons and only really ran into fights to die. Is that considered toxic? If I&#039;m reported for that will I get banned again?\r\n\r\n2. Is all-chat beef reportable? If someone insults me or something, and I simply reply with a sarcastic remark or call them salty (no insults), is that reportable as well?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just nervous about getting my account banned again. I recently got over a two week ban and I really don&#039;t want another one because someone found something i said offensive or someone wants to troll me.\r\n\r\nAlso, another thing, I was reported for trash talking with my friend. We often exchange insults back in forth with no ill intentions behind them. Why was I reported for this? Even in the same conversation we were talking about normal things.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are just things I&#039;ve been thinking about. If I come up with any more ill post them here. Thanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"B4L5H4","date":"2016-08-24T20:55:11.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"No matter what you do Riot will ban you, they are a greedy company and they don't care if you invested money in your account.","replies":[{"poster":"DraygenBiscuit","date":"2016-08-24T20:56:26.056+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=B4L5H4,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3MjfFIff,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-24T20:55:11.820+0000)\n>\n> No matter what you do Riot will ban you, they are you a greedy company and they don&#x27;t care if you invested money in your account.\n\nThat doesn't make them greedy lol, they would be greedy if they did give special treatment to those who invested money!

Either you are crazy or you are geniusly intuitive lol. Also I appreciate your effort to not use that other word. I personally don't think that Riot is that kind of company, but I wont argue with you because I have no evidence to the contrary.","replies":[{"poster":"sheeplol","date":"2016-08-24T22:37:08.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly being banned is 100% avoidable.","replies":[{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2016-08-25T06:06:25.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only surefire way to avoid getting banned is to not type. period. what ends up happening. is people will falsely report you. these will get thrown out. however. at some point.  you will get a real report in which case the previous false reports will have put your account under surveilance, which causes the real report to trigger a punishment when it would have normally been cast off as the occasional toxic game that EVERYONE has","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sheeplol","date":"2016-08-24T22:35:42.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair I've never been unjustly banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-08-24T21:35:08.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Ori sounds more like a frustrated new player than a troll.  Try to start conversation to get them in a positive mood before asking about the second deathcap.\n\nIf you are able, seek out players that can encourage you to stay positive.  It can be fun to rib friends but that can be distracting to teammates, particularly if they dont know you are friends and this can actually put them on tilt. (I am one of these players, though I do try to ask if things can at least be toned down before i feel reporting is an option)\n\nIf you are in need of a teammate that can be a bit more chill hit me up, though I cant promise I'm the best around.
