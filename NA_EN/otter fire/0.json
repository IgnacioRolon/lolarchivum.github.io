Lethality is flat armor pen that scales with level. If a rengar smacks you for 1200 damage, and you have 1400 health but if an adc were to get say {{item:3078}}, {{item:3071}}, or {{item:3053}} then they can get a boost of health to have more health to survive with and then you can use lifesteal to heal back up. \n\nFor mages you have {{item:3157}}, {{item:3027}}, {{item:3152}}, {{item:3030}}, {{item:3151}}, {{item:3116}}. These items give you stacks of health to survive on which you can use to counteract aggressive plays. with a balance of ap and health\n\nMy point is, if you are a carry and you are getting one shot by lethality abusers. you build defensively, you play to counter the build. grab a {{item:3026}} and you get a free revive. And you keep going on about Mages and ADCs but not many that play supports or bruiser/tanks are having many problems with lethality. Do you know why? They build health items which help their stats and still give them survivability! Don't like the meta? then change it! I just started playing Rammus jungle and I have been rushing Ninja before Cinderhulk. Now I'm almost mastery level 7 and I am almost to my promos for Bronze IV! (I know it doesn't sound impressive but I started league last year) \n\nDon't like what I am suggesting people to do to fix the situation? then just leave this discussion board. I was just trying to have some fun criticizing players who don't try to look for a way to solve a situation whilst proposing alternatives to players who want to try to fix problems in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-03-21T00:39:28.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3152}}, {{item:3030}}, and to a slightly lesser extent {{item:3116}}, {{item:3157}}  and {{item:3027}} are all quite situational items that few mages can take advantage of.\n\nMany mages want to _avoid_ being in range to use the first two.  Rylai's has weak stats for a lot of mages, and some can't make good use of the slow.  It doesn't even give all that much health.  Rod of Ages require 10 minutes to stack up, crippling the early mid-game for many mages for whom that is their peak phase.\n\nI'm actually not too bothered by lethality myself, but I am tired of people acting like mages have great defensive itemization.  Zhonya's is the only one that mages can commonly get, but even putting that in their builds can reduce their damage by quite a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Otter Fire","date":"2017-03-21T00:51:26.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't use the hextech aggressively, they are meant to reposition. And any mage can run any of them. People are too reluctant to give up a little AP for more survivability.

I'm generally fine with lethality champions even when I'm playing regular mages.\n\nMages do need a ton of AP though.  The biggest advantage AP has over AD is that you can generally get a lot more AP than AD.  If you build two of those items you listed, you're likely to lose out on 100+ AP (unless it's ROA, but that's highly delayed power).\n\nOh and if a mage drops too far down in AP, the assassin will just finish the rest of the tankiness off with a couple 100% ad scaling auto attacks while the mage is incapable of killing the assassin.\n\nAgain, I'm generally fine, but I can understand the frustration.","replies":[{"poster":"Otter Fire","date":"2017-03-21T01:37:38.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't saying that you should build all of the listed item, I am just criticizing players who have a problem with the meta and refuse to think of alternatives for themselve. \n\nBuilding just one item that give you health should be just enough to prevent getting one shot so frequently. \n\nWhile you and I share different approaches to this meta, we at least are having a meaningful conversation in my opinion","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-03-21T05:37:52.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I find these conversations interesting.
