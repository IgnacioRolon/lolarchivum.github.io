It would once in a while play up and I would just restart my router and it would go back to normal. Now, however, I cant play league without AT THE VERY LEAST, a 150 ms connection. Bearing in mind that around 50 is my perfect no lag connection, 150 is a lot, especially when that 150 goes sky rocketing up to 2000 and higher. What my question is, is why? Can riot look into my account and see if anything is there? It cant possibly be anything to do with my internet, because its been working for over 3 months perfectly up until now. Ill be honest I did a very stupid thing and clicked a link someone sent me for a free skin ( I new it was a scam I'm just an idiot ) and they got into my account. I changed my password quickly like a boss, so no problems right? But I'm pretty sure it was ever since then ive been lagging. Again, this is why I would want riot to look into it. ( P.s, Ive read the article on how not to lag in league, and nothing worked for me. I use gamebooster, which doesn't do jack sh*t and I turn off all downloads and other devices IN MY WHOLE ROOM. I don't even have any pages open except for league and skype which is permanently open. ) Please someone help me, I cant play with this lag. Also, if there is a way to contact riot support and actually talk with a help line, ill definitely do that. Thank you for reading this much ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T22:46:10.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be an issue with your network having problems maintaining a strong connection, but it could also be how your ISP is routing to reach our servers.
