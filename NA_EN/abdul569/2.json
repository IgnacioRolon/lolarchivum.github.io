Use electric type and grass type pokemon when facing her while avoiding fire types. \r\nGood choices: {{champion:85}}  {{champion:143}}  Bad Choices:{{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} \r\n\r\nB: A grass type. Unlike A, fire and ice types as well as poison types are really good against her but water types and rock types are a big nono.\r\nGood: {{champion:69}} {{champion:34}} Bad: {{champion:54}} {{champion:267}} \r\n\r\nC: Flying type: Use electric and rock types versus this form while avoiding fighting and grass types\r\nGood: {{champion:85}} {{champion:163}}  Bad: {{champion:64}} {{champion:57}} \r\n\r\nD: Fire type. Fire types are weak to ground and rock type champions while strong against ice, bug and steel\r\nGood: {{champion:33}} {{champion:268}}  Bad: {{champion:121}} {{champion:82}}\r\n\r\nE: A Dark type. Use Fairy type and fighting type attacks. Avoid Psychic types as they have no affect on her. Also has good resistance vs dark types\r\nGood: {{champion:2}} {{champion:117}}  Bad:{{champion:238}}  {{champion:56}} \r\n\r\nF: Psychic Type. Ghost types are super effective along with dark types. Don&#039;t use fighting types or poison.\r\nGood: {{champion:30}} {{champion:429}} Bad: {{champion:27}}  {{champion:59}} \r\n\r\nG: Seems like a dual type of rock/fire. Best types are water and ground. Avoid using fire and normal types as you only deal 1/4 and 1/2 damage respectavely.\r\nGood: {{champion:72}} {{champion:223}}  Bad: {{champion:119}} {{champion:115}} \r\n\r\nH: Electric Type. This one is tough as her only weakness is ground type.  Flying types are not advised when fighting her.\r\nGood: {{champion:421}} {{champion:3}} Bad: {{champion:133}} {{champion:161}} \r\n\r\nI: Fairy Type. Use poison and steel types. avoid dragon types as they deal no damage to her\r\nGood: {{champion:17}} {{champion:53}} Bad: {{champion:136}} {{champion:102}} \r\n\r\nJ: Finally the ice type. Best choice would be Fire and Fighting. Grass and Flying will have trouble though\r\nGood: {{champion:10}} {{champion:89}} Bad: {{champion:40}} {{champion:266}} \r\n\r\nFinal Note: Riot has nnot announced it but it may seem like almost all of the Lux&#039;s forms will be dual types with psychic as their 2nd type. In which case I would look at F for what to use.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-11-08T21:07:11.529+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love that you did this, there are more than a few pokemon fans on the team and yeah champion types is a regular conversation >:P","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-11-08T23:47:22.448+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So of what type will be next champion?
