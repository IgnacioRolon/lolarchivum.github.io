Something to help with towers","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think we all can agree that towers are pretty bad. So I was thinking of an item that can help buff then if you build it. Now bear with me on this, it is pretty unique idea and has augmentations so you can choose what your towers do.\n\nFirst of all the build path {{item:3105}} +{{item:2053}} +300 gold (total 3k) +500 gold for augmentation (total 3.5k)\nStats: 40 armour, 25 mr, +250% hp regen , +200hp\nUnique passive: legion grants nearby allies 10mr\nUnique Passive: increases ms when moving towards a turret\n\nNot very impressive at the moment, right? But for 500 more gold you can augment this item for a bonus effect. \nPassives in **bold** can&#039;t be team stacked ie. having 5 team members with the same augmentation will only grant the effect of having 1 person with that augmentation.\n_ Italic_ means that it is an active augment.\nnormal writing means it is a passive but can be team stacked (having 5 members with the same item augment means the passive is 5 times as strong)\nApart from the actives, this item affects all ally turrets\nFinal note: You can&#039;t have more than 1 of this item per team member (like jungle items)\n\nOnto the augmentations!\n\n**Unique Passive: shockwave** - when the turret fires a missile, also sends a shockwave that does aoe dmg to the surrounding area equal to 1/4 of the missile damage\nComment: This helps with the massive minion waves when your turret is just focusing 1 minion at a time.\nEdit: might become an active which is global and cd is 1 min but shockwaves last for 30 sec\n\n**Unique Passive: Plunder-** For every minion killed by the turret, add 3 gold to the &#039;bank&#039;. Upon destruction, the bank is depleted and team members gain an equal share of what was in the bank\nComment: helps losing team gain something back. also since turrets get easily destoyed, there won&#039;t be much in the bank for destroying consecutive turrets\n\n_Unique Active: Revive_ - (5 min cd) Revive an ally turret with half hp\ncomment: something like azir passive but longer cd. doesn&#039;t work with enemy dead turrets\nEdit: clear rules must be set such as only 1 revive per turret/game or that this item only works on inhibs\n\nUnique Passive: rapid fire- increase turret attack speed by 10%\ncomment: can be team stacked so 5 members with this augment means 50% bonus attack speed\n\n_Unique Passive: Void Summon_ - choose a ally turret and make it a portal for voidlings (lasts for 2 min, 3 min cd)\ncomment: you can also buy portal and have loads of voidlings! only works on 1 turret at a time per person (so you can&#039;t have 1 turret bearing 5 voidlings at a time but you can have 5 seperate turrets each with this active on them) Note: useless when all your turrets are dead\n\n**Unique Passive: Last Chance** - For every ally turret + inhibs dead, reduce death timers by 2 seconds\nComment: All 11 turrets and 3 inhibs gone? that&#039;s a 28 sec death timer reduction. Does not team stack so you can&#039;t have instant revives. RIP Revive summoner spell. (but if it&#039;s that stage then you are unlikely to win)\n\n**Unique Passive: Power comes with age** - every minute, towers gain 100 max hp, 10 attack, 1 armour and 1 mr. \nEdit: Probably gonna be a 10 min cap of 1k hp, 100 attack, 10 armour, 1 mr (like ROA)\ncomment: you need to buy this item first b4 the towers slowly grow more powerful. Maybe towers become too powerful in hour long games so numbers may be tweaked or have a cap? (if someone buys this augment at 20 minutes and the game goes on for an hour that would mean towers have 40k more hp and 400 attack.....so a cap is most likely needed)\n\nUnique Passive: Shield -Upon receiving damage under the tower from a champion allies under the tower receive a 200 hp shield (30 sec cd). stackable so 5 team members with this gain 1k shield.\nEdit: someone said shield may be too strong so possibly have 200 base +50 per person with this augment\n\nPros:\nstronger towers!\ndifferent combination of aumentations (I added several augmentations so if it does turn into an item, as unlikely as that is,  some can be scrapped)\nUnique\n\nCons:\nMay become the must have item\nToo stong towers? doubt it but it is possible\ntowers too weak still? yeah possible\nNo one buys it - may take time for people to use like the zzrot portal\n\nTLDR: a 3k item with alright tank stats that you can augment for 500 gold more for bonus effects on your towers. \n\nHope people upvote this and comment on possible other augmentations and ideas plus feedback","replies":[{"poster":"V The Support V","date":"2016-03-29T17:30:20.563+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No Ideas, just.....\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"abdul569","date":"2016-03-29T18:55:32.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=V The Support V,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=o2nE2AmE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-29T17:30:20.563+0000)\n>\n> No Ideas, just.....\n> \n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nthanks! had this idea for a while now so decided to share","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"anikay","date":"2016-03-30T06:09:42.234+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, an item that grants Armor, MR, and HP is too slot efficient just in general as it allows defense against all types of damage wrapped up in one neat package.\n\nIf you'll notice there are no items that grant all three of these stats in the game. (Excluding Guardian's Horn)\nThere's a reason for this.\n\nThat said the stat efficiency is rather poor on its own which may PARTIALLY make up for it being extremely slot efficient.\nOnly taking raw stats (for the owner) into account you have: 40 AR, 35 MR, 250% HR, 200 HP\n40 AR = 800g\n35 MR = 630g\n250%  = 750g\n200hp = 533g\nTotal is = 2713\nMeaning the point runner passive is valued at 287 gold whereas it is valued at 25g on a raptor cloak.\n\nBut now we get to the REAL problem with this item.\nIt doesn't fit any one niche, I note that you point out certain effects can stack and therefore encourage multiple members on a team to buy said item.\nHowever this is the exact OPPOSITE of what we want to do.\n\nMaking an item that has super great utility, some decent defense stats and stacking effects just means that players will simply find the best combo of passives and then all 5 members will buy the item; cutting down build diversity.\nYou've basically made a better alternative to Guardian Angel with this item as it is.\n\nPlaying support? The Aegis makes the build path easy and good for you, rush the Age enchantment after SS.\n\nPlaying top? Rush the Bank enchantment starting with whichever item is best for your lane.\n\nPlaying mid? Probably not something to rush but grabbing the Shockwave enchantment second will allow your entire team to start roaming (including you) because nobody can shove hard enough to take your turrets.\n\nPlaying ADC? You might forego this item the entire game, but it gives such great utility and it's better than GA in raw stats; you'll probably buy it some games.\n\nPlaying Jung? It's really dependent upon which Jungler you're playing tbh. I could see somebody like Kha completely ignoring this item but J4, Sej, Zac, Elise, Lee, Eve, Mundo, etc. would most assuredly purchase it at some point.\n\nSo in every game you've got 3/5 at least, 4/5 most often, and 5/5 on occasion.\n\nWhile I like the concept behind the item I feel it could be significantly improved upon by changing the build path, stats, and giving the item a specific niche.\n\nThe other slightly smaller problem I have with this item is that it caters heavily toward defensive play. (If everybody on both teams buy it then it actually promotes very aggressive turret pushing and probably splitpushing.) Meaning if your team stacks up on these you're probably just going to play a very slow wave clear game and hold out until late. \n\nThe other reason to purchase this item (and this is the idea I REALLY like) is if you have a heavy teamfight team and they're constantly trying to avoid that by splitting. Combine this with an Ohmwrecker and you've got a tank that's waiting for the splitter to show his face before diving into a 4v5 under turret...and that's cool.\n\nAnyway, good high level concept.\nPoorly put together imo.\nPlease reply to my post and we can soundboard some more ideas!\n\nI'm out!{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"abdul569","date":"2016-03-30T13:46:34.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"some really nice consturctive feedback. I will try to answer some problems and my thoughts on some points.\nStats: my initial thoughts was have RC as a base item but the problem was what do I have next in its build. don't want another armour hp item nor do i think it should be armour ap. other option was make another portal type build but that would be too similar and then portal won't be chosen at all since for 800 more you get better item?  Plus I kinda wanted it to be expensive so that adcs won't insta rush this or ap mages since for 3500 gold i'd rather get a zohnya than this or statiks and boots. feel like this is more a top/tanky sup item maybe even jungler getting one too.\n\nThe problem of everyone getting it: I did put that in the con section when evaluating the item. tbh not sure how to counter this other than gut the stats but that would mean making the item worse than the components since getting the item is basically 5 more mr +25% more hp regen plus an extra slot for 300 more gold basically so not much stat improvement. only item i could think of that does that to an extent is{{item:3003}} where it loses the 1mana/8 passive or RG where it loses the hp/mana on lvl up.\n\nI also thought bout ohmwrecker. might actually become a viable item if this comes about so thanks for pointing that out!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2016-03-29T18:55:23.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like a cool idea,  but I would defintely scrap the revive augment.

Maybe make it a global so a sup can defend top turret while your top laner is helping gank bot or if mids about to get a massive 5v5 and bot lane is getting pushed against you, you need to protect it but still don't want to leave your team to clear. Others such as plunder won't need to become an active i reckon.\n\n2nd point: i was thinking like the jungle items you could switch the augment for some gold cost. However there is some clear rules to this: actives' are on cd like when you change trinkets you have wait to use it. so this item won't be too useless when turrets are gone but not too powerful so that you can instantly change to revive and save the nexus by reviving a turret late game\n\n3rd Point: Yes revive must have some rules. Guess 1 revive per turret per game i guess or that only works on inhibs so the enemy has to destroy it again for super minions to come.\n\n4th point: Last chance is really powerful but in most cases 1 team has lost almost all turrets while the other has lost 1 or 2 so the winning team won't benefit as much. In long drawn out battles I guess I would presume 1 member on each team has one of this augment. (like how almost everyone has GA in very long battles so I don't really think this is much of an issue)\n\n5th point: As I said in the comment there must be a cap on PCWA and numbers can be tweaked. Also Shield numbers may be big, yes. how about base 200 + 50 per member who has this augment. I also don't see this being much of an issue as you can get a poke in, wait for shield to pop then dive as the shield takes 30 cd to come back again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Munisylc","date":"2016-03-30T15:49:01.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks really good man!\n\nAs it goes, for more tower abilities, why not have:\n\n- **Frost Touch:** The tower's attacks slow enemy attack and movement speeds by 20% for 1 second\nWe can even allow it to stack, with the tower's ability changing to \"stuns the target for .5 seconds\" if all 5 champions get this upgrade.

You could cap the amount of gold spent per champion, per turret, or both in order to lighten the load on supports (who would be forced to purchase anything like this to help their team, whether it be directly upgrading the turret or through an item)\n\nThe upgrades could also change the appearance of turrets in order to have good visual representation on how it has been modified.
