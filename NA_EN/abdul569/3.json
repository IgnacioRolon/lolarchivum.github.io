The only champions that would have their power shifted by this benefit are ones with long-ranged skill shots that don't already have special FoV alterations built in (e.g. Xerath and Jhin ultimates). Draven and Jinx ultimates might become easier to use, and long range snipes with Jhin's W that would otherwise be just off screen would be more reliable, but that's all I can think of.\n\nChampions are designed to operate within the given FoV window that you see in-game, and letting players see just beyond that window wouldn't be game breaking. It would just put more information at the forefront of a player's mind if they aren't in the habit of keeping the minimap in mind and using freecam regularly.\n\nKeep in mind that when I hear \"let us zoom out more\" what I have in my mind is something to the effect of seeing a half-inch (or centimeter) in any direction beyond the FoV of current default zoom at the very most, just because I feel like on-screen visuals feel a little cramped with the area where I'm interacting with the playing field. I don't want an expansive cinematic bird's-eye overhead of my lane, just a little more distance between where UI elements are and where I'm pointing and clicking the most.

This is a suggestion for improvement, not meant to make the game perfect for everyone, and the hypothetical people you cite who would not be pleased still would be happy over increasing the FOV, they just want it to be farther out still so they would get an improvement.

There are times and places on the map where I could be playing Caitlyn and my auto attack range is outside of my field of vision when I have the screen locked on my champion. Sometimes I'm able to position my screen correctly but there are other times where I am just too slow. I know that good players don't suffer from this issue and I will certainly get better about it but I think that at least the auto attack ranges should be within view of the champion so we don't have to unlock the screen for us bad players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2017-05-26T15:07:44.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should make a keyboard button that allows you to zoom out as a toggle just like jhin's ultimate (maybe not that far since is not necessary), so that you can use cait's ult, kog's ult, varus Q when you are red side, zac E, and a bunch of other offscreen stuff that need just for a little while to have the camera zoomed out without the need to unlock the camera for a second and then lock it again (the Y button is bugged as hell since i can remember, since i have to spam it and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes i have to alt tab and then reselect the game icon to make it work properly, and also sometimes it locks/unlocks by itself without me pressing anything) or just to gather more informations (hp/mana bars status, cooldowns, number of people) of what's happening near you without having to drag for a second the minimap cam there where the action is happening before getting there.\nIt would be exactly like hotkeying a group of units or a building like starcraft, it would just reduce the amounts of uncomfortable clicks one must do to perform a very basic action.\n\nIt wouldn't change literally anything balance wise and it would be just comfortable to use. (also back then when my pc broke i had to play on several different monitors and i noticed that the camera angle and zoom changes according to both the resolution in game and the screen's size, never understood why)\n\nAlso as a jungler it would be awesome if we could macro the movements like in starcraft so that i don't have to perform 4 clicks, wait for the character to move the distance and then perform the next click while i wish i could use that time to look around the map and maybe i accidentally walk across mid since the pathing decided that i was 1 pixel wrong from the pathing i was thinking of, it happened to me a couple of times and it was pretty frustrating, i've been wishing for this since i can't even remember, weird nobody thought if it already...)\n\n~~Also let us start the game with the camera already locked if we selected so since 0.25/10 games i trinket the fountain and i don't have the ward to scout where the enemy jungler starts~~","replies":[]}]}
