She's this evel sexy demon monster and when the first impression ingame is a cartoon animation, it really doesn't deliver.\n\nBut here's a suggestion instead:\nIf Evelynn uses the 'joke' emote on the fountain, she gets this animation. This way, you can keep the meme alive while still delivering on her theme.\n\n(I came up with this idea by comparing her in my mind to Vel'koz how he could've had such a walk too, and then it made me think of his \"oh darn\" emote. It's nice to have a funny animation possible on even a supposedly cool/scary champ, but it shouldn't be part of the standard play pattern. Hence my suggestion. Make it possible, just not happening every game.)","replies":[{"poster":"AwesomeGuyDj","date":"2017-10-18T23:25:32.607+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just let her toggle it like with the toggle button like the dongers swagger walk","replies":[{"poster":"LordForrest","date":"2017-10-19T10:02:46.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But didn't they break his swag walk when they changed his passive? or did that get fixed?","replies":[{"poster":"morris1","date":"2017-10-19T15:27:30.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its interaction with the passive is very weird but he can still toggle between them by emoting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"needHymn","date":"2017-10-18T06:23:05.972+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riddarn","date":"2017-10-18T06:27:59.431+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=needHymn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ojpjB4Kr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-18T06:23:05.972+0000)\n>\n> Because her lashers aren&#x27;t supposed to be flippers.\n\nShe was obviously trying to seduce a duck.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-18T19:27:27.235+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who could blame her?
