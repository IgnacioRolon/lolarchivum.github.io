I never knew the enemy sees them adding to the fear factor of their impending doom. kudos to rito for adding this effect. He is badass already and this just puts the icing on the cake!\r\n\r\nand for those wondering why I didn&#039;t find out this sooner:\r\n\r\na) I&#039;m the one normally playing urgot so I didn&#039;t know the enemy sees the chains on their screen\r\nb) most videos of urgot are from the perspective of urgot, not the victim (including his champ spotlight).\r\nc) When I&#039;m not urgot top, I&#039;m normally a tank player so i&#039;m not a priority when it comes to who he ults at.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-09-03T18:30:46.947+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is really doing a great job with these newly added features for champs.\nWarwick and the sound that plays if you are hunted work well at inducing fear, too.\n\nI hope to see more stuff like that in the future, it is great getting the feeling of being a true monster on the battlefield.","replies":[{"poster":"MeBuffULongTime","date":"2017-09-04T02:19:24.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally, the first time I heard the new sound effect for Warwick I was freaked out lol.
