I currently have frontier fios 150mbps and am forced to rent there router which is an arris nvg468mq. My friend recently got a new router and said I could have his used  nighthawk x6 r8000 for $35. Basically just want to see if it would make a big difference in wifi speed/range. I&#039;m currently in a 2 bedroom 2 story town home and with the router I have being right next to it shows about 140mbps in speed while the downstairs a lot of times dips down to like 30. Would the nighthawk help the range at all I&#039;m not in a big place at all and was kind of expecting the whole place to test over 100 when I got this new internet. Thanks!","replies":[]}
