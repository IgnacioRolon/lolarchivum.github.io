But if you want that +1 in the win column, you gotta be a leader and keep your team going!\n\nYes but 4v5 only works if your team is clearly better then the enemy team... that is if the MMR of the players do not reflect the actual player skill.  However in theory the matches are SUPPOSED to be even... or meaning that both sides \"power\" is the same.  If you take away one of them (especially from the start) you are behind by definition.  Unless you play far above your MMR it is not possible to win by mathematics.\n\n\nCase in Point:  LCS.  Would a LCS team be able to win if 4v5?  Well perhaps if your Team SoloMid or CounterLogic Gaming vs last place team.  But I highly doubt that, in an even MMR (or in this case LCS standings) situations, lets say Fnatic vs Elements... that if one of them AFKed that they wouldn't stand a chance.  Just because something is THEORTICALLY \"possible\" doesn't make it likely, nor relevant.  Because the universe has the 1 in 1000000000000000000000000000+ chance of randomly self-destructing at any point in time doesn't mean it is going to happen ever.\n\nNor, for the purposes of more casual LoL play, does it mean that I should have to tolerate AFKing on such a frequent (20%+ of games... amazingly 90% of the time on my side only) basis.  Some of the AFKing situation is due to load-in errors that is RIOT's fault with recent releases.  Rest are usually people with bad interent connections, that in theory, shouldn't be playing LoL in the first place.\n\n\nANd if you are in Bronze... of course this is far more likely to ruin your day then anything else.  With the \"soft resets\" of S5 and formally S4 Gold/Silver being placed into B3 matches... well that just ruins your day.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Protestorc","date":"2015-02-11T18:50:13.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what i thought when i read your poem.\n\nBronze problems that no one can fix\nI have a problem that only I can fix\nstart practicing and stop receiving dicks\nIf my team rages what can I do?\nI should simply improve and stop being a noob?\n\nWhy yes, of course I'm upset\nWhenever I join solo queue, I regret\nthe choices I make\nBut I don't take time to fix my mistakes.\n\n\"But maybe just one more game\", I pray\nonce again I'm doing it the same awy\n\"Don't give up\" they tell me\nGive up?

However this is the first time I've actually complained on the forums lol XD. You are right though, I do play seriously( which probably means that norms isn't for me to play all the time). This poem was written to blow off a lot of steam (it's been stored up as that is the person I am) since I tipped. \nUnfortunately I'm not the guy that everyone hates (unfortunately for you ^^), but I am glad you noticed my ridiculous poem xD. I also really don't care what rank I am either, I don't even understand how lp works xD. \nI'll give you a brief explanation since the vibe I'm getting from you is,\"Oh great, another stupid bronze scrub\"\n\nFirst is the introductory stanza asking if you can solve this universal problem.\nSecond, This is the part where I blow off some steam as I was in a depressive state, it says that I regret joining solo queue sometimes\nThird, It's my mentality whenever I join. Whenever I join queue it's hard for me to motivate myself to play, as usually people will argue in chat or rage in-game and such.\nFourth, Whenever I take a break and come back to play, I usually run into ragers who penalize and rage at the small mistakes I make. They usually always blame me or \"turn their teeth\" to bare against me.\nFifth, This is confusing to you in that while people do make mistakes it's like learning is hard for people. Whether it be fear to try the methods they have seen or just the disregard to try new things.\nSixth, It'd be nice for a change for people to mix and match their own playstyles, not with a certain champ, but in general( like whether you're a passive-aggressive player or an aggressive player straight up)\nSeventh, This stanza explains that it isn't fun when people feed and I constantly have to run since I can easily get one shot.\nEighth, This stanza follows the seventh in that while I don't like feeders, I myself can be a feeder sometimes( as I am not even pro). It also expresses that I miss the old days back in Urf and wayyy back when where op fought op.\nNinth-ish+ that one line that doesn't fit with Riven, This is an expression that is pretty self explanatory, no offense to Riot( you guys are pretty cool people), I say Riven since the stereotype for many Riven players is extreme bravado.\nTenth, This is the end of the steaming, and redirects the blame to people like you and me who could argue forever xD and rage and flame. \n\nSo in the end I don't mind noobs, or boosters(you can explain what those are later, Idk what those are :P), or trolls, or flamers( even a little toxicity is good, only a little though). I just want to enjoy myself without having to ignore these problems.
