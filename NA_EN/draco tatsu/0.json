But when i force Vsync it does not seem to work, my FPS remains high in-game and only the limiter takes effect causing tearing. I tried forcing Vsync without limiter and it does not enable in-game. Does Vysnc only work in-game in League of Legends?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-02T05:38:52.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Dboss9!\n\nFrom reading your explanation of what you are talking about, it may be related to the \"smooth\" camera option due to the high FPS that the game is running at.

And when i cap fps at 60 i get screen tearing which is odd considering that when vsync is enabled it caps at 60 O_o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draco Tatsu","date":"2014-12-02T14:16:07.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for the response!

This equates to 60 Frames Per Second. Anything over 60FPS means your screen is getting more frames a second than it can refresh at, thus it causes strange artifacts such as \"screen tearing\" and desynchronisation.\n\nIf you're running at 60Hz, stick on VSync - you'll be capped at 60FPS which will ensure they are in sync (Hence the name vertical sync :-P)\n\nHaving higher FPS than refresh rate is entirely useless, it may sound cool to have 150FPS but really it's doing nothing other than causing issues beyond 60FPS :-)\n\ntl;dr: This happens, use VSync.","replies":[{"poster":"Draco Tatsu","date":"2014-12-02T14:21:20.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for the response! Yea I thought it could have to do with this, but my issue with Vsync currently is that on the new rift I am experiencing big fps drops that I believe are tied to champion ablities, and so when Vsync is enabled fps drops are very noticale as it goes from 60 to below 60 (40 or so). Compared to when Vsync is disabled the drop is not noticeable because fps is much higher than monitor refresh rate, or at least that's my theory lol. But Vsync does work on dominion and Aram.","replies":[]}]}]}
