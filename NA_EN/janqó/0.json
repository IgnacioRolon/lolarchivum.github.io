She could still have that one shot potential, but at least she won&#039;t be able to spam her abilities. Also consider there being a cooldown for her spell thief ability after using it. I think nerfing her damage would be better BUT  she could probably just end up one shotting a squishy anyways so this is probably just an alternative.\n\nEDIT: Also maybe make her sleepy trouble bubble a smaller skillshot, making it a bit harder to hit since its a really strong ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-01-23T08:54:05.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerf her Q damage and remove the trap from E. There, she's semi-balanced now.","replies":[{"poster":"Janqó","date":"2018-01-23T14:28:10.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well her main source of damage comes from Q, so if it is to be more balanced, it would probably need to get really nerfed. Although for the sleepy bubble trouble, making its radius smaller could make her more reliant on skill? (not sure, a friend recommended the idea that she is gated by skill and not mana)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-23T05:48:33.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from what i see, one shotting a squishy isn't a prob... it's how early she does it\n\n\nI like the mana scaling ult idea, although it would have to be like half the amount of scaling since it does no damage","replies":[{"poster":"Janqó","date":"2018-01-23T14:26:06.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, i realized that flaw so i added a maybe consider because I wasn't sure if it would be the greatest of ideas to add a scaling ability that does no damage","replies":[]}]}]}
