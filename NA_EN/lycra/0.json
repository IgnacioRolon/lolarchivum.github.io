This could be a routing issue, ISP issue, etc.  It's tricky to say without having more specific information.\n\nI'd recommend taking a look at our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article and go through those steps as a first step (particularly the packet loss section).  If you're still having the lag and disconnects, go ahead and [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll take a deeper look.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienSky","date":"2016-03-26T11:11:03.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a pc and have the same problems as the mac users","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AlienSky","date":"2016-03-26T11:10:22.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not using a mac and it still happens (fps drop, laggy sound).

As a result, many people find team fights as still images, since so many audio files are playing at once (about 5x the normal amount) fps drops to only a few frames (single digit numbers) and makes the game unplayable. \n\nThe bug is completely tied to audio playing multiple times as disabling all sounds fixes the problem. But I am not about to play ranked without sound. So I go back to leaning the f2p champs in normals until this is fixed. \n\nThis has been a problem in both 6.6 and 6.7. I don't know if Riot changed anything related to rendering audio in 6.6, but whatever was done needs to be fixed. I await your solution Riot.
