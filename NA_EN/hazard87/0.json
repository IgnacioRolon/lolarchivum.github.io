I have been playing for less than a year after a couple years of DOTA.  I don&#039;t know if everyone else is experiencing this, but it seems that every game since early to mid December has been one team with 30 kills, the other team with 5 kills.  At first it was fun to be on the winning team with scores like that, but it is getting old.  It is boring when I win, and frustrating when I lose.  \r\n\r\nIs this something that happens with LoL every year?  I understand matches like this from time to time, but every single match has been like that.  When I look through my match history, the last 20 games the winning team has had, at minimum, 4x the amount of kills as the losing team.  At 12 to 3 that doesn&#039;t feel to bad, but at 20 minutes in the /ff comes out because one team has 40 kills and the other team is still trying to hit double digits.  These are not fun games to have all the time, regardless of what side I am on.\r\n\r\nDoes Riot reserve an MMR type matchmaking system for ranked players only?  I don&#039;t want to play ranked since I like playing with my friends and brother, and I don&#039;t want to have to worry about throwing a game and costing them LP or anything like that.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-04T01:08:59.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This season is particularly stupid (autofill, MMR reset, broken matchmaking), and preseason/end-of-season are always full of low expectations, sadness, feeders, people in the wrong ELO, people who have given up, new players, matchmaking glitches, smurfs and failure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KilikOdagawa","date":"2017-01-04T00:56:32.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you elaborate a bit more on what you mean by reserving an MMR system for ranked? If that means that they are completely separate queues with their own individual MMR, then you would be correct. Normal MMR and Ranked MMR do not influence each other. (As far as I'm aware)\n\nAround this time of year, the only time we get to see Winter Rift, there are a lot of extremely good players mixing in with the usual hodge-podge of people who traditionally play normals. Based upon my 2016 review, I spent 86% of my games in Ranked queues, however, having the chance to see Winter Rift has pulled me INTO normals and away from my usual games. \n\nNormal Draft as far as I'm aware, is Winter Rift compatible, so you should be able to play the Draft style without costing your mates anything. \n\nI hope I've explained well enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Hazard87","date":"2017-01-04T01:08:03.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering if they just did not use an MMR system for norms, or if MMR for both norms and ranked were reverted.  I did not realize ranked games did not have access to the winter rift.  I hope you are right, and when it goes away the matches will balance out.","replies":[]}]}]}
