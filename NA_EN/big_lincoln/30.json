This kind of idea has already proven to be either too strong or absolutely awful with no in-between {{champion:72}} {{champion:82}} ; why are you taking it a step further and giving her bonuses based on which dragon spawns? \r\n\r\nWith 3 mountain drakes Shyvana can solo Baron and Elder drake with almost no damage taken, as well as being able to tear down turrets without minion waves. The 20% reduction from monsters via passive combined with the 30% bonus true damage to monsters makes her one of the strongest splitpushers. She will have some of the fastest objective-killing in the game, to boot. \r\n\r\n3 Infernals will have the same effect on her damage in teamfights; with 10% of her damage becoming true, she will shred through any champion even harder than she already does. \r\n\r\nOcean giving her CDR will mess with builds and rune pages; especially an uneven number like 15. Something similar was tried with Cassiopeia&#039;s first rework and it proved to make her builds less flexible and more frustrating. It&#039;s not necessary.\r\n\r\nAir Drake is the least offensive, but slow resistance is a powerful stat right now. \r\n\r\ntl;dr I&#039;m surprised this passive is even being considered. Riot even knows that making her reliant on this would make her too feast or famine. But making her not NEED the buffs like she currently does just creates one of the strongest win-more mechanics in the game.

Many champs have CDR overkill issues at the moment, but it would be generally a waste on Shyv, probably.\n\n> Objectives are the most dynamic part of the game. Controlling them factors in warding, power spikes, positioning and minion waves. Why wouldn&#x27;t you double down on that?\n\nPretty much for this reasoning exactly. They are an important factor in the game. And you build overkill on those, you get champions like Skarner and items like Ohmwrecker. Skarner is a perfectly capable champion in his own right without his energy spires, and the addition of those bring him up to an overboard state in some cases, until you learn to avoid his spires. Then he's simply zoning the map, but not truly tearing up the enemy team alone, so he appears to be healthy. It's throwing off players' playstyles to the point that counterplay measures are not accurately shown by game data. He has the second-highest win-rate while also maintaining some of the lowest damage dealt, damage taken, and kill amounts in the game. In Shyv's case, game data will probably give insight to the situation, as every Shyv will be a ward-master and secure every possible dragon, but the global effect is still immense with this passive change.\n\nOhmwrecker, similarly, is absolute junk because it's meant to be an assassination item, but not meant to be overly abusive, and therefore simply open an enemy's tower for a few seconds, but give no damage to the gankers. Therefore, nobody wants to go for this early, not until they amass some damage. However, if they don't go for it early, the only general options are ever going to be go for it while snowballed ahead, or get it while the enemy is snowballed, where once again, the effects are abysmal. So, in short, the item is only viable in a short window early in the game, but will hold back your damage in that part of the game, and hold back your effectiveness. Similarly, Shyv won't feel a single effect from these dragons until she's already sauced a boatload with her allies on a few dragons. She'll get the buff when she doesn't need it to win, and she'll find it impossible to get when she needs it the most. That's the biggest problem.\n\n> This sounds to me like: &quot;don&#x27;t let his team get towers, don&#x27;t let him get farm&quot;. I mean, yeah, it&#x27;d work but it&#x27;s an impossible demand.\n\nWell, impossible in some games, possible or even probable in others, like Shyvana's proposed passives, which is exactly what OP was saying.\n\n> You are describing any champion with an ultimate here.\n\nNo, I'm talking about game field manipulation specifically, specifying that Shyv's/Morde's/Skarner's are a manipulation on a non-stable game factor, such as dragon presence and recharge times on spires, and similar to unit hop abilities, only the unit-hops are in a much more stable game factor, that being the locations of live units to hop to. Ultimates in general are not such manipulation abilities.\n\n> which makes this untrue [that an ability would be forced to be buffed substancially].\n\nIt is true. If a unit finds problems making reliable use out of their fenced area, like Skarner, that gets beefed into abusiveness, such as Skarner getting up to 120% MS, 160% AS, and 2% max mana regen *without duration* while in range of an active Spire. That is some crazy beef, and is only allowed because Riot assumes smart players will stay out of Skarner's area, so they can let him be crazy imposing. They don't note that the zone effect from this can be a conditional thing from game to game, and cause the game to snowball his direction quite consistently.\n\n> Yes. The game is centered around bot lane.\n\nIt would be if Shyvana was getting all her useful buffs there... I wouldn't gank top until I knew their jungler was leagues away from that dragon, and even then, I'd probably take it. I doubt anyone would do any different, because top simply isn't worth it when the benefits stack so high, hence seasons 4-5 and the seasons of top seclusion and no rift herald.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-11-14T19:47:41.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Terchio,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NbdAIsRY,comment-id=0016000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-14T10:33:00.854+0000)\n \n> Pretty much for this reasoning exactly.

Again, I don't see the problem with encouraging that. It seems to be just a consistent part as minion hopping.\n\nWithout the base stats to back him up, removing spires'd make Skaner's winrate drop. That seems obvious.\n>He has the second-highest win-rate while also maintaining some of the lowest damage dealt, damage taken, and kill amounts in the game. In Shyv&#x27;s case, game data will probably give insight to the situation, as every Shyv will be a ward-master and secure every possible dragon, but the global effect is still immense with this passive change.\n\nThe low amount of damage dealt and taken is somewhat unsurprising. He's a jungler and his teamfight presence if focused on his ult and CC.\n> Ohmwrecker, similarly, is absolute junk because it&#x27;s meant to be an assassination item, but not meant to be overly abusive, and therefore simply open an enemy&#x27;s tower for a few seconds, but give no damage to the gankers. Therefore, nobody wants to go for this early, not until they amass some damage. However, if they don&#x27;t go for it early, the only general options are ever going to be go for it while snowballed ahead, or get it while the enemy is snowballed, where once again, the effects are abysmal. So, in short, the item is only viable in a short window early in the game, but will hold back your damage in that part of the game, and hold back your effectiveness. \n\nI feel it's more because there are better options for diving during that time period. Champs like Mundo or Tahm could go for the health damage scaling e.g.\n>Similarly, Shyv won&#x27;t feel a single effect from these dragons until she&#x27;s already sauced a boatload with her allies on a few dragons. \n\nBut does she notice her current passive is the question. Or do the few trades she wins, the few extra seconds in teamfights mean too little?\n>She&#x27;ll get the buff when she doesn&#x27;t need it to win, and she&#x27;ll find it impossible to get when she needs it the most. That&#x27;s the biggest problem.\n> \n> Well, impossible in some games, possible or even probable in others, like Shyvana&#x27;s proposed passives, which is exactly what OP was saying.\n\nHonestly, I don't know. A game where you secure 0 dragons sounds very improbable to me (unless you got stomped or you stomped and neglected drk because of it). Especially on a powerfarmer like Shyv.\n> No, I&#x27;m talking about game field manipulation specifically, specifying that Shyv&#x27;s/Morde&#x27;s/Skarner&#x27;s are a manipulation on a non-stable game factor, such as dragon presence and recharge times on spires, and similar to unit hop abilities, only the unit-hops are in a much more stable game factor, that being the locations of live units to hop to. Ultimates in general are not such manipulation abilities.\n\nRumble ult and other AoE ults gain a lot strength and reliability if you fight in the jungle but I suppose they have other uses too, albeit lesser ones.\n> It is true. If a unit finds problems making reliable use out of their fenced area, like Skarner, that gets beefed into abusiveness, such as Skarner getting up to 120% MS, 160% AS, and 2% max mana regen *without duration* while in range of an active Spire. \n\n>That is some crazy beef, and is only allowed because Riot assumes smart players will stay out of Skarner&#x27;s area, so they can let him be crazy imposing.\n\nThere is no way that's the reason. It's more likely they want his base stats and damage to have predictable spikes. Only yes, targeted CC is strong in its own right.\n> They don&#x27;t note that the zone effect from this can be a conditional thing from game to game, and cause the game to snowball his direction quite consistently.\n> \n> It would be if Shyvana was getting all her useful buffs there... I wouldn&#x27;t gank top until I knew their jungler was leagues away from that dragon, and even then, I&#x27;d probably take it. I doubt anyone would do any different, because top simply isn&#x27;t worth it when the benefits stack so high, hence seasons 4-5 and the seasons of top seclusion and no rift herald.\n\nTbf, Shyv jungle rarely ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2016-11-15T18:22:22.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of these are minuscule redirections on what was said, and I'm tired of feeding the monster.

His base stats are already some of the highest in the game, especially for a champion based around CC like you claim. Then you turn around and give him the game's 2nd highest AS boost, behind Elise and tied with Evelynn (both only 3 seconds), you give him the game's highest movement speed burst, bar none, and they give him Evelynn's Mana Regen passive on top, with no durations to worry about, all on a passive. This is not \"beefing up his stats\". This is outright making him a guard dog on a leash, which people are apparently figuring out. He doesn't need to actually deal damage to be effective because nobody will be crazy enough to be caught out in his circle.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-11-16T04:02:26.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fighters are usually absurdly powerful if you get within range of them though.

With his CC, he shouldn't have some of the game's highest bases *and* steroids. They gave him that much power with a control kit because they literally wanted him to be a guard dog, nothing less. It has come back to bite Riot, because they don't realize the implications of giving champions reliance on zones. I remember back after first rework, he conditionally had maybe 1/4 of his current steroids, with an even harder to land stun. He does not need the stats to suddenly \"become a fighter\".","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-11-16T19:33:33.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a jungler who's a fighter, gimme a break.

This is further the case because he gets his spire buff from stunning an enemy. (TIL)\n\nIf they don't realize what zones are doing they need to pull back on like 90% of their reworks. Most new/reworked items, champions and SR changes have conditional power. Just look at Redemption.
