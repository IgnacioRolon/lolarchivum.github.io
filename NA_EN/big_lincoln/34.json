But what does Garen teach you? \n\nDoes he teach new players how to farm and last hit? No, Nasus does that, and his reward for it is far more visible than Garen passively gaining resists.\nDoes he teach new players resource management? No, he doesn&#039;t have a resource.\nDoes he give players some simple skillshots to practice? No, he doesn&#039;t have any influence beyond melee range.\nDoes he teach you how to position for high damage, or how to kite as melee? Not really; E does more damage to isolated targets, but that will almost never happen until laning phase ends. Darius does &#039;conditionally higher damage&#039; much better and in a way that new players can clearly understand and consciously strive for; hell, even Illaoi does it better, with her soul-pull mechanics and positioning for double-hits. \nHe can&#039;t even teach newbies about the usefulness of attack resets on fighters, because his is so much drastically slower than his normal AAs that it can be easily interrupted for every second until the attack actually connects to someone. \nHis passive doesn&#039;t teach you anything; there is no gameplay to it beyond &#039;avoid interaction, heal up.&#039; Juggernauts with missing HP heals  in combat will teach you about risk assessment in fights far better than Garen does for the majority of the game. Even _Volibear_ does it better with his regen passive.\n\nGaren is so fundamentally lacking, so completely simplistic and minimalist in design, that he is a piss poor recommendation for beginner players and will not help them to learn anything. He&#039;s just a thoughtless, spinning bullet sponge with a kit that is too barebones to be acceptable with Riot&#039;s new gameplay direction. Is he fun? Yeah, he is. Is he good for new players? Not at all.\n\nRIOT, you need to accept that this kit is dated, and if he&#039;s meant to be babby&#039;s first juggernaut, he needs huge changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2017-03-05T21:34:09.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how you get downvoted for the title even though you make legitimate points.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-05T21:36:33.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's just the rule of gameplay boards","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-03-05T22:24:21.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I think that the thing is that all those things you mention arent for beginners. Garen is a simple champion and doesnt need a whole lot of knowledge to do what he does best. Hence why he's for beginners because he's simple. Learning resets and auto canceling then you might as well say Riven is for beginners. Garen teaches you more about the game moreso than champion mechanics.\n\nI personally dont see a problem with him. Especially with how i play him with full lethal page. Would like to see a buff to his passive in the early game since its almost nonexistent but thats just me.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-05T22:36:03.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"beginner champ should help you with the fundamentals of the game, or have any mechanics that might be able to translate to other champs, kind of like the stepping stone to more complex ones if you want to play that\n\ngaren has none of that","replies":[{"poster":"TimX24968B","date":"2017-03-06T16:34:17.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its more along the lines of \"beginner champs teach you bare basics of the game\".
