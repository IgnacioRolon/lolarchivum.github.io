When I'm in lane by myself, it's pretty easy to see the indicator for the execute, but the timer for the ult is so hard to see when it's at the enemy's feet. It's not as clear as say a Braum passive proc because it's a very thin transparent circle that's usually covered by minions or terrain during laning or teamfights. In teamfights, the execute indicator is somewhat hard to see as well, but it's not too bad. \n\nA huge improvement into making those ult opportunities more transparent could be having a permanent marker over the enemy's healthbar at the 25% mark to gauge potential trades (which might be too generous) or a mark _**over**_ the enemy when they fall below 25% (something like 5-mark Darius passive or Garen villian mark). Having an overheard mark for the ult timer CD would be great as well, as it would be much more transparent to my teammates to try to finish the impaled enemy off. So many moments where if my team simply switched targets when I ulted someone, we would have instantly gotten a pick. But then again, I don't know the Riot team philosophy on making those elements visually transparent for executes (like Cho ult, Jhin shots), if at all. \n\nTLDR; I love the Urgot rework because he has very clear strengths and weaknesses, with amazing high-points in his gameplay, but the ULT could be more visually transparent for both the player and teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2017-08-14T05:52:31.162+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I believe at one point we were planning to have a notch in the health bar for 25%, but it didn't quite make it in.

The Q is simply the method for you to slow and land an E onto enemies. The W is then used not for the damage, but to quickly rapid-fire you shotgun shells. You still dominate melee matchups.
