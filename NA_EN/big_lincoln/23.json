In both cases, you can make tremendously skillful plays by, say, ulting from several thousand units away, or chaining your abilities in such a way that you use them all to their full potential, but you can also both play them more simply, ult from point-blank range or the like, and not fail completely. They're both champions with clear indications of success and failure, but unlike many others, they also give more control to the player over how much risk they want to take at any given time. Because of this, players who are learning the champion, or who just are at a lower elo, can still get good mileage out of them, but as they master that champion and the game, there's a very smooth curve that allows them to unlock more and more of that champion's potential all the way up to much higher levels of play.\n\nTo go back to Garen, and even similarly simplistic champions like Xin Zhao or Annie, I think the key to making them viable at higher elos is to similarly alter their mechanics so that they can control how much reliability they want to have versus raw power. I think it's perfectly fine for his WQE combo to suffice as a learning experience, but there should be a clear path for him to improve from there. Giving him more back line access by pulling off more difficult plays, for example, could let him become a top-tier executioner at higher levels without affecting his low elo play too much.\n\nI completely agree that the whole \"learner champion\" argument is bullshit, not just because we now have several learner-friendly champions that scale up properly with mastery, but also because simplistic champions like Garen are terrible for learning the game: sure, you can get a good win rate with that champion without having to know too much about them or the game, but once you truly start progressing, you hit a wall, and suddenly have to end up relearning the entire game, and finding out it runs along very different lines from what you thought. Most other champions aren't as forgiving, don't have as much free power, or need to interact more with the environment just to be able to contribute, and learning that much in one go in the middle of your gameplay experience is intimidating as hell. Many players power through, mostly by de-learning bad habits they picked up with the easy mode champion and re-learning good ones, and some just stay at that level indefinitely, stuck in that local minimum until some larger force pushes them forward, or simply leave altogether out of discouragement. At best, Garen is a crutch that newer players will find themselves tricked into liking, and at worst he's an impediment to a proper learning experience. In both cases, he's not contributing positively to the game in his current state, and deserves a proper update so that he can be viable across all elos.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-05-30T16:29:10.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think at the core of exemplary reworks like Sion's or Warwick's is that they all have inbuilt sliding scales of power versus reliability.\n\nThat's a very good analysis, I never looked at it that way.

I guess difficult plays would mostly have to rely on either the timing of some of his abilities (e.g. pressing Q to cleanse important CC, or maybe pressing W just as a major source of damage hits him) or his positioning (landing the full Judgment on an enemy champion might not always be so easy).

Garen's rework then was done specifically with the idea of him being a \"beginner champion\", but unlike the Warwick rework, which used that to preserve the champion's ease of learning while substantially increasing his skill ceiling, the changes that followed didn't really bother to make him scale with mastery at all.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-05-30T18:21:24.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> as it was the basis for his rework during the Juggernaut update\n\nI think you're over-interpreting too much from a few comments.

What I'm saying is that Warwick's design team used the idea of a \"beginner champion\" to anchor his skill floor while raising his skill ceiling, whereas Garen's dev for the Juggernaut update took it as direction for not changing either. Granted, there are massive differences in scope between the two reworks, and I definitely agree that the Juggernaut Update was very experimental as a format, but the core point here is that a champion should never be held back on the grounds of being a \"beginner champion\", because true beginner champions have good skill ceilings in addition to low skill floors.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kal Vas Flam","date":"2017-05-30T10:00:54.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"We don't need all the champions to be complex and require 100 games to master.
