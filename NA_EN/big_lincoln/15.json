I don't think even I can deny the 'troll pick' status now, and that kills me.  Viktor was the first champion I 'mained' when I started playing this game back at the beginning of Season 3.  I remember Solcrushed's \"True Evolution\" thread, and all the interesting ideas proposed in it over the course of about two years.  \n\nI just don't understand Riot's \"balancing\" changes in Season 6.  Across the board they don't make sense, and the nerfs to Viktor when he first got picked up in pro play are one of the many signs of that.  He got nerfed for having good wave clear, which was always part of what defined him.  He used to be labelled as a 'Pusher' (before the new classification system) and was picked for his sieging and holding capabilities.  Now, it seems like that's all he'll be good for.  Minions that don't move are the only thing you'll get your second E proc on.  There's no way any player will stand in the same spot for enough time for the second tick to hit them (unless they're just really bad at the game) especially considering how much mobility is in the game now.  \n\nI still love Viktor's lore and his overall personality/character, and he's my favourite champion in the game for those reasons, but if these changes go through I can't realistically see myself picking him in games I want to win.  \n\nEdited for clarity.
