I've used 3-4 spell rotations as a mage against a tank and they survived while still managing to blow up one of my carries in the fight.  Tanks SHOULD be able to absorb copious amounts of damage, yes, but the trade-off should ALWAYS be that they lose damage in doing so.  \n\nAlmost every tank in League of Legends is capable of blowing up a carry even if they build absolutely no damage.  Early game, I'm fine with it---high base damage helps get tanks through the laning phase, but their scaling should be low if not completely pitiful.  \n\nAnd herein lies the tug of war on the Boards...\n\nSome people believe tanks should be utterly garbage through the game and only capable of soaking up damage in teamfights... others think tanks should outscale damage/carries late game.
