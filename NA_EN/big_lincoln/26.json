I am not really going to count lee since Safeguard is on a 14 cd (8.4 with 40%) and his Q requires you to land the first part on an enemy to use the dash.\n\nAll of those requires specific situations to constantly dash and they still have limitations.\n\n{{champion:131}} If you land Q can only dash rapidly twice, if you wait for Q and land it you can continue to dash until you mess up or you double tap. You still need to wait on Q.  Max rank its a 6 sec CD (3.6 with 40%)\n\n{{champion:39}} Needs to kill the target with her Q for the reset.\n\n{{champion:55}} Honestly requires good setup and positioning to be able to pull of the crazy dash game play.  Seeing as she needs Dagger for the CD reduction and she only produces 2 on a single rotation, so that 3 dashes on a rotation.  If she manages to kill or get an assist within 3 seconds she will reduce all her cooldowns by 15 seconds allowing another rotation.  You also have to keep in mind that the Dagger reduction is dependent on picking them up so if they are in a bad spot they don't help.\n\n{{champion:157}} Yes, if there is a large enough minion wave he can dash like crazy, but then he is locked out of dashing to those targets for 6 seconds at max rank.  So he has a short period of crazy movement around an area and then he is locked out for a time.\n\n{{champion:84}} She has at most 3 charges available.  She only gains more over time (15 sec recharge at max rank) or upon an enemy champion takedown.  So unless a champion she damaged dies, she has 3 dashes.  Well that and the blink on her smokescreen.\n\nAlso yes, my first response was not worded right.  I was more referring to the fact that he requires a target to dash to.
