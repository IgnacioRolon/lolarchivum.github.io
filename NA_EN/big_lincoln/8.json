Also its a little dishartenting to see the comments about gating support and jungle only items, but urgot still gets the short end of every fighter item he should be able to use. \n\nAs a fan of this game i have to be honest the lack of even addressing this design issue/mistake from anyone other then yourself tells me its just not a priority and riot is completely on with just letting urgot slide into his old niche irrelivant state. The champion is still bugged beyond belief, his “unstoppable” ultimate is countered by half the interactions in the game.

Biggest immediate problem I can see with that, however, is that there&#x27;s no immediate gameplay connection to that profile in the same way there is for AA ranges.\n\nI can see there being a massive problem with making him melee, but at he same time, scaling back some other power in the kit to compensate, would I think fix most of his problems, like scaling into late game and having access to the items that allow other Juggernauts to do Juggernaut things. If new items that he can use are in the works, great, but that always scares me. Just thinking back to \"you can never kill me\" GP like you referenced form the start of the season made me seriously considering dropping league, and I did till he got nerfed(still more needed in my opinion) and Conqueror came out. If Rakan and Thresh can be considered ranged, I don't see why Urgot cant be melee, for balance purposes.\n\nThe only Items I can find that this would affect are as follows:\n- Phage = Movement speed is no longer halfed, so Urgot's mobility is helped slightly.\n- Tiamat = good early buy if you want to hard push, but wouldn't be bought early over Phage most likely.\n- Titanic Hydra = Since the W reduces on-hit, the proc wouldn't help massively, but would offer him a really nice spike like other Juggs such as Darius that build it when ahead for wave clear and balance defensive/offensive stats with emphasis on his \"AOE destruction\" identity.\n- Frozen Mallet = This would be a massive buff to his stickiness, but even when the slow was 30% for him he was never broken, so I don't think this would result in massive power spike overall.\n- Dead Man's Plate = I could see this become staple considering some Urgot's build this now, but with Frozen Mallet it would probably just become \"either or\" decision on what you need at that time.\n- Sterak's Gage = This is the big one. Access to this Item would be exactly what Urgot need to do what he want to do a Juggernaut, and could be the biggest reason nerf might be needed in some areas of his kit if it went through.\n\nKetstones:\n- Fleet Footwork = Would remove the heal reduction which is super nice, but doubt anyone would take this. Even though lane sustain is always nice to have, especially if in a rough match up, Grasp would better probably.\n- Conqueror = THE Bruiser keystone, and would be so nice to have access to as Urgot. This also could demand nerfs in some other areas of the base kit.\n- Grasp of the Undying = Would remove the damage and healing reduction, allowing this to be a great option for the lanes you might need to sutain out, but most likely wouldn't be taken over Conqueror or PTA.\n- Glacial Augment = Could also be an option if you don't want to get Frozen Mallet or Dead Man's, but prob wouldn't be to much better then it is now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The KoolAidMan1","date":"2018-04-16T15:47:37.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for engaging with the Urgot community. Even though I’m not loving what I’m hearing from the dev/balancing team in regards to urgot it does bring me some comfort to know that there is at least one dedicated urgot fan (you) fighting for him to stay relevant and not forgotten because of his niche design. \n\nIn regards to the  fighter items do you feel confident that these new items will hit the mark without being abused by other roles/champs who use them better then urgot (Gnar, graves). Typically urgot gets the short end of the stick on most of these types of items (frozen mallet) when they hit a balanced state. What makes you feel like these items will work and be a good choices to build on urgot rather than just being an item that he is able to build. \n\nPersonally I feel like unless there is a change like the one you suggest in your last paragraph these will end up being like all other bruiser/fighter items on urgot... suboptimal and weak. \n\nSpeaking of design philosophy it feels like Urgot is at a crossroads. He was released relatively reciently, but is already feeling like he could easily slip to old forgotten urgot due to his kit and niche ranged tank style. Is there an urgency to get his route issue resolved or will it be bandaids and eventually outdated kit in his future. \n\nThanks again for the update!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-04-14T11:15:31.492+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man my problem lay with being the god of bruisers yet not able to use the new keystone, urgot suppose to daruis twin in shreding and bullying people in lane yet daruis now with that new keystone doing that much much better than him.\nnot to mention now champions that able to use the new keystone while urgot mostly went even against them  now they rekt him, champions like {{champion:2}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Potchikir","date":"2018-04-14T11:58:48.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":29,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ValiantKiller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LdyzovVa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-14T11:15:31.492+0000)\n>\n> Man my problem lay with being the god of bruisers yet not able to use the new keystone, urgot suppose to daruis twin in shreding and bullying people in lane yet daruis now with that new keystone doing that much much better than him.\n> not to mention now champions that able to use the new keystone while urgot mostly went even against them  now they rekt him, champions like {{champion:2}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:157}}\n\n1. {{champion:122}}  does NOT use Conqueror, Why?
