They just think he is an ult bot that just snowballs bottom lane (which he can do really well). They don't realize how strong he is in the early levels, especially till 9 where he maxes his Q. His duelling power at any stage is awesome, maybe his weakest point is level 6 where he doesn't get an ulti. Level 1 is strong, with the empowered attacks, level 2 might be awkward, but level 3, 4 and 5 are strong. Gap closer with CC, a AA denial and an augmentation + the shields he's getting. When CoC was strong, he also went in, did 3 empowered AAs (like  30% of the enemy HP), and backed off, while taking no damage.\n\nAt level 9, he probably has Bami Cinder already, maybe even some more items (maybe the full Sunfire Cape, or a Tiamat), and he is very strong. The % max HP health is very strong. I still believe, based on the enemies, how fed you are and how you itemize, you might be able to 1v1 after 9.

Some other comparisons to ADCs for examples are somewhat missleading because marksman as a class are strong late - so when an \"early game marksman\" like Lucian kills a \"strong lategame tank\" like Sejuani then that's not necessarily a problem - especially seeing how tanks usually (!) don't compete with marksmen when it comes to a certain pick. The way that tanks and marksmen scale is somewhat connected because marksmen depend on protection to deal tons of DPS and tanks can protect but need someone to DPS in the lategame. That means together they outscale assassins and divers as a class (exceptions etc. are ofc there).\n\nNow, nitpicking aside, I agree with you. As it is right now I really couldn't care less about whether we/they have a Nautilus or a Maokai toplane (aside from specific matchups that is).

Very little CC and no utility means he has to be a threat through his damage. Hence, he's a juggernaut.\n\nTrundle can. Garen comes close. If Mordekaiser can keep his shield up he can. What's your point though? Being the tankiest juggernaut doesn't mean he's not one.\n\nAll tanks are about utilizing their strong CC and/or utility to either lock down the enemy team or peel for their carry. Dr. Mundo is not a vanguard, he can't engage. He's not a warde, he's a poor peeler. He's a juggernaut meant to cause havoc in the enemy backline with his damage and stickiness, or force duels in side lines while splitpushing. His kit is loaded with damage, including one of the biggest AD steroids in the game. Dr. Mundo is intended to be a damage threat.\n\nYou're describing juggernauts. Juggernauts can't be ignored because they have the damage to easily kill your carries. Just like Dr. Mundo.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2017-02-03T09:09:49.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just answered to the other guy above \n\n> Don't rely too much on Riot lists, they are actually a bit confused about juggernauts situation and that's why they are planning for a kind of tank rework, to clear up some inconsistency and reduce edge cases.\n\n> Look at the same article that is referenced in the post you linked what is the definition of tank classes:\n\n > http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses\n\n> \"Tanks excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves\"\n\n> Which is EXACTLY Mundo description we both agreed upon above in the discussion.\n\n> He is placed into Juggernauts category only because he lack hard CC, he fit any other possibile description of tanks in this game stated by same Riot words...and he has far more in common with tanks rather than with champs like Nasus, Darius, Morde or Yorick.\n\n> Not all the tanks are about doing the same things, and Mundo has his own thing going for him as unique tank, just like other champs have their unique things going for them in other roles\n\nBut I want to point out some other things you said:\n\n- about tanking tower damage: \"Trundle can. Garen comes close. If Mordekaiser can keep his shield up he can.\" \nWHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SMOKING DUDE? Garen can come close to Mundo in tanking constant damage  output received? That's one of the stupidest things ever said. Garen \"tankiness\" come almost entirely by his regen passive that gives sustain OUT of combat when he does not receive damage. If he get CCed under tower, especially if he is not using his high cooldown W- which he should save to be able jump into the enemy team without being istantly blowed up if a fight happens - he is taking considerable damage. He is one of the worst juggernaut/tanks for tanking towers in a siege situation, because he has not great tankiness, low regen/sustain in combat, and low mobility to get out. If he start tanking a pair of shots and get CCed while the tower has still enough health, he is in serious trouble.\nMorde shield is something you can't rely on in those siege situations, because the shield is built upon doing damage in combat, which is not happening when you are sieging and so basically the shield is decaying or has yet decayed. He has even lower sustain and mobility to get out. Morde can reliably siege only if he has the ghost tanking for him, but this require having succesfully killed some enemy with the ult or the drake.\nTrundle is by far the best of the three guys you mentioned for sieging, but not because his ability of tanking damage, he is actually not good at doing that, he is good because he can zone enemy away from defending tower with the pillars or use the pillar to escape cutting enemy chase path (enhanced by his W). \n**Trundle is also the guy who is the farthest away from Juggernaut and closer to tank definition among the mentioned ** by the way, **as pillar is a tool that allows them to initiate and peel  as proof of that he hs been succesfully used as support**, which is a thing other Juggernauts can't do (heck, he was even specifically mentioned as been as Warden-Juggernaut Hybrid in the original article about subclasses)\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wet Dryman","date":"2017-02-02T23:23:20.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo IS a Juggernaut (official subclass list with examples provided by Riot http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list ).
