Moreover, Garen out-of-combat regen, good move speed and slow resist on Q make him a very decent split-pusher, and probably the best among the Juggernaut class except Nasus, and on top of that he is pushed towards that strategy by the fact he provides no team utility except on the rare occasion where his silence can disrupt a Diver's combo. But a split-pusher doesn't really want to amp his team.\n\nSo, overall team-wide Armor shred is always good, not a really situational niche, but detract Garen from his current strengths. It's definitely a buff, and I won't refuse it given Garen's current state, but I'm not convinced it's a good long-term buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NovaDisk","date":"2016-11-18T03:22:27.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like a reasonable buff, since Armor Shred is pretty common on a lot of other bruisers as well (Jarvan, Renekton, Nasus, Wukong, Xin, Vi, Jayce, and Sion all have Armor Shred, and others such as Darius and Yasuo have Armor Ignore).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-11-18T02:56:17.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you look at his passive too?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2016-11-18T02:37:39.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZY71Nbl5,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-18T02:35:32.676+0000)\n>\n> Do you think this will create a bit of an abuse case in his extra synergy with {{item:3071}}, since both will stack to more than what Darius gets for himself where Garen gives it to his whole team, or is that intended to be a new potential niche for him?\n> \n> also thank you for the reply\n\nEither that, or he will now be getting {{item:3031}} as his E can crit.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-11-18T02:46:42.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's not really enough, i feel, to be worth warranting. only 20% just isn't really enough. if there was a nice crit item for bruisers he would be very strong, I feel","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2016-11-18T03:05:33.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZY71Nbl5,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-18T02:46:42.809+0000)\n>\n> it&#x27;s not really enough, i feel, to be worth warranting. only 20% just isn&#x27;t really enough. if there was a nice crit item for bruisers he would be very strong, I feel\n\nTrue, {{item:3078}} used to give crit, but I wonder if a jugg crit item would be added. I get that it may be something that reduces crit damage but gives HP as to discourage ADC's from abusing it and becoming tanky while brusiers that don't needs a lot of crit would like it because they don't barely need it.","replies":[{"poster":"FAT MOUNTAIN","date":"2016-11-18T08:28:41.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about making it melee only.
