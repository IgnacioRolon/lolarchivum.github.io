Darius has the lowest attack speed of all Juggernauts (and possibly anyone, not sure), so he is required around that fact to use Q for the forefront of all his damage. Thing is, simply by being in Melee range, Darius loses 65% of his damage from Q, and no stacks. Since Juggernauts weakness are to be kited, which is rather easy with a good team, they get more leniency  with their mana costs. Same rule applies to other Jugs (save Illaoi, them mana costs on E, and how much you wanna use Q)\n\nMages who actually use Mana as a stat, and itemize it, are much more likely to run Oom in lane, before they literally buy an item to make that less of a concern, because that's their shtick. Fighters don't commonly itemize Mana, save Triforce's, and I suppose that is meant to be a pro for the whole Melee v. Range concern, but that's another topic for another day. Fiora relies heavily on her dashes to work her way around to hit those Vitals, and as such, needs to have that ability up. A Fiora who couldn't use her Dash would lose to every other champion, as her survivability and damage is based around dashing. \n\nADC's are variant in their use of Mana when it comes to it. Lucian requires an Essence Reaver for his build, as he actually does run out of mana rather fast mid game, because his entire damage output relies on chaining his spells. Jhin on the other hand, doesn't rely on his abilities for the front of his damage, and as a result, his abilities are lower cost because they aren't nessecary, but helpful when it comes to his kit. Sure, Jhin still builds ER, but that's just because it gives CDR with AD and Crit Chance if anything is to be seen from that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epicanian","date":"2017-02-05T23:25:45.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{champion:266}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} \n\nwhat's mana?","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-02-06T00:18:58.934+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you stop copy-pasting this thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legacy Hydralpha","date":"2017-02-05T23:52:30.286+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Those champions may not have mana, but their resource is something that has to be worked around to use them at their fullest strength.
