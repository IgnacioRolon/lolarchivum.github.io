It has to suck horribly that a Fiora can just run you down with massive MS boosts once she hits 1 Vital, I totally get that.

Though they were the exceptions not the norm.\n\nAD's are designed with auto attacking in mind, although it's fairly flawed. You can see that by how Talon must auto to proc his passive, Kha'Zix's passive empowers his autos, how Rengar's jump is just an auto, how Zed's passive gives him more auto attack damage, how Riven's passive is an auto attack empower, even Gangplank's.\n\nThe major flaws, I believe, is how these autos work. Early game, they're a huge safety net. A Zed who only hit a single Q when he ults will simply auto attack twice more to make up for it, and you can't stop him. Rengar's autoattack usage gives him insane dps when combined with his Q resets. A Riven who all ins, fails her combo, and simply doesn't have the damage, will just auto a few more times and kill a squishy anyway. Assassin's are burst based, and their autos mean they keep a level of unnecessary and unintended power.\n\nMy solution is to drastically lower the attack speed of all AD assassins. But, you ask, wouldn't this destroy their ability to weave autos into their combo's because of the slowed auto attack animation? Yes, it would. Unless, we artificially sped up their auto attack animation.\n\nThis means a Zed who combo's perfectly still gets in that 1 auto attack and weaves it smoothly into his E's and Q's, and kills his target as intended. But a Zed who fails his Q's can no longer auto attack multiple times to make up for the missed Q damage, unless for some reason his target stands there for over 3 seconds.\n\nOf course, this hits their tower pushing and early game dps, so for the latter, I suggest their attack speed to be kept the same but the scaling to be lowered. AD assassins already chunk towers, the attack speed nerf would only put them on the same level as an AP mage, which is fine.\n\nRiven is not specifically an assassin and is also balanced around being able to duel tanks, but this should not be a problem. Her fast combo will be unaffected, but perhaps a soft auto attack reset would need to be incorporated into her W to make up for that, which again, would not affect her assassination combo. So Riven's ability to take down a tank would also be ability based, rather than simply slapping away with 400 damage autos between combos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-03-19T05:05:55.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">There has always been some degree of cross over, like Jax ult and Ashe Volley. Though they were the exceptions not the norm.\n\nThat's not actually true. There was a point in time early in S1 where AD ratios just weren't a thing. If you had an ability it either scaled with AP or nothing and that includes abilities which have AD ratios now like Volley and Leap Strike. I think the on exception to this was Parrrlay, which has always had an AD ratio, originally 1:1 because it's always been considered an AA.\n\nAlso on Jax's ult, it's newer than champions like Riven and Talon. Jax's ult was only changed to what it is now at the end of S1, before that it had the bonus AS part of his passive, the 3rd hit passive and bonus MR based on dodge on activation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-03-18T23:28:10.877+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree delete {{item:3071}}","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-18T23:34:00.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"delete you first","replies":[{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-03-18T23:36:00.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Im agreeing with you???","replies":[{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-03-19T01:52:40.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"He's a juggernaut main, you autist ADC main.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-19T01:54:26.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no need to be rude i was only kidding","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-03-19T05:00:36.699+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone builds {{item:3071}} now\n\nI see tank builds with cleaver for the shred, I see assassins take it, hell I saw an {{champion:22}} today with cleaver.

Like what item has a better utillity than that armour shred?\n\nThe last whisper needs to be toned down a lot and the 2 completed items need more effectiveness vs hp so that hp doesn't end up better versus physical damage than health. But an overall nerf so an adc cant solo basically any juggernaut with no kiting lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FortisDominus","date":"2017-03-19T06:18:57.665+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbRiYV5SBAI","replies":[{"poster":"The Neglegent","date":"2017-03-19T07:05:07.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yea but you have to consider that tanking 31 tower shots has nothing to do with being tanky and everythign to do with turrets being completely irrelevant after lvl 3.","replies":[{"poster":"FortisDominus","date":"2017-03-19T07:07:05.918+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not just tanking 31 tower shots, its tanking 31 tower shots in the middle of a TEAMFIGHT.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2017-03-19T16:55:17.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also worth noting in this scenario the team support he had to survive.\n\nHe had Nami with Ws on him, lee sin's shield, a redemption tossed in here, not only that but his team was at a massive advantage overall (The only ones with decent scores on the blue team were corki and varus, and even they were still not nearly as strong.\n\nThe tower itself did almost nothing, whereas the most of the damage came from the opposing team rather than the tower, the tower's damage was negligible (ninja tabis, frozen heart and sunfire cape were all the armor items that he had, I'm not sure what that is exactly with nautilus's base armor at the time, but I'm going to estimate somewhere around the mid 200s.)\n\nHonestly the game pacing was modified heavily by how weak the towers feel.
