Hath God forbid League have a single unique interaction within its code? Besides the pure spaghetti bits, that is. Every time a unique interaction comes up people ask for it to be removed from the game. The fact that Riot hasn't listened to the boards on that one actually makes me really happy.\n\nYou wouldn't just remove Blue from being a build option, you'd nuke his more normal AD route (Tri-Force) and AP (Lich Bane) as well, and last I checked those builds haven't been considered broken in a long time (AP since the heal was removed; AD since the attack speed reduction on W was removed). You'd force him to build like every other carry in the game because you can't deal with one specific playstyle. If Blue is a problem then here's what you do: You see that pretty little Iceborn Gauntlet? Not many other ranged champions besides Ezreal really use it, y'know? So what you do is, now listen closely: nerf it more for ranged since only Ezreal uses it effectively from a range. Nerf its damage, or its slow; hell, make it unusable for ranged and kill Blue off entirely while causing minimal damage to other champions (since, again, pretty much nobody else uses it effectively from a range) while keeping his AP and AD route intact. \n\nAnd that's if Blue Build is actually so problematic as the Boards say it is, since the boards are, frankly, well-known for hyperbolizing anything and everything they see as a \"problem\" and suggest guttings and rampant nerfs for issues that could be resolved by balancing _around_ what's considered to be a problem instead of removing options altogether and making everyone have to conform to some pre-ordained school of balance where everyone has to adhere to the exact same philosophy and beliefs of what is and is not balanced or ideal.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-01-07T04:48:32.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just iceborn that would die, that's it.

Until then, don't kill something just because it's unique and you don't feel like dealing with it.
