Naturally I chose the second one, but as soon as I click find group I am in a leaverbuster 5:00 minute ban. At the end of the ban, a message pops up saying something along the lines of invalid skin, I forgot to screencap. I change back to the other classic skin and attempt to re-enter, but I get another ban. Exit pop-up and try again, ban timer resets. The bug repeated after re-logging. Also, I am now constantly in Leaverbuster, in anygame mode with it resetting constantly.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-02-05T23:34:15.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, he's got two eyes now! {{champion:161}} {{champion:161}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2015-02-05T23:02:54.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is intended for the timer to restart from 5 min each time you queue.
