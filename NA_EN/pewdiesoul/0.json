This functionality no longer works, and I think it is because the rune system was updated. I think the problem is on twitch.tv's end, because they didn't update their linking system to account for the changes to runes, so I don't think it's a LoL problem.~~\n\nEDIT: I've just made a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7loeka/twitch_it_is_no_longer_possible_to_sort_lol/) that I think summarizes the situation. I think the fact that the LoL+Twitch account linking isn't working any more is related to the preseason runes change, and I think this is also why the Twitch option to sort LoL streams by rank no longer exists.
