What are your guy's favorite champs? Why? What was your best play with them?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I love Irelia. {{champion:39}} :) Her combonation of melee, bonus damage, and a ranged ult make her a top lane smoothie. I once got so tanky, I was able to get a quadrakill without losing more than 40% of my health. xD So, that's mine, what's yours?","replies":[{"poster":"League is a Drug","date":"2013-11-27T03:25:45.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:114}} For sure. She can just get so OP. For my Fiora, there's not a lot of counters to me. The 3 things that get me all the time are Singed, Vladimir, and Frozen Heart.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatGuyNamedAce","date":"2013-11-27T03:59:28.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome. She's definitely my second choice. I think that the thing that makes or breaks a top laner is the ult, ya know, and her ult is definitely what makes her.","replies":[{"poster":"Hoai","date":"2013-11-27T04:19:09.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup. Dodges Darius dunks. Chases the Yi's. Trolls Kennen ult. All the possibilities.\n\nUntil someone completely avoids your ult like Jax, Panth, Vlad, or Elise.\n\nOr you get tanked to the death.\n\n:C","replies":[{"poster":"League is a Drug","date":"2014-06-19T14:23:34.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahah yup\n\nI like to try to make them use those abilities first and then ult, and I'm usually fine, but sometimes they're smart.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"guienapig","date":"2013-11-29T08:58:57.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my favorite champion is kayle she is amazing with her combo of support and being a great lanebully and just her being alll around awesome {{champion:10}}","replies":[{"poster":"ThatGuyNamedAce","date":"2013-11-29T17:27:38.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play Kayle. :P Always been a fan of hybrid damage.
