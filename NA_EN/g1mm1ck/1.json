This is why player X, who only recently got Gold, will likely fall back to silver. \n\nThis is why I&#039;ll always listen to the advice of players in gold or higher. If they are higher rank then me, they are doing something I am not. If I never made a mistake in any of my games, I would not be a gold player. You can&#039;t possibly know all the mistakes you&#039;re making, so you have to listen to the advice you are given. \n\nThe dumbest thing in league is players who think they&#039;re playing perfectly and they somehow lost just because they got bad teammates, *especially* if they are bold enough to flame people doing things they don&#039;t agree with that are clearly working. You can give any advice you want, but don't assume you're right if you don't have the ranks to back it up. \n\nCannot wait until we put these morons back in school, because they sure as all hell need it.","replies":[]}
