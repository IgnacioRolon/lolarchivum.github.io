It'd be a pity for Riot to release yet another mana/mana regen + AP item.  Plus, 250 mana?  Who opens up the shop and decides that's the amount of mana that will make their build work?  For an item targeted at supports, it seems a bit foolish to ask those supports to plan 2 items to solve their mana problems (one of which being new Zeke's if supports are actually going to buy that).  The rest of the stats are still awkward too:  which supports want both AP and armor?  The tank supports don't want the AP, and the squishier supports don't often spring for armor (though they probably will when this drops).  \n\nLastly, as much as I don't want to bash Riot's new items (the problem is the REMOVAL of an item, not the ADDITION of one).... who the hell thought those stats on a buff would be healthy for the game?  They'll warp powercurves completely, water down the niche of buff-focused supports, and snowball games pretty hard.  Zeke's/Locket/Abyssal as flat auras already snowball to an extent, due to the multiplicative nature of stats, but a scaling buff just exaggerates it.  Now when you and the other support both build new Zeke's, but their ADC builds IE while yours doesn't, your Zeke's is now much weaker than theirs.  This will only further enforce IE as a must-buy ADC item.  **BUT AGAIN:  the main problem is that they're removing a harmless item to do all of this**.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2015-06-30T11:05:07.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The community has been demanding an AR item for utlity support fpr a while now.Seems like we finnaly got it,kinda...","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-06-30T18:33:37.719+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just for what price...\n\nnothing against an armor item for mage-supports, but why sacrifice Zeke's for it, and why that 50% crit steroid...\nalso, do we need another cdr item for supports?

I can't tell you the last time I've seen a support build this item ad or ap. They are making items more tempting to supports that want to branch out to more ap heavy supports. I understand you AD supports wanting something but this is for the ap heavy supports, let us have this. It's so gold efficient so we don't have to build actual ap items when we could be building something to help our adc. \n\nI feel for you ad supports I really really do, but AP supports that can really shine will seriously be able to bring something to the table now. AD supports deserve an item, you're right. But this item is ours just let us have this. Hopefully riot will branch out and maybe make something more for AD supports in the future. But the people who want to play those off meta supports Like I mentioned will not be able to play those and not get flamed.","replies":[{"poster":"Lorinne","date":"2015-07-01T11:40:30.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not an AD support (usually, though I have done it); all of my favorite supports are AP (Nami, Lulu, Zyra, Sona, etc).  We already have plenty of options.  And this IS removing the item.  It changes literately EVERYTHING.  There are zero similarities between this item and the old herald, it's completely unrecognizable, it is for all intents and purposes the removal of Zeke's Herald.\n\nAnd don't act like AP supports don't already shine.  ALL \"viable\" supports are either AP or tank.  Annie is probably one of the most AP-heavy supports and is also one of the top 5 (if not higher) at pretty much all levels of play, even the LCS.  I see her at least one or two game(s) everytime I watch the LCS.  And I've seen pretty much every mage as a support at one time or another, from Brand to Karthus to Veigar (as I recall there was even a Veigar support in the EU LCS last year or so).  And it's MUCH easier to bring one of those bot lane than ANY AD (even the one AD, Ashe, who is classified as a support).  I don't see how you can act like AP supports are suffering when they have literately ALWAYS been the main or the secondary option for a support.  You act like this change will make or break AP supports or that they won't be viable without it - that's just not true.  I definitely would like to have it, but I don't think it's right to replace Zeke's Herald with it.\n\nZeke's is pretty much the most unique item in the game.  I'd rather them just flat out delete it, name and all, then have them just turn it into yet another AP support item or support item with yet another active.  It just feels wrong to warp it into something unrecognizable, and to me there's no reason to do that.  They could easily just give this item a new name and keep the old Zeke's, as well (maybe even rework the old Zeke's a bit to make it more viable while at the same time keeping its identity).  Item diversity isn't created by deleting unique items or changing them beyond recognition to an item that will become a must-buy on some supports. \"Must-buy\" isn't \"diverse\".","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-06-30T02:45:09.553+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":19,"body":"\"Riot, please don't make a support item into a better support item.\"\n\nOh, wait, you thought they intended it for bruisers?","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-06-30T18:51:46.839+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more \"Riot, don't take my spoon and turn it into a Chair.\"\nGetting a new chair is nice, but you simply can't eat your soup with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-07-01T01:19:30.884+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"plus I already have 3 other chairs and I really don't need another","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-06-30T19:23:09.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's not like turning a spoon into a chair, it's like turning a sundial into a digital clock with an alarm.
