I don't understand why you aren't targeting her low interaction passive, which drastically needs to be changed due to the invisible power it is offering. It's very frustrating to play against with absolute no effort on the Janna's part. I say this having thousands of games played as Janna since season 1. She has been nerfed so many times that she honestly feels like a shadow of her former self, especially if you choose to build her squishy/AP focused.\n\nI find it amusing that Janna is being seen as \"OP\" and getting all these complaints from lower tier players simply because she counters the tanky assassin meta (not to mention the INSANE death timers). Poke supports hard counter her, but they're so drowned out by Alistar and Braum right now that you never see them.

Note: disable duration is still down on her ultimate, we had other changes that reduced the range of the knockback which were pulled.\n\nI can only speak for myself but \"my carry has a free BF Sword as long as my shield's on them\" is quite possibly one of the best parts of Janna's late game IMO. It doesn't get utilized very well down here in Bronze, but even in early game I go E first with the specific purpose of making last-hitting easier for my carry. The shield part is icing on the cake to me, and that's not just because I have relatively slow reflexes and often don't get the shield on my carry until after they've taken the poke I was trying to block with it.\n\nAnd this is beside the point, but just saying, if you care about melee frustration whatsoever, the absolute very first thing you need to do is delete Kalista from the game. THEN you can start worrying about the Jannas and Namis and other supports whose entire purpose in teamfights is ruining the melee's day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mood in blue","date":"2016-03-16T20:09:52.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"The biggest problems about this, is that Alistar and Braum are running around being pick-or-ban since 10 months.\n\nAre you at least gonna nerf them too  if you nerf their hardest counter on top of them being too strong themselves?\n\nBecause you're set for a pick-or-ban Alistar-Braum playoff run like this, and they are dominating high elo already.\n\nAre you aware that the current Alistar nerf is a complete joke and won't change anything?","replies":[{"poster":"137434","date":"2016-03-16T20:20:46.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you aware that Janna not only has the 2nd highest pick rate of supports in all Plat+ games (behind Thresh, ahead of Alistar and Braum), but she always has the highest win rate in the role?\n\nThey aren't even really nerfing the part of Janna that makes her a counter to those two champions you mentioned.

She is exceptionally powerful because of her ability to punish SoloQ mentalities (miscommunicated engages, bad coordination, covering for her own teammate's errors). It is also a plus that she has strong lane match-ups against most of the current meta supports.\n\nThis has ALWAYS been true, throughout all of Janna's history.\n\nThat said, Janna is something that definitely needs to exist in some form or another in the league of legends dynamic, if we are to value style diversity and strategic counterplay. To simply call it \"overpowered\" because it has a strong statistical showing in the cesspit of SoloQ, resulting in targeted nerfs that may affect her competitive relevancy, is detrimental as a whole to league of legends.\n\nObviously there is wiggle room here, and I'm not at all opposed to some nerfs here or there, but I think we approach a dangerous area when we simply label high win-rate SoloQ champions as inherently overpowered instead of examining WHY they are overpowered.\n\nThis attitude could lead to a barrage of unwarranted nerfs ( hi swain, hi karthus) and lack of appropriate nerfs for the biggest offenders of competitive variety.
