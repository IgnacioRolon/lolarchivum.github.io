If your team's tanks/juggernauts aren't completely retarded nasus is a champion that takes minimal effort to peel. As cassiopeia you're not reliant on attack speed in any way shape or form so just poison nasus and go to town with your twin fangs.\n\nAlso, wither is usually best used on the ADC, not mages, since as I said before, mages dont rely on AS so only half of the wither is going to work. It's more efficient and worthwhile to wither an adc.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2016-09-14T21:02:54.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fully agreed. Seriously the thing is a clickshot 99% 3 second slow at max rank. For comparison, so few other slows even are 50%, and not one that's over 60% lasts any longer than a second, even all slows on ultimate abilities. It's basically \"Unless you're Kog'Maw with W, you're dead.\" And next patch, they're changing him so he doesn't get 5.0 attack speed anymore, so even that is only until the next patch. Only way to deal with him is to kill him before he gets into range to slow, but if you're an ADC and in range to basic attack, you're probably in range to get slowed.","replies":[{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-09-15T22:13:26.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teamates can also cc him, knock him back, use utility skills to save you, and generaly pull someones butt out of the fire.
