I mean, how can you ignore those improved stats? You're crippling yourself by not having a fully upgraded income item, and the actives are so good for teamfights.\n\nAlso, so many times your teammates have bad map awareness, so placing more wards (and sweeping enemy ones) helps you help your team by preventing their potential deaths. I typically do more mia and warning pings, even for other lanes, because I'm not \"tunnel csing\".\n\nIf I see another post-game lobby and you still have only Relic's Shield, I'll cry.\n\n**EDIT**: I guess some people are misunderstanding my point. Support is not the only one who should be warding. Watch all the high-elo matches you want and you'll see pinks/greens are purchased, and trinkets are upgraded.\n\nThat said, not everyone is a higher-elo player at this point in time; I suggest the above only as a way to carry your team to victory simply because other players DONT typically buy/upgrade wards. As a support, you're not really a dmg carry, but setting up plays and making calls can carry your team to victory. Warding and sweeping is a great way to help you do so.\n\n**EDIT2**: I admit this is pretty awkward timing given the 5.3 ward updates XD Overall, TEAM vision can greatly help you win games.

If youre playing support, theres really no reason you should be prioritizing AP over anything else (ESPECIALL vision) since youre gold income, even with an gold income item (which some of you have said you don't even upgrade XD) is so pathetic youll literally never be able to be relevant with damage unless you get SUPER fed in lane, in which case it likely wouldn't matter anyway.\n\nTheres literally no good reason to ever NOT get a sightstone on your first back if you can afford it, as vision is pretty much the most important thing in the game. I mean, Codex is only SLIGHTLY better in terms of stats compared to Frostfang, and if you go for the former as opposed to the latter youre gimping your damage potential, mana regen and gold income for a small amount of extra AP and 10% cdr. Now if you want to delay building FQC for other things that's far more understandable as its not that great of an item once its completed, and things like Mikaels can be far more beneficial depending on the enemy comp.\n\nI cant even really imagine a scenario where rushing a Mikaels is a good idea to be honest. Definitely not if youre sacrificing Sightstone, and possibly not even if youre just sacrificing your gold income item. If youre far enough behind or your teammates are bad enough that youre seriously considering a Mikaels over a Sightstone/income item, it probably wont make much of a difference.\n\nI am kind of curious about the pink ward trinket though. I had a game not too long ago that went on so long that even as the support I was getting close to full build, and I had to decide between either not building another item, or switching my sweeper for the pink ward totem to free up a slot in my inventory. I elected to ditch the sweeper for the totem, and im curious if there is any consensus on whether this was the right call or not. Its less reliable than just carrying pink wards around, as it has a cooldown, but it seemed like the right call so I could get another item completed. \n\nWould it have been a better idea to just sell my income item at that point and keep buying pinks? While not the best in terms of stats, I do find the actives pretty useful for chasing/running/surviving.","replies":[{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2015-02-11T17:57:37.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pink trinket is more for keeping control of Dragon or Baron by being able to clear all wards in the area.\n\nUpgraded sweeper is hands down the best choice if dealing with Teemo shrooms, or any champions with stealth mechanics.\n\nAs for the part about a Codex, getting started on that instead of the Frostfang upgrade is good due to cost efficiency.

Sure, if I don't have 1300g maybe I'll get a cloth armor, pots, wards, and upgrade income item instead. I just find the above works out for my lane more often than not. Hell, if you buy wards and cloth armor in place of sightsone on first back, I don't care.

However, correct math or not, I feel blasting wand is a horrible choice.\n\nSo: my math. Assuming the 1300g above, buying blasting wand (860g) implies you aren't upgrading your income item (40g short). I'm assuming you have an ancient coin because spellthief's requires precise Q's (not that I prefer it over coin anyway).

This gives you a lot more information, and you can act accordingly to where the enemy jungler is.\nSightstone can be bought early-mid game as long as you have 1-2 green wards every time you back.\nSweeper should be bought first back / second back depending on situation. (Most times I go for it first back, and once you hit level 9, rush the upgrade.)\n\nSightstone Upgrade should almost never be upgraded, it's a waste of gold because you are more than likely to never finish the 4 wards you get before backing anyways.\n\nSupports should most times concentrate warding bottom - mid, including jungle. \nTop should try warding their bush, perhaps ward inside enemy jungle if possible.\nMid should ward one side of their lane and stick to it.\nJungle should try warding their jungle entry's to avoid counter jungling. They should also try warding enemy jungle if possible.\nADC should focus on warding tri-bush, or bottom lane bushes. Supports can only place 3 wards a map and having an extra ward in the enemy jungle is more vital than having one on bot lane side bush. \n\nThis is the most basic, and it is just my opinion.

I think everyone should consider wards, there is no reason not to. If youre going to make a case for how important is for X, Y, Z to be done with wards/sweeping lenses, then it can only be done better if everyone shares the responsibility. When I go mid I buy a pink for my back right jungle bush near the raptors, and a stealth on my first back to ward the opposite side of my free ward. Denying the jungler easy ganks on me more than makes up for the cost. At level 9 you can bet Im spending 250 gold on better wards and keeping 100% up time on both river bushes. Similar when I top, pink on my bush between inner and outer turrets, stealth in river, free ward in one of the bushes, which ever they will try to escape too the most.\n\nIv seen games that have gone decidedly in our favor get stagnated by enemy turtling, and to counter this we start split pushing. This lets them catch up in farm and take out a split pusher or two, or catch the jungler invading. This starts to melt down our snowball and lets them find a way back into the game. This \"way back into the game\" could be easily curbed by people spending the 250 gold on upgrading the free trinket so you can see the gank coming.\n\nIv finished countless games where no one else has upgraded their free ward, and they've even announced \"full build.\" Also when your getting pushed back that is the time to buy wards and ward up the bushes and jungle. Often we have been able to escape the base and kill ADCs and Junglers invading our jungle cause they though we were stuck in our base and didnt know where they were.\n\nLook at it this way, if you spend 250 gold on a ward/trinket upgrade, and you avoid 1 gank cause of it, then you denied them the 300-500 gold bounty on you, not to mention NOT losing out on the farm you cant get while dead.\n\nWarding is everyone's responsibility, the only reason the current meta even works is because others are abiding by it. If every player had upgraded wards at 9, and had decent placement, then they would have a decided advantage due to the vision they would gain. Im tired of begging people to buy wards just so we can avoid their fed jungler, warding well in the first place would potentially stopped them from getting fed in the first place.\n\nSo a \"supports do this warding scheme\" maintain the meta thread isnt really helping in my opinion, its merely an attempt to train people to do something that only works because others agree to do it the same way. Just like old black powder musket days when hundreds of soldiers would line up shoulder to shoulder across from the enemy army and launch volleys of musket fire at each other.... that kind of warfare only worked cause that is what the enemy agreed to do also.\n\nIn my opinion, the support should have the stealth wards and the carry should have the sweeping lens, oh no spending some of your precious carry gold to murder that stealth champ.... oh my forbid.... The support can spend time walking around placing wards to protect from ganks while the carry farms. The top and mid ward types could vary depending on their disengage options. The mid almost certainly needs a stealth ward, but picking up a lens to help your jungler gank mid isnt a bad idea either. Warding is complex, and the only reason the OP thinks there is \"One way of doing it\" is cause there's only one way people generally do it.","replies":[{"poster":"AthenasHarpy","date":"2015-02-11T22:01:23.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Weasel Kensei,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=W8KELh5y,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2015-02-11T20:02:11.685+0000)\n>\n> Im not entirely sure if the meta of \"You filthy support, do all the warding\" is good. I think everyone should consider wards, there is no reason not to...\n\nSo, just a clarification: I don't like or care for the meta. You can ask people to buy and upgrade wards, but I've heard \"that's for endgame\" and \"I'm adc\". \"Follow the meta\" is not what I'm trying to say, and sorry if it seems that way. Besides, if support is my preferred role, why would I suggest something where the role I play is \"filthy\", looked down upon, or forced to bear that much of the team's weight?\n\n> \n> Iv finished countless games where no one else has upgraded their free ward, and they've even announced \"full build.\" Also when your getting pushed back that is the time to buy wards and ward up the bushes and jungle...\n> \n> \n> **Warding is everyone's responsibility**, the only reason the current meta even works is because others are abiding by it...\n\nAgain, I don't do the above because it's meta. I do it because the results of me doing so are pretty damn obvious. I'd hope people are upgrading and using their trinket (and 5.3 should further help the appeal of doing so), but your above quote tells me you know its not often done. It would be awesome if other people went the sighstone/sweeper combo (or even pinked) besides me, but that doesn't happen too often when not playing with friends. Sometimes I've had to remind adc to trinket even in laning phase.\n\n> \n> So a \"supports do this warding scheme\" maintain the meta thread isnt really helping in my opinion, its merely an attempt to train people to do something that only works because others agree to do it the same way.\n> \n> Warding is complex, and the only reason the OP thinks there is \"One way of doing it\" is cause there's only one way people generally do it.\n\nPlease don't assume to know why I ask of the above. I don't care about how \"other people do things\" I adjust my build and play to account for my own (and team's) strengths and weaknesses. More often than not, the biggest weaknesses are \"vision\" and \"sweeping\". I suggest the above only as a way to carry your team to victory simply because other players DONT typically buy/upgrade wards. As a support, you're not really a dmg carry, but setting up plays and making calls can carry your team to victory. Warding and sweeping is a great way to help you do so.","replies":[]}]}]}
