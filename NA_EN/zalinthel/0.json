Sona&#039;s heals were annoying sure but they didn&#039;t matter if she got blown up. I don&#039;t understand why people are complaining, the *point of the mode* is that **everything** is ridiculous. And I wholeheartedly love it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2015-04-04T00:44:41.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember....URF...loves you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dnsup","date":"2015-04-02T21:33:06.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agree agree agree. I wish we could get everyone who still loves URF to *stop playing it for a second* and get on the Boards to represent.\n\nRight now, the Boards is being flooded with all the toxic people who've played it <5 times and want to see it snuffed out.\n\nThis mode should be permanent. I still haven't bought any RP since last April, since apparently April is the only month I play anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrChache","date":"2015-04-04T02:58:33.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe if the mode was random...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tidecaller Nami","date":"2015-04-04T02:47:29.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We complain because Riot only gives us 6 bans when there are over 10 champions that completely ruin the fun the other team can have because of their snowbally nature in this game mode.\nMaybe if we had more than 6 bans for more than 120 champions and people would stop picking the most op champions to win instead of just relax and have fun, more of us might enjoy it","replies":[]}]}
