I had an idea they could do recently on totally reworking Ryze from the ground up but explain it through lore. I'll just quickly explain, he protects his Scroll as it has magic that he doesn't want anyone else to have so what if in his rework lore he loses the scroll or someone finally destroys it for good and he starts to forget all his previous magic because it's no longer attached to his body (the tattoos wear off or he just goes insane) and now he relearns new magic and that's why like your idea he can't burst people down and becomes more of a tanky mage XD Riot could do a lot with a full on rework for Ryze and I'd honestly be okay with it because this current Ryze is never going to work and I miss old Ryze and I'll never get it back so screw it, I'd rather have every spell be different than try to keep this Ryze we have now working.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2016-02-02T23:05:56.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Riot consistently does this so I'm not sure what rock you've been living under.

That is somewhat ok if he can actually scale to something strong later in the game like old ryze did. Ryze is broken don't get me wrong. For me I feel like as long as I do everything right I cant loose against any match up. Ryze before the rework and before the small q buff was better than this Ryze in the Pbe. I played him a lot then and got diamond only with that \"nerfed\" Ryze. My idea of a nerf is very simple and effective. I don't get how riot didn't even think about it. So here it is. Remove the CD he gets from ult. Make him Gain Passive duration from CD. Therefore he goes in lane with 0 CD lets say and the duration of his passive 3s. For every 10% cd he get 0.5 s increase. Therefore at 40CD he will have his 5s passive duration as it is in live. The difference is that this would occur only when ryze has lets say ionian boots, frozen heart and let’s say 10 cd from a maxed q like old ryze had. This will make him scale slower but will keep his late game intact to an extent. The difference here is that he wont be able to rush seraphs second after rod since he will need the cdr for his passive forcing him to buy FH or morelo which lowers his dmg output early in the game. To compensate a bit I believe that his mana ratios should go up a bit but other than that I think he ll be ok. You will not be able to all in someone at level 9 like now but at least ull be able to defend yourself with that FH or spirit visage that will help you scale into the late game. I just came up with this so I don’t think its flawless. What do you think? On a side note, riot's comment that ryze is too cheap to be complex and have a high skill  cap for beginners is just absurd and childish. Make another champion 450rp and increase ryze's cost then.","replies":[{"poster":"H 3","date":"2016-02-05T11:10:33.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=basketcase91,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EmnhE4Yd,comment-id=0036,timestamp=2016-02-04T20:09:39.607+0000)\n>\n> Ok so listen. I was master tier and best Ryze in the world last season for about 4 months and i know ryze like I know myself. If this nerf goes through ryze will become the worst champion in the history of lol. He will not be be able to survive in lane against almost any match up. He will have 0 kill potential and no real way to outrade or outplay his opponent. That is somewhat ok if he can actually scale to something strong later in the game like old ryze did. Ryze is broken don't get me wrong. For me I feel like as long as I do everything right I cant loose against any match up. Ryze before the rework and before the small q buff was better than this Ryze in the Pbe. I played him a lot then and got diamond only with that \"nerfed\" Ryze. My idea of a nerf is very simple and effective. I don't get how riot didn't even think about it. So here it is. Remove the CD he gets from ult. Make him Gain Passive duration from CD. Therefore he goes in lane with 0 CD lets say and the duration of his passive 3s. For every 10% cd he get 0.5 s increase. Therefore at 40CD he will have his 5s passive duration as it is in live. The difference is that this would occur only when ryze has lets say ionian boots, frozen heart and let’s say 10 cd from a maxed q like old ryze had. This will make him scale slower but will keep his late game intact to an extent. The difference here is that he wont be able to rush seraphs second after rod since he will need the cdr for his passive forcing him to buy FH or morelo which lowers his dmg output early in the game. To compensate a bit I believe that his mana ratios should go up a bit but other than that I think he ll be ok. You will not be able to all in someone at level 9 like now but at least ull be able to defend yourself with that FH or spirit visage that will help you scale into the late game. I just came up with this so I don’t think its flawless. What do you think? On a side note, riot's comment that ryze is too cheap to be complex and have a high skill  cap for beginners is just absurd and childish. Make another champion 450rp and increase ryze's cost then.\n\nYeah I agree he can as of right now do 15-20 spells on his passive at max rank or around that and to nerf it to a measly 5 is such an insane nerf. Looking at his scaling and base damages he needs to be able to spam to do a lot. They could of made it 10 or nerfed his base damages again and made the root have diminishing returns or even lower it to a flat 1 second at all ranks or something. I feel like riot could balance things better and instead of insane overnerfs they could a good size nerf then if it's still a problem do some more. How many times in the past has riot made a champion mega weak or insane just from some buffs or nerfs? I honestly believe there could be far more number tweaks more often than changing so many at once to being OP status or garbage. If somethings a problem you try to fix it instead of just demolishing it but I guess people can't seem to understand that and allow feelings to take over or hate towards a certain champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatTaco","date":"2016-02-03T12:09:25.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get a bit irritated that Riot chooses to explain nerfs and changes for other champions for example Soraka but we won't get 1 Rioter in here to tell us what's up with this change and if it's final or just a PBE test. There's a few posts on the forums pointing this nerf out and reddit posts with hundreds of replies all discussing the doom of this champion yet Riot will not discuss what this will do to the champion, I'd really like to know if they think he'd be playable after this and if there are any future updates for Ryze this month. This favoritism on game balance insight is really annoying. I feel like as a game developer if you make changes that are experimental like this and people can test it out for themselves you need to explain why you want this change so the community can get a good idea about why it may or may not be needed. Xin Zhao only just recently got a response because of crazy amount of backlash, do we really need to heat up our pitch forks that much to get a simple explanation about a change? \n\nPersonally for me it looks like Riot gives the cold shoulder when they really don't have to. I am open for a Ryze change but let's talk about it first, I don't like it when a champion is out right dead until they find a way to solve it. We should get a change now! There should be a very small balance team built just for Ryze. A 1.6 billion dollar company can't make this happen? Another example I'll give is Mordekaiser, no one plays him now at all, Riot seem like they are in the mood to change him again but it's slow ... again. Another dead champion. It's times like this that I really question why I support this company and continue playing this game I can see so many other companies do PR and really communicate on their changes in a more respectful and dignifying way. I guess I just have a problem with favoritism.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2016-02-03T01:49:59.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until they give him a proper full scale rework, he's still going to have the same problems and he's either going to be abusively strong or have to be handicapped badly enough to not degrade the rest of the game.\n\nIt's just better this way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blastermine","date":"2016-02-02T22:48:43.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this the third time that Ryze got nerfed for being too strong in competitive play even though he has a low solo queue win-rate?
