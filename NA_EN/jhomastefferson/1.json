Two games? And I wasn&#039;t even that toxic. Maybe in game two I could see it, but game one I still don&#039;t see how my actions warrant such disciplinary action. Riot, please send all of the chat logs. I want an actual &quot;community&quot; review of the facts here.\r\n\r\n This is abhorrent that I&#039;m being treated this way. It&#039;s unfair that I can&#039;t even respond to personal attacks during game without being considered toxic, even if I do so without bad language.  And its loathsome that the condemnation of things against the summoner&#039;s code in game is also considered &quot;against summoner code&quot;. That&#039;s like saying rape is bad, but you shouldn&#039;t tell rapists they&#039;re bad. That&#039;s like saying thievery is bad, but when you see someone stealing something, you shouldn&#039;t yell &quot;thief!&quot; and attempt to stop them then call the police, you should just call the police. That&#039;s like it being illegal to ride in the passing lane, so when you&#039;re riding with someone doing it, you just call the police instead of telling them that it&#039;s illegal. It&#039;s a retarded method of thinking.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-06-14T02:01:55.052+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, basically, the problem here is that instead of trying to defuse the situation, all you did is continue to antagonize Ahri and likely make things worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-06-14T02:22:14.649+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're responsible for your own behavior, no matter how others are acting.
