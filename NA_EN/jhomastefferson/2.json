Her teamfight is still great, and the ability to force people to scatter is a key function of her kit, but with lowered AP on current Zhonya you can't expect to actually burst or have meaningful damage without teammates, something old Morg used to be able to do and current Morg struggles with on a first item buy Zhonya if needed to survive.\n\nI find just enough HP to survive mid game teamfights and building Zhonya 3rd or even 4th is more useful as a mid game item, since rooting until the next game starts usually has enough benefits that your team can play around the picked target. As a support I could argue Zhonya is more useful since extending deep into the enemy team and ulting/Hourglass forces them to scatter or get stunned, allowing your team to pick up extra damage/kills from it. However, you're still super dead as a support Morg at that point. \n\nI digress though, we're talking about her E. \n\nMorg is a tactical pick who will always be okay in lane, be it bot or mid, because of her kit. You may never expect her to win lane, but you should always expect her to be relevant due to the combination of skills she has to offer engage and disengage. Building a team that doesn't have a spell strong enough to pop her E on a carry is a noticeable risk in champion selection depending on what your team is trying to draft together. Just as picking Morgana offers very long cooldowns (even with CDR) to counter her. \n\nUntil, or if (I don't work on champ design or reworks) Morgana has a rework, expect her to fill that duality of an average midlaner who will hold it down and start fights, or a support who gives a get-out-of-jail free card every 15 seconds or so late game, and once her E/Q are down, has no defensive capabilities but to all-in or flee.\n\nPoke her with physical damage. Bait out her E and then crush her once it's clear. Make her burn long cooldowns on the threat of being killed. Her E isn't a huge problem if you figure out how each player decides to uses it in game, then abuse it. Perhaps that's too much attention needed to do the job, but that's an easy way to play around her.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2016-11-07T23:51:06.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Just because her e and q are down doesn't mean I or my team can go in.\n\nBy the time the shield runs out, the out of position-ness that we were trying to capitalize on will be gone, and we still cant just dive with all 5 into the fight cuz she can ult zhonya.","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-11-08T00:39:20.608+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JhomasTefferson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8R5AZ5f2,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2016-11-07T23:51:06.877+0000)\n\n> By the time the shield runs out, the out of position-ness that we were trying to capitalize on will be gone, and we still cant just dive with all 5 into the fight cuz she can ult zhonya.\n\nThen she's working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2016-11-08T01:06:09.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"so how does one punish mistakes by her or her teammates, if those mistakes are negated with black shield?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-11-08T02:17:05.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once she casts black shild on one person, the rest of the team instantly loses the chance to be immune to CC for a short while (barring some execptions like Sivir and Banshee's).\n\nForce her to shield someone, then kill someone else (Morgana is a good target, which then prevents any more CC immunities while she is dead).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-07T23:41:44.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/xoCeI02","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-11-07T22:35:08.860+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Morgana is balanced has been since her inception  when they give her an VGU.

She is fairly easy to shut down, you just need to focus fire her before she gets into place with her Ult. You either force her Zhonya's and then kill her when its done or you kill her before she can ult+zhonya's.  \n\nBtw her shield blocks 350 + 70% AP, the average Morgana (support) builds {{item:3092}} {{item:3157}} as far as AP goes and gets roughly 15 AP from Runes with i think 15 AP from Natural Talent. Which means she has about 150 Ap at level 18, 70% of that is 105 so her shield blocks about 455 AP damage. That is a lot of shield for sure but if we look at what it takes to break it, it is actually not that much.  \n\nLets look at a high win rate mage, Annie. Average build and runes for Annie are {{item:3027}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3135}} with 15 AP from runes and 15 AP from Masteries. So a total of 715 Ap (Rabadons 35% boost, but my math could be wrong). Annie's Q deals 220 +80% AP, so 792 magic damage. Shield broken, with one ability not counting Luden's proc.  \n\nSince that is a common build on a lot of mages we will just use it on a few more, like Brand who's Q would deal around 590 damage, not including burn. Vel'koz Q deals 669, Syndra Q 760, Ziggs 719, etc. Obviously not all of those champions build pure AP but as you can see they would only need to build about 500 AP to break her shield with only 1 ability. \n\nNow if you are talking about Mid Morgana a common build is {{item:3027}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3089}} which is about 640 AP (with runes/masteries). So her shield would block 798 magic damage, that is a helluva lot more shield but even so it would take 2 abilities to break it. For a champion like Brand all you would need to do is E then W then Q and you would stun her. Syndra would need to Q then W then E and it would stun her. Annie would only need to hit her twice before being able to stun her. Most of the time, those are the normal combos for those mages anyways.  \n\nThe shield is used to help an ally escape a single CC or engage without fear of being stopped. It is not really meant as a shield against magic damage, because most mages can break it with 1 or 2 abilities. Yes you can't just throw CC at her shield, but if you are smart about how you attack a Black Shielded opponent, it isn't really much of an issue by itself. If you are being zoned off by her shield, you are not playing correctly.  \n\nHonestly though all my math could be wrong because I am very tired and did most of this in my head, so please someone feel free to correct me.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2016-11-08T01:02:45.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't have an issue with her ult, w or q.

I was showing you how you deal with her shield. It only blocks multiple CC's if you are dumb enough to throw multiple CC at a Black Shielded opponent. I was not showing you its shield strength for fun, it was so you could see that its not hard to get around her shield. You hit the opponent with 2 abilities AND THEN use CC or just CC another opponent. Remember in a Teamfight there are multiple people attacking targets, so only 2 people need to use 1 ability each and then you can break her shield.  \n\nI understand that throwing CC at an opponent only for her to shield it, can be upsetting, but you need to adjust your playstyle. If there is a morgana around it may not be the wisest choice to just use all your CC willy nilly. You need to fake her out, throw one ability at her and then another at her ADC. She can only shield one person so if you play mind games with her you can get her to waste her shield.
