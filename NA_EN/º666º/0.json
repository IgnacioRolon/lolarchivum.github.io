How you guys find out the right items priority to fight enemy team? I am real bad at math to calculate what would be the best items while facing certain champions.\n\nI am good when it come down to control / reaction as i been playing Starcraft / brood war / dota (cs+deny) most of my childhood so when it come down to control, i am fairly good.\n\nMy big issues it the item buying order with every type of roles and which item to buy in certain situations.\n\nIs there anywhere i could read bout which item is good in certain situation with each champions /v versus X champions? Like complete in dept guide?\n\nThis could be awesome to move out of Bronze as of right now, i really worth Bronze and i wont blame others when i know i am a big part of the problems in most of my games with such a lack of knowledge.\n\nThanks guys and wish you a nice week end","replies":[]}
