Are you using any extensions that could be blocking it?  You could have a caching issue as well, so I recommend starting with [clearing your cache ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies)as your first step.  You can also try Incognito or another browser to see if that could work.
