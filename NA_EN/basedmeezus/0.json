Does anyone else have any similar issues. does anyone have a solution/fix to this? I can't really play in windowed mode. also does anyone else know how i can play this on a windowed fullscreen mode?\r\n\r\nI'm running a late 2013 Mac Book Pro retina. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks. i'll try to record the next game and upload it so u can see what i'm talking about","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T00:16:00.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've never heard of this issue happening in-game.

Something weird and odd happened. when i started recording, it would no longer freeze. but as soon as i would stop the recording, it would go back to freezing when not moving the mouse. this only ever happens if i tab out either during the loading screen or ingame. 1 fix i've had which is pretty annoying is closing the game and reconnecting back.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-31T21:13:23.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.. you mentioned above that this was similar to an issue we brought up in the service ticker in the past.
