Where I&#039;ve seen there are good players but also like really bad players in that division, maybe Bronze would benefit from a division below instead of being automatically placed in Bronze V. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve also always wondered why toxic people don&#039;t have their own queue/games\r\nIn Dota2 you&#039;re placed in &quot;Low Priority Queue&quot; if you&#039;re reported/toxic\r\nWhere you have to play and complete 3 games playing with other toxic players in order to return to the normal population. I believe this would resolve the issues in league as well.","replies":[]}
