May I ask why?\nInsurance Agent: You are at a high risk of an accident. I mean, it might never happen but it&#039;s a high risk. \nArbiter/Warden: Oh ok. That&#039;s fine. \n\nHonestly, you guys should only be acting if the discussion gets out. Not be like &quot;hurr hurr, lemme use my fortune telling powers *flip a coin* and lock the thread preemptively because ** I solely believe the likelyhood of the thread to get derailed is high even if it never does** .  As it is right now it is like the thread/topic is suppressed. \n\nDefinition of a Warden: \n\nA person responsible for the supervision of a particular place or thing or for ensuring that regulations associated with it are obeyed. \n\nRules of General Discussion Political: \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/OTnnE4bL-4132017-update-to-political-social-issue-discussions\n\nThere were no inadequate trades between the people involved in the thread, other than asking Canadians their opinion which was respectfully accepted. And go ahead and lock all threads if someone says \"This seems like bait to me\" even if a group of people are having a civil discussion in that thread aside from the person saying \"This seems like bait to me\" or \"inbf4 lock\" which I should say are the baiters derailing the discussion from the actual topic. \n\nMight as well ask Keyru to rename you guys to Sages / Witches of GD.\nSince unlike insurance companies, I doubt that you guys got trained or possess access to any empirical data to support the preemptive action. \n\nHere's the subject thread for those wondering:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/RlZzAsp5-your-move-canada-at-least-trump-is-not-a-hypocrite\n\nWardens---\n\nWhat they're actually doing:\nhttp://www.sunsigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fortune-teller.jpg\n\nWhat they should be doing:\nhttp://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/04/15/102590002-speeding-ticket.530x298.jpg?v=1495047288\n","replies":[]}
