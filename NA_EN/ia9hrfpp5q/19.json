Those people are trapped in that country... TRAPPED. N.Korea regulates all resources to its people and everything in there looks like its currently 1955 while the rest of the world (most) is in 2017. \n\nhttps://forum.smartcanucks.ca/attachments/canadian-contests/184281d1372952750-club-q-q107-loyalty-club-southern-only-v4-american-flag-bald-eagle.jpg\n\nTime for USA and the allied nations to dispense some Democracy.
