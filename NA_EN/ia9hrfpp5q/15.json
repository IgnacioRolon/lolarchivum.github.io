[Spoilers]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why the hell is the theme song so &quot;cheer&quot; like?\nI mean even the lyrics aren&#039;t &quot;cheerful&quot;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYZfeY8Vg0E&amp;t=2s\n\nTA-TA-TA-TA-tatattatata-TA!\n\nBasically all the characters are &quot;psychologically broken&quot; one way or the other, or and if you weren&#039;t broken you&#039;re either a secondary character not really relevant or have been killed off. \n\nAlso stop giving Shinji the &quot;he&#039;s the worst protagonist ever&quot; no he is not, have you ever been forced to do something everyone wanted you to do but you didn&#039;t want to? Instead of making you choose a college major he&#039;s basically told to pilot EVA. I liked Evangelion and I liked Shinji&#039;s representation of being psychologically terrorized. \n\nThough I liked Evangelion, I still feel that Rahxephon spoke a lot more to me... but then again the story is a bit more fleshed out and they have less &quot;comedy&quot; and more &quot;psychological terror&quot; never gonna forget the &quot;dream sequence&quot; rahxephon episode where the girl asks him to lick the sauce off her lips xD\n\nSpecial Mentions Evangelion Moments\n\n1. When Eva eats\n2. When Asuka gets Hallelujah&#039;d by Arael\n3. That almost 2 min scene of Shinji holding Tabris in his hand before... \n\nSpecial Mentions 2 \n\n1. Nice Seizure Inducing Episode - The episode Shinji gets absorbed by Eva\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FTNH9I0.jpg\n\nhttps://img.memecdn.com/neon-genisis_c_155848.jpg","replies":[]}
