I play ranked nearly every day and have for months now. I usually even play more than once a day, up to many times. I&#039;m afraid there is a bug and I might get demoted for no reason.

I reached out to some people, and it seems like we had some faulty demote messages sent out. \n\nDon't worry, as long as you keep playing those ranked games you won't get demoted for \"not playing\"!","replies":[]}]}
