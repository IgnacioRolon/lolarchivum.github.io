I purchased 2 NA MSI icons for me and a friend for 500RP thinking that that's not a bad price if we do get the IP boost. Shortly after the client updated and made the icon 1IP. This was a glitch / bug that riot is responsible for. After submitting a ticket about it I was told by a support specialist that it is not riots policy to refund RP for summoner icons. Again, my RP was spent BECAUSE riot made a mistake, not me. This is outrages that they can refuse a refund for their mistake in their program. This is awful customer service and even worse business practices.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-03T17:59:17.626+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey McBallard! \n\nSorry for the delay here.

They're treated as if they're Legendary Skins and worth 1820RP, and they're given essence values for upgrade/disenchant accordingly. In reality though, they're only worth about 750-975RP, which you guys reflect whenever they come out of the vault - how come they're still treated as if they're \"modern\" Legendaries in Hextech though? Shouldn't they be adjusted according to their up-to-date RP value?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-03T23:38:51.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's based on the original price of the skin, not discounts that occur during sales.","replies":[{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2016-05-04T05:09:59.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-04T16:33:06.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully sooner than that. :P","replies":[{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2016-05-04T17:22:15.548+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-04T18:14:19.334+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"O__O You may be the most interesting person I've met on here. \n\nThat's actually not great, that you haven't seen a skin for your favorite champions.

Why is it worth 1520 essence? It's not because it's legacy, because if it was, all Legacy skins would be different prices. It just doesn't really make sense.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2016-05-03T19:12:34.074+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"If you want a useful response, and not just a cold shoulder by Riot, try seeing their perspective and make a discussion asking why this happened and if there could be an exception.
