Not in terms of it being bad, but in terms of it being off the charts broken. I know a couple of nerfs to it that brings it in line. One instead of the sheen  proc on it being 2 seconds per proc, make it 4, or nerf the damage off the sheen proc","replies":[{"poster":"Lyndris","date":"2017-05-03T18:55:10.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"2nd most expensive item, it does give plenty of stats but with the exception of AS it has mediocre stats, just lots of them. at 18 the MOST damage it can do is an extra 260 physical, at which point armor for even squishies is like 70 so like 38% reduction... It is a HUGE AF first item spike, but i feel it is fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-03T19:11:33.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucasman","date":"2017-05-03T19:07:41.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just make phage and stinger like 50 gold more expensive so the item costs just a bit more, sheen is so powerful early I think it should be either 1200 or 1250. Could even keep combined cost up only 100 instead of 350 more","replies":[]}]}
