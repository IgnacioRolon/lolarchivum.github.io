The first time I launch the game to loading screen after turning on my computer, I receive a HUGE lag spike. Massive input lag, discord voice stutters, twitch streams freeze, other tasks unresponsive, and it continues until I get into the loading screen. After this, the lag does not occur for any other matches until I restart my computer again.\r\n\r\nI've isolated to just the game and the lag is the same, task manager doesn't indicate abnormal CPU consumption either. \r\n\r\nMy computer is pretty high end, 4790K @ 4.7GHZ, EVGA GTX 980, 16 gigs ram, Windows 10 on creator update (but it was happening before then too). Temps remain normal, CPU &amp; GPU \r\n\r\nI've looked around and didn't see anyone else with this problem. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T01:46:51.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned that there wasn't abnormal CPU usage but it's very strange that this only occurs just after you boot up the PC.\n\nEnabling 'Low Specs Mode' in settings is a good temporary fix since that can really help reduce processes and lag, but I want to [**try running a cleanboot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7) of your system to see if something might be interfering towards the beginning. Keep Low Specs Mode disabled, then follow the steps in that guide and see if you still get the slow or laggy client you had before.

If it's specifically only after starting up your computer, then you might want to check which programs are set to automatically start up on launch. You can disable anything that isn't necessary to improve boot times, especially if you want to jump right into a game immediately after starting up.","replies":[]}]}
