I didnt even say a thing about it, the passive wont fit just, but just that, lol, i dont hate, you guys want to accept everything someone says into hate, thats why the game will probably end being full only with toxic players! I said that this skin idea is cool, but it wont fit since ZAC IS FOR JUNGLE, NOT TOP, NOT MID, NOT BOT, his main is jungle.

I actually just came up with an idea myself: liquid metal Zac. Silver skin with a single red eye in the center of his head, MAYBE remove the tendril. His passive will have the blobs sort of melt back into his body instead of the little explosion and the active portion can have him melt instead of explode. The Q can have his hands morph into metal blocks, the W releasing spikes in an AOE, and the ult turning him into one of those crushing blocks you can find in your everyday platformer.
