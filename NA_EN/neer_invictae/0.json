The ratios on his ult, are far too high.\r\nLiterally exploded teams twice with it.\r\nlike the 1st time, i hovered over it to see how much damage it could do, this is at the 30+ minute mark, it was around 1300 total. So i used it\r\nand pretty much instantly got a quadra kill and won the game for my team.\r\nI jsut used it again now, and a took a full health ziggs, down to zero in 1 move. I just feel that its a bit unfair to use his ult when it does 1500+ damage without any charge up time. I mean Nunu&#039;s ult doe a lot, but he needs to charge that shit 1st.\r\n\r\nYeh i feel like i am playing him relatively well, he is extremely fun to play as and to watch in general, his moves seem so crisp and there is a lot of trickery that can go along with it, seriously he jukes better than {{champion:7}} \r\nbut i feel he is definately on the strong side, if just nerfing his ult ratios would do it then thats great!","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-29T12:00:43.798+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Ekko is a problem child \n\n\"We have finally made a champ whose lore and gameplay are matching _exactly _ !!

Each of those ults requires generally requires proper timing, proper setup, and also a noticeable time investment.\n\nExamples\n\nKatarina:  Channeled, easily interrupted, and can also be fairly easy to avoid with mobility skills.  Due to being channeled it is by nature a DoT thus allowing more time to react\n\nFiddlesticks:  Channeled, also easily interrupted, and _incredibly_ easy to avoid with proper vision coverage.  Acts as an AoE DoT which provides ample time to react\n\nKarthus:  Channeled, and requires a hefty setup from his team.  Also generally requires Karthus to die so that he can actually safely cast it.  Provides a very clear particle effect as to when it is about to happening allowing a (fairly large) amount of time to react.\n\nRumble:  Requires very poor positioning on the enemy team (or very poor setting up on the enemy teams part, seriously stop trying to teamfight rumble in thing corridors like the jungle, **it never ends well**!).  Also functions as a DoT meaning that the enemy can avoid a significant portion of the damage if they position well enough.  In order to get quadras or pentas with this on your own you need to either be:  Grossly fed, or you enemy must be incredibly incompetent.\n\nYasuo:  Requires setup from either himself or allies, as his Q is fairly telegraphed and also fairly easy to avoid.  This means that you need at least 1 other person to be fairly skilled (that or the enemy team has to be _incredibly_ stupid and/or very poor at positioning).  Generally speaking Yasuo requires team assistance even after landing his ult as he can (unless very grossly fed) be destroyed fairly quickly and easily, even when moderately fed.\n\nAmumu:  Well.......I have only seen a cheesey full AP amumu once (and I will admit, it was quite terrifying to deal with at times), but his ult generally isn't enough to secure him a quadra on his own (even when moderately fed).  And when I say on his own, I mean Amumu himself all alone and without team assistance.\n\nBrand:  Requires incredibly poor positioning on the part of the enemy and brand generally isn't able to 100-0 an entire enemy team without allied assistance as he is both very fragile and very susceptible to cc due to his lack of mobility.  Unless the enemy team is composed of numbskulls he isn't going to be getting a solo quadra.\n\nFiora:  In my experience, every Fiora I have seen is downright abysmal unless she gets fed.  If she gets fed then her ult does have the potential to get a quadra, although generally this requires her to be grossly fed.  Also, the damage isn't entirely instant allowing for a period of time to react (even though it isn't a fairly large window), and also her penta potential requires on her enemies being fairly dumb.\n\n\nNow then lets compare that to Ekko:\n\nEkko:  His ult is an _instant_ large AoE damage spike (and I do mean _very_ large AoE damage spike) that like many of the above champions rapidly scales up in damage if you get fed.  Now proper usage of his ult does require setup (generally in the form of wards, good prediction skills, and a fair amount of luck as you can never be 100% certain that the enemy will go in certain directions).  However, when it is properly set up, the event happens instantly and without warning.  You literally do not have a second to react before Ekko is just right there ripping anything and everything apart that was near the epicenter of his ultimate.  Now the important fact to remember that it isn't his ult alone that kills the enemies, it is also the way the rest of his kit works that gets involved too.  His W passive allows him to rapidly capitalize on the large burst from his ult (because if you are a squishy caught by his ult, and the ekko is moderately fed, you will be at roughly the 1/3rd HP mark during midgame), then he gets a huge shield and a stun field (which, while the stun field itself is difficult to use, the shield sure as hell isn't), and then his E which if used properly will allow him to avoid any incoming CC from the enemy(unless it is point and click CC of course), and then finally his Q and passive which both slow and will allow him to position himself incredibly quickly around the battle.\n\n\nNow keep in mind, he does have to be moderately fed to 1v4, but in comparison to the above champions he is able to do it in a much much easier fashion than they could ever even hope to do (or, and this is the special mention to Yasuo, were also able to 1v4 in a similar manner but were nerfed to the ground because of it).  Hopefully they wont have to nerf Ekko too hard, but honestly he really does need some number nerfs.\n\nI think they might be more successful in number tweaking Ekko than they were with Yasuo, largely because of the fact that one is an AP character and the other is a crit focused AD character (which seem to be very difficult for Riot to balance without simply making said champion useless).","replies":[{"poster":"BronzeVicious","date":"2015-05-30T15:47:33.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Now proper usage of his ult does require setup (generally in the form of wards, good prediction skills, and a fair amount of luck as you can never be 100% certain that the enemy will go in certain directions).\n\nSo you need good vision, map awareness, skill on the champion, and some dumb luck to even make it work...   mmmm yeah seems OP.
