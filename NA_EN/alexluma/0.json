I&#039;m sad to see him go after a long time of watching his but truly he deserves this. Maybe a singed skin because of his famous spam laugh early on. Or maybe a Darius Dyrus skin just because it is a funny play on words. I just want to see something so he can be remembered by the community as not only being a great player but a great person. He never shut up the hate, he tried to change their minds about him and that is extremely honorable. Although this will never happen because they didn&#039;t win i just wish there was something we could do for him, after all he has done a lot for us.","replies":[{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2015-10-11T20:14:34.765+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":5,"body":"Would be nice, but I doubt Riot wants to start a precedence where every super famous Retired pro gets a skin.

The players chosen to get rings are chosen not just based on how many tournaments they win, but also to an extent their personality, impact on the game, and what they've done to push the game forward and promote it and it's evolution.\n\nDyrus has been, from what I've seen, the rock.\n\nHe's been that guy you want on your team who's just...he's just there. He's consistent and stoic, at least after a fashion. He may get super-mega-ultra camped, but from what I've seen he's not the type to just afk at base when that happens. He knows what he needs to do, and even if it's tough, he does it for the team.\n\nHe has flaws, as everyone does, but I think at least certain aspects of his personality represent desirable traits in a League player. You WANT a consistent laner, someone who's not gonna ping constantly for ganks because the enemy jungler showed once, or because he died once. You want someone who's there, who's your rock. Who's gonna attempt to do his or her job come hell or high water because they know that's what's expected of them, and if and/or when they screw up, they're gonna take that feedback and they're gonna try to improve.\n\nI mean for the love of all that is holy....some of the times he's been ganked and camped? Man...that would break ANYONE. He never seems to break. He seems to just stay strong and do what he can for his team. We'd all like that on our team, and let's be honest: we could all stand to be a little more like the Grand Sensei and take our losses and setbacks with stoicism instead of rage and salt.\n\nBottom line is that I think a skin for a professional player that has made an impact, and has traits we, and Riot, would like to see in more League players, wouldn't be a bad idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatinWarDrumz","date":"2015-10-12T00:28:37.229+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"singed or darius\n\ndefinitely\n\nbut we should do it for all legendary players for their mains - faker leblanc or zed when he retire, doublelift vayne, alex ich ryze etc etc\n\nEDIT: Also LemonNation Braum","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2015-10-12T00:59:08.224+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, Lemon might be better remembered in a skin for Morgana / Karma / Zyra.
