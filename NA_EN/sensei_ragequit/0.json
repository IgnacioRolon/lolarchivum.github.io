There were minions around and it just disappeared. Later another player was also playing brand mid when they encountered the same bug on a roam bot lane which ended but disappointment when their ult didn&#039;t bounce resulting in no kills. I was wondering if anybody else had faced this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T01:00:52.499+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of this issue and you should see a fix soon!

The second game it happened was on Twisted Treeline, my second Brand game of the day, again I ulted Lee Sin when he had minions nearby, and still no bounce. This is quite a big bug considering it happened in both of my Brand games yesterday. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} ","replies":[]}]}
