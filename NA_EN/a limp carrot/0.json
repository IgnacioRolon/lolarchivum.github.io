I want to make it clear that I an NOT here to complain about lag. I get why it happens. It is what it is. My idea, though, is that rito creates some sort of a filter. Said filter would watch the ping of players in games, and should the ping cross a certain threshold x number of times , it tags you in that game. The tag would prevent you from getting placed in a low priority queue. The LPQ is for people who intentionally go afk or leave games. When you cant play the game due to something out of your control, it seems a bit far to be placed in LPQ. For example, in my game yesterday, I was ping wrecked all game until i ultimately disconnected for the remainder of the game. In game, I hit, and i kid you not, 10,000 ping. I get on today to find that I am in LPQ for 5 games @ 20 minutes each. I had no intention of leaving the game. I think a filter would help prevent unneeded LPQ placements.\r\n\r\nAny criticism is welcome.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"A limp carrot","date":"2015-09-18T22:00:08.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get leave buster every time i disco. And its not often. Like 3 times in the past year. And @Treeofwar, I think you should, but only half as much as you wouldve lost for a loss, had you played the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-18T21:38:15.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why, but everytime I've dc'ed from internet, I never get a leaverbuster warning. Not once. I mean, I never ever afk in games for any reason, and we pay for good internet and my computer is hard-wired. Still, time-warner sucks ass.\n\nI got dc'ed the other day. Walked out into jungle to place a pink, and just got disconnected. We were already losing, and I was like \"fuck\". I had to restart my router and wait a good 5-7 minutes for it to come back on and work, and when i logged in the game was over, but I didn't have a leaver buster warning. \n\n? I don't know why some get the warning and I don't. Maybe I'm never gone long enough, or whatever. I'm not sure. but yeah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Treeofwar","date":"2015-09-18T21:08:00.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if its in a ranked game would you lose lp","replies":[]}]}
