Lost Ranked match because of this","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does Teemo cause me to No Longer be able to cast abilities, Cant Cast self shield on myself to protect from dot dmg, skill shots shoot off in directions that I did not aim them, specifically Cast Sion's Q and instead of where i aim it, shoots back wards, on multiple occasions, and then when i'm trying to move, i'm right clicking to move my champ but nothing happens.\n\nALL WHILE I HAVE 53MS. \n\nIf anyone says it's my internet you dont know anything. I'm a Telecommunications Technician FOR MY ISP, there is no connection issue, no network issue, no hop issue in the network, no lag, nothing. 75mbps strong entire time and it's barely even using my UP portion of my connection so it's not like lag. I have no Forward Error Corrections which are errors ATT's network routers and such auto corrected, no Loss of Link between any of the servers, I have no % of error or signal loss on the downstream or upstream of my connection. nothing. My ISP if fine. But all this happens in a ranked match and causes me to lose for no reason. \n\nOnly plausible explanation is Riot secretly buffed Teemo to deflect directions of Skill shots, Have a Silence now, and effect my auto pathing/movements..... which i doubt....","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T01:09:11.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned a lot of possible network issues there, but this sounds suspiciously like packet loss to me.
