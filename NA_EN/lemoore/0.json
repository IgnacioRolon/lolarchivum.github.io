I tried restarting my computer so all I ask is that you don't ask me to do so. Its something similar when I use FL Studio and switch to the ASIO sound driver and until I close FL or switch the sound driver it uses the issue persists. I just don't see how anything similar to this can be happening to me in LoL. Thanks in advance for your help!\r\n-Lemoore","replies":[{"poster":"husktoucher","date":"2016-05-13T04:33:43.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have a third party programme in the background that is trying to manage your audio and causing your issues.

Can you provide a little more detail on what you mean by \"won't let me watch videos or play any music\"? Do you mean that videos just won't start playing or that they play correctly, but no sound comes out?  Also, do you have sound within League of Legends normally and it's only external sounds are not available?","replies":[]}]}
