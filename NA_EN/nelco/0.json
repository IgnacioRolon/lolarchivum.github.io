And CS alone.  The passive on it is a stacking 12 second pause on the passive quest stacks for every cs you take, meaning your only options to get a ward item for your team is to:\r\n\r\n1.  not cs and let minions and the enemy take your tower while you try to poke them down\r\n\r\n2.  your jungler stops jungling and you support him\r\n\r\n3.  you sell your support item and start re-stacking one of the other two support items, putting you really far behind\r\n\r\nOne of two changes should be made.  My ideas were to either make the 12 seconds non-stacking so you don&#039;t have a 70 second pause stacked on each wave, so just a resetting 12 second timer, or in the event a player disconnects during a 5v5 the 12 second debuff goes away entirely.  Why kick a 4v5 team while they&#039;re down anyway?  Heck, the passive as it is during a 5v5 is dumb anyway.  It punishes a support for last hitting minions under tower while they wait for their ADC to return back to lane.  Even when it was 350 gold it was still a risk to buy, because at least one player DC&#039;s during any given match nowadays it seems, odds are it is gonna be your ADC. \r\n\r\nOr maybe I&#039;m dumb, let me know what you think.  Either way I&#039;ve stopped playing support this season.  It is just not what it used to be.\r\n\r\n{{item:3303}} {{item:3303}} {{item:3303}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wizard Blaze","date":"2018-08-01T23:33:28.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive of that item made me shift to go buy {{item:3301}} .
