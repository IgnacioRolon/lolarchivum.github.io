Riot fixed it. Great. However, it looks like the fix introduced another bug. I play Brand regularly (actually, exclusively) and after the most recent patch, his ulti is often not bouncing at all. That is, his ulti is not bouncing despite there being targets around the primary target.\r\n\r\nI believe it happens when the primary target is a champ and blazed; my guess is, in fixing the previous bug, Riot made it so Brand&#039;s ulti will only bounce to another champ if the primary target is a blazed champ (as opposed to prioritizing champs, which is what the skill is supposed to do). Problem is, sometimes there isn&#039;t a second champ around, so the ulti doesn&#039;t bounce at all.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I&#039;m wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-04T18:17:39.590+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nSo, this definitely isn't in the realm of skins, so I don't have a ton of context here, but wanted to pop in and let you know that I've gone ahead and checked the status of this issue.\n\nIt's a known issue on our end. It appears that it'll be resolved in patch 6.3 if all goes according to plan!","replies":[{"poster":"Lakjin","date":"2016-02-05T03:43:21.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please fix it as soon as possible.

Not only does it not bound but can cost you many kills because the random nature of when it doesn't and might bounce.

I thought it may have been a problem with the enemy having Hexdrinker and the interaction with the spell shield.  \n\nBut did you find this happening even when enemy did not have {{item:3155}} or {{item:3156}} ? \n\nI do recall it being able to bounce between champions.  But not in 1v1 when I would rely on bounces to minions","replies":[]}]}
