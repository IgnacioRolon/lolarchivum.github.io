I dodge because someone picks an ahri support and declares in chat that theyre going to go mid no matter what or feed. I have no choice but to lose the game and get tilted while losing my promo&#039;s or wait 30 minutes to play. We all know that these toxic people appear and are the #1 reason for dodging games. Can you reduce the timer on it so it doesnt go from 6 minutes &gt; 15 &gt; 30.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-12-24T09:32:48.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AUTO fuckingg FILL boys.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buzhidog","date":"2016-12-24T09:27:34.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, it should be reduced with summoner rep or something.
