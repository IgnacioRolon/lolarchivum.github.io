I snowball hard from roaming, especially when my team keeps an enemy mid laner interested in trying to get a kill and I can shockblast them through the FoW. I always out CS my lane opponent, snowball out of control, help push objectives, but the end game always stalls. I'm not a rager, I don't get pissed because I know I make mistakes sometimes. I used to have a bad issue with getting extremely fed and overdoing it in a fight instead of backing off and playing safe. Or staying around too long because I don't think they can kill me. I remember specific games where I have thrown it all by myself because I was huge, while my team was not, and overstayed and died costing us the game. \n\nWhen I am jungling, I used to always want to get fed and carry. But once the tank meta came around, it helped me understand that more supportive play was my playstyle, as I climbed from Bronze 3 to Silver 1 in a few months. So now I tend to give more kills over to laners, especially if they are already behind. Nothing is worse than playing with people who gank, your ignite is on and they auto the person before the last tick goes off. That's annoying to me, especially if you're already behind in CS or kills and need that shutdown gold. I know I am Silver for a reason, but sometimes I just can't fathom how a lot of people don't understand that it's an issue if everybody else isn't fed to give kills away. I see it almost every game where 1 person takes all the kills, dies, then we lose because we're 2 items behind the enemy team in every role. \n\nPersonally, I think it's harder for me to win on Jayce because it's hard NOT to get kills. Sometimes my teammates just can't reach the opponent like I can, or even out duel somebody. Jayce has become an insanely strong dueler depending on how you build him. It just gets frustrating because I don't know what's holding me back from getting into Gold. I've gotten so close multiple times with hitting Silver 1, getting 80 LP then going on a massive losing streak and eventually getting demoted. I did the basics to get up to Silver from Bronze like warding more, learning how to build versus certain team comps, focusing on a smaller champion pool, etc. That worked for me fine, but regardless of how skilled I am at my roles, I still can't get out of Silver.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2015-12-16T21:25:23.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's about pushing advantages when you get kills, either joining your team to force a 5v4 and win it, or taking an objective or two afterwards (mid tower then dragon, or you take top tier 2 turret while your team pushes down bot turret, etc.)\n\nIt's about pressure. You wanna make sure the opponent has to choose between multiple bad decisions.

I'm not blaming my teammates, but it does make me mad when I am fed and split pushing and they're still conserving mana trying to slow push waves out, even though the entire team is chasing me top lane. I literally have to tell them after the fact because I can't type while running away that they need to be pushing. Then they start pushing hard, the team collapses on them and they die also. It just doesn't make sense, and I can't compensate that much for everybody on the team. I feel like there's only so much I can really do in a game, regardless of how well I do or how many towers I take down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Twil1ght Fades","date":"2015-12-16T21:35:06.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 50% win rate isn't bad, it's normal.

I play Jayce top, Rek'Sai/Lee Sin jungle (tanks), Orianna mid, Thresh/Braum/Nautilus support and Lucian/Quinn ADC. When I play Orianna, I usually get more assists than kills. The only 2 champions I play often I average more kills than assists are Shaco and Jayce. So I try my best to play around the team, just a lot of times it's poor positioning on a carries end that makes us lose. Because with how the meta is now, having an ADC die at 29 minutes is like a 45 second respawn timer. And when the other team has a Tristana, towers fall like flowers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"D rok","date":"2015-12-16T21:31:26.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean... Laning is just one phase of the game.  And arguably the less important one.  Maybe more important this season.  \n\nBut you winning lane is not always a big deal if your laner is going something utility-based, or late-game focused.  It's also not as big a deal if your other lanes don't do so hot.  Or if your team can't group for objectives or capitalize on your successes.  \n\nMy best advice is try to communicate with your team.  Let your team know when you feel strong and want to group.  Look at your team comp and find out if you're at a good enough spike to make some pushes.  Find out what you're supposed to be doing, and what your team's best options are.  \n\nThrowing a game can sometimes just happen by not doing anything at all.  Trying to let the win come to you doesn't always work.  \n\n\nAs a final thought, in that general arena of elo, Jayce tends to lane really well, but is sometimes an odd fit into a team composition, and theoretically tends to fall off a bit (Could be contested).  Pushing your early game advantage is a good idea.  And letting your team know when you feel like it's time to push/help/do objectives can be vital for early game champs.","replies":[]}]}
