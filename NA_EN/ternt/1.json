The reason they're discounted on release is because back when the new price tier was announced, there was a LOT of lashback from the community over it.

How does this differ from a 975 RP skin, in your opinion? I'm more curious on your perception than anything 'cause sure, we have our guidelines, but I think it's important to understand perception of them as well.\n\nPersonally, I just want another go-over of all the skins to have them placed in the proper tiers. Certain skins, mostly the release skins for champions released before 2014, (Lulu, Fiora, Naut, Hecarim etc.) are all egregiously outside of what the price tiers categorize them as. Similar to Armor of the Fifth Age Taric, if these skins have model or particle changes they are negligible and not evident enough to warrant them being 975 skins. (Muay Thai and Dragon Fist Lee, Dynasty Ahri, Imperial Lux, Silverfang Akali, Full Metal Pantheon... the list goes on...)\n\nSkins released in the past two years have been MUCH more consistent, but that shouldn't justify older skins not being properly categorized. If you compare GB Morgana, to Blood Moon Akali, I guarantee you you're going to say the GB skin is easily a 975 quality, and the BM skin has no reason to be 975 (other than popularity perhaps?) and that's the problem. Some of these skins are popular and improperly categorized. Some of these skins are probably awful sellers (Subterranean Naut) and are improperly categorized. And some skins just don't seem to have the particles needed to be 975 skins. So there doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason on older skins being priced the way they are, even if newer skins fit the categories much more accurately.\n\nIMO, voice processing shouldn't be an extra 375 RP. If the main difference between a 750 skin and a 975 skin is particles (which are highly noticable, and readable), then I see no reason why we as players should pay even more than the price of particles just for voice processing on some skins. I get it if the particles go above and beyond a normal skin, (Battlecast particles, Steel Legion particles, Pool Party particles) and maybe a little oomf in recall animations or joke animations. Those things, the above-and-beyond particles+animations are worth the extra 375, not Voice Processing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-28T21:55:17.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe it's because I started in beta, but I think that the 1350 price tier is kinda stupid.
