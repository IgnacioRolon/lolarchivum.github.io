I can't reset them. I basically have to tell my team we need to surrender. Usually they don't understand and so I end up playing a 20-30 minute match where I'm completely outmatched and have no hope of being able to combo. This used to be an infrequent problem, happening maybe once every 15-20 matches, but now it's almost every match.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T20:32:09.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmmmmm it sounds like your client is having a hard time pulling your hotkeys from the servers. I want you to try resetting your config files again in a specific order, so try following these steps and let me know if it helps!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Jamie Crypt","date":"2017-06-11T18:03:09.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look at the threads I linked to in my post, you'll see this was the solution you gave me last time. It works temporarily, but it isn't a permanent fix. Please advise, is there any way to fix this on a more permanent basis? It happens too frequently now for this fix to be practical.","replies":[]}]}]}
