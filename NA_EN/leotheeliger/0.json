But how much longer are we gonna keep getting weekly quests for worlds? I just don't want them to be over all of a sudden and I didn't make it. I bought the Master Pass but I am finishing this week with 290 points. As you all know I need 320. Are we gonna get another week of Quests?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T17:59:30.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Per the[ Worlds Missions announcement](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/esports/esports-editorial/worlds-2017-missions-loot), you'll have until the day after Finals so roughly Nov 5.
