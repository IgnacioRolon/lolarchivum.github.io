This was basically from just being an instigator and low level (albeit constistent) badgering. No hate or racism or zero-tolerance words.\r\n\r\nThis led me to getting honor level 1 and then 0 pretty fast. I &quot;unlocked&quot; honor pretty quickly, only took a week or so if I remember correctly. As honor came out in earlyish July (right?), this means I probably re-unlocked my honor in earlyish August. So, thats been almost 5 months of sitting at honor 0. I&#039;ve gotten no more chat restrictions, let alone a 2 week ban. Is it normal to take this long to get up to honor level 1? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Reforming ape","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-12-18T19:16:10.031+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"I looked at your account, and you have a lot of unsportsmanlike games that just weren't severe enough to warrant a penalty. You actually have to be sportsmanlike .. or at the very least not unsportsmanlike, to progress through the system.\n\nOne pattern I noticed is that you constantly harass people on your team with negative scores, and accuse them of 'initing'. It's a pretty consistent behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"sleepysithlord","date":"2017-12-18T19:21:48.838+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-18T19:55:54.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is useful to know, now we can tell this to people when they make posts like the OP's post.\n\nThanks for the info Tantram! now we'll be more able to help users we come across who post about their lost honor.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-12-18T20:19:51.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!!!
