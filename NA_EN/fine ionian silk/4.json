Currently, I am sitting at Silver in both solo/duo and flex (Silver IV in S/D, Silver I in flex), and I plan on getting to gold in flex this season. However, with that comes the question of borders and rewards. If I'm Gold in flex, will I receive a gold border and the Victorious skin? Or is there a different sort of system in place?\r\n\r\nThank you in advanced!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T18:36:39.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't announced anything for this season's rewards, so can't really say for sure.  If you received Gold in one mode then you should be fine, but can't really say for sure yet.  Bookmark our [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page as we draw closer to the end, we should have more info then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Douglas Funnie","date":"2017-09-05T08:30:58.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you reach gold in any ranked ladder, you'll receive a gold border and the victorious skin.  There will be extra rewards for those who reach Gold+ on both Solo/Duo Queue and Flex queue.","replies":[]}]}
