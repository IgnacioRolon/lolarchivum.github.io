If you have another keyboard, try swapping it out.  This will help us determine if the issue is with teh hardware itself.  \n\nYou could also have a corrupt config folder causing problems as well, which a reset could fix:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ooDarKnightooo","date":"2017-02-04T02:42:05.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem recently, and I never had this problem before this January.","replies":[{"poster":"Fine Ionian Silk","date":"2017-02-04T02:47:47.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having it last year, but recently it's been more frequent.","replies":[{"poster":"ooDarKnightooo","date":"2017-02-04T02:52:25.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mrs Susanoo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=5oAY63OQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-04T02:47:47.872+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve been having it last year, but recently it&#x27;s been more frequent.\n\nWell, maybe because I started playing this game since last December XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}
