Now my client is in a loop of \"being restored to an older version\" message to \"unable to patch\" message, making me unable to access my client.

I know a lot of players have suggested it as a workaround, but your OS clock is important to a lot of features in and out of League.  Doing so can cause you more problems, including getting into a game.  Loss prevention is not active and you may be prone to Leaverbuster.  Please take care in doing this, at your own risk!\n\n> **UPDATE @ 10:53am PT** In some cases, [reconfiguring your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) may resolve the issue for some players.  \n\nIn the meantime, stay tuned on our pinned thread or [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page for updates.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"NaniniBarros","date":"2017-08-12T18:00:16.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems I am able to log in for some time (like five minutes) before a message appears asking/forcing me to restart the client, so in a way I'm still stuck in a loop.
