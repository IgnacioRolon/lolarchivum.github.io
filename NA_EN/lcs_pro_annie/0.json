I have only a small time in game development and I could fix like 10 of these issues in a DAY by myself.\nIf the new client was so much better, then the tools to implement these changes should be even better!\nIt shouldn't take 1,000 veteran game devs over 6 months to do shit that an amateur can do in one evening.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lcs pro Annie","date":"2017-05-16T20:50:07.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Literally paying people money to work on this for weeks at a time and they crap a big turd right in a million players faces","replies":[]}]}
