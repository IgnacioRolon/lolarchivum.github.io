All champions released last year (only 6 mind you) beside Vel'Koz had some mobility (some extreme case like Kalista too). Most of them also had overloaded kits (this seems to be the norm now).\n\nI don't know what to think of Riot anymore to be honest. To me it seems they are heavily biased in their balance philosophy as soon as mobility is involved because it makes LC$ big plays...\n\nThey want to remove \"no counterplay\" pattern (aka point and click stun and such). I can understand that. Problem is, it's becoming the only way to deal with the insane rising mobility in this game.
