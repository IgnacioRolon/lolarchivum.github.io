I also occasionally notice the same during the loading screen, with the ping suddenly spiking to 500+ for a second or two while sitting in loading screen, once again, not obviously correlating to whether I am still loading, or sitting at 100%, waiting for others to load. This, it seems to me, pretty well precludes display issues, but I'll let you be the judge of relevance here. \n\nAs far as the many changes/adjustments I've made to my system, which I briefly mentioned in the last post, they seem to have had negligible affects on this intermittent severe lag, but provided noticeable improvement in ridding my experience of FPS drops in team-fights, etc., and are part of the sacrifice that I make in playing the game on this laptop. I am o the point now, that excepting these seemingly random lag-spikes, my playing experience is pretty decent, with only very occasional slight FPS drops in crazy team-fight situations, which I can live with, and if nothing else, provide me a ready excuse should I miss my smite steal of baron, etc.  \n\nThe computer I am playing on is an:\n\nHP Pavilion dv4 Notebook PC\nIntel Core i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz\n64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1\n4 GB Ram\n\nRunning an NVidia GEFORCE GT 630M with 2GB ram\n\n\nI hope this information is useful to you in the search for an identification, and hopefully, a resolution of this problem. If there is any other information I can provide that may be of use to you, let me know, and for a nominal fee, or if you ask nicely, (: I will be happy to oblige.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T18:13:06.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still having this issue?

Thank you for the prompt service. It is greatly appreciated.\n\nPerhaps you could help me with one other item: I have occasional severe lag issues in-game that seem mostly to be random, ie., they occur at random times throughout the game, rather than specifically during team-fights, or other moments of increased graphics, or other taxations on my system.\n\nI am not playing on a high-end machine and understand that a certain amount of the lag issues may be local to my machine. With that in mind, I have turned down all the in-game graphics settings to the minimum, and have tweaked all my system's settings to minimalist, even going so far as reducing my refresh rate to 40hz through Intel's graphics settings on my machine. \n\nAll these adjustments (and more) have resulted in a slight overall improvement in performance, yet I still have these intermittent severe lag issues. Numerous times when they have occurred, I analyzed my system immediately, and found no background processes running, or even a spike in memory usage or computing usage. So, I was wondering if some of the issues may have to do with Comcast's routing to Riot, and if that is the case, if there is any hope of a fix for this any time soon. \n\nSome quick Google searches of the keywords of \"League of Legends\" and \"Comcast\" suggest that per-say \"Comcast lag\" has been an issue in times past, with symptoms similar to mine. I also found a suggestion that changing my network adapter driver to the older Windows XP version might help, but found that people that did so gernerally did not find any real improvement, but have no yet tried this myself.\n\nSorry for the long post, but really, I am wondering if there is anything additional remedy that you may know of that I may try in order to fix this issue myself, or if it is a known issue and I am stuck waiting for a resolution.\n\nAgain, many thanks for your prompt assistance and the quick resolution to the login problem.\n\n-Aaron","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T16:22:51.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for giving me a detailed description of what you've already tried to resolve this specific issue, it really does help me decide what steps we can skip. One thing I'm not able to determine is whether you're experiencing FPS drops or latency spikes when the \"lag\" occurs. If you could dive into a bit more specifics around what specific behavior you experience when the issue happens, I can determine whether this is a connection or display issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
