On the map Butcher&#039;s bridge, Riot girl Tristana&#039;s cannon clips through her body and does some pretty insane stuff. I have included a video (720p, forgive?) and will give you instructions on how to create the error again. \r\n1. Enter &quot;Butcher&#039;s Bridge&quot; (Custom or ARAM)\r\n2. Choose Riot girl tristana \r\n3. Use ANY of her emotes, it also works when she stands still sometimes.\r\n\r\nMy friend (shameless plug) rugg1999, has also helped me test. We do not have any of the other skins, so we tested out her base skin. Normal Tristana&#039;s emotes work perfectly normal, according to rugg1999. Note: Cant add an mp4, so heres the link YO. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4EP3FtREclQa05nZkM4eUV3Z0E/view?usp=sharing","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-24T17:44:06.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya coldweirdguy,\n\nThanks for the detailed report!
