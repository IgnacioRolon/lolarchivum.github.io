Like 1-0.5 seconds before death, thr game freezes until death, during this time the game doesn't recognize most commands such as: zilean self ult, summoner heal/barrier, kayle ult, and many other life saving spells.\n\nThis has been going on for many years, and I thought it was just because my laptop is getting a bit old, but now with other people talking about, I know it's not just me.\n\nMy internet is quite solid at 120mbps, so I'm not sure why this is happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Brungus","date":"2016-05-11T01:18:56.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, when it happens as kindred I feel like it won't allow or won't recognize my ult command.

This weird and random delay seems to only happen under turret, and only when I'm low life.\n\nThis hasn't happened very frequently, but enough for me to remember it. I usually get no lag at all, 20 ms ping and ~60 fps, so when I do get delay it's very noticeable to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timmortality","date":"2017-04-15T20:45:02.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, just since a few weeks having this too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nahath","date":"2016-05-10T22:25:39.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a big difference. If everything keeps animating, but it doesn't take commands or show you the most recent behavior from other players, that's typically a network problem. Could be connection speed, ISP problem, firewall, or one of many other things, but ultimately, it's at the network level.\n\nIf the screen completely freezes, that usually indicates a problem with what's happening on the computer itself (CPU, graphics card, hard drive, etc.), which is an entirely different set of troubleshooting steps.\n\nHard to guess, but we recently fixed a somewhat similar problem on my wife's laptop by moving the League installation from the regular hard drive to the solid state drive, since apparently there was some \"feature\" where the regular drive would go into a sleep mode to save power and every time the game had to pull something from it, everything froze up for a second.\n\nOf course, this is only one of very many possible solutions, but I thought I'd share my own experience just in case it helped someone.","replies":[]}]}
