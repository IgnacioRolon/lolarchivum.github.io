I remember this happened before and I was reported by leavebuster. I was just winning my game top lane as heimindinger into singed top. My whole team was winning. I was enjoying the game. Every other application works fine but league of legends just crashes over and over. It says retry disabling your firewall. I don't even have it enabled while I play league. So I am gonna get reported and banned for something I did not do wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"The Loop","date":"2019-10-07T14:43:53.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me as well.. message Riot Support on twitter..
