That uh... doesn't... really respond to well to my point thou.\n\nIf most your issues come from player behaviors the correct solution is to point out that player behavior is a very common issue for you and Riot needs to update their systems for it.\n\n10% toxic PB is massive. \n\nHere is an illustration. The odds of rolling a 1 on a D10 are 10%. Any 1 you see = toxic teammate. Your not in the equation. So 9 open slots. 10% odds one of them is part of the more toxic side.\n\nRoll(9d10)+0:\n8,2,9,9,7,7,9,8,1,+0\nTotal:60\nRoll(9d10)+0:\n1,2,2,9,7,7,3,6,7,+0\nTotal:44\nRoll(9d10)+0:\n5,8,9,3,5,7,1,7,4,+0\nTotal:49\nRoll(9d10)+0:\n6,8,9,8,7,1,2,5,5,+0\nTotal:51\nRoll(9d10)+0:\n2,1,6,8,2,3,10,2,8,+0\nTotal:42\nEdit. here is the site I used to roll dice. https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm\nSee the issue yet?\n\nGets worse. \nMMR is ranges. MM pulls from a range.\nAll you need is 10% toxic in a MMR range and you see same odds as those RNG dice I just rolled.\n\nOh and MMR does not deal with toxicity at all on its own as it objectively works off wins losses and who your vs. So all it does is move toxic accounts down the ladder, if and only IF their behavior cost them consistent losses over wins.\n\nRiot NEEDS to have good player behavior systems and to set rules for ques to be competitive or non competitive in nature.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-05-31T23:46:52.345+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"No, you don't.
