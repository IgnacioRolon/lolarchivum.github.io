I have great feelings towards the mechanical side of the update but not appearance of her classic model. I wanted Fiora to use the same classic skin before she was given the new one. I wanted to see if Fiora can get a traditional skin like Sejuani and Trundle. So this way the veteran Fiora players can still use the old classic but still have the new one on the side. I personally have all of Fiora&#039;s skins and I really loved using the old classic more than the skins. If she can get a &quot;**Traditional Fiora&quot;** skin I would be very happy, especially since she hasn&#039;t gotten a skin in a long time.

However, I could see why some people see it as one.\n\nI read a little of Riot's shpeal about Gangplank. They seem to think that the whole captain Gangplank, or pirate lord theme is just too goofy to be taken seriously. (though I somewhat disagree after the voice over. since the newer quotes point to a more in depth philosophy.) Of coarse it would be completely alienating to the community to completely remove that theme from gangplank. So they created two gangplanks. One before, and after the events of Burning tides. \n\nI actually seen his new skin, and I don't even think it's that bad. (Still like captain better) He's not that fat, though I feel like the splash art doesn't best represent him. The part I don't really like though is the hat. It looks ridiculous, and doesn't fit the pirate theme too well.","replies":[{"poster":"Mixter Yi","date":"2015-08-07T20:07:53.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You misunderstand, they meant old gangplank was too goofy.

I would be willing to bet that the reason this VU isn't completely up to scratch is because from the get go riot knew they wouldn't be making any actual money off this update. they probably just threw it together and said to their designers \"hey, don't worry too much about this one it isn't worth anything anyways\". that being said, thank you for fixing the hair.
