Is it because I'm in California and the servers got moved to the east coast maybe? I really hope it's not that nobody on the entire west coast can expect much better than 65ms =/","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T04:36:04.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The latency you're seeing is fairly normal for the east coast, depending on your ISP and network routing, you could see a ~10ms dip either way in your latency maybe. Your traceroute has some basic information, but I'd like to see an in-depth look at your network routing using a proper traceroute with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/). After loading up the app, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After the trace has run for about 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"ohboyimmaPOOP","date":"2017-01-12T03:29:06.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thank you for being willing to look at the results either way.

After your connection leaves your local network, your latency along your route basically sees consistent spikes in the low 100s before reaching our servers.
