The amount of effort and luck needed to take back a lead or break even relies way too much on how good or bad the enemy plays instead of your own planning and execution. They hold all the cards based off one single small victory when that simply should not be the case. \n\nYou get fucking rich off turret plates now, and turrets themselves still do no damage and can't defend you from a dive.

A 2-0 lead means they don't farm without dying and again, depending on the champion, they can get dove repeatedly with impunity.\n\nIrelia and Darius, same as Riven and Renekton.\n\nAnd that's just top lane. Bot lane has even more of these kinds of match-ups where a 2 kill lead means the lane will snowball massively in a very short space of time with 0 chance of the losing side being able to stop the bleeding much less make some kind of come back.","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-09-10T16:52:55.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FioraWillCarry,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=43YhAuQV,comment-id=000e0001,timestamp=2019-09-10T16:22:49.694+0000)\n>\n> A 2-0 lead is huge.

You're not coming back from that unless the enemy massively throws. And in some match-ups, a 2-0 lead means they can kill you at will whenever they desire and you cannot farm. \n> \n> An example of this kind of match-up is Tryndamere vs Kayle. If Tryndamere gets even a 1 kill lead, he can just dive Kayle repeatedly at will. Nothing she could do and the jungler can't be around 24-7 to help her. \n> \n> Riven vs any squishy is another example of a match-up that is impossible to win if the Riven gets a 2 kill lead. Riven's opponent won't be able to farm at all and depending on who her opponent is, she will be able to dive and kill them over and over with impunity. \n\nDoesn't have to be a squishy. If Riven gets 2 kills up on Garen, then she won the lane unless the Jungler steps in.\n\nHowever, a lost lane, does not equal a lost game. There's two other lanes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2019-09-10T06:20:28.185+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd argue you can't really build back into the game against something like the Irelia that is 2-0 with 50cs. \n\nstun dash r dash dash dash auto dash auto auto dead. &lt;--- .5s too.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonš","date":"2019-09-10T16:29:17.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But you can, you play safe and just farm.
