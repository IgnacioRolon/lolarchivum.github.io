But when I got the \"match found\" pop-up as soon as i got in my client froze, seeing as i lost both games prior and this was my last chance at gold 5 I thought it was only right to make a post, I dont know if there is anything that can be done about this, but i think this is extremely unfair. It's also completely out of character for my computer to do this, hasn't ever happened unless there has been a bug/error that others are experiencing, normally i wouldn't make such a lengthy post about this. but seeing as its close to the end of season 6, i could really use some help. thank you. -Spacejunglerz","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T04:31:22.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, the gold dream! :'(\n\nI understand this can certainly be frustrating when you're so close to hitting your season goals again. I'm sorry to say that I can't revert the loss or put you back in gold manually, but I'm confident you'll get back there with hard work and determination.\n\nIt sounds like your client lost its connection to our servers, so I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a preventative step.
