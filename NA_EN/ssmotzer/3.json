Originally Iceborn\n2. Who is then corrupted by the Void,\n3. Then taken by the Black Mist,\n4. And finally takes up a Darkin weapon.\n\nFirst off - sucks to be them.\n\n----\n## Iceborn -> Void\n\nI'm less familiar with Black Ice, so I'm going to start with 'standard' Iceborn.  Sorry!\nI don't think there's any problem with the idea that an Iceborn could be affected by the Void - being Iceborn doesn't (from what I know) confer any resistance towards the Void, except that it'd be harder for the Void to actually make contact, with Iceborn being so strong and generally very tough.\n\nUnfortunately, unless they are able to stave off the corrupting influence of the Void on a semi-permanent basis (like Kassadin or...) then total overwhelming Void corruption would result in the entity being remade by the Void.  Hard to say how much of the original Iceborn's identity would remain, but physically the entity would likely be incredibly tough, possibly larger than it originally was (depending) and most likely fixated on the continued success of the Void.\n\n----\n## Void -> Black Mist\n\nSo we've got a mostly Void-creature at this point.  Probably humanoid-ish with unnatural strength and toughness.  In comes the Mist.\n\nMost of what we've seen of the Black Mist shows us Harrowing entities bringing the dead back to a twisted, broken, form of 'life' - but that's where we encounter our first issue.  According to Diana's color story, and the promo for Rek'Sai, Void creatures that are killed don't leave a corpse for very long - they near immediately dissolve.  \n\nHrm.  Bit of a show-stopper there.\n\nBut **that's no fun** so let's propose our Void creature is subjected to a slow, debilitating, version of the Mists then.  Now, tricky bit - if the Black Mists draw out the spirit of the entity - does a Void creature have a spirit?  In-game Thresh would say yes, as he shoves them in his lantern like they were candy, but in-universe, that's a tricky question.\n\nAt this point, for the sake of more fun, let's say that yes they do - if only so we can get to the end of the thought experiment!\n\nSpirits from the Harrowing are generally a mix of corporeal and non-corporeal - able to become more of one than the other.  Their form is usually the one that they had in life, more or less (hi, Hecarim, you weirdo) but their eyes glow with an unnatural lambent fire and their skin is translucent and blue-green.  Our Harrowing-Void creature would likely have the same glowing eyes, a mostly humanoid form, and with a bit of creative liscence, its harder/thicker carapace like the armor on Hecarim or Kalista, and the lighter/thinner carapace being the translucent form.\n\nHowever!  Entities from the Black Mist are (I believe) usually *driven* by something - or they are mindless and exist in thrall to another, stronger, Harrowing entity.  The mindless ones we read about in Maokai's color story seem to exist with a drive to snuff out life where-ever they find it, while Kalista exists to take vengeance on behalf of the betrayed.  I contend that our Void entity might not have a strong enough will to be self-driven - and would instead go wherever the 'will' of the greater Black Mist itself would take it.  (It's possible that the mind of the original Iceborn could be strong enough to persist in some twisted form all the way down to this point, but man - what a *will* it would have had to have had!).\n\nFor those having trouble keeping track of my rambling - our entity is a slightly oversized Harrowing version of an incredibly strong, tough, Void entity.  Mostly humanoid with glowing eyes, solid armored carapace sections, and is driven by the will of the Mists as a whole.\n\n----\n## Black Mist -> Darkin\n\nBut there, lying on the ground, is a weapon bound with a Darkin.  So what happens?  Hrm, tricky.  Reeeeally tricky.  Imagine the Harrowing-Void-Iceborn creature sees it as a form of life, and approaches it in its mindless attempt to snuff out life.  It becomes corporeal enough to reach out and touch it... but what happens?  We saw from Varus that the Darkin takes the body or bodies that it has available to it, and if it can overcome the will of the wielder, will remold their physical form to closer serve the Darkin within.\n\nBut does an entity from the Mists *have* a physical form?\n\nI think we might be stretching it a bit far now.  Is a Harrowing creature, when corporeal, a physical creature?  Does it have 'flesh' that a Darkin could control?\n\n----\n## I give up!\n\nAt this point, I have to throw up my arms in defeat.  I don't know!  \nBy this point, we've needed to 'excuse' a few things - \n\n* A Void creature that is able to be taken by the Mists without its corpse dissolving\n* The deep philosophical quandary of whether or not Void entities have 'spirits' that the Harrowing could act on\n\nand now:\n\n* Do entities from the Black Mists have 'flesh' that a Darkin weapon would be able to act upon?\n\nIt all feels like trying to min-max a super crazy D&D character - with half-dragon vampire gnomes and the like :)","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-12-29T05:19:11.568+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what happens if our Harrowing-Void-Iceborn-Darkin abomination ascends Mount Targon and is possessed by an Aspect?\n\nYou know what, let's add Viktor's mind-controlling dive suit to the equation as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-12-29T05:22:31.369+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epicurus,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3YLlgrHB,comment-id=00080002,timestamp=2017-12-29T05:19:11.568+0000)\n>\n> So what happens if our Harrowing-Void-Iceborn-Darkin abomination ascends Mount Targon and is possessed by an Aspect?\n> \n> You know what, let&#x27;s adds Viktor&#x27;s mind-controlling dive suit to the equation as well.\n\nIs this before or after their Ascension ritual, do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2017-12-29T06:49:37.699+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3YLlgrHB,comment-id=000800020000,timestamp=2017-12-29T05:22:31.369+0000)\n>\n> Is this before or after their Ascension ritual, do you think?\n\nIt depends if it has vastaya blood or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-12-29T06:29:24.765+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-zephyr}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-12-29T13:51:34.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and then goes to Shurima and gets ascended\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-12-29T01:15:59.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3YLlgrHB,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-12-29T00:41:23.861+0000)But there, lying on the ground, is a weapon bound with a Darkin.

I'd personally question whether a Darkin -- an entity that can be imprisoned in a *weapon* -- even *needs* flesh, really, or whether we've only seen flesh-based Darkin because most weapons are only wielded by those with physical forms. Given that all Darkin seem to struggle on a psychic battlefield for dominance and *then* remake the form in their own image, I can honestly see a situation where a Shadow Isles spirit becomes the host of the Darkin mind, wielded by an angry spirit and formed into a semi-corporeal representation of the Darkin's true form, as, not being limited to the available flesh, the Darkin could likely achieve something closer to its true body. The resulting creature would probably have little resemblance to the Iceborn/Void creature it used to be, but it's probably all the more frightening for being a Darkin that transcends the normal restrictions and vulnerabilities of a physical form.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2017-12-29T01:30:34.138+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, It makes sense to imprison a creature that needs flesh inside something that doesnt have flesh (aka a weapon made of metal), so, they wouldnt \"expand\".

Similar to my worries about The Djinn's comment about the Darkin being able to use the corporeal-state version of a Dark Mist entity - what happens when the entity goes non-corporeal while holding a very-much-corporeal Darkin weapon?  Does it get dropped (which I imagine is not good for the Darkin entity)?  Does it become a spirit version of the Darkin weapon that then can become non-corporeal?  Is a Black Mist entity holding a corporeal object able to turn it non-corporeal and take it with it?\n\nThat last question might be the most important one (with possible future implications).  Can an entity from the Black Mist pick up an object and then disappear, taking it with them?

But If we compare his spirit with a spirit from the mist, his color is a bit more light blue/white as the ice. \n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/93/Iceborn_Keeper_profileicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20170517182305\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/4e/Spirit_of_the_Altar_profileicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20170517182322","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-12-29T15:22:14.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never noticed his dead body was there 0_0","replies":[]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2017-12-29T19:15:58.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His body is still conserved in true ice because he was ritually killed by Avarosa in order to turn him into the immortal guardian of the Howling Abyss.

Be it because they don't have flesh or because they don't have a mind, it seems silly to put them in one of the few things ALWAYS intended to be wielded by sentient hands.

It really does seem like they're not really corporeal beings as we think of them, since they seem to be able to bridge the gap between weapon and body pretty easily. My guess is you can have a non-corporeal Darkin as a spiritual presence.","replies":[{"poster":"Zallamance","date":"2017-12-29T16:41:42.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aight, I'm just gonna throw out some of the things I've picked up at this. In Varus' updated lore, it's revealed that his bow was the actual bow he used when the Darkin were invading Runterra. So I think it would be safe to assume that this is the same with the other Darkin (Aatrox and Rhaast) and that rather trap the Darkin into some mundane item such as an anchor, they had to be trapped into something that was incredibly durable and that neither the weapon nor the Darkin would reject. \n\nAlso, if we can take in-game assets into theory, Rhaast (still trapped inside of the scythe) rises up and pierces into Kayne's body in order to complete the corruption and mold Kayne's body into one better suiting him as a Darkin. This suggests to me that the weapons themselves can actually act and move of their own accord (or from the spirit trapped inside), if only a limited amount of time. Still taking in-game assets into consideration, during Aatrox's dance, his blade moves up and down, further promoting this theory.\n\nIn my mind I've always thought of a Darkin weapon, once the Darkin has taken over its host, to be that similar to that of a busy business employee and their phone. Yea, they can live without it, but it's such an integral part of their life that it's with them 24/7 and they feel incredibly uncomfortable if they don't have it with them. Actually, I feel with the Darkin it goes deeper than that too. Their weapon is their identity. If you've ever read/watched The Golden Compass, I believe the bond between a Darkin and their weapon is practically the same as that of a person and their daemon.\n\n\n\nTo the mian topic at hand though, I believe the order of a series of unfortunate would be most successful if it were Iceborn>Black Mist>Darkin Weapon>Void.\n\nIceborn being dies from some unruly travesty, and for some reason was near the Shadow Isles. The Mist resurrects said being. Their goal would most likely stay the same as it previously was (which I would assume fight back the Mist as I have no real idea why an Iceborn would be near it otherwise). During this endeavor, they come across a Darkin weapon and wield it. Considering their will is strong enough to keep cognition after being resuscitated, the Darkin would only partly corrupt the body as they steadily chipped away at the psyche to gain control (similar to Kayne's predicament, and arguably Varus'). Said being mostly likely wouldn't care too much about the annoyance of the Darkin, as their body becomes rather trivial at this point (the mist brought them back to life, they don't care about their body, only the task they are set to do) and their mind is pretty devoted to their current task, so the Darkin would have a tough time corrupting it. Next comes the Void. This is where it get's pretty weird.\n\nUp to this point, the mentality of the being has been mostly that of the Iceborn, the mist not able to corrupt its mind and the Darkin unable to devour it. Once the void comes into play though, it plays the part almost of that of the Darkin, except no weapon required (creeping corruption of both the body and mind). So, this monstrosity now has 3 mind (4 if the mist is kicking around in that noggin) all trying for control. Are they doing a time-share, where each one gets to watch its favorite show on TV depending on what day of the week it is? Doubtful, but maybe. Possibly it would be similar to Golem from Lord Of The Rings, except more than two personalities. While the Iceborn is still the main ruler of the mind, the remaining voices would argue on everything it thought/said, slowly swaying the general consensus towards their opinion and away from the others, but ultimately the choice is still the Iceborn. Or would it be like Varus, where when one of the beings trapped inside feels strongly enough about a certain thing, they get to take control, and so the other mentality's need to sort of coax them into their way of thinking in order to have power?\n\nHonestly, this is the best I can come up with.
