In the capital, as in High Silvermere, Lux made a name for herself as a young woman of immense kindness and great wit. During her stay, she befriended a knight of the Radiant Ones, the warrior order of the Illuminators, named Kahina.\n\nHowever, this was before she learned about the \"secretly uses magic\" stuff, so they probally show themselves to the public as a religious order.

They talk about her like people did about faeries and other myths like that, as someone who does her thing, can be appeased for favors, but I don't think there are organized religions around her.\n\nWhile the Avarosans seems to consider Anivia just a protector of Freljord, the Notai worship and follow her around Freljord. They even seem to have a \"sacred task\" gave to them by Anivia. This was explained in \"Frozen Hearts\", here some quotes from this story: \n> “Mhmm. They say she is a phoenix, with icicles instead of feathers—her wings borne on frigid wind, brrrrrr! But we Notai know, it is hope that carries Anivia, and that she is not a guardian of our realm, as the Avarosans say. She is freedom. She is the spirit that fills you as you follow your passion, no matter how mean the world is.\n> ...\n> The dancing, the singing, a lyre in my hands, shivering even as I burn with this—this thing I try to name! This is what Anivia has tasked us with carrying across the Freljord. This is what gives her wind on her migration! Some villages see us as untrustworthy traders, others fear us for the ice that announces our arrival, the winter that can mean life or death. But to them all, we bring song, we bring togetherness, we link each village with our spirit.\n\n.\n\n\n> I don't think we've gotten any information about religions in Noxus either.\n\nWe kinda did, even though it was just about Kindred.\nFrom The Principles of Strength:\n> She gazed up. In ancient Valoran custom, death was often represented as a dualistic in nature, taking the form of the Lamb of peaceful death, and the Wolf of violent ends. In Noxus, the latter was honored with rather more rigor and panoply. Dying peacefully in one’s bed was not the way to secure honor in an empire that venerated strength. \n\nFrom Karthus's lore:\n> Karthus learned to love these laments, and would watch, fascinated, as the tally-men of Kindred notched their staffs and bore the bodies from the almshouse.\n...\nThe tally-men quickly recognized Karthus’s suitability for their order and he was inducted into their ranks, first as a digger of graves and pyre-builder, before ascending to the rank of corpse collector...Eventually, Karthus worked in the temple itself, tending to the sick in their final moments, watching as whatever death had laid its claim upon them took its due.\n\nThough, Karthus lived in the slums of Noxus, not the capital, so it isnt a good source for he noxian culture in general, since the order just works in the slums.\n> I was not aware that Xerath has a cult. \n\nAs far as I know, it isnt exactly a cult, just some people who believe that he is the emperor of Shurima, some of them appeared in Nasus's color story.\n\nBut I agree with the rest of what you said, just wanted to correct some things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2018-09-28T21:17:02.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Vz42GxvA,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-09-28T16:48:14.409+0000)\n>\n> This isn&#x27;t a religion.

It is not a god, a culture, or a pantheon of gods. It is a mountain. It is used to talk about the region or the mountain, and nothing else.\n The people and culture that live on Mount Targon and around it are the Rakkor. Pantheon's host is from the Rakkor people. Leona is a Rakkori that became a disciple of the Solari. The religions practiced by the Rakkor are the Solari and the clandestine Lunari.\nSol, when saying he wants to tear down Targon, is referring to the mountain. At the top of the mountain is the hidden city of the Celestial Aspects. In tearing down Targon, Aurelion Sol would destroy the entrance to the city of the Celestial Aspects, thus shutting of their entry into Runeterra. This is why he would take delight in destroying the mountain. \n\n> \n> The only church we know of in Demacia is the giant Temple of the Lightbringers.\n\nAnd Lux's bio heavily implies that this is just a front for the Illuminators, as they are a secret organization within Demacia that uses magic for the good of the country.\n\n> \n> Well, they have a phrase mentioning the Great Balance, and they all seem pretty focused on balance in all things.\n> Karma is worshiped like the Dalai Lama. \n\nThe Dalai Lama is not worshipped. The Dalai Lama, like Karma, is thought to be the incarnation of past Lamas, and as such, is a fountain of wisdom and knowledge. He's not a god, he doesn't speak for a god, he is just a spiritual figurehead that leads his people in their path to enlightenment. Likewise, the Ionian quest for balance in all things is how they believe they will reach enlightenment. They do not worship balance, they seek it as a means to achieve harmony and happiness in the world. Their spiritual beliefs are more akin to a philosophy more than a religion.\n\n> \n> People still pray to her. It doesn&#x27;t matter if she is a story, a creature, a spirit, or a god, there is a faith built around her, and that is all it takes to form a religion.\n\nI'll concede on this.\n\n> \n> Only the first of the Frostguard know the truth. The rest of them are still promised to be Iceborn from the Watchers. Lissandra&#x27;s speeches are still canon, they just aren&#x27;t a clear motive for her character anymore, but are instead her inspiring her Frostguard.\n\nNo, this is not true anymore. Lissandra's new bio erased all of the previous lore about her, and her speeches are no longer cannon. NO ONE knows about the Watchers except for her and the few people who have witnessed their corruption. She's not promised anyone anything. She's trying to keep the Watchers in captivity so they will not destroy the world. And her new bio also establishes that being Iceborn is genetic, not something you become. There are living Iceborn still in the world, and she has a great many of them in her clan who can wield the true ice weapons she's hoarding. I recommend you read her new bio to get updated.\n\n> \n> Yeah, they have a massive shrine built in honor of Wolf.\n\nI have no idea what you are referring to here. I haven't heard of anything specifically targeting Wolf and Kindred in relation to Noxus. Noxians have shown very little inclination to magic, let alone religion.\n\n> \n> &quot;His stolen power grew with every passing moment, and he beheld a world ripe for conquest, a world brimming with mortals ready to worship at the feet of a new and terrible god.&quot;\n\nThat is a quote from Xerath, but that is his delusion of grandeur, his grand vision of the world he wants to rule. This is not what has happened, because he was entrapped in a tomb and left for millennia. He doesn't have a cult, because he hasn't conquered anything.\n\n> \n> &quot;Primitives worship me, hoping for mercy. I shall give them death.&quot;\n\nThat's not really organized religion. That's begging at the feet of someone who's going to kill you.\n\n> \n> Doesn&#x27;t matter what Vilemaw is. Rammus has a religion, anyone can have a religion.\n\nIt does very much matter what Vilemaw is and the nature of how Elise operates. She's not running a religion. She's gathering the weak willed of Noxus with the promise of power at the hands of some foreign god, and taking them to Vilemaw to die. They do not worship because they die. Elise is a charlatan, who only acts like an evangel long enough to get people to go with her to feed Vilemaw. That's not a religion. It's a Ponzi scheme.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zkaiser","date":"2018-10-03T18:12:28.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Vz42GxvA,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-09-28T16:48:14.409+0000)\n>\n> Vilemaw is not a real god.

There are no organized groups the practice Vilemaw worship in Noxus because anyone who is seduced by Elise's \"evangelism\" ends up dying to Vilemaw. No one ever returns to start an organized religion to Vilemaw. The reason we know this is because _if_ there was an organized religion that was basing themselves over what they hear Elise evangelizing, they would make their _own_ pilgrimages to the Shadow Isles, because that's what she's telling people they have to do, thus making Elise irrelevant to Vilemaw if people are coming of their own accord. Elise has to very much ensure that there is no organized religion to Vilemaw that would attempt the voyages to him, because otherwise, there would be competition and she would lose her direct access to immortality.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-28T16:03:09.536+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's the Grey Lady, also, in Zaun.

None of them are unbiased or omniscient.** Some quotes in-game are hypothetical (item and champion special interactions, death quotes, etc.) in that they haven't happened, so they're not canon events or meetings in-universe.\n\nAatrox was an Ascended, confirmed from several sources to be called god-warriors. It's believable that Aatrox was worshiped as a \"god\" in the same way that any high-tier Ascended would have been. **After becoming a darkin, he was probably feared and hated as a destructive, cruel being more than worshiped (a relationship depicted in Twilight of the Gods). What Aatrox himself says in-game is almost certainly the rose-tinted nostalgia of an eons-old, fractured mind that basks in the vague memory of its former glory.\"**\n\nThese are all responses taking from this post of yours:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/qHLj4dAt-riot-are-champion-quotes-canon\n\nAnd they all agree that Aatrox perhaps had a cult in the past, but it is no longer the case.\n\nSo yes, there clearly are other people questioning the truth in Aatrox's words.\n\n> A few people asked for sources and were satisfied with his lore calling it out and him directly saying he is worshiped.\n\nWhat?\n\nWho are these \"few people?\"\n\nAnd how were they satisfied with \"his lore calling it out and him directly saying he is worshipped\"?\n\n> \n> Groom is the word typically used when dealing with predatory behavior,\n\nSays who?\n\nYou?\n\n> like cults do.

The weapon was immense, its ebony haft carved with the names of his forebears, and the blade a slab of razor-edged bronze. Few of our group could even lift it, let along swing it, but Saijax was a master of weapons. \n\nLooks strong to me.\n\n________________\n\nAbout hosts and memories, IMO the Darkin can search though the mind of the wielder for memeories, but this don't necessarily means that the Darkin _will_ absorb the memories.\n> I feel his hand grip this form and… _and his consciousness opens to me!_\n> \n> I burrow into him, pulling him down.

Rhaast probally has more time to go around Kayn's ind since he cant \"pull\" Kayn, but I doubt that he would go around the mind of the wielder in a situation like this:\n> A desperate Noxian had freed the weapon, its red eye now revealed and glowing with inhuman rage. The soldier’s own eyes grew wide as he swung in vicious arcs at his own comrades. He was clearly not in control, trying in vain to release the scythe.\n> \n> The rumors were true. \n\nThe conciouness of the soldier wasnt in the body, instead it was Rhaast's concious, as seen in this quote:\n> Calling again on his shadow magic, Kayn dove into the writhing Noxian’s darkin-corrupted flesh. For the briefest of moments, he saw through the eyes of this ageless being, witnessing millennia of inflicted pain and suffering, screams and lamentations. This thing was death reborn again and again. It was the purest evil, and it had to be stopped.\n\nAlso, Varus's color story happens long after the comic, and in his color story, this happens:\n> Varus grinned and vaulted onto the obelisk, drawing back on his bow as he landed. Violet light built in the living weapon as it flexed, and a coruscating arrow of lightning formed in the air.\n> \n> _Why must you kill them?_ This was Kai. He hated unnecessary killing.\n> \n> Varus felt his hands tremble as Kai fought to make him lower the bow.\n> \n> “Your people destroyed my kin,” said Varus, exerting his will to steady his aim. “That’s the only reason I need.”> \n> ... \n>_ So everyone you see must die?_\n> \n> Varus exhaled, and in the space between breaths loosed the shot. It flashed through the air to pierce the bearded warrior’s heart, burning a hole clean through him.\n> ...\n> In seconds it was over. Sixteen dead, and he hadn’t even broken a sweat. He felt the anguish of Valmar and Kai within him, and grinned. Every death gnawed at them, weakened them, and made them less able to fight him.\n\nThis sounds like \"agreement\" to you?(this question is directed to SSmotzer)\n\nLast of all, this \"I can predict everything because humans follow estabilished tropes\" thing is  bullshit.

It&#x27;s just that in Shuriman culture their symbology is mostly animals. That&#x27;s why Xarath Ascended and turned into pure energy, because that is what he imagines Ascension to be, raw power. Kayn sees Ascension as surpassing Zed, and thus, he becomes a master shadow assassin.\n\nWhere is it stated that Ascension turns people into symbols?\n\nAll the Ascended we've seen, with the exception being Xerath, who's Ascension was botched, stolen from someone else, and lasted longer due to him forcing the sorcerers to keep the ritual going even after he had already Ascended.\n\nIs it that hard to assume this is the reason why he looks like energy?\n\nAnd even if Ascension turns people into symbols, Xerath should've turned into a bull.\n\nA bull is an animal said to represent strength and power in Egyptian mythology, which Shurima draws heavily from.\n\nIf you're going to use the excuse, \"Ascension turns people into symbols\" and then also say \"Symbols in Shurima are animals\", that does not explain Xerath's form, as Xerath himself is a Shuriman, thus should turn into an animal.\n\nAnd how is Kayn's Shadow Assassin form a symbol for anything?\n\nNoxians are known to use animals, primarily wolves, for symbols as well.\n\n> \n> So it&#x27;d make sense that Kayle would Ascend and sees her Ascended form as, well, herself but with wings. \n\nHow is herself but with wings a symbol?\n\nAnd Kayle's \"ascension\" isn't the same thing as \"Ascension\" under the Sun Disk, so everything you said above doesn't even apply to her.\n\n> \n> If you trapped Nasus in his staff is he a Darkin.\n\nA Darkin, \"fallen\", is a title, not a race.\n\nIf you trap Nasus in his weapon, he is still an Ascended.\n\n> \n> Well, their souls are probably somewhere.

Azir's death happened by sun magic. The Darkin were killed by moon magic.\n\n3. Azir did not come back from the dead with the help of the Sun Disk, he came back because of Sivir's blood.\n\nThese factors make it clear that Azir's death and later rebirth cannot also be applied to the Darkin.\n\n> \n> They had a vault dedicated to storing magic items. It was a major providence on Runeterra. Having a Cerberus style champion would be really cool. He could play like a Bloodborn boss.\n\nSo...

None of them had heard her sibilant whispers in over five hundred years.&quot;_\n> \n> You gotta admit, it&#x27;s pretty weird for a trap in a temple to transform someone into an incredibly powerful snake person. \n\nEven if Naganeka is supposed to be the source of Cassiopeia's power, she wouldn't be able to if she was consumed by Valeeva, as you've previously stated.\n\nBesides, we've already seen a massive golden dinner plate in the sky turn people into giant animal god warriors.\n\nA trap turning someone into a powerful snake person isn't that weird.\n\n> \n> Well, Aatrox&#x27;s fleshy body is still living flesh right?\n\nSo is Aatrox supposed to be alive along with his body, dead, but his body is alive, or undead?\n\nYou need to make yourself clear, you always speak so cryptically.\n\n> \n> An &quot;undead&quot; Darkin wouldn&#x27;t need flesh, and could probably just manifest as a ghost.\n\nHow do you know Darkin are able to be undead, as well as manifest without a body?\n\nIf this was the case, why does Varus even bother with Kai and Valmar's crap? Why not just take on the spirit form we see him as in the music video?\n\n> I&#x27;m imagining that he as been broken down, by the mist, to a beast, and acts like a dog.\n\nAatrox survived, physically and mentally, what can be considered a living hell inside of his sword for thousands of years, yet the Mist is somehow even worse?\n\nI find that hard to believe.\n\n> The iron rod being like a bone. Throw the rod Cebotaru fetches it.\n\nI'm sorry, but this just sounds stupid.\n\n> \n> There are two swords in the mythos, and one is on fire, just like Kayle&#x27;s sword.\n\nAnd only one of them was wielded by a Horseman.\n\nTherefore, only one of them can be a part of that \"allegory\" of yours.\n\n> \n> I said Naganeka&#x27;s weapon was a chain whip. Valeeva just took it, you know, before all of the sealing stuff happened.\n\nFirst off, how would that chain whip even have any magical properties left in it, if Naganeka was never imprisoned within it? \n\nSecond off, what reason could Valeeva possibly have for taking the weapon, especially considering the above?\n\n> \n> The nation is anti-magic, the church is not.\n\nThe church is still Demacians.\n\nThey wouldn't pick up an evil sword that corrupts people. They would destroy it.\n\n> The church actively seeks out magical artifacts to use... outside of Demacia.\n\nNo they don't.\n\nThey seek out people with magical abilities. It is not stated they seek magical artifacts.\n\n> Like Lucian and his magic guns, or Lux... the magic lady.\n\nLucian is not to have been given the guns by these \"Lightbringers\" we don't even know anything about.\n\nAnd Lux isn't an \"artifact\", if that's what you're implying.\n\n> \n> Well they probably didn&#x27;t know it would corrupt them at first. Then every time after they would use some magic to prevent themselves from being corrupted... and failing, at least until Kayle.... Morgana, not so lucky.\n\nIt still makes jack shit sense that they would continously try to wield a sword that corrupts them every time they would try to do so.\n\n> \n> Also, when asked about why they are in Demacia, Reav3 just said we will have to wait and see. He said Aspects could be considered Ascended, and that the sword is Targonian.\n\nDo you not find it odd that Reav3 would just suddenly talk about being an Aspect can be considered being an Ascended in a thread that's centered around Kayle?\n\nYou, that claims to be so great at seeing narrative clues, can't fathom what Reav3 was trying to get at here?\n\nHe was literally replying to someone that said \"I'm actually pretty surprised by this given how aatrox interacts with them both\" when he said this, and to someone else that said \"So they're gonna be targon related?\" is when he said the teaser image looks pretty Targonian.\n\nYou're still not convinced they're going to be from Targon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-10-03T11:08:50.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SSmotzer,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Vz42GxvA,comment-id=00040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000028,timestamp=2018-10-03T09:40:53.528+0000)\n>\n\nRan out of space on the other one comment.\n\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaylemains/comments/9ac0nz/just_one_thing_can_we_all_agree_to_not_act_like/e4xpugu/\n\nIt's almost hilariously depressing that you use this Reddit post for trying to justify the sword thing, but you ignore the literal two replies above where it pretty much confirms that Kayle and Morgana are from Targon.\n\n> \n> What is his established character? Half human half demon who wants revenge. I don&#x27;t see how adding a give and take between the demon and the human sides is in any way contrarian.\n\nHis established character is, yes, as you describe, a revenge driven ancient evil that seeks to re-enslave and or kill all humans, the reason why him and his kind was imprisoned.\n\nTrying to save Kai and Valmar goes against his previously established goals of re-enslaving or killing all humans.\n\nAnd if we want to be technical, he's 2/3 human, 1/3 Darkin.\n\n> \n> Well yeah, he&#x27;s a demon.\n> \n> I could reference a popular comic book character who is getting a movie Friday, but you would just chastise me for it.\n\nI would, as it has nothing to do with what we're talking about.\n\nAnd I fail to see how him being a Darkin justifies what we were talking about.\n\n> \n> well no, there is enough evidence to say they are corrupted by the Void.\n> \n> The only thing that we know that separates the Darkin from Ascended is the war with the Void.\n>\n> Renekton has suffered even more mental damage than any Darkin. So it&#x27;s more than just PTSD and turning into assholes.\n\nThere is not.\n\nDarkin is a word from Ancient Shuriman that means \"fallen\".\n\nIt's not a race as much as it's just a title.\n\nWhat separates the Darkin from the Ascended is that the Darkin were the slave overlords. The Ascended were all those who didn't enslave anyone.\n\nThis is why Renekton and Xerath, despite both being evil, insane Ascended, do not count as Darkin.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
