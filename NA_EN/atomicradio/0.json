Extra care should be taken when laning against him. Simply asking what the OP asked tells me the OP doesn't understand anything about Brand except that a good Brand will punish mistakes severely.

If you dodged him ten times then because of his mana expenditure he prolly backed 2 or 3 times to boot and you still did nothing to set him back.
