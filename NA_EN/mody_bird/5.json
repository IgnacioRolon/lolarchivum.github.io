Yeah, the game had issues, but it seemed like Riot knew what they were, and kept making improvements. However, this season has just felt off to me from the start. I feel like what may have set it apart this time were the new masteries. It felt like major power creep. Maybe I'm just worse, but it seems like there is so much more solo kill pressure from everyone in-lane. Falling behind makes me feel more helpless than before. Everything feels less tactical, and more fast-paced. Not to mention that so many champs are being changed that their relative balance is constantly in flux.\n\nThen again, it could just be me. I used to play WoW, then I got to a point where I suddenly no longer enjoyed it. Can't even enjoy similar games now. Maybe I'm just tired of this one too.\n\nStill, I hope I'm not done with the game, and that Riot improves it enough for me to enjoy it as much as I used to.
