Thoughts?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":10,"body":"If you&#039;re just here to shitpost, LARP or troll, fuck right off.  This is a legit post where I want to hear feedback about what OG players think about this season.  This season has been incredibly difficult for me; for the first time, the meta has changed so drastically that I cannot find my place.  I played League of Legends in season 4 &amp; 5 and climbed easily to Plat 4 in the jungle over the 2 seasons.  I skipped out on Season 6 due to school and came back Season 7 and have never been so frustrated with this game.  While I&#039;m proficient in all lanes, Jungle used to be my main.  I find it nearly impossible to adapt to the new jng meta as it isn&#039;t my playstyle, so I switched to AD.  I love AD, but I am not proficient enough to consistently carry the majority of my games at my current elo.  Top has been my primary role coming back this season as the gameplay and playstyle is more similar to what I&#039;m used to, but even then it still feels so very unpleasant and wrong.  I&#039;m thinking about uninstalling and coming back Season 8 to see if the meta has changed to something more enjoyable.  Anyone feel like they&#039;re in the same boat?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-25T19:43:27.097+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Season  7 isn't a joke at all.

It's simple, Riot forces you to pick meta champs and items if you want to win your games. As if that wasn't enough, they also have enforced meta playstyle as well. If you don't play your lane or your jungle the meta demands, then you will again lose. \n\nAll in all, they removed THE FUN out of the game. This has become extremely obvious in all the games one plays. People CAN'T have fun any more, if giving one kill away means losing towers, lane, pressure and eventually the game. So, everyone just wants to win win win win these days. Welcome to Season 7, or as i like to call it, an even worse Season 6. I doubt S8 will be better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2017-05-25T19:41:48.388+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started season 5 so I'm not an OG but I agree. This season is horrible. For me, it's the snowball mechanics. Even games are so scarce this season. 90% of games, it's one side snowballing hard and it can be caused by a single feeder. All it takes is one mistake for a lane to start feeding, then all lanes end up feeding hard as well. Definitely not the game I remember in season 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-05-25T21:59:32.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Season 7 is much better than season 6 in my opinion.\n\nThe annoying thing is that the better jungler almost always wins and well.. Autofill hits hard too. If you get an autofilled anything against an OTP or just a main of that position, you have a much higher chance of losing the game.\n\nunlike season 3 when I started, season 7 promotes teamplay.\nYou can't win that easily just by playing good anymore. You have to snowball your team and work as a team. \nFor some people that's hard to adapt to, for some people it is easier.\nPlayers that are not so strong automatically get carried by stronger people they randomly get matched with, because snowballing is really strong this season.\n\nOverall i think this season is borderline ok-ish. \nThere are many ways to improve and in my opinion there has never been a better season than season 3. \n\nSeason 6 however, was the biggest mess so far imo.
