For some reason, League will spike and my MS goes up to 400. I don't know why this is happening. I checked our internet speed and that's fine...my computer is the HP Envy with i7 7th gen processor, windows 10 and has NVIDIA GEFORCE card. Also, I cant find anything online about the NA servers. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nFrustrated ADC, \r\n\r\nShane","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T20:46:54.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a new computer, it's important to make sure all of your drivers and settings are tuned up and updated.  It's equally important to make sure your network is keeping a strong connection and able to maintain a comms specifically with the game server.
