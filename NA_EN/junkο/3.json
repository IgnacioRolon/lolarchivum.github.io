You lost because you had an afk, not necessarily a balancing issue.\n\nEven if Lucian didn't rage quit because he died once (report system works as intended btw), we still had an inting Mundo.\n\nLosing LP because not 1 but 2 of my teammates are complete idiots is just dumb. And if you look at my match history you're going to notice that this happens in basically majority of the games I play(except that one game out of 40 I played in the last few dayswhere I was the inting retard).","replies":[{"poster":"FurtherScape","date":"2018-06-22T21:37:52.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might I also point out, that was technically your best player :D \n\nI don't know if anyone has even caught that yet. \n\nbut, Plat 5 is the start of that Tier, so your Golds 1 an 2 and your Plat Players would still be matched fairly, they could have been Plat but demoted do to monthly play time, suspensions, quit playing seriously . Looks to me the system is doing its job.\n\nYou won't be bothered by those guys again, unless you keep falling with them. _Just My2cents._","replies":[]},{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2018-06-22T21:27:24.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, this is nothing about any game aspect.
