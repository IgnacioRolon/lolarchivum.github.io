I'll often throw the boomerang into a group of minions if the enemy champion is standing right behind them for harass, because it will still go a bit farther in after hitting something. But I've never personally seen an instance where it'll go the full distance through a minion wave, unless the wave and the champion are close together and just far enough away that it seems like it's going the full distance, I'm not sure.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-10-13T18:36:10.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually, no. It turns back at the point you cast it to. So if it is supposed to turn back when it hits an enemy, then it isn't working. How it works right now is that you cast it, and it flies in the direction of your cast to the point your cursor was at. if that is less than full range, it won't fly full range. If you cast it past full range, it will make him walk out farther to throw it (I think). It most certainly does not return after hitting an enemy, and can hit as many enemies as you can fit between it and you before returning. Basically, if you tend to leave the mouse hovering just a little way away from your champ, you will usually under throw. You have to put the cursor at the max distance for it to go full range.","replies":[{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2014-10-13T18:46:49.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'm testing this in a game, and I'm really not sure what you're talking about.\n\nMaybe you're just using different settings than me, but I'm still getting it as \"Goes full distance unless it hits an enemy\", no matter where my cursor is in relation to Gnar.

However this will not cause it to go past max range.\n* Enemies can only be hit once by the boomerang\n* The boomerang return trajectory is longer than the initial throw trajectory, and it slowly gains speed while returning.\n* Catching the boomerang reduces it's cooldown.\n* Mega-Gnar can catch the boomerang\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong on any of these points. Not including numbers, just the mechanics of the skill.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-10-14T12:48:48.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stand corrected.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ByeGoodbye457","date":"2014-10-13T17:23:57.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya","replies":[]},{"poster":"12q34e","date":"2014-10-13T18:15:23.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i concur this is annoying and hard to understand.
