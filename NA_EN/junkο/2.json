If you interrupt the channel damage stops, but cleansing only stops the cc portion.\n\nNot really sure on Azir; probably because his bugs are rarer, though it could just be because they want him open because he's playable and dealing the same damage and interactions in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-12-11T16:25:28.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Soldiers dealing no damage with AA and Q and his ult not functioning isn't doing the same damage and interactions last time i checked","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2014-12-11T16:28:09.239+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been spamming {{champion:268}} recently and for the most part, everything works fine.

His ult dealt damage multiple times, and could - for example - \"kill\" the edges of Jayce's acceleration gate multiple times, granting stupid amounts of experience for free.\n\nA champion who does poorly on release due to bugs/poor QoL (see also: release Syndra, 23% winrate) is not the same as a champion who has, say, a 1 in 5 chance of doing 10k bonus damage to a target due to a coding mixup.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-12-12T18:12:24.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One causes the person to 100% win the game, other causes to 100% lose.

Then they fixed a truckload of bugs - the ones that plagued both him and his opponents - and then re-enabled him.\n\nHaving bugs in a champion's favor is different from bugs against them. If they left Jarvan active, people would've gone into ranked and won every single game due to freelo because he's the best possible option. On the other hand, if a champion has bugs that cause poor performance (ex. release Syndra), then players can just go grab one of the other hundred-plus champions in the game instead... or the hardcore types can play her ANYWAY, and try to learn her strengths despite the handicap (which is what I did. Positive winrate on release syndra ftw).\n\nWhen a bug truly *breaks* a champion, like if someone lost their ability to autoattack after recalling, then that's worth a disable because that champion can no longer contribute to their team in any way. \n\nNegative bugs (like the temporary inability to flash-Q for xerath, varus and vi RIGHT NOW) don't totally take a player out of the game, they just reduce a champ's strength.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-12-12T18:54:13.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When a bug truly breaks a champion, like if someone lost their ability to autoattack after recalling, then that's worth a disable because that champion can no longer contribute to their team in any way.\n\nFor example Azir ult not existing?\n\nBut w/e not worth arguing anymore.
