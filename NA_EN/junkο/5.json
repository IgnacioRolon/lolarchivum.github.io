The sad part is that as soon as the Diamond 1 player picks a different role/champion, the system thinks they're a noob all over again.\n\nTeambuilder is set up to be the only game mode anyone ever plays, but no one wants to play it. Matchmaking like this, the unability to fill/change champions to fit the team, and the horrible wait times is why I've given up on it. I might play some for the new Summoners Rift, but as soon as the map is avalable on blind pick that's where I'll head.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-11-13T16:39:54.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There *are* advantages to it. If you play enough times, it becomes much more accurate to skill level. And if you try a brand new champion, it will adjust matchmaking to try and take that into account. Its a good place to practice champions, since you are guaranteed to get the champion and role you want, as well as getting an adjustment so you aren't crushed by somebody who mains their champion or something.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2014-11-13T16:48:16.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've had Teambuilder wait times so long I could play two games of blind pick in the time it would take to play one game of Teambuilder, giving me ***twice*** *the opertunities to practice new champions*.

I usually can stack those odds by queueing with a few friends.\n\nRiot already has two ways to measure my skill level, ranked and normal. Why do they need a third? What compelled them to think that Diamonds, when not playing a champion they're familiar with, drop *that far* in skill? Not to mention missing options like random and fill. No thanks, Teambuilder's not for me.\n\nEdit: adjusted matchmaking for new champions means nothing if you're being pitted against diamonds. You're better off playing with your normal matchmaking.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-11-13T17:02:07.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I've had Teambuilder wait times so long I could play two games of blind pick in the time it would take to play one game of Teambuilder, giving me twice the opertunities to practice new champions.

However, my personal experience has been that if you solo queue TB, you get in much quicker. If you solo support, you get in far faster than Blind pick. \"Pick what you want\" IS a selling feature for many, and honestly, if you cover support (and maybe perhaps jungle and Marksman) you won't have trouble with queue times. There are always gonna be trolls and rebels in blind pick that--unless you have 4 other peeps queued (in which case just do TB)--there's always a chance SOMEBODY is going to make things difficult in some way. At least in TB, its absolutely no pick/roles fuss and you get what you want GUARANTEED. If you prefer blind, that's fine, but Team Builder has an appeal for others that it doesn't for you. \n\n>What compelled them to think that Diamonds, when not playing a champion they're familiar with, drop that far in skill?\n\nIts by no means perfect. If I had to give a complaint (other than queue times, which is a difficult problem) my number one problem would be that it doesn't take normal queue MMR into account. But to people who do play it frequently, its a nice tool that allows you the role you want, stress-free.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-11-13T16:43:11.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In exchange for waiting more time because the amount of players that can get matched get limited.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-11-13T16:50:34.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that I wait the longest for supports; When I solo queue as a support, I get into a game quicker than blind pick.

I personally hate blind pick, as its just a messy rush to lock in the champ you desire. But I get that some people like that mode the best.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-11-13T16:38:00.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i will def change to blind/draft when the new map goes there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-11-13T16:35:12.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so true, im not even ranked and I got placed against a diamond 1 player and he pooped on us.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2014-11-13T16:47:37.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bunch of people who practically never touch Team Builder (and thus have low MMR on it) are piling into Team builder to try the new map.
