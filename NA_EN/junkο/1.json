But every other ability has the visual effects from the High Noon skin.\r\n\r\nI think they should all be classic or all be High Noon (pref classic) not a mix of 2.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-26T19:10:34.378+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! \n\nNice catch on this one! You're correct, they should all be using consistent particles.  Since the chromas are for High Noon Yasuo, they should be using High Noon Yasuo's particles, not his base particles. Lemme see what happened with this. Shouldn't be too difficult to hook the right particles back up for the shield. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Askein","date":"2016-12-02T09:13:03.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI just recently started to use the Emerald High Noon Yasuo chroma and noticed the same issue. The shield particle is still blue opposed to  orange/reddish.\n\nYou're still looking into this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2016-08-26T19:44:50.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying but I feel like the chroma would be a lot better if it used classic skin particles.  Having a blue like skin with brown-orange particles just look weird. And I think it could attract more buyers too if the particles also changed.\n\nBut well, your (or whoever is in charge of that) decision :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXxAltaïrxXx","date":"2016-08-26T19:20:24.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to ask something about chromas.I admit I was never interested in buying one (I am big sucker for splash arts in this game). Why not give them a recolor splash of the original art? I dont think that would take much time and effort and would change mind of me and others who really like art in this game...","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-08-26T19:33:09.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can answer this one. The splashes are made in Color pallets in mind so colors don't clash with each other. By throwing in colors not originally in the Splash, they're likely not to look well in the end result.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
