His win rates suck at every elo, here is why and what he needs.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"top lane 45% in silver, 46% in gold. 48% in plat and 47% in plat +\r\n\r\nNasus is at 53 54% in silver and gold and 52 in plat\r\n\r\nGaren, over 50 in all elos\r\n\r\nDarius, close to 50 in most elos\r\n\r\nUrgot 50, 51 52 at higher elos\r\n\r\nI could go on, with few exceptions such as Irelia who seems to be suffering at top as well in all elos.\r\n\r\nBut why. I have said this before, no one seems to get it.  Olafs kit is too basic to keep up with the craziness.\r\n\r\nNot having a hard CC, or a shield, or a built in dash, or some crazy way to scale into late game or some massive team fight ult {{champion:85}} {{champion:157}}  etc, is really BAD.  And even when you build tank hes not insanely tanky like {{champion:223}} , who does pretty well at high elos, 51% win rate compared to Olafs 47 and 48%\r\n\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter that his ult is pretty good.  But actually, in the games climate, its not that good. 6 seconds is short, and the amount of flashes, dashes, mobility, hourglasses, stopwatches etc, make it really hard to catch anyone in that amount of time, to do really not that much damage at a fast enough rate.  Since if you build high damage you definitely will be exploded before you reach any carry.\r\n\r\nI think what I am saying is obvious, but to agree with me you would be conceding that Riot has overloaded most new champs and reworked champions, and the implication is that all of it is a huge mistake, or they need to catch everyone up.\r\n\r\nI have solutions.  He doesn't need a complete rework. \r\n\r\nHere are single changes that could be done by themselves without changing anything else. I believe each one of these changes by themselves would put him in a stronger position. REMEMBER, I am not saying he should get all of these changes. Just one, or maybe two. Otherwise, he would be incredibly too strong.\r\n\r\n1)Increase the range, moderately, of his E.  This will allow im to reduce his exposure and live a little longer.\r\n\r\n2)Let him keep his armor and magic resist buff during his ult.  Why can't it just be a passive that stays when he activates his ult? This would allow him extra toughness to have a better chance at making the most of his ult.\r\n\r\n3)Increase his ult to 8 seconds. 6 is just too short these days, for reasons mentioned above.\r\n\r\n4)Increase his bonus movement speed from 1 second to 3 seconds and allow him to move through units.\r\n\r\n5)Given the amount of burst damage and high damage in the game, his bonus Attack speed and lifesteal when almost dead is not enough. The bonus enhanced healing from his W caps out at 50% when missing 100% health (so, dead). So he never really gets there. Instead of 0-50%, it should be 0-90% and it should max out when he is at 10% health, not when hes dead.\r\n\r\n6)Reckless swing is now a point and click short dash, where he jumps swinging his axes down doing true damage. Can only target enemies, not wards or anything utterly stupid like that ( {{champion:24}} )\r\n\r\nLet the down votes begin.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-06-11T16:15:57.661+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people who pick him, just can't play him right.","replies":[{"poster":"XJ99999999999999","date":"2019-06-11T16:25:02.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SuicidePlank,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9GbqbsRX,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-11T16:15:57.661+0000)\n>\n> A lot of people who pick him, just can't play him right.\n\nolafs bread and vegan butter is his Q, which is a skill shot.

His ult maybe could be refreshed based on kills he gets, kinda like how Master Yi's and Aatrox's ult get an extended duration based on kills. Maybe also add some extra AD the lower his HP gets, but obviously at the cost of nerfing some of his abilities and numbers in his kit. To me, he is supposed to be this unstoppable force that refuses to die, and only gets scarier the lower his HP is, but he really doesn't seem to live up to that fantasy anymore especially with the amount of mobility and terrain there has been added into this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KICK OUT AT 2","date":"2019-06-11T17:50:08.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would like to see his power shifted into his E or auto attacks so he's more than an early level cheese champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Failog","date":"2019-06-11T18:00:23.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly his E should just be a passive ability---Olafs next auto attack, when Reckless swing cool down is reset, deals bonus true damage, etc.   Then there could be an active of some sort on the E.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AngelNipata","date":"2019-06-11T16:53:02.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sympathize with the champion being weak but I by no means support buffs for him. I get that he's weak, but Olaf being strong isn't really the greatest thing for the overall game because once he does get strong, he just becomes a freight train and run over everything in front of him while being pretty much unstoppable.\n\nI feel like you kind of downplay how strong his ult actually is. Even if enemies have to flash and dash and use actives to get away from you, Olaf ultimate can just burn so many resources that that 6 seconds has a ton of impact. The ultimate itself can much of time effectively force a full retreat for immobile enemies that don't have enough damage to stop you. Which does bring about the next point of why it's pretty hard to justify buffs for Olaf. When Olaf ult goes off, fighting Olaf comes down to a single question which is \"Do you have enough damage to kill Olaf?\". If you don't, then the only thing to do it run and if you do, then you make the attempt at fighting, which in turn makes Olaf's and insane snowballing tool because the counterplay of \"just CC him\" flies right out of the window.\n\nLooking at your suggested buffs, they're not all bad like suggestion 1 and 5 seems fairly reasonable. Suggestion 2 and 3 exacerbate the issue I mentioned about his ultimate in the previous paragraph. I like the part about him being ghosted in the second part of suggestion 4 because minion block is a melee champions worst nightmare, but I feel the increased duration of movespeed may give him too much chase down potential. Suggestion 6 is pretty insane of a suggestion because it just gives him too much stickiness, when combined with his q a dash of any kind would make Olaf a nearly unstoppable menace and though that may feel good to play, to play against it would basically come down to how far can you get away before Olaf begins to fight.\n\nOverall you're not wrong in saying that Olaf is pretty weak, but buffing him isn't really an option because how hard he can run over an enemy team when he actually does work up some sort of lead.","replies":[{"poster":"Failog","date":"2019-06-11T17:52:44.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"I sympathize with the champion being weak but I by no means support buffs for him.

His snowball is not insane.  And yes, despite how he builds, hes never THAT tanky. What with all the true damage and % of health damage floating around.\n\nSo buffing him is not an option....and you agree hes weak. Haha so what then? CHAMPIONS ALREADY run over teams when they ahead. Thats part of the game right now.\n\nSeriously, just...I cant handle this line of thinking on the boards. Its a problem to buff a weak champion because he might do well and snowball in matches...meanwhile, we have champions who already do it, do it well, and no one is saying, hey we need to nerf them.  Such a double standard.","replies":[]}]}]}
