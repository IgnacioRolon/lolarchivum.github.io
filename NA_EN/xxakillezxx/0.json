It sounds like you might have either permission-related issues which is causing the patcher to immediately crash upon launch, a connection issue which is failing to establish a connection to start patching, or the launcher is corrupted from a failed patching attempt. In either of the cases, the patcher may simply fail and error out.\n\nIf you've recently updated the OS or a third-party application which may interrupt the patcher's ability to launch (usually an anti-virus or a game launching platform), you may want to run the launcher in Administrator Mode straight from the League of Legends short-cut; details regarding how to accomplish this can be found here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq4\n\nIf that doesn't work and this happens on-and-off, you might want to look into resolving a possible connection issue. Here are some steps we have to resolve connection issues:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq8\n\nOtherwise, it could be a corruption with the launcher itself or if the game client is very out-of-date--let's say you've taken a break from League for a year and you're jumping back on. If that's the case, you may want to force it to re-patch. We've outlined how to do that here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq5\n\nAs always, if you're having issues after completing these steps or have trouble, feel free to contact my colleagues through the Support Site: \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
