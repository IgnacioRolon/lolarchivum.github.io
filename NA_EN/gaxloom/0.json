Tower has hit me way more times from pillar, than assist I&#039;ve received with pillar; therefore, remove the one damage from pillar so I can be free to tower dive without taking that insane 2-3 shots from tower before actually engaging. \r\n\r\nI know that the idea of having one damage pillar came from players, but I don&#039;t believe those players are at the level of play I&#039;m at, and at that the level of play I&#039;m at you need to do more than just throw a pillar up, as well as wait for your team to lift you. My level of play requires me to actually use my pillar to peel off people who are attacking adc or simply block a path off. Regardless I&#039;m also going to be the one who engages, with my q as well. So the chances of me not getting an assist are insanely low; furthermore, the idea of one damage pillar was brought up by players who only felt like throwing up a pillar, then going into the jungle, and wasting time when they could be pushing a lane, or assisting with another kill.\r\n\r\nWhether your opinions differ or not the fact that when trundle players tower-dive they take 2-3 shots of damage before they actually do damage, which is once again insane, please remove one damage from pillar or make it so towers only recognize 10+ damage from champions in order to focus on that champion.","replies":[]}
