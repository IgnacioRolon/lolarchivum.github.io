I was told that LoL does not support 10.12 Sierra fully yet. But I just wanted to address a few issues. I encountered. While in-game, majority of the time there is a delay in the game/during attacks &amp; teamfights. Lagging between all champions and minions. It ranges from light lag that last a few seconds to severe lag(delays) that last minutes.\r\n\r\nWith the client, I notice that its a little slowing trying to change tabs while in the store. Also I can not add items to my List. I try deleting the list and making a new one to no avail.\r\n\r\nI would love to post a video of the lag during game, but I don't know how to record while in game.\r\nIf anyone else recently updated to Sierra on your mac and is running into problems/bugs, Post them.","replies":[{"poster":"GoingQuantum","date":"2016-10-06T21:07:57.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i Have the same problem...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T16:14:13.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're currently having the bugs/issues with League and macOS Sierra posted to our [Bug Report Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Leviticus","date":"2016-10-03T22:04:30.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted my response in the Bug Report Board first and then it was deleted/removed and told me to place it in the help & support section.
