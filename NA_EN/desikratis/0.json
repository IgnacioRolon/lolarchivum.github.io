When confronted with harassment like that, you'll want to mute and keep your focus on the game.  \n\nIn this case, I wasn't able to find another player using slurs towards you, even then it's not okay to repeat it.  **Anyone **contributing towards negative experiences would be reviewed, though.  Looking at your logs it seems you were broadcasting drama into all chat when muting would have been the best option.  Your account has also had a history of homophobic slurs and **extreme **language towards others, so you were already at the top of the [escalation path](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-).

No, they do not support racism, and people who are racist often receive swift punishment. If you were banned for your behavior, it's either likely due to severely extreme offensive chat behavior, or cumulatively negative chat behavior with prior punishments already taken place.","replies":[]}]}
