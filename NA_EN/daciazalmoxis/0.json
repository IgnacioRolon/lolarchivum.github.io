I will also talk about the root of toxicity and how Riot&#039;s idiot system is NOT helping.\r\n\r\nSo here are three things I have noticed from playing league:\r\n\r\n1. First and foremost, the team player aspect of the game just doesn&#039;t work unless all players are decent and have a intermediate understanding of how the game works. However, Riot does NOTHING to help people learn and understand the important aspects of the game. Further, Riot&#039;s player matching system intentionally places higher MMR players with a mix of low MMR players, forcing the higher MMR player to carry ---but how can he carry when the other four players are pure idiots? There is NO way to carry a 1 v 5 (or 9). The game doesn&#039;t allow it. So even if you won your lane and are 20 and 2, you will lose the game because the other lanes lost. This happens way too often. What&#039;s Riot&#039;s solution? Continue placing the bad apples with the good so that they can drag down the good players and keep them no further than a 50% win ratio. \r\n\r\n2. Internet goes out and player gets a warning after ONE TIME afk--because of internet connection! And then like a communist dictatorship, they force you to type in &quot;I Agree&quot; or &quot;I understand&quot;. What if I don&#039;t agree but you force me to agree. That doesn&#039;t get you anywhere but more hate for the game which further translates into the game play. Yes, there are a lot of people rage quitting. But you seriously need to figure out how to not punish the innocent players because of the rage quitters!\r\n\r\n3. Toxic team ganging up on one player, that player responds out of frustration with one comment (which includes curse words..etc), the team reports and gets the player banned for 2 weeks. Mind you that this one the first offense and the team reported for Verbal and AFK. The AFK was due to the player being so demoralized that he was off farming and couldn&#039;t focus to play the match anymore, but didn&#039;t actually leave the game. So can someone please help me understand this one? Why didn&#039;t the toxic players who ganged up on one of the player get punished? They drove the player to lose focus and not be able to play well anymore. And in the end that player is the one getting punished? I&#039;m a software developer, I know I can come up with ways to improve the system of detection. But once again, Riot&#039;s ignorance and lack of solutions adds to the toxicity. That player left League of Legends and will not longer play it because of this. So they lost a decent player but gained four toxic horrible players. Good job Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2018-04-13T19:56:47.713+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Let me start off by saying that the purpose of my post today is to shed light on the illogical and plain stupid punishment system Riot has put in place that adds further to the toxicity of the game.\n\nIf you disagree with the bans you have received on your account, I'm happy to discuss them with you.

Continue placing the bad apples with the good so that they can drag down the good players and keep them no further than a 50% win ratio.\n\nThere's a reason why when pro players make new accounts they end up at the top every time. There's also a reason all of my accounts, in many different regions, are all about the same rank. Players rise to their respective level. Sure there are some games where other players don't do well, but there are just as many games where your teammates do extremely well. Just as you sometimes get carried in games, you will also sometimes carry others in games. There are only 4 others on your team, but there are 5 others on the enemy team. So if you are better than where you are placed, math dictates that you will continue to rise. There is also much more to winning a game than going 20-2. I've lost games with scores like that and known very well I lost the game because I had all the gold (when I could have given kills to others) and I got caught out at a critical time. I've also hard carried games where I had no kills by focusing objectives.\n\n> What if I don't agree but you force me to agree.\n\nYou don't agree to not leave games? Leaver buster does not punish innocent players. It punishes players who leave, and it also serves as a check for players with internet connection issues. If a player DCs during the 'low priority queue' they will have to start again. This makes sure a player with chronic internet issues has a solid connection before they enter game. Regardless of the reason for a leave, it affects 9 other people. Leaving, no matter the reason, is not ok.\n\n>  that player responds out of frustration with one comment (which includes curse words..etc), the team reports and gets the player banned for 2 weeks.\n\nIt's very very unlikely a person would get penalized for one comment. The system takes into account the fact that League of Legends is a competitive game, and as such tensions can run high. But, lashing out on someone in retaliation is not ok, and will be met with a penalty if severe enough.\n\n> Why didn't the toxic players who ganged up on one of the player get punished?\n\nIf they are indeed toxic, they would be. I suspect you may not realize you are being much more toxic than other players. Remember that the vast majority of players never experience any sort of penalty. This is because harassment and lashing out is not the norm. It may seem like it though when you are frustrated and exposed to 9 other people every game. Each time you have a negative experience it will stand out in your mind (negativity bias).\n\n>  I'm a software developer, I know I can come up with ways to improve the system of detection.\n\nFeel free to offer up suggestions. There have been many threads on the boards from people offering suggestions. If you were to write a more effective detection system, there is no lack of companies that would purchase it from you. You'd be rolling in the dough like Scrooge McDuck. If it's an interest of yours, and you have an innovative solution, you should absolutely explore it.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-04-13T20:54:52.349+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JkHdrIrR,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-13T19:56:47.713+0000)\n>\n You'd be rolling in the dough like Scrooge McDuck.\n\nJust FYI OP, that's not how [physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqqfGXrX__8) work.","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-04-14T03:18:42.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Family Guy: [Always ruining childhood cartoons](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sr_AXMUjxKI)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2018-04-13T20:18:25.769+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JkHdrIrR,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-13T19:56:47.713+0000)\n>\n> If you disagree with the bans you have received on your account, I&#x27;m happy to discuss them with you.

What they can do, however, is put players with others of similar skill. The matchmaking **does not** mix high MMR with low MMR - each team is made within a small MMR window and is made to have a 50%+/-1% chance of winning the game. If you're 20/2 and lose the game, then you focused too much on your score and not on helping your teammates.\n\n> 2.

But you seriously need to figure out how to not punish the innocent players because of the rage quitters!\n\nYou aren't being punished by being notified that your AFK was detected. You are punished when you get a Low Priority Queue for AFKing/leaving multiple games and showing a pattern. Judging by your anger here I don't think you've been punished by that system.\n\n> 3.

Good job Riot!\n\nYes, toxicity in retaliation is still toxicity. You have no way of knowing if the \"toxic players who ganged up on one of the player\" got punished or not - yet you are saying that you magically shouldn't get punished because you somehow know they didn't?\n\nToxicity is **never** okay. **NEVER**. It does not matter if others \"started it\". It does not matter if others are \"worse\". Mute them, report them, and move on. If you choose to break the rules in retaliation, you **will** be punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Onecimus","date":"2018-04-14T00:56:38.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll upvote this thread simply because it combined two of my things in the world. \n\nDucktails and a Tantrum {{summoner:11}} \n\nToday was a good day to be a citizen of planet earth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Especially 4U","date":"2018-04-13T23:23:57.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nrader","date":"2018-04-13T19:30:24.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"I disagree about the afk stuff since that genuinely ruins games.\n\nI think you're right about the retaliation topic though, context should always matter.","replies":[]}]}
