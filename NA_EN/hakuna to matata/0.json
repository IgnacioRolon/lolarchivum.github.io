I could log into the site, as obviously im here, and I reset my password and When I go to log into the client it is still saying that my username and password are invalid. Is there a fix to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T22:55:20.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't deactivate accounts unless it's been specifically requested through a support ticket.  The account will simply remain idle until you decide to return.  You can use our [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) to help regain access to your account.  It sounds to me, though, that your patcher might not be set to NA region.  Double check your region on the top right, and you should hopefully be good to go!","replies":[{"poster":"Hakuna To Matata","date":"2016-08-19T00:13:33.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much ahah.
