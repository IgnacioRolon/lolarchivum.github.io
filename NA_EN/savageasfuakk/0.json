God yes.\nBut I don't, because I want to see this community get better, and the only way to do that is to promote positive feedback, which is something I truly wish riot encouraged more. Your logs were very negative, almost always showing antagonistic speech towards your team. Please promote a positive environment if you ever decide to play again.","replies":[{"poster":"SavageAsFUAKK","date":"2016-12-12T19:25:48.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I never once said anything negative first just because someone is feeding.

However, this was not conducive to their reform policy, as many players would never improve their behavior and would just stack up hundreds or thousands of chat restrictions while continuing to use their limited chat to be toxic and ruin the game for everyone else. This is why they moved to the [4-tier punishment system](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/yFLxpAcV-qa-about-player-behavior-systems-chat-log-reviews-and-feedback) where you will eventually be escalated to bans if your behavior is consistently toxic even after multiple warnings.\n\nCombined with the Instant Feedback System, this 4-tier system promotes reform in negative players more than repeatedly giving them punishments that doesn't bother them. Anyone that reaches the 14 day ban step and doesn't get the hint even at the threat of a permaban doesn't need to be around ruining the game for everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2016-12-12T23:44:47.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SavageAsFUAKK,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KEWldVEQ,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2016-12-12T20:19:01.353+0000)\n>\n> no 1 in their right mind can look at the chat logs provided and say &quot; yeah that guys deserves a perm bann from the game forever ..\n> \n> \n> maybe a chat rest or something\n\nIf these logs were the only thing that had ever happened, would anyone say insta-permaban?  Probably not.  But they aren't.  Punishments in league are not taken individually.  They are taken cumulatively, and when you receive as many punishments in as short of a time span as you did, that implies rather strongly that you do not have any intentions of changing how you act.  At the time of the 14 day suspension, which was just days ago, you were told that ANY further infractions would result in a permaban.  \n\nYou've been told repeatedly to change this behavior.  You've been given multiple warnings.  It may seem harsh to be given a permaban for these logs, but these are games of harassing your teammates, in conjunction with all the other games that you were reported for the previous punishments.  \n\nIf you choose to make a new account, please try to learn from this.  If you cannot talk to your team without wanting to snap at them, then mute them.  It's better for you to just not hear them than to risk raging at them and getting yourself back in trouble.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TehChaosWolf","date":"2016-12-12T22:58:25.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're really not seeing the issue here? you HAD a chat restriction.. you HAD a 14 day ban. You HAD multiple warnings in a row that you needed to calm down and play the game instead of flaming or being negative. arguing over whether or not THIS incident needed a permaban isn't the issue. If you had this many warnings in a row, riot decides that you playing their game isn't worth bringing down the games of 4-9 people every single match. so no, maybe THIS one time didn't deserve a permaban.. but you as a player, definitely did. Just because you aren't toxic every single match, or because you had a few good ones, doesn't absolve guilt from previous matches. If you are a generally toxic player, which it seems you are based on the chat here anyway, then no one wants to play with you in their games. After so many people tell riot they would rather you not play.. riot responds with WARNINGS first. you had writing on the wall here, and chose to ignore it instead of hitting mute or moving on and just playing your best. Maybe start a new account as a good person, or find another game to play?","replies":[]}]}]}
