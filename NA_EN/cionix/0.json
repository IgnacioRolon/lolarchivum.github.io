I mean, I can totally imagine Darius coming out of nowhere and slicing Bard in half, trying to defend his flag then Katarina comes in and pounces on him just before Blitzcrank pulls him out of the way, Katarina gets the flag and gets a speed boost and takes it back to her base scoring a point for her team. I think this should be a 5v5 game, and that one team should get at least 10 flags before the game ends. I mean, this game would cause a ton of strategy, because it is hard enough getting to the nexus and destroying it as is, now you need to get to a flag and take it back to your base without Master Yi using his Wuju to facerape you. Anyways, I thought it was a pretty cool idea and that I would share, so feel free to add new things to it (Riot you would be the best if you made this).","replies":[{"poster":"Dessim8","date":"2015-03-21T16:58:36.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if it's a larger map than it needs to be, if a  bunch of enemies are zerging your location and you teleport 5500 distance away, you should be relatively safe unless their speed buffs are through the roof.","replies":[{"poster":"Cionix","date":"2015-03-26T00:28:20.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dessim8,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=EFjPM0de,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-03-21T16:58:36.405+0000)\n>\n> Even if it's a larger map than it needs to be, if a  bunch of enemies are zerging your location and you teleport 5500 distance away, you should be relatively safe unless their speed buffs are through the roof.\n\nHehe, trust me, it'd still be fun, because everyone without the flag will run like a crazy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mikemil223","date":"2015-03-14T04:36:04.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what about if u just picked yi and ult'd to run away. or ,since yi's ult DOES run out, picked riven who can keep speeding up every few seconds as well as go over walls. or freakin lee sin who can q a monster over a wall and then w the one right after that?WHAT ABOUT {{champion:77}} SPAMMING HIS E WITH GHOST (fastest champ in the game plus can get tanky and just outrun everyone and escape)","replies":[{"poster":"Cionix","date":"2015-03-14T16:01:05.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mikemil223,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=EFjPM0de,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-14T04:36:04.869+0000)\n>\n> but what about if u just picked yi and ult'd to run away. or ,since yi's ult DOES run out, picked riven who can keep speeding up every few seconds as well as go over walls. or freakin lee sin who can q a monster over a wall and then w the one right after that?WHAT ABOUT {{champion:77}} SPAMMING HIS E WITH GHOST (fastest champ in the game plus can get tanky and just outrun everyone and escape)\n\nTHATS THE FUN OF IT!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"BatteryDead","date":"2015-03-14T16:42:16.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:111}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:57}} \n\nThere's a lot of lockdown champs out there, wouldn't be too difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"Cionix","date":"2015-03-14T23:32:01.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BatteryDead,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=EFjPM0de,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-14T16:42:16.534+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:111}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:57}} \n> \n> There's a lot of lockdown champs out there, wouldn't be too difficult.\n\nYou're forgetting towers! {{champion:11}} would def be best champ in this situation tho especially with {{summoner:6}} and {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} x3{{item:3072}} and {{item:3280}}","replies":[{"poster":"HGILLIS","date":"2015-03-18T01:44:36.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:4}} can just ult","replies":[{"poster":"Cionix","date":"2015-03-20T00:40:30.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HGILLIS,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=EFjPM0de,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-18T01:44:36.381+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:4}} can just ult\n\nMap would be bigger, they wouldn't be global anymore, he would be useless in this gamemode, his ult might only cover a tenth of the map, maybe less, come on, you can't just think I am going to post a game mode without knowing the basics.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sedonis","date":"2015-03-15T00:42:06.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think this gamemode would be super one-sided, get the most mobile champs, for example bard, reksai, lee. more bans would be needed","replies":[{"poster":"Cionix","date":"2015-03-20T00:38:59.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sedonis,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=EFjPM0de,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-03-15T00:42:06.967+0000)\n>\n> I honestly think this gamemode would be super one-sided, get the most mobile champs, for example bard, reksai, lee. more bans would be needed\n\nBanning would be annoying though, because it wouldn't be a normal Summoner's Rift map, make it bigger, make it more complex, and add turrets, it wouldn't be easy, actually it would be extremely challenging, plus the flag carrier would be handicapped, unable to use abilities. You would run rather fast, like the typical movement speed is about 390-400, their movement speed might be 450-500, but they are extremely prone to stuns and slows, and as for champs who have global ults, they wouldn't be global in this game mode, once again the map would be massive with a lot of twists and turns, Bard would be especially good as a support on this map, but this would be a game where you can either play Offensive or Defensive, playing both wouldn't work. Oh, and this would require team effort, the flag carrier would probably only be able to basic attack and use passives, and they might have a bit more defense, but enemy champions will do an exceeding amount of damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dessim8","date":"2015-03-16T23:21:31.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:4}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:80}} \n\nHow have long ranged teleporters NOT been mentioned yet?
