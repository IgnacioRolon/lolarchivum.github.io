He was supposed to be jungle and so he went to my lane, which was top, and fed. I asked people to report him after game and he reported me after the game and I got perma-banned. I have played on this account for years and invested so much time, only to be banned because of someone who can&#039;t handle their champ being banned and then acting like a ten year old. What is Riot as a community saying, that this kind of behavior is acceptable and fine? And that me being upset about someone not only taking my lane, but also intentionally feeding means a permanent ban? I&#039;ve only had one temporary ban before and then this right away? It seems extremely unfair to me that a player like that gets to get away with this while I get my account which I&#039;ve had for years, get banned.\n\nEdit: Here's chat logs. Yeah I swore and got pissed off. Reason I posted was isn't it supposedly 4 bans before a perma-ban? And honestly it's just shitty to lose an account 109 levels in for this kind of bs. The CAPS part was gp crapping on me cause his WW got banned.

Riot want's people to be toxic and flame. Then they can ban them unjustly, and force them to roll a new account \"Because we have friends who play occasionally\". Hoping, praying, and thirsting, for each toxic talker banned will result in more revenue for their increasingly homoerotic skins, and less than fun gameplay in the form of unbalanced champions. LoL is turning into a SJW self help simulator, because kids can't handle being called mean things on a competitive game. Just think of all the poor kids that played halo on the original xbox that killed themselves cause of guys fucking their mom, then tbagging them.
