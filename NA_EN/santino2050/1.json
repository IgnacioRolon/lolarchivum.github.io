What possible reason is there that literally outweighs another fucking means to intentionally allow trolls/tilted/piece of shit teammates to ruin a game before it even starts?  I mean if you are going to allow pick intents to be banned, the what the fuck is the point of even wasting 20 seconds in the fucking lobby having players select who they intend to play?\r\nSo you can plan a team comp? Pointless\r\n\r\nYou guys claim all this blah blah we want to reduce toxicity, blah blah, yet you allow hovered pick intents to be banned? Fuckin lol, now before the game even starts you give trolls the chance to be toxic assholes without even saying a word, sweet fucking idea(plus another way for them to just fly under the radar, as your system could careless when this happens)\r\nSomeone wasn&#039;t paying attention and bans your pick intent on accident? Tilting, doesn&#039;t matter\r\nSomeone wants to troll and bans a pick intent, on purpose? Just as tilting\r\n\r\nIf someone has a champ selected as their pick, it should be fucking grayed out to keep this stupid ass instant tilting intentional bullshit from happening.  I&#039;m probably just overlooking the extremely positive and crucial reason though that banning your teammates pick intent is allowed, sorry, my bad","replies":[{"poster":"Bionic Jellyfish","date":"2017-09-26T05:33:42.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a question: what if the pick is say, riven midlane? or another troll pick? what then? do you dodge, and face penalties, or ban out the champion and see what happens?","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2017-09-26T07:56:22.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I know it’s not her best role, but what exactly qualifies Riven mid to be called a troll pick?","replies":[{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2017-09-26T08:22:05.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better reason: person in question is last pick, champ is really strong atm, and you don't want enemy to pick it against you.
