I absolutely hate promo for every tier of a division, should be removed as it just adds such a infuriating, pointless layer of additional grinding.  What&#039;s even more aggravating is how fast you can drop after passing a promo.  \r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\nI recently hit S1 again, for the 100th time this season.  I won 5 straight games, 1st win took me to 8Olp S2, next win my series, following win promotion to S1, next win 20lp and the 5th to 39lp S1, sitting at Gold 5mmr according to OPGG\r\n\r\nThen , lost 4 in a row, 39lp to 22lp, 22lp to 3lp , 3lp to 0 lp, 4th loss demoted back to 75lp s2...\r\n\r\nSo overall 5-4 out of 9 games, and since they drop you to 75 rather than the lp you typically lose, now you need to win 3 straight again to get promoted again, to potentially drop in another 4 games.\r\n\r\nEither make it more difficult to drop from a tier or remove the stupid promo series for every damn tier of a division because I honestly see these promotion series as nothing more than another means to drag out the grind and tilt players just for the sake of doing it.  \r\n\r\nWhy not just have a visible  MMR and associate it with a division and tier, ex: 1200 mmr S2, lose a game -18 mmr, 1182 mmr S3,  win the next game +21 mmr 1203 mmr S2 again?  Still have division and tiers then, just no added pointless layer of wasted time, games and grinding in between.  A promo series from b1 to S5, S1 to G5 etc would be more than enough","replies":[]}
