I bought Firecracker Jinx which brought me down to 2205 RP, then I got Shockblade Zed, which is 975 RP, and it brought me down all the way to 255 RP. It charged me twice for one skin, how do I get that RP it charged extra back, Imma be soooooo mad if I lose that money. I don't wanna use my second refund for something that is not my fault or I got ripped off for. Please Help","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-06-25T00:48:56.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After checking into your RP balance, it looks like what you experienced could have been a display error in the client. I've made a slight refresh, so right now you should have the correct amount. If you still see the wrong value, try closing the client completely and logging back in.\n\nIf that still doesn't work, go ahead and create a [Player Support Request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), and let me know here. I'd be happy to get it all sorted out for you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"R2D20","date":"2015-06-25T17:03:02.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That teemo icon, are you Satan!?","replies":[]}]}]}
