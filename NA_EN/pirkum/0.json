But The past few times I've faced an ekko with the sandstorm skin, I cant see where his parallel convergence is going to land until its already landed. No preview circle or anything. And sometimes his trail would zip across the fog of war, but that is a lot less frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"heimonlybluorafk","date":"2019-12-06T06:22:43.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is old, but this just happened to me with trick or treat ekko.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-15T18:48:05.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pirkum - \n\nThanks for the report! I gave him a go in game, and I wasn't able to get a repro, unfortunately. D: If you have any additional info as to what was going on when this happened - or better yet a video - I'd be happy to dig into this a bit more. Without a lead, it's a tad difficult to pinpoint exactly what's causing this to occur. \n\nOut of curiosity, what graphics card do you have/what graphics settings are you playing on?","replies":[]}]}
