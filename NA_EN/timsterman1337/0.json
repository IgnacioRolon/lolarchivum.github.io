They have changed the email, password, and probably the username. The email that I signed up with is not receiving anything, and I fear it may be too late. for some reason, my account is still logged into this website, but I can't change anything due to everything being changed. I have already filled out the forms that Riot provides. I hope something can be done about this because I spent lots of money on this game and have played it for four years. I know it is all my fault and that Riot has provided many warnings about this. :( I'm still really sad though.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T01:55:13.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries bud! You mentioned already having a ticket open, so just do your best on answering as many questions as you can. Even if you aren't 100% about an answer, try to get as close as you can because the more questions answered the more likely you are to get verified as the original owner.\n\nAs a side note: if you still aren't getting responses to your ticket, try shooting us another ticket while *not* logged in. That should guarantee you get a response to the email you provide.","replies":[{"poster":"ChuMan1337","date":"2017-06-26T03:09:39.978+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is timsterMan1337. I followed your advice and logged out and sent another ticket. Because I logged out, I cannot log back in anymore (due to the password being changed). I am using my brother's account to leave this comment. Thank you so much for the quick response. To verify that this is me, the email that I used for the new ticket is teemoshroomsftw@gmail.com. Also, is the automatic LeagueOfLegendsSupportZendesk email that comes after the ticket is sent come instantly or after some time. I may have accidentally forgot the \"s\" after \"shrooms\" while inputting my email into the ticket form. I have not recieved any emails yet, so if the Zendesk email comes instantly after the ticket, that means I did input the email incorrectly.
