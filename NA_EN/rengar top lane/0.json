I think you might not understand %'s because you're trying to dress down just how much 20% is(its ONE FIFTH OF YOUR HP NO MATTER HOW MUCH HP YOU HAVE).","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-11-23T05:55:31.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blindsorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fhh6Oidw,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-11-23T05:51:41.146+0000)\n>\n> Uhhh 20% of your hp is 1/5th of your hp no matter how much hp you have, and no matter what dmg mitigation/healing you would have had for that hp.

Yes 20% might be too much but 5% is too little","replies":[{"poster":"Blindsorcerer","date":"2019-11-23T07:59:48.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fhh6Oidw,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2019-11-23T05:55:31.373+0000)\n>\n> And 5% is so small that you might as well not have an execute at that point.

Especially if its going to be as mindless as \"do any kind of dmg to enemy at X% of hp and they will die instantly\". Just get rid of it and replace it with a better idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-11-23T11:31:16.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you fucking kidding me?
