This tree honestly doesn't offer anything useful for mages. Back then, using 9 points on the defensive tree was possible because it didn't had any useful points for mages, but the utility tree didn't had anything useful for mages either, so the defensive tree could be taken to have the advantage on trades.\n\nBut with those new masteries, there are tons of appealing options on the cunning (utility) tree. There is no reason for mages to go with the resolve (defensive) tree.\n\nThe only exception is {{champion:8}}. He benefits very well from some resolve masteries. The tier 2 has two extremely appealing masteries for Vlad. You can either take Runic Armor, which will increase his already fantastic sustain even more, or take Veteran's Scars, which has fantastic synergy with Vlad's passive. I personally like to take Runic Armor because Vladimir already gains a lot of free HP with his passive. You can then either take Insight to reduce your summoner spells' cooldowns (good if you are going Flash/Ghost to have better mobility) or Perseverance (to have a better chance to survive the early game in which Vlad's sustain isn't so good, and also has synergy with Spirit Visage).\n\nNot to mention, Vlad is a manaless champion. He doesn't exactly benefit from the Secret Stash mastery, and he makes very little use of Runic Afinity. Merciless and Dangerous Game are somewhat good for Vlad, but on my opinion he should just go with the masteries on the Resolve tree. He heavily benefits from them.","replies":[{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2015-11-11T20:58:11.103+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Except Vladimir is also useless because of Executioner's Calling.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-11-11T21:29:58.672+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spizzle9000,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=I4vIKnAP,comment-id=0009000000010001,timestamp=2015-11-11T20:58:11.103+0000)\n>\n> Except Vladimir is also useless because of Executioner's Calling.\n\nI don't see what this has to do with the mastery choices, though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Victurn Up","date":"2015-11-11T19:28:13.546+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL?

So you get 12 ticks of dmg from the single target skills and 6 from AoE/DoTs. \n\nSo let's say you hit an enemy with a single target spell and .5s later you hit them with an aoe spell.\n\nYou'll get 2 ticks of DFT from the single target spell burn and then reapply DFT with the 10% over 1.5s\n\nAs you can imagine, this heavily favors mages that have DoTs or spammable spells.

More specifically, we’re hoping to draw out and amplify some of the cool things your champion’s kit does, instead of just loading on general power. \nAs an example, while Janna may appreciate +10% AP, she’s going to feel much more excited about a +10% amp to shields and heals. One of these stats is for almost everyone, but the other speaks to a number of specific supports. Choice in the system is a secondary goal that, while nice to have, is not as important. There’s 126 champions out there and limited space in the tree, so we’d prefer a world where Soraka and Brand both have 1 path that speaks to them, instead of Brand getting 2 and Soraka crying in the corner. That said, giving players meaningful choices is still an important goal, so we’re trying to add it into the trees where we can. We just may not be able to do it for EVERY champion.
