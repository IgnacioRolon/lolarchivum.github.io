It's a projectile, so it'll get stopped by both Windwall and Unbreakable. The only thing I don't know is whether the projectile is destroyed as soon as the edge touches or if the core needs to collide with the walls, since that's determined by where the hitbox is.\n\nSadly, I don't know how the passive interacts with the walls. Those orbs might be coded like minions, since they kind of don't have a mechanic to spawn; they're just sort of constant. I'll try to test it when I get home, but that'll be a few hours from now.","replies":[]}]}
