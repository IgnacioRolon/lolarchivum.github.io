No need for more armor because of his passive. rest is up to you. e-target carry, aa proc passive and iceborn, ult, aa proc, w, aa proc, heal yourself with q, aa proc. rinse and repeat. By now you should have proc&#039;d grasp twice as well.\r\n\r\n2.)CDR Maokai-I personally start roa and would like feedback on this item on maokai, it hasn&#039;t let me down yet but open for better items. roa, Spirit visage, locket/Frozen Heart(start whichever is biggest need) and rest is up to you. Not going to lie I just w in on the carry after i ult faceroll my abilities with maokai while mixing in aas when possible to sustain off of your passive. Just make sure your cursor is on the carry the whole time you are sticking to so that your q skillshot will hit for extra dmg.\r\n\r\n3.)Mundo-Mundo doesnt realy have a bread and butter build given cdr isnt absolutely what he needs(unless you&#039;re a MUNDO GOD whom can land cleavers every time it cools down) and most people know how to build him given the enemy teams threat. Most items that come to mind that synergise with him are Spirit visage for ult and passive. Sunfire Cape to do massive aoe dmg with your w, and furor enchant on your boots so that you can chase even easier after you q a carry. But like I said the rest is up to what you or the team needs.\r\n\r\n4.)Nautilus- I&#039;d build him the same as Maokai but switch the roa for Righteous Glory. His combo is pretty straightforward but I don&#039;t play him enough to say this is absolutely correct but I ult carry with w on(walk up and aa if possible) if not q to carry then aa, E as the snare from aa ends and they&#039;re disengaging(trust me, they will, you&#039;re scary af) for full damage off all 3 blasts. they are slowed for quite a while so you can continue to harass them with your autos or use the rest of your autos to peel other champions off of your carries in a teamfight as the snare passive and extra phys damage is PER CHAMPION.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add to my list as I just realized these are the only tank champs(that I use) that pick grasp of the undying as a staple. I would add Sejuani however I do have difficulty sticking on people with her.(I know, right?)","replies":[{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2016-03-03T22:07:05.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion stacks a lot of health and the amount of CC he packs makes it easy to land autos.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-03-04T05:44:31.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And he refuses to die!  \n\n{{champion:14}} is perfect for this mastery!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-03-03T22:18:21.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For top lane Nautilus, I believe Strength of Ages is better.

Otherwise the laners can't get it to stack up reasonably except supports who can roam reliably to jungle when their adc is backing.

He just facetanks their damage with his shield, daminging and interrupting them with his CC and abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-03-04T05:41:06.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CS appropriately doesn't matter you know that right?\n\nAll laners can roam but only the support can do it often to reasonably get str of ages stacks before the 30min mark so it's much more reliable to take grasp of the undying for ALL non-jungle tanks and off-tanks/bruisers(Who aren't using fervor of battle).\n\nIf anything you could say Zac doesn't since he just doesn't AA in any fight due to constant AA-preventing abilities being cast. Aside from that I don't see any tank not taking it in lane.\n\nAlso the reason why supports can take it is in off-time they can roam near a jungler's camp since the range for str of ages stacks are surprisingly larger than exp range(Thank you god for that riot.) in addition to ganking for other lanes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-03-03T22:41:46.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All tanks who aren't jungling take grasp of undying hands down, no exception.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zelgoth0002","date":"2016-03-03T22:26:31.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I take Grasp on {{champion:75}} over Thunderlords.
