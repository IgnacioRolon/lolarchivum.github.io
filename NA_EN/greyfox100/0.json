Ultimately, if you're not making your champion idea for your own entertainment, there isn't too much of a reason to. I know that sucks to hear, but it's the truth.\n\nSecondly, a cyborg ninja -- let along one that's pulled from another franchise -- is not something that seems like a good fit for League. While both cyborgs and ninja have a place in *League*, combining the two seems a bit odd, as it's a Zaun/Ionia hybrid that feels somewhat out of sorts with the world.\n\nFinally, while I could give you a full kit breakdown, I feel this kit suffers a lot from two common issues I see frequently. First off is virtually mirroring another character from another game (Genji, in this case) almost perfectly, and second is a tendency to use added movement or passive stat boosts in place of interesting or engaging gameplay. Aside from the Q, this character is *extremely* straightforward and stat-checky, yet also manages to be extremely frustrating due to virtually non-stop mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Greyfox100","date":"2019-01-02T05:13:08.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gods have spoken.\nand it's meant to be out of the ordinary, He has an unknown origin/story.\nWhat more creative could you want?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-01-02T05:20:17.049+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grayfox100,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=BkKwPH1q,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-01-02T05:13:08.678+0000)and it&#x27;s meant to be out of the ordinary, He has an unknown origin/story.\n\nThe problem with \"out of the ordinary\" is that there are ways that's great, and ways it isn't great. A sentient sink with a slingshot is out of the ordinary, but I think we both agree it's a bad fit for *League*. If you want to sell a cyborg ninja, I'd want to see a good origin/story that convinces me that it fits into the *League* world, rather than just throwing it in willy-nilly.\n\n> What more creative could you want?\n\nIf you're legitimately asking the question, I'd want two main things:\n\n* A unique character with a better defined story, as story/character are what players love, and this feels like \"mysterious cyborg who is basically Genji and has a name/theme from Metal Gear.\" I'd much rather see a character who stands on his/her own as a unique addition to the League world.\n* A kit that relies less on easily-accessible mobility and stat-boosts in favor of more interesting interactions or mechanics that are bigger tests of player skill. Your Q here is interesting -- a skillshot with an optional blink is cool, and requires decision-making. The rest is all fire-and-forget abilities that just give a lot of power and/or mobility without a lot of thought or interesting interactions with either the rest of the kit OR with the enemy play patterns.","replies":[{"poster":"Greyfox100","date":"2019-01-03T05:32:41.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See if you're really getting to know me...

So they would not opt to add in a champion who doesn't add versatility into the League. Let alone a champion specifically designed to mirror another character.\n\nJust because they don't have something isn't a reason for them to add it. League also doesn't have a worm champion, and League shouldn't have a worm. Well... Potentially a weird worm thing... Maybe...
