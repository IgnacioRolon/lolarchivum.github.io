I put it on, but it still doesn't work. Like for example, when I'm playing Yasuo, I click my E and the box shows up and then it moves. I don't know why the box shows up, but it makes my E move like a second late. It doesn't sound like much, but it really bugs me.

I did as you instructed, but it still didn't work. The box still shows up, then the spell goes off. Do you know of another way to fixing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Dushi","date":"2017-04-18T04:20:51.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DooshySushi,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7k4NQQse,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-04-18T04:10:34.674+0000)\n>\n> Ahhhh!

One simple change in my settings, and it's fixed. Sorry for taking your time and thanks for attempting to help my stupidity.
