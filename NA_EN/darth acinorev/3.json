After champ select, the logo popped up and tried to load but a black screen came and I had to force close. This happened several times until the game ended. Then I tried to get into another game thinking it was just a one time bug, NOPE. It happened again. So I gave up. Upon logging back in after 2 days, I get a leaver buster warning. Yes, it's just a warning. But it concerns me. I don't want to end up banned because of this. I've gotten chat banned for a few times and this just adds to it. I even put in a ticket to riot, and I still have not recieved a response. Usually I get a response within a day or so. Is there anything else I shouldve been doing?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T22:43:21.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you notice that happening at all, it's always a good idea to first take a step back and troubleshoot these connection issues in a custom or practice game to avoid any penalties. First things first, make sure you check out your network settings using this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a resource. Make sure to do all the steps, but pay extra attention to port forwarding and DNS.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Acinorev","date":"2017-10-11T02:49:47.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anytime anything like this happens, riot always tells me to check my connection. Of course I always do and it is never the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T03:10:23.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't simply asking you to check if your internet was working, there are several troubleshooting steps in that guide that covers many of the basic things that can go wrong. For example, a lot of people think that if you can reach youtube or google that you should be able to get anywhere on the internet, which couldn't be further from the truth. It's pretty common for someone network to have no problems reaching a server like google, and not be able to reach gaming servers like ours or Blizzards.\n\nCheck out each step in that guide, and let me know what kind of changes you saw. The steps I mentioned on Port Forwarding and DNS are two ways of telling your network how it needs to be routed in order to have an easier time reaching our servers. If that guide doesn't work, it doesn't mean we're just done with you! Telling us what helped and what didn't can give us clues on what we need to do next. Let us know what happened when you tested those steps, then we can move forward in troubleshooting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
