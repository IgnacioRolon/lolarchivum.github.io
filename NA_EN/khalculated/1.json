I do have small ping spikes on my internet very infrequently, which last for maybe 2-5 seconds, which causes my game to start 'Reconnecting\" which can last sometimes 5 minutes while it attempts to 'reconnect'. This doesn't make sense to me because I can browse YouTube, play music online, and browse websites while League is 'reconnecting', so I definitely have a solid connection. Even if nothing can be done about these unnecessary punishments, I would just like further information as to how this works, and what I might be able to do to prevent further problems with my account. Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-18T17:10:55.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection might be unstable, and causing you to lose comms with our game server.
