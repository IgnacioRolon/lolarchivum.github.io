I'm not sure what is causing this, but when I switch to the legacy client, my ping just fine with no spikes at all. I'm usually at 33 ping, but on the new client it'll spike to the hundreds and this happens every so often.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T22:21:12.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like a coincidence that your ping is varying between clients, because neither versions actually affect gameplay.

I'm still not convinced that your in-game ping is a consequence of the client, so I'd like to offer one more thing.
