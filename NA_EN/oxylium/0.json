Plus, you got a mute button. If people don&#039;t use it when someone is toxic, it&#039;s their problem. You can&#039;t perma ban someone because he trashing on his team when the jungler goes no smite or the support do nothing but staying backlline and blaming the ADC... I got a problem with toxicity and i know I need to work on this (and a LOT), but this community knows so well how to enrage people!\r\n\r\nAnother thing is the fact that i get perma ban after only a chat restriction... Where&#039;s the 1/2 weeks of suspension? You cannot fix the problem by perma ban anyone who saying &#039;&#039;Go f*ck yourself&#039;&#039;, especially when you are in a competition game.\r\n\r\nRiot, i love your game so much. I put a lot of money in it, money that I should have spent elsewhere, because i feel that this game got a HUGE potentiel. But when i see something like that happened, i feel like i&#039;m being robbed by a company that just don&#039;t care about his community and i wish so much that i&#039;m wrong.\r\n\r\nAll that I&#039;m asking is that you give me a 1 or 2 weeks suspension instead of an insta perma ban after only a chat restriction. I will find some ways to avoid being toxic in the future (like disactivating the all-chat, muting other toxic people, etc.)\r\n\r\nCordially, Oxylium\r\nA big fan of your game!","replies":[{"poster":"Oxylium","date":"2016-12-22T16:29:06.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"I was actually more toxic than just ''go f*ck yourself''.

Saying otherwise just makes you look really ignorant.\n\nI would recommend that you post your chat logs. If you do that perhaps we can identify why you skipped directly to a permanent ban rather than getting a 2 week ban.\n\nSaying people should just mute you when you're being toxic is like saying \"just walk away from the bully.\" Just because someone mutes you doesn't mean you shouldn't be held accountable for your actions (just like the bully shouldn't get a free pass to harass other people as long as he let's people walk away.)\n\nThe permanent ban is not going to be reversed so I wouldn't hope for that. If you decide to stick with the game and make a new account I recommend talking to your computer screen rather than typing. It gets your anger out just like typing but won't get you banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Oxylium","date":"2016-12-22T18:44:08.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"The mute button is like ''just walk away from the bully''...

The problem isn't with the person being bullied, the problem is with THE BULLY.  Likewise, the problem isn't with the people who don't mute you, the problem IS WITH YOU.\n\nSide note, it takes a lot more courage to walk away from a fight then it does to just smash the person into the pavement.  Its easy to start a fight, its hard to walk away from one when all you want to do is hurt the person.  I can't tell you how many times I've had drunken idiots try to start a fight with me.  I have over 5 years of MMA experience so needless to say none of them have ever successfully hit me.  In every single one of those cases I wanted nothing more than to make an example of them and knock them out.  However, if I did that then I'd look like the asshole and the cops would probably arrest me as well as him.  Trust me, its much, MUCH harder to just laugh it off and walk away from a situation like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Oxylium","date":"2016-12-22T19:46:00.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i totally agree with you.
