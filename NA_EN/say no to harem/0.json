Bans that started before 8/22/2017 will not disqualify a player, even if the ban period extended past that date.\r\nPlayers banned for boosting during the 2017 season remain ineligible for rewards.\r\nPlayers who experience fraud-related or erroneous bans will still be eligible.\r\n\r\nThose are the Eligibility Rules for the 2017 season. I'm honor 1, got a 10 game chat restriction a few months back. When I got it I was put in honor 0, didn't flame for a long time and got honor 1 + rewards back. Based on the eligibility rules I should have gotten my rewards, but I see everyone has Insignias except me D;. Feelsbadman, is this how it's supposed to be or am I just a toxic dude that doesn't deserve rewards?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T23:53:59.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rewards will be going out over the month, so if you don't see yours yet no worries.
