Well, you unlocked it by finding friends with the friend discovery feature that connect your League and Facebook accounts. Mystery solved! :3\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLimely\r\nP.S. We might do more (and louder) promotions around friend discovery in the future. Keep an eye out! ;)","replies":[{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2015-06-08T18:37:50.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I already had all my FB friends on league...so where did mine come from O.o","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-06-08T18:42:59.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't have to add anyone, you just had to be linked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limely","date":"2015-06-09T07:24:00.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Phioxsyn,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=9MHgnKEc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-08T18:37:50.773+0000)\n>\n> But I already had all my FB friends on league...so where did mine come from O.o\n\nSorry my wording was confusing! As mentioned by Valkyrie Witch, you actually get the boost from linking, not necessarily from adding friends.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XTRENIX","date":"2015-06-09T16:39:54.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didn't get my BOOST","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wickedfates","date":"2015-06-08T20:49:23.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty, i dont have that particular feature but i really appreciate the fact that you posted this info which seems to come from reddit to the boards.... well played \n\noh... and i thought maybe a weird choice of links.... is this to remind us to use the search function as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Limely","date":"2015-06-09T07:22:25.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wickedfates,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=9MHgnKEc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-08T20:49:23.319+0000)\n>\n> ty, i dont have that particular feature but i really appreciate the fact that you posted this info which seems to come from reddit to the boards.... well played \n> \n> oh... and i thought maybe a weird choice of links.... is this to remind us to use the search function as well?\n\nIt was linked from the \"Notice\" on the front page of the subreddit regarding the 4-win IP boost... I promise at one point the comments revolved around said topic, but somewhat quickly derailed into a discussion about the search function......... ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}
