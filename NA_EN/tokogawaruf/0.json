Also it just pested the Boards with more unneccesary Rage and Rant that i originally wanted to exterminate, at least on my part. I got really emotional seeing another one of my loved Champs get changed (The other was old Yorick) and gave in to my hatred. \r\nI officially call my Post a Unneccesary, biased rant and openly beg for forgiveness, especially the Writers and Voice Team of new Aatrox. \r\n\r\nNow that my Self-hatret is out of the Way, lets talk new Aatrox. So I dug into him, his quotes and lore especially, because i still just love lores of Champions. \r\nTo stay unbiased of my, in the 3 day old post shown, clear bias, i treated him like a new Champion named \"Boris\", just for the keks since i read that here somewhere. Anyway, reading and hearing him like this, he actually is a really deep, great Champion, a once noble warrior gone mad, driven into his rage as a only way to express his despair he felt for Years. Hes not, as i said \"So AngEry\", hes totally despaired with no other way to vent it then seeking revenge and destruction. He simply can´t act different, and seen from his Point of view, who wouldn´t feel his way.\r\n\r\nTl,dr, My latest Post was total crap, I feel pathetic for even writing it, and new Aatrox is actually a well designed Champion Lore an Quote wise","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-06-16T17:10:07.148+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":16,"body":"Making this post is super big of you and deserves a thanks...\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}} \n But I mean we have to be careful about this sort of new behavior — otherwise we risk the board’s rep as the most toxic of the toxic  being jeopardized. \n\n  Terrible things could happen!

If the fact that this is Riot's Boards has any formal or sentimental value, then a shithole like Reddit that is clunky, ugly and corrupt with it's moderation should not have gained the favor of Riot more in the first place than their own forums.\n\nThe reason you stopped posting is because you mostly post about Mordekaiser (anything that hits the front page at least) and nothing else really. One of your discussions is literally labeled \"Do you hate Assassins? Do you despise Yasuo?\" under Gameplay. The content of that discussion is nothing more than \"Yasuo shits on X; Y and Z champion and he is easy. That's about all i have to say.

Yes thats what he became after he was tortured for centuries but he was clearly honorable  beforehand and was a great general even though his methods were brutal. He sacrificed himself not once but twice for the betterment of others thinking that he would die each time. Also there was no previous weakness or darkness that xerath exploited he just overpowered him using time. After this he became a mad beast lusting for blood willing to kill all in between him and his revenge. Yet even then nasus believes that he is redeemable. He obviously hates the world judging by he constantly talks about killing shit and even has the everyone will suffer like i have which is ironically pretty close to aatroxs vo.\n\n\nAatrox as far as we know also defends shurima as a godlike being except against the void instead of people. Based on his vo he believed himself to follow nobel ideas and was helping targon for whatever reason. However something happend which was likely him getting corrupted by the void and going insane and he was sealed in the blade during the darkin wars. Eventually he got out and now decimates the land seeming revenge against the targonians who wronged him by giving humans the ability to trap him in a blade. He thinks he is immortal only being able to die when everything else is dead. His vo is just as bloody as renektons and involves a ton of random slaughter lines. It hints that he was once a nobel creature but is now just a savage hunting for revenge just like renekton.\n\nSo we got 2 characters that were both noble warriors at one point that fought for something they believed in and ended up sealed away only to be tortured for ages to eventually be freed. They then seek revenge against the ones they perceive trapped them in there being more than happy to kill everything in their path. They both wish to die and if the void corruption ends up true for aatrox they were both manipulated by a external entity to go insane.\n\nStill sounds similar to be honest. In fact aatrox could be a even greater savage than renekton was judging that as far as we know he didnt sacrifice shit and was captured and imprisoned in the blade by force. Though if he does sacrafice himself it just draws a bigger parallel between the characters.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheMinionLeader","date":"2018-06-16T21:37:56.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"although it so easy for those people to criticize something negatively they can not stand it when they are at the receiving end of said criticism!\n\nhe was attacked by this player.

Good on you, man.  A couple things, though.\n\nIt's good to be kind to Rioters, but \"Riot\" as a company isn't necessarily the same thing as the people behind it.\n\nThe big thing I want to address, though, is that although I agree that the other post wasn't very helpful, it's totally fair for you to be upset by the rework.  I'm super happy you've taken another look at it!  But as long as you're civil, it's ok to give negative feedback, even to get a little emotional.  Although I'd try to vent your frustrations to a friend before you post your feedback.\n\nChampion re-launches are hard.  Sometimes champions have a lot of different parts to what they are, and trying to decide which of those are most important, and even then deciding if there's a way to deliver those things for a more holistic experience, is something I'm sure both gameplay and writing sectors stress about.  Aatrox has a style of gameplay that doesn't mesh with his character/theme, I feel.  Based on what i've heard, it seems there is a change in gameplay style, but he still functions as a Diver and I think he captures the thematic better than before (bluntly, I always thought his literal dive was silly and felt out of place for a character who feels like he should be a Juggernaut).\n\nThat isn't to say you'd be wrong to have a differing opinion or to like the old Aatrox better.  No need to feel guilty about THAT part.  But as someone looking from the outside (not a player of him, myself), I feel the new Aatrox fits better within Runeterra and has a more defined thematic.  He was always portrayed as a juggernaut (as a character archetype, not the League class system), but his gameplay didn't deliver on that at all.  I feel his Q hitboxes feel too much like a fighting game in that it feels too \"fun\", but other than that I think his new kit really delivers the feeling of an unstippable war veteran.","replies":[]}]}
