Is there anything planned for him on the lore front?\n\nRecently we've had quite a bit of lore for the Darkin, with Kayn/Rhaast, Varus, and some other blurbs of their race mentioned here and there. In the end, we know a decent amount about Varus, Rhaast, why they were here, what their motivations are, etc, but Aatrox (muh main boi) is still lagging behind the group without any kind of real fleshing out. \n\nI totally understand if you're unable to talk about anything that may or may not be in the works, so this was mainly a question about if it's possible/on the table rather than if it's happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-07T19:04:11.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A great question... although, since it relates to the future, I have to be a little more vague...\n\nWe currently have three darkin champions, and there's a lot of implied lore in there.
