I've been working on this system for a couple months now, but wanted to make sure I would stick to the project and I have no plans of ever stopping this until it's done (even then, I will update and expand the system). \r\n\r\nSo I have a lot I have been working on whether it be items from the game, characters, races, or places. I am attempting to create the most immersive and expansive Dungeons and Dragons experience possible. I know you all want to know progress and I am including progress below as well as a tentative description of the DnD LE~ Official Campaign. \r\n\r\n~ League Edition\r\n\r\n**Progress**\r\n* Items - There are currently Over 200 items in the game, and I will be including basic adventurer's gear from the Player's Handbook (DnD 5E) _these itesm will not be exactly as those in 5E_ I will be including about 100 Items from the In-Game Shop with their own abilities and effects that will play their roles in every campaign.\r\n\r\nItems Ready: 2 / ?\r\n\r\n* Weapons - Like I stated previously, there are about 200 items in the in-game shop, and most of them are weapons, which makes sense. However, there have been a plethora of weapons and items that have been removed over the years because of their lack of need or for balancing purposes. In Dungeons and Dragons, we're limited by our imaginations, and that means I will bring back 90% of weapons and items you missed whether from being new to the game or it was removed to soon in your heart. We'll bring those items back and they all will have their value.\r\n\r\nWeapons Ready~~: 52 / 52\r\nLegendary*  Weapons Ready~~: 7 /  50\r\n\r\n_~ Legendary weapons are weapons that are one of a kind_\r\n_~~ Weapons that are ready are ready for play testing, and for beta purposes, and their current copies may not make it to the final version_\r\n\r\n* Classes - With classes, I currently am using placeholders, for play testing currently, I will be running normal 5E classes. However, myself (as well as a few other DnD players and DMs / GMs ~) are working on unique classes as well as basic classes.\r\n\r\nBasic Classes Ready: 0 / ?\r\nUnique Classes Ready: 1 (Almost) / ?\r\n\r\nWith Classes, these will take a very long time for all of the unique and even the basic classes, because they all will go to 20th Level and have unique abilities, feats, and lore. Some (most) will be tweaked throughout the final release, until we [the devs] think it is balanced\r\n\r\n~ GM or DM stand for Game Master of Dungeon Master, these both stand for the person who is essentially God of the game being played and runs the campaigns.\r\n\r\n* Races - Races are another large project, because there are so many diverse and unique creatures in Runeterra that I have to take the time to create each race and their unique traits. However, not all races will some sort of enhancement or debuff, some will be pretty boring (for now).\r\n\r\nRaces Ready: 4 / 31 \r\n\r\nAlthough I have about 4 races ready for play testing, they are not finished and will get buffs and nerfs as play testing starts.\r\n\r\n* NPCs - NPCs or Non-Playable-Characters are extremely complicated, but I will assure you I will be spending weeks (if not months) preparing these characters for the official campaigns. Also, as a sorta bonus note I will be including **every single** champion in the game, as well as custom lore that will fit into the official lore of each champion. So yes, that will mean Pantheon will want to be a baker, even though it isn't official anymore. \r\n\r\nNPCs Ready: 0 / 133\r\n\r\nThe reason I don't have any NPCs ready is because I will be focusing on the technical aspects of the game before even thinking of the campaigns and how individual characters will fit into them. \r\n\r\n* Creatures - You thought I forgot about enemies? Heck no! I have been spending **A LOT** of time of monsters and a few mini-bosses. The creatures you'll encounter will be creatures you encounter (_or have encountered in the past_) all throughout Runeterra, so how can I not bring these to life?\r\n\r\nLeague-based Creatures Ready: 19 /  28\r\nGeneral Creatures Ready: 0 / ?\r\n\r\nSo why did I separate League creatures and general? Why not compile to one list? Well, the fact of the matter is, there are only about 28 different creature types I could really come up (Including Epic Monsters), and that just won't cut it, so I will be adding many many many more. Like skeletons, spiders, rats, zombies, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright well, I've let you all soak in a **very** general tone of what this game's progress looks like from the technical aspects (Not even going into initiative, abilities scores, leveling, etc yet....maybe another update). I'll give you a sneak peek of how your experience will sorta work as you are reborn into the world of Runeterra.\r\n\r\n_All Parenthesis'ed text will be for a GM_\r\n\r\n_Address your party and welcome them to the world of Runeterra, your party has to decide this before playing where they will begin their quest: Demacia, Freljord, Piltover, Zaun, Shurima, the VooDoo Lands, or Yordle Land.\r\n\r\nIf the party cannot reach a consensus, decide for them roll 1D8, on 8 they will placed into the Void._\r\n\r\nYour party awakens in a foreign land to you and before you see _the major city in the nation_. \r\n\r\nYour choices are never limited to only approaching the city, as your party is aware of different paths before them, leading your party into a different adventure at every turn.\r\n\r\nSo which path will you take when you are reborn into Runeterra?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Just a small note for everyone, I really haven't worked this out to the depth of any other campaign I have played or worked on, but I wanted to tease a bit more of the world of Runeterra, and hopefully hype up a lot of you. Thank you for taking the time for reading this thread, and I hope to get some constructive criticism back from all of you! I do [stream](http://twitch.tv/wegetcrunk) League everyday (Monday - Saturday) for many hours a day and play other games all for charity, I do take many hours out of the stream to talk about this system and come up with more ideas throughout playing and grinding out different goals in game, so please feel free to stop by whenever or check out my [twitter](http://twitter.com/mrmrl96) for updates on the stream and the dnd system. Sorry for the self-plug, but I just wanted to get contact info out there!_","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-11-05T05:26:27.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome sounding.

I've been playing D&D for years, both the very first version, and now 5e. But. Riot. Im a little afraid of the fact that you do this to earn more money instead of making a new chapter in the history book of D&D and basicly just all RPG, cause D&D are and stays the biggest so far. I only got this feeling because you, the recent years, has made the game, more for the money than for the game. I wish you the best luck creating the D&D version, i got no idea how D&D allowed you to do so, but its great!, thats not what Im saying. Im a little aware of the prise tho, because personly I dont really got any, but I would to see the project proceed through the early stages. Is it possible to get some kind of early access? Im an experienced player to say it my self, and I would really like to see the game grow. Please. \n\nJust a little note from one who has tried to develop RPG himself (gotten as far as actually finding an artist to put colors on it all, but then it died while writing the rules), played it through his entire life so far (mostly D&D), and thinks its awesome, and an amazing idea.

However I have to question the use of system. Not in the 5e vs 4e and so on. But why are you using a class based system? There are many other systems such as fate which I believe would serve to better convey the themes, personalities and attacks all the champions have.","replies":[{"poster":"Freljords Shield","date":"2016-11-08T18:39:49.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the offer! I will definitely extend my hand to those who want to help as we need it! Also, as far as class based systems vs a system such as fate, we explored the option on paper and it didn't seem fitting, because you aren't going to be playing the champions from the game, but you will be exploring the universe they live in. Although FATE is a great system for it does, Class based systems convey a better attribute you lack from playing League of Legends and that's the process of leveling up and role playing that. \n\nPlease don't get me wrong, I like FATE, I have played campaigns with FATE and worked with and tried to tinker many other options as well as more home-brewed options, but a class based system seems to be the most effective and getting people more involved with a story and allowing them to have a more clear direction in which the game will head. \n\nHowever, as time progresses and we work through options and we don't think a class based system will be most effective, we will explore other options. This concept of a League-based RPG is something that will take time and a lot of effort, so there will be different versions people will want to try, we're just trying to get a cookie-cutter (for a lack of words) system ready for people to explore and play with.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2016-11-08T19:44:48.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All fine.

However, we want the classes to feel as though if your character was brought to life on the Summoner's Rift, it would have a clear role in the game. As a slight teaser, a class we've been brewing up currently is going be the ultimate support character. Your character will have upwards 3D12 maybe even 4D12 Hit Points at First Level, and an outstanding armor class as well as feats comparable to Braum's W (Stand Behind Me) and his E (Unbreakable). As I am one of the only people in our \"dev squad\" who plays regularly I am constantly analyzing different champion abilities and seeing how we can tweak and balance them to make them fit into different main classes and sub-classes. As well as being able to multi-class in a very natural way.\n\nI hope to have a few more updates by the end of the month, but I also plan on having a play test version (with possibly 5 classes and a decent amount of races to select from) ready sometime in January.

I used it in my Chamion Suggestion Alythiira, The Bender. But the chamion was shot down very very hard... Anyway here it comes:\n\n#The Path System, Magic\nAlpha Version 1,12\n\nMy idea is based on cards. Each turn you gets cards equal to half your Spell Attack Bonus Modifier rounded up. The “magic” cards are based upon your class (if any), which mean, if Im wizard, and my spell attack bonus modifier is 7, when I choose the “magic” action, Ill then draw four cards from the Wizard Spell Card deck. Now my idea behind this is like paring three cards of three types. Channeling, Damage and Effect. So if I drew some and these three is amongst them:\n\n\n#Three of the cards drewen:\n\n\n**Channeling:** Your spell is channeled through a bolt of energy, damaging Radiant damage.\n\n\n**Damage:** You spell deal 2d10 (plus spell damage modifier ofcause) damage in a circle of two feets\n\n\n**Class Spell Card, Effect:** The hittin have half movement in three turns.\n\n\nNow this is basicly Karma’s Q with out the “Kameha Heeliane” (R), but I’m not done yet. My whole thought was that, upon choosing Wizards, Sorcerer of fx. Warlock, you would gain one, maybe two Spell Cards, you always have. I call these “The Class Spell Cards”. You then discards all remaining cards upon firing the spell and those three (besides if one of them is a Class Spell Card then you keep it). My idea is to, when you make the charater, you draw this so called “Class Spell Card” from a seperate bunch of cards (yup heres going to be many), which are slightly less powerful than the cards you draw upon using magic. To make it easier to get precisly what you want you can, upon leveling up your character, choose to switch out your “Class Spell Card” (this is done randomly). This is just a new idea for the kind of “Spell Slots”, can trips are the same. My thought was to let you draw another card in level 6, then you have two “Class Spell Cards”, in level 11 and in level 16 (Which basicly is in those levels when your’e enable to buff ulitmate). \n\n\nTo prevent this from getting super powerful I add what I call “Spell Drain”, inspired by WarHammer’s “mana” system. “Spell Drain” drains you temporerily physically, which means you got some points of “Spare Energy”. Using a spell with two cards requires 1 “Spare Energy” using a spell with three cards as the one above requires 2 “Spare Energy”, and so on. Which makes you enable to fire the most powerful and devestating spells, but balances it through the “Spare Energy”, because when you’ve used all your “Spare Energy” and uses a spell more, you gain “Spell Drain” equal to the “Spare Energy” cost of the spell. \n\n\n“Spell Drain” takes your Dex, Str and Cons. Temporerily. Im thinking of, having onestack of “Spell Drain” you gain -1 to all Dex throws (if your then having a +3 modifier in Dex, you now have +2 until after next long rest). And yes, once again you recharge “Spare Energy” and gets rid of “Spell Drain” during a full long rest. Having two “Spell Drain” might cause you to gain dis advantage on all Dex throws, and so on. It just gets worse and worse and worse. But doesnt prevent the magician from using magic, which I personally thinks is great. It more what it should be, according to me. Hope you can use my thoughts so far!\n\nSmaller Note: About the visual expression is up to the player i think.

I guess I would call it; all of which I will do so separately and go through the whole system rather thoroughly.\n\nTo start off, conceptually this is interesting. Its a different way to address and portray spell casting. However, it seems far too complex and possibly even too tedious to play it and without proper explanation and time to dedicate to balancing and allocating resources into channeling, cards, and 'dump' stats for most mages / spellcasters, this seems rather difficult to pull off. However, like I said, this is a very interesting take on magic overall, and reminds me of Twisted Fate, and I will look for your guidance when the time comes to design Twisted Fate's attacking system, as well as his spells and abilities.\n\nFurthermore, your technical aspects of the system are pretty flawed. I stated previous that this system will be very hard for a normal mage to use, because as a mage your dump stats are normally Strength and Dexterity. So _Spell Drain_ will be very daunting and almost too large of a risk for most spell casters to use. Also, the whole system from a technical aspect is extremely complicated and almost convoluted to an extent. For emphasis, having a card system in place where that is the only means of casting is quite silly when you take into account that most mana using champions and casting champions can cast magic from tools or even their bare hands. So essentially this card system is good for specific classes and functionalities, however it isn't a blanket system by any means.  \n\nOverall, your system has its ups and it has its downs. I will regard it when designing Twisted Fate and specific mage classes, that are similar to him. However, this won't be a blanket system for Magic in this specific system because I don't think it would work well as a general system; like I stated before the concept is very interesting for a more concise magic, but not for all magic users because it really wouldn't make sense for them to follow this system.\n\n\nTL;DR - I like this concept, but I don't think it is the right decision for use of general magic users, and will be considered for more specific purposes.","replies":[{"poster":"Lilythia Somana","date":"2016-11-12T20:19:19.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=wegetcrunk,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=2dxAEuaW,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-11-11T20:24:40.247+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m going to address everything I do, and do not like about this particular system?

However, it seems far too complex and possibly even too tedious to play it and without proper explanation and time to dedicate to balancing and allocating resources into channeling, cards, and &#x27;dump&#x27; stats for most mages / spellcasters, this seems rather difficult to pull off. However, like I said, this is a very interesting take on magic overall, and reminds me of Twisted Fate, and I will look for your guidance when the time comes to design Twisted Fate&#x27;s attacking system, as well as his spells and abilities.\n> \n> Furthermore, your technical aspects of the system are pretty flawed. I stated previous that this system will be very hard for a normal mage to use, because as a mage your dump stats are normally Strength and Dexterity. So _Spell Drain_ will be very daunting and almost too large of a risk for most spell casters to use. Also, the whole system from a technical aspect is extremely complicated and almost convoluted to an extent. For emphasis, having a card system in place where that is the only means of casting is quite silly when you take into account that most mana using champions and casting champions can cast magic from tools or even their bare hands. So essentially this card system is good for specific classes and functionalities, however it isn&#x27;t a blanket system by any means.  \n> \n> Overall, your system has its ups and it has its downs. I will regard it when designing Twisted Fate and specific mage classes, that are similar to him. However, this won&#x27;t be a blanket system for Magic in this specific system because I don&#x27;t think it would work well as a general system; like I stated before the concept is very interesting for a more concise magic, but not for all magic users because it really wouldn&#x27;t make sense for them to follow this system.\n> \n> \n> TL;DR - I like this concept, but I don&#x27;t think it is the right decision for use of general magic users, and will be considered for more specific purposes.\n\nI see your points, and thanks. I will be glad to help you with what ever you need mroe than two eyes on, it can be my bad english spelling has made my little magic concept a little hard to understand, but ye, it was just an idea i got sitting in the train on my way to the gymnasium. About previously being a TF thingy, it wasnt really what i was thinking but if you can use it go ahead.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
