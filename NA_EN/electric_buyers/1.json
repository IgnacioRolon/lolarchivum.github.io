I play ranked Solo in low Plat and my experience is not hell, it's exactly the same as it was last year when solo queue existed. I win games, I lose games, and sometimes I get utterly stomped, it's the same as it's always been. I have never once in over 100 ranked games been abused by a premade team, the only instance of intentional abuse I can think of this entire year was during a normal game where the J4/Darius bot lane intentionally stole my jungle EXP at level 1 and flamed me, and that's a normal (and a SINGLE incident) so I don't give a shit about it. Heck I even got a notification when my report on both of them led to punishment by the system. \n\nElo boosting has always existed, and will continue to exist. The main reason queue times in lower Elo's have gone up is because of all the quitters (this is a guess and I honestly could be wrong), and saying there would be less toxicity is an outright lie. League has a toxic community, it was worse before when people had to fight over roles, now at least there is some semblance of democracy and balance in team comps. Sometimes it doesn't work out but in the vast majority of my games players are getting there preferred roles or are willing to trade with someone without the \"mad grab\" of yesteryear. \n\nDynamic queue is not a perfect system, but I have no real issues with it. If solo queue were to magically reappear overnight it would make no difference to me, but in it's absence the game is still playable and is not the flaming heap of garbage the vocal minority are making it out to be. I understand that everyone has a different experience and perspective, but this is mine. I like dynamic queue just fine.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Simpumba","date":"2016-05-21T15:00:06.754+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I'm on the verge of quitting LoL, and I've played for 4 years.
