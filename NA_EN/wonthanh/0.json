Equip a skin for a champion that you have at least 2 skins for. The other player should have the other skin equipped.\r\n2. During champion select, have the other player choose this champion.\r\n3. During the final phase of champion select, trade for this champion. \r\n\r\nYou should find that the skin selected is not the one you had originally equipped, but the one the other player had. I have only observed this on several occasions and haven&#039;t actually tested it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-11T06:04:04.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In ARAM even if its the first champ I get without trading the skin it starts on is often not the last skin I used, idk if this is intentional.\n\nHaven't noticed a problem on SR but I don't trade that often.","replies":[]}]}
