Every loading screen takes longer than the previous client. (Chosing match type, opening profile information, etc)\r\n2. Especially the Champion select screen , after you accept the match, the champ select shows up after 6secs+ with black screen before the champ selects load- sometimes i am left with 10 secs to pick a champ: or missed the match because i couldnt select any (screen is still loading in black).\r\n\r\n*im using alienware so my PC is not the problem... \r\n\r\nanyone knows how to solve this?
