This changes when he gets kidnapped by the very crew who stole Morningstar - because they need his help in repairing it!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:29:29.690+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love all the particle effects you chose!  Especially the constellation zone. However, I can't help but get an \"insect\" vibe from the model.  I was imagining something a little more sleek/scifi, whereas your concept art makes Viktor feel a little hobbled together. That's a cool direction, too, but I'm not sure it matches the Odyssey thematic.","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2019-10-15T23:17:06.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! Yeah I envisioned him as a sort of an insect-fish-alien, who lived a not so luxurious life since the Morningstar got stolen. I guess the legs give the strongest insect vibe - I could try some further variations!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2019-10-16T11:21:44.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leyvey! This is awesome. I love love LOVE the concept art. I will confess, it feels like the sleekness and spacing was lost in translation to 3D (the body shape is different, after all), but from the back - in my opinion - he looks absolutely fantastic! The cloak, the hair, the metal plate &amp; cables protruding from the back of his neck, the **wrench** and the awesome arm just *synergise*, y'know? It looks awesome.\n\nIf you're thinking of different approaches, one thing that might be really neat is a visor/mask that mostly focuses on the upper half of his face, revealing a human (or insectoid) mouth and/or jaw. Think a mechanic augmented with the capacity to use elaborate nerve-controlled tools, rather than a full cyborg who aims to replace and improve any and all bodily functions. \n\nThen again, a blast shield is totally justified for somebody who walks around with a goddamn WELDING LASER on his back, so in hindsight, maybe an unguarded jawline isn't a fantastic idea. \n\nScarves, leather and breathing apparatus might be neat, though. An intricate and plentiful supply of pockets and tools all over his legs, shirt &amp; jacket. I don't know how familiar you are with tradesman pants, but I buy em just cause they look neat and there are upside down pockets for notebooks, inner pockets for small tools, outside pockets for wallets and what-have-you and even clips for satchels and such. \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\nBUT I DIGRESS\n\\\\\\\\\\\n\nSorry for trying to pitch ideas. I just really dig this concept and felt vicariously creative. Also Viktor stuff. VIKTOR STUFF.","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2019-12-10T22:06:07.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, hi Anagram King! Sorry for my late reply!\nExcellent suggestions you have there. I just love this idea of a disgruntled space engineer with a laser mounted on his back, fixing ships on megadocks in low gravity and counting money, wondering if he'll have enough for his rent.\n\nAlso, more Viktor content you say? I've got just the thing! I published the next chapter to Becoming the Herald!

Wonder if she did some concept art or somethin'.\"\n\nImagine my shock when I see a full blown prologue in action. And the promise of MORE TO COME?! Very cool, leyvey. Jayce looks like someone from a 90s sitcom, by the way. The kind of b-star who gets their own mildly-successful spin-off series. :P\n\nI like that you don't shy away from Viktor's insecurities and potentially villainous tendencies. I like that he's simultaneously egotistical AND grounded in a firm sense of reality. Even though I didn't like the lore redesign that Viktor was given, that short story in which he spoke to/\"helped\" the small child was fantastic. That's not entirely relevant, I know, but I've seen a lot of your art embrace his heroic tendencies AND his villainous tendencies, both - Viktor, himself, ignoring his flaws. He believes himself above such petty trivialities, despite still having his own subjective sense of morality and perspective.\n\nI recall a post you made, once, defining his insecurity and 'need to be recognised' as central themes in his character. \n\n_I liked that interpretation._\n\nI can't wait for the next chapter, leyvey. This one was rad. I also apologise profusely for referring to you as the 'Viktor chick'.\n\n**Afterthought edit:** Also your drawing is getting good. Really good. I'm not an artist, but I've been around a lot of them and so have been exposed to the difficulty some have with tackling different shapes and styles. I'm also noticing a lot of noise and immersion in several - even most - of the panels. Love and toil has been put into a lot of it - you can totally tell.\n\nYou've been getting consistently better. Which I *suppose* one could expect from somebody who draws as a regular hobby. But it's still very neat.\n\n**Another edit cause I ignored your post:** I'm also totally sold on poverty-stricken mechanic Viktor. Give him some grease and stained overalls!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
