As far as I can see, every type of champions has another that's good against, and the other that's week against. Assassins have been getting on my nerves because I play immobile champions, etc. A lot of people have been complaining about the massive mobility many new champions are getting, and some are demanding that mobility gets removed. But what if a new class could be created, specifically designed to counter mobility champions, while being weak against some other type?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2015-02-22T20:29:47.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This class of champion technically does exist: **Tank**\n\nMobility is countered by crowd control. **Tanks** bring the most crowd control to a team.\n\nThis doesn't make it a hard counter, and I'll admit that tanks in general are suffering a bit due to the strength of crowd-control-carrying initiation bruisers in the current meta, but crowd control is the counter to almost all the mobility in the game.\n\nMaking a whole new \"class\" of champions to counter mobility would be a design mistake, especially because \"mobility\" isn't an inherent trait of any class. Instead it's something present in all types of champions. We have tanks with high mobility abilities (Sejuani, Jarvan IV, Vi), fighters with high mobility (Renekton, Riven, Kha'Zix, Lee Sin), mages with high mobility (Ahri, LeBlanc)...the list goes on in virtually every role.","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2015-02-23T21:56:20.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, mobility isn't a trait of only one class.

The list is already pretty large: knock-ups, knock-backs, flings/pulls, slows, snares, roots, stuns, silences, blinds, fears, polymorph, charm, taunts and suppressions. Any new type of CC with different rules needs to be carefully considered.","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2015-02-24T18:00:29.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, everything new will be carefully considered, especially since the game is already very complex and each type is intrically connected to the other.

Well, we have a few methods of targeting something: Point-and-click, linear skill-shot, targeted AoE skill-shot, non-targeted AoE (centered on you), semi-targeted AoE (typically cones extending from your champion), vector-targeted AoE skill-shot (Rumble and Viktor), and global non-targeted abilities (Karthus Ult, Soraka Ult). Everything else that doesn't fit nicely into the above categories is typically a variation of one of them.\n\nI'm not sure there IS much else we could do as far as targeting is concerned, honestly. This covers pretty much all of the \"ability hits enemy automatically\" and pretty much every way of saying \"ability MAY hit enemy if you use it right.\" I'm having trouble coming up with a third method of casting that isn't point-and-click or some variation of \"direct the ability's area through your positioning or the positioning of your cursor, with the potential to miss.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Drewprint","date":"2015-02-22T13:55:23.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Introducing a whole new class, while it does sound appealing, would break the system Riot is still in the process of balancing correctly. \n\nIf you want to counter a mobility champ, *play* a mobility champ.
