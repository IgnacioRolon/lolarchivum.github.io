They altered her to look more like a shark. \n\nIf you want pool party A Sol to work I think you need to change his model to look more like a sea creature of some sort. Just changing his color doesn't cut it. If they arent a humanoid then they need to look like they belong in the water. A sea horse was the first thing that came to my mind based on his posture. \n\nA ghost tail also doesnt make sense on a water creature because hes no longer an ethereal cosmic creature. So perhaps this is a good oportunity to just chop off his ghost half entirely and make him an upright seahorse with less overall tail length so there is no need to make half of him ghosted as a sign that its not a part of his hitbox. The new seahorse model would simply fit within the confines of his actual hitbox.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2018-06-06T20:03:09.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 I like water for the orbs but good work","replies":[]},{"poster":"3001413","date":"2018-06-07T04:43:56.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe just \"Beach Sol\"?
