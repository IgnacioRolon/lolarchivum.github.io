While I think you should still lose stacks (whenever you die, execution is dieing) and while it can be very frustrating to finally \"catch\" someone only to have him troll around and manage to get an execute (easier with fizz than with mordekaiser for sure)  he/she apparantly outplayed you a bit, I usually just say \"wp\" in all chat in those situations. The price is dieing which means you lose out on possible farm/exp/buffs, you're not available to your team for (counter)sieging or taking dragon/baron and you can't teamfight, this is a penalty that gets higher as the game drags on  as one death in lategame can win or lose the game.\n\nThe reward? Damage control, you deny your enemies gold (and possibly exp) and you can rest easier knowing that one death you have wasn't feeding the enemies.\n\nIf you get executed on jungle camps/drag/baron you're just doing it wrong and deserve the punishment of dieing (while the reward isn't there).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-11-13T01:15:49.973+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the two items should be improved beyond the changes we have for patch 4.20, I would be hesitant to change them in this way.\n\nSword of the Occult and Mejai's are interesting from the standpoint of \"show off\"-ness and how it warps your own safety strategy.\nThe safety warping aspect of these items is key to them.

Execution is such a spineless maneuver, and it doesn't punish you for killing yourself, which is so backwards. If you resort to running into towers, you fucked up, you're on the run from the enemy or something, and they've chased you into their base. You got outplayed, and yet you can just erase it by running into towers and killing yourself. It's pretty stupid to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainbowgasm","date":"2014-11-12T22:08:45.610+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"the penalty is your respawn time. you are missing out of farm, and are now unavailable to your team until you respawn.\n\nit's not a reward, it's damage control.

If you can avoid getting hit for how ever long it takes while inside the enemies base, you still die, but they don't get gold.\n\nYou get to deny the enemy team the gold they earned by out playing you in such a way that you have to pray for the sweet mercy of their own turrets, the respawn time was going to happen either way, but you're able to take away the reward of dying by dying to the enemy team's tower.\n\n I bet someone will be like \"well if they outplayed me, how come they couldn't hit me?\", do you not see the glory in the fact that they were able to send you to your demise without even touching you? That takes some out playing that you would rather take a guaranteed death rather than try to find a way to outwit the opponent and slip by without dying. We shouldn't allow \"damage control\" to be taking the easy way out and kissing their turret. You want damage control? Get out of there, go into solid snake mode and sneak past your pursuers.\n\n Suiciding to the turret should not be damage control, it should be a disgrace, instead of going out in a blaze of glory you just take a suicide pill and call it quits, why should the enemy team get no gold for that? Why should you not lose stacks on the items where you lose stacks on death? You died, be it to the tower, dragon, or purple caster minion, you died, and that's all that counts.","replies":[{"poster":"Nico0404","date":"2015-11-04T04:04:00.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first off, im guessing you got outjuked/outplayed and someone you chased for a long time got executed, so this is why you posted this.\n\nsecond, if getting executed did what you said then nobody would ever execute, they'd just stay in place and b, causing the team chasing to commit MORE into killing the target. While the team KEEPS chasing{{champion:106}}  and trying to kill him{{champion:38}} , the rest of the team can just go and pressure the rest of the map, because they know a couple of people are chasing that one guy. If you know someones gonna go for the execute, you back off and pressure the map hard because they wont be up for a long time. The way it works is, you managed to juke your enemy from doing dmg for long enough that IF there were no towers{{summoner:17}} , you'd probably make it out alive. it's not a reward for the one getting executed, its a punishment for the team who failed to kill the enemy. \"If they out played me, how come they didn't hit me\" is an actual thing. they outplayed you, but then you outplay THEM, thats why the system works. Getting executed is already a \"disgrace\" if you want to call it that. Its also a thing you do for the lols, so if you wanna play for trolls with your friends or make a joke with them it means you give your opponent a lead? yeah no. \"going out in a blaze of glory\" as in getting deleted by the collapse{{champion:7}}  and not being able to do anything. yup, blaze of glory. losing stacks{{item:3041}} {{item:3141}}  is OK cause you died, theres no change there. if you get executed, its an outplay for both sides, but since one side has less team members alive they can push/force a fight as a 4v5. \nFinal point and the most important if you ask me: If you towerdive, chain cc'ing the target so they didn't harm you{{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} (and after the kill you die) or tanking turret while the team does work{{champion:223}} {{champion:201}}  shouldn't punish you. ESPECIALLY because the target didnt manage to hit you once, so why should they get gold? its a kill for a kill but you did the teamplay and the outplay.\n{{summoner:30}} \nPS: dont critizize grammar im too lazy to do capital letters and check it in general ;D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zyvux","date":"2015-11-04T04:06:58.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"##BringBackLeviathan#","replies":[]}]}
