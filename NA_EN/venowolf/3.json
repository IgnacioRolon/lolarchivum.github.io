They also apply Blighted Quiver Blight for 6 seconds, stacking up to 3 times.\n> \n> **ON-HIT MAGIC DAMAGE**: 8 + (Varus level )  + ( 25% AP)\n> \n> Varus&#039; other abilities detonate Blight and **adding effects**, dealing magic damage equal to a percentage of the target&#039;s maximum health per stack (capped at 360 against monsters).\n> \n> **MAGIC DAMAGE PER BLIGHT STACK**: 1.5 / 2 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of target&#039;s max health\n> **MAXIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE**: 4.5 / 6 / 7.5 / 9 / 10.5 / 12% (+ 6% per 100 AP) of target&#039;s max health\n> \n> **At leves**: 1 / 4 / 7 / 10 / 13 / 16\n\nLike I said berfore his W looks more a innate passive, so putting like his real passive can open a new slot on his W, without take off his identity at all. I reduce the damage because now every blight stack can add a effect when is detoning, this depends what skill Varus uses to detonate. \n\nQ - Piercing Arrow\n\n> **Added effect**: The Piercing Arrow now can \"shred armor\" when exploding blight stacks. \n\n> **ARMOR SHRED PER STACK**: 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 %  exploding BLIGHT stacks by the Q.\n> **MAX ARMOR SHRED**: 18 / 21 / 24 / 27 / 30 %  exploding BLIGHT stacks by the Q.\n\nSo its a Piercing arrow so have thematic sense that shred armor. This add some \"tank\" bust power too.\n\n\nW - Living Vengeance\n\n>**Passive** : On a minion or monster kill, Varus **refresh** attack speed  duration for 3 seconds. On a champion kill or assist, Varus refresh the attack speed duration to 6 seconds. These bonuses do not stack with themselves. Upon death, Varus instantly detonates every Blight stack in all units on a range of 1000 units (because VENGEANCE).\n\n>**Active** : Varus consumes every Blight stack to gain attack speed and extra magic damage on hit for every stack consumed up to 5 stacks for 6 seconds. \n> \n> **RANGE**: 1000 **COST**: 55 MANA **COOLDOWN**: 21 / 19 / 17 / 15 / 13 \n> \n> **ATTACK SPEED**: 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 %\n> \n> **MAX ATTCK SPEED**: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 %\n>\n> **MAGIC DAMAGE ON-HIT PER STACK**: 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 (+2%AP)\n>\n> **MAX MAGIC DAMAGE ON-HIT**: 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 (+10%AP)\n\nThe core idea is give him some real steroid \"boost\". Meanwhile the MS and mobility keept like his core weakness, He gain now a massive tools in the utility, if he build Runnan Hurricane he can put a lot of stacks at the same time and gain a massive amount of AS and proc all his utility, the AS has reduce because he need some stacks to make his AS effective.\n\nE - Hail of Arrows\n\n>** Added Effect**: Varus can stun a enemy if he explode blight's stacks on a enemy standing on his corrupted ground, the duration of the stun is affected by every blight stack.\n\n> **Stun Duration**: 0.5s by each blight stack.\n> **Max Stun Duration**: 1.5s\n\nThe E now can add a stun if you exploding blight when the enemy are standing on his corrupted ground, this only works if the enemy is standing on his corrupted ground, so Hail of Arrows can't be used to stun the enemy.\n \nR - Chain of Corruption\n\n> **ACTIVE**: Varus flings out a tendril of corruption that infects the first enemy champion hit, dealing magic damage and rooting them.  **The root can be more powerful if its used on a enemy with Blight stacks every stack increase the root duration by 0.5 second.**\n> \n> _The corruption then attempts to spread towards enemy champions within **600 range**, applying the same damage and root (if the new hostage of the spread have blight stacks, the root are increased) if they stay within 600 range of the infected champion. The corruption will continue to spread until there are no further targets in range, but each champion may only be infected once per cast._\n> \n>** ROOT DURATION**: 1.2 / 1.6 / 2 s\n\n> **MAX ROOT DURATION**: 2.7 / 3.1 / 3.5 s**\n\nWith the extra root he gain a slighty chance to spread more \"easily\" his chain, so this can have more reward if he hit his ult (To be honestly with Mikael its difficult to spread it but not impossible at all), Also a extra range can help too. (maybe a 1250 range?)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith these changes he can gain more utiliy (stun, shreed armor, a more powerful root) and a more interactive kit, with a passive more \"Notable\" (his actual W works like a passive to me). With these changes he have a more weaker early game but a more powerful late game. Have a good tools to cause cc, shreding tanks and poke, with the real weakness of the mobility.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-30T19:35:34.838+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sound a lot like an old Varus rework suggestion years back that I mentioned back in another Varus thread recently.\n\nIts an overall good suggestion that exchanges Passive and W in a kind of Ashe-rework way.\n\nBecause lets be honest, Varus's W sounds more like a passive and he needs some reliability on his steroid.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-30T19:38:15.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completly agree bro, Can you share your rework suggestion?

Any one of these options could be a great help.\n1) Increased aa range\n2) Increase in passive strength, atleast against champions. \n3) Reduce the pass through damage reduction on his Q, maybe 10% instead of 15%.\n4) (this is a borderline rework) Added effects on his abilities when full stacks of Blight are proced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-01T23:39:05.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He diatinguish with his poke, lack of mobility, beatiful Q, his passive is just meh.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-04-30T23:28:14.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks amazing. now if we can get Red Rito's attention.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-30T23:42:25.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How we get the \"Red Rito's attention\" ?","replies":[{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-05-01T00:30:19.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is very hard.

It still doesn't address the fact that his only steroid is incredibly weak and very situational. I would rather have the AS steroid be part of the active and forego the MS portion entirely. Varus is unique because he is immobile and self peeling. He doesn't want mobility in his kit since it would take away from his power budget in other unwanted ways.\n\nMaybe have the steroid work like this: Active: Varus gains 30/45/60/75/90% AS for 3 seconds.
