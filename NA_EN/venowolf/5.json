He can have 2 axes at one time, since he only has 2 hands ... It&#039;s pretty obvious.\n\nSome like this\n\nRecharge time:  16/15/14/13/12 s\n\nStatic CD: 1.5s\n\nThe damage can be reduced to 60/85/110/135/160 (+30% AD) physical damage because its more spammable if he have 2 charges and pick the axe&#039;s constanly.

He loses the flat amount of attack damage but gain a massives tools to engage on team fights rushing into key targets. Instanly start with a pumped Vicious Strikes effects to make him feel like a real Berseker for 6 seconds and a real nightmare when he is close to die. \n\nThis Olaf its by far more funny, spamming axes like a crazy, and engage in tf like a truck, split pushing more safe, and make his Berseker thematic much revelant.","replies":[]}]}
