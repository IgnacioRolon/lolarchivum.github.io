To encourages something to build late is better work with the &quot;on level&quot; part, so my idea is this:\n\n{{item:3800}} \n\n**Stats**\n\n> * +400 health (lower from 500)\n> * +200 mana (lower from 300)\n> * +100% base health regeneration\n> * Active\n> * UNIQUE: Grants +60% Movement Speed to you and nearby allies when moving towards enemies for 3 seconds. When this speed boost ends, it emits a shockwave, slowing nearby enemy champions by 80% for one second. 90 second cooldown.\n\n> * **UNIQUE &ndash; VALOR&#039;S REWARD: This item gains 12 health and mana based on champion level. **\n\nSo in level 18 this item gives:\n\n> * +400 health +(18*12 ) = 616\n> * +200 mana +(18*12 ) =  416\n\nThis mean that in level 9 give the same stats that bring right now, since level 9 this turns into a righteous &quot;win&quot; of stats, so at the end not encourage people to build at first item but at the same time gain relevance in the mid-late part of the game just as {{item:3027}} RoA does.\n\n\nSo is a glory and righteous buff IMO, and help to fix his awkard state (**unique item in the whole game that lost a passive after be full**)\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about these changes?","replies":[{"poster":"lxl RockBall lxl","date":"2016-04-07T20:23:29.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you need to chech this:\n\n**Catalyst the Protector of Aeons **\n* Valor's Reward passive removed\n* New Passive - Eternity: 15% of damage taken from champion is gained as Mana. 15% of Mana spent is gained as Health.\n* (Healing limited to 25 per spell cast or 25 per second for toggled spells.)* \n\nCatalyst loses quite a bit of free early lane pressure here - however, it enables a very powerful engine - turning mana to health and health to mana while brawling with other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2016-04-12T15:21:40.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well that sounds nice but maybe that % could be better in the final items","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2016-04-06T20:26:30.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3800}} is ok or need something more?","replies":[]}]}
