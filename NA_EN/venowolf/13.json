Also give a new build path for the Brutalizer and can turn Zeke Herald into a item with a better niche, I feel that Zeke need some love and a rework like this can push Zeke in the right way.\n\nSo the two items actually stay in a bad spot, Brutalizer need more build paths, so if a great chance to put in Zeke&#039;s or Reaver.","replies":[]}]}
