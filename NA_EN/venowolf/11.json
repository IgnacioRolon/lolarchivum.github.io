The weakest of the items you listed probably is the Seeker's Armguard, only because it's passive doesn't carry over, so that one might have a purpose (give mages a little help vs AD Assassins). As for the rest of them, their early passives are very strong. The cheap Magic Pen. on Haunting Guise is extremely vital to AP Assassins. The Hexdrinker's passive is ludicrously strong for AD Assassins or Bruisers that fall behind to an AP champion.

It used to build out of Chain Vest instead, which wasn't a very comfortable recipe. At that time it was used to tune down the reign of Talon over the mid lane (the first wave, Talon briefly came back years later before they removed his silence).\n\n> The cheap Magic Pen. on Haunting Guise is extremely vital to AP Assassins.\n\nActually it's even more so important for mage bruisers - champions who rely on their base damages rather than AP scalings.\n\nAnyway, Haunting Guise existed in season 1 as an item without any upgrades - as did Chalice of Harmony. People didn't realize the power of the magic peentration and felt \"trapped\" with the item. It was also a time of Metagolem (Warmog's Armor had stacking HP and regen back then) and Liandry's Torment was one of the two anti-health tools introduced, the other one being Blade of the Ruined King.\n\n> The Hexdrinker's passive is ludicrously strong for AD Assassins or Bruisers that fall behind to an AP champion.\n\nHexdrinker is a very similar case. It was a mid-tier standalone item without any upgrades.\n\nThey've actually tested an alternative upgrade to it, Spellbreaker (melee only, with Avarice Blade in recipe and Tenacity as its unique effect), but it didn't help melee carries and was abused by bruisers instead.\n\n> Phage is freaking Phage\n\nPhage is a bastard child of balancing Trinity Force. Any item with a slow strong enough to win you lane 1v1 is absurdly strong in teamifghts, since it's not just you catching up to the target, but everybody else.\n\nSo the RNG slow was removed and replaced with a speed boost, leaving Phage as a temporary solution that got left hanging for years because no better solution was found.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2015-01-30T01:37:26.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***We need more items.***","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-01-29T19:12:56.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should combine together into a hybrid dmg/hybrid def item.
