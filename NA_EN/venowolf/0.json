Back Face of the Mountain Active and Ruby Sightstone Passive","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That is exactly what I want: THE ACTIVE OF THE  FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN{{item:3309}}  ... I mean if Shurelyas and Twin Shadows {{item:3905}} are back in order to replace actives of {{item:3306}}  and {{item:3312}}   respectly. Why not create a new item with that same pasive of Face of the Mountain? Also the Supp Tanks needs a couple of items to have more optimization, I also really miss the passive of  Ruby Sightstone too...\r\n\r\nWith the new Active of Solari {{item:3190}}  there&#039;s no Shield Active Items... And that feels very weird to me. I mean the chance to be a hero with some champs dissapear...\r\n\r\nI want to save my adc of the mischeavous ignite with quick reflexes and be a hero! I really love that sensation! Please RITO put again\r\n\r\nI want Something Like this\r\n\r\n{{item:3309}} FOTM (Name and Icon could be a completely new one)\r\n\r\nRecipe: {{item:3105}}  + {{item:3067}}  + 400g  (Total Cost 2300g)\r\n\r\nStats: 35 Armor, 35 Magic Resist, 300 HP, 10 CDR\r\n\r\nPassive UNIQUE: Active ability items&#039; cooldowns are reduced by 20% each.\r\n\r\nActive UNIQUE: Grant a shield to yourself and an ally equal to 15% of your maximum health for 4 seconds. After 3 seconds, the shield explodes to Slow nearby enemies by 50% for 2.5 seconds (**90 second cooldown**).\r\n\r\nThe stats, recipe can be others but the essence of the active and passive is the thing that really matters here. . . If two items come back why not the last one?","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-03-09T17:17:16.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i coudlnt honestly care less about FOTM.. but... ruby.. needs to come back.\nonestly i would perfect if they just didn't fuck with any of these things in the first place.\nwhy the hell they go out of thier way to break something that is working fine idk","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2018-03-09T22:37:55.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah in some cases that new quest thing take too much time!
