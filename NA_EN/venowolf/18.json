It seems like the kind of thing I'd always want every single game I wanted to be tanky, no matter the circumstance. I mean, what's my argument for not building this item?\n\nThat may sound like a silly question, but I do think an important facet of defensive itemization is that every option has a situation when something else is superior, and I legitimately can't see any reason to not build this item every game on every tank. I'm trying to think of alot of different games, and I'm having a very hard time finding one where I wouldn't get this item. Major damage reduction, lots of flat health, a shield to help keep you from getting bursted, tenacity. What's not to love?\n\nI like the concept of having more tank items, but I think they should all still have situational purposes. This being a generic \"always buy this\" kind of item doesn't seem good for the game.

One of the big characteristics of defensive itemization is that it gets adapted to specific enemies. Having the strongest potential option be one that works against absolutely everyone and fits every situation completely screws that idea.\n\nEven for offensive items it's not a good thing, but there is at least the hint of giving up some kind of defense or utility when you get the highest AD or AP item (deathcap certainly isn't keeping you alive). There is nothing given up here. Get it as a second or third item once you've already secured CDR or a specific resistance, and you get absolutely everything you want by having this. It's a 1 stop perfect tank item. That's not good design.\n\n> tanks need better itemization.\n\nSure. I just don't think this is the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-09-08T21:31:17.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see too \"perfect\" like you say, also the tweak numbers can fix it...","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-09-08T22:35:42.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty perfect.

Defensive itemization is reliant on adaptability. Having a 1-stop answer for any defensive problem is not good design. Having it almost completely negate threats of burst with a combination of a shield and damage reduction is not great design either. It should not solve every problem at the moment you pick it up, and that's exactly what it does right now.\n\nIt isn't just tanks who love this item either. Any fighter could use this too. The bonus health scaling is the only thing that makes this a tank item, and that is the least important part of the item.
