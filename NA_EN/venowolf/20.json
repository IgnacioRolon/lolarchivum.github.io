I mean make that shield scale with \"total Hp\" like the Nautilus PBE shield:\n\n \n> Hey All, \n> I’m going to be doing some Skarner work and right here is one of the best places to start. \n> \n> So I’ve been doing some digging and unfortunately, poor Skarner is being picked 80% less this year than he was last year. Some of this might be from some nerfs he has received, but it may also be because newer champs are outclassing him in what he does best. Either way, I think we all agree that Skarner could benefit from a few improvements to make him more fun/viable for both Skarner players and their opponents. Keep in mind, the goal here is not \"make Skarner OP.\" There will always have to be strengths and weaknesses to all champions.\n> \n> Before we get to any of the potential changes, we need to figure out what Skarner’s strengths and weaknesses are right now. I have a few questions for you all, and you can answer these as a SKarner player or even as someone who only has experience playing against Skarner. \n> \n> • What are the most fun aspects of playing Skarner?\n> • What are the most frustrating/unfun aspects of playing Skarner?\n> • What are the most frustrating aspects of playing against Skarner?\n> • Are there champions that do Skarner’s job better than he does? Why?\n> \n> I have my own personal answers to these questions, but I may be only seeing one side of the coin. There are some Skarner players out there with wayyy more experience that I have, and I think there is a lot of valuable information that I may be missing. I have a feeling that once we get talking, we will come to some very useful conclusions. GOGOGO\n> \n> -Scruff\n\nNow my thougths:\n\nW:\n\nSHIELD: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 80% AP) to 60/70/80/90/100 (+ 8/9/10/11/12% of  Skarner's TOTAL Health)** and 15% of tenacity during the shield.**\n\nBase shield value lowered to 60/70/80/90/100 from 80/135/190/245/300\n\nShield now scales on 8/9/10/11/12% of Skarner's TOTAL Health from 80% of his AP.\n\nSkarner now is more oriented to the tank side (after the 2nd rework), and are a very few items that he builds with ap (ICB, Trinity and maybe Abyssal Scepter). So that 80% AP is very useless. I mean he need some reward to build tanky like Sejuani or Nautilus and that \"TOTAL Health\" is the thing that Skarner need in his kit. A huge shield that make him feel like a fast-truck. You are the responsable on the Skarner rework so please change his \"magic\" Shield into a very powerful \"solid\" shield. IMO has more sense the TOTAL Health scaling instead the AP...\n\n\nE. Bracken Crystal Wall \n\n\n>RANGE: 1100 COST: 70 MANA  COOLDOWN: 2 RECHARGE TIME: 39/ 35 / 31 / 27 /24\n> \n> PASSIVE: Skarner generates a new crystal wall periodically, and can only store up to 2 crystal wall at once.\n> \n> ACTIVE: Skarner creates an impassable wall of crystal at the targeted location for 4 seconds, perpendicular to which way he's facing. After the 4 seconds the wall explode causes magic damage and root all nearby enemies within 200-radius of the wall.\n> \n\nSkarner can use Impale on the crystal walls and drag the walls to an another direction Skarner can reactive his Impale to launch the wall to a target location. When it lands, it deals magic damage to all enemies in the area of impact and Stun them.  (Range 1100)\n\n\n> WALL LENGTH:  400 \n> ROOT DURATION: 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 \n> MAGIC DAMAGE: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 45% AP)\n\nCrystal Wall on Impale:\n\n> Stun DURATION: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 \n> MAGIC DAMAGE:  150 / 225 / 300 (+ 70% AP)\n\n\nApart of his Ult his kit it's very boring, specially his E, an linear skillshot with non damage is not the best example of \"fun\", he need more crytsal in his kit, also a better mechanics in his kit.  The damage of his E does not exist. I'll prefer  make a completly new E like the previously showed, It's very fustrating see that ridiculous damage, is like \"nothing\"..\n\n\n\n\n> • What are the most fun aspects of playing Skarner?\n\nI love Skarner Ult!! personally is the best part of his kit. The drag mechanic is an **unique** move and make you feel like a boss it's very funny ability, Alos the Crystal venom passive its funny tried to stack the crystal venom stack and stun the enemy it's like a mini game, but the actual reward it's not \"fair\" (the stun duration is too short IMO)\n\n\nNote: The first time that I see Skarner I think or have the impression that he can create \"crystal structures\" after use sadly this is not true, but please make it real, Put in his E a new \"crystal structure\" that block the pass of the enemies and also have another new interaction for example. drag with the ult and laaunch to the enmies to make a powerful AoE stun/slow/ root/ hard cc this have a lot of fun IMo\n\n > • What are the most frustrating/unfun aspects of playing Skarner?\n\n-I like his clear jungle time specially in early compared with others tank junglers But... the mana cost is very high maybe a reduce in all levels or an buff in his mana pool can solve this. \n\n-Apart of his Ult his kit it's very boring, specially his E, an linear skillshot with non damage is not the best example of \"fun\", he need more crytsal in his kit better mechanics in his kit.\n\n-The damage of His E does not exist. I'll prefer to change his damage to none and improve the utility of this skill or make a completly new E, It's very fustrating see that ridiculous damage is like \"nothing\"... I want some like this:\n\nACTIVE: Skarner slows all enemies in a line them for 2.5 seconds.\nMAGIC DAMAGE: lowered to 0 (YEP NOT DAMAGE) from 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 (+ 40% AP)\nSLOW:  increases to: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% from 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65%\nNEW: This ability build 2 stacks of  Crystal Venom on the targets enemies affected (up from 1 stack)\nReduce the cd by rank: 12/11.5/11/10.5/10 s from COOLDOWN: 12 s on all levels\n\nSo how his E now don't cause damage can put that \"damage\" in another ability, so buff the damage of his Q sligthy:\n\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE: increased to 38 / 48 / 58 / 68 / 78 (+ 40% bonus AD) from 18 / 28 / 38 / 48 / 58 (+ 40% bonus AD)\nBONUS MAGIC DAMAGE: increased to 38 / 48 / 58 / 68 / 78 (+ 20% AP) from 18 / 28 / 38 / 48 / 58 (+ 20% AP)\n\nNote: the numbers can be lesser but it's an example. I personally want a completly new E.\n\n-I really hate the AP Scaling on his Shield it's very uselees have a nice 80% of ratio in a champ that doest'n build huge amounts of AP.\nI really want to see this shield scaling with TOTAL BONUS HP to reward Skarner when he build's tanky\n\nSHIELD:   60/70/80/90/100 (+ 8/9/10/11/12% of  Skarner's TOTAL Health) from 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 80% AP)\n\n-His passive is nice but make an effective take time and the duration of the stun it's very short so feel like it's not a \"fair\" rewars, IMO a sligthy increase in thE duration can make this \"reward\" more satisfactory:\n\n  0.75 / 1 / 1.25 from 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 on levels 1 / 7 / 13\n\n\n > • What are the most frustrating aspects of playing against Skarner?\n\nActually playing against Skarner don't feel any frustating. I feel him underpowered to be honestly. He lost his sticky pattern and a lot of his dmg. Also his passive take time to be effective so it's not a toxic champ but completly a \"underpowerd\" one.\n\n>  • Are there champions that do Skarner’s job better than he does? Why?\n\nHe is a fast inamomible champ that have how principal role \"peeling\" and chase. His cc is \"meh\" another champs like Sejuani or Amummu have better weapons in this area (He need more duration in his passive stuns)... His tankinees is decent but other champs can fit the \"peeling\" role better like Volibear, Nautilus or Rammus (He needs a better shield scaling way), like a fast inamomible champ and chaser is decent and IMO his better role but Warwick, Rammus or Udyr take this role better because have more completly kit that provides the neccesary to make satisfactory (His E need more utility instead damage). Skarner need buffs to compete with the other jungles (specially in his Q dmg), So IMO he needs some love to make him more viable: A increase in the duration of his passive, More damage in his Q, A real shield, More utility in his E. All of this are some examples of how this Bracken can enter in the scene without make him OVERPOWERED.\n\nTL:DR What about Skarner state? I'l mean he is underpowered, he need some love:\n\nPassive: Increases the stun duration to 0.75 / 1 / 1.25\n\nQ: Increase the damage to: 38/ 48 / 58 / 68 / 78 (+ 40% bonus AD) and 38/ 48 / 58 / 68 / 78 (+ 20% AP)\n\nW: Shield now scales with total HP: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 /100 (+ 8/ 9/ 10/ 11 / 12 % of TOTAL Skarner Health) and 15% of tenacity\n\nE: Damage reduce to 0 (Don´t damage enemies) but now applies 2 stacks of Crystal Venom instead of only 1\n\nIncrease the slow to : 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 %\n\n\nWith these changes he can turn in a better spot with more utility, tankiness, cc and utility.\n\n\nEdit: New idea of Skarner E.\n\nI personally want a completly new E, some that make Skarner a more funny champ something like this:\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"OxBaker","date":"2015-01-26T16:46:05.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mained him last season and would love to go back to him but a combination of the nerfs they gave him and this seasons Jungle make him far too hit and miss to be enjoyable.

His damage is very low, actually the problem is that  he need more unique in his kit more \"output and input\" with the brand Skarner, his kit it's can be better, more funny and satisfyng.\nHis E actually need to be reworked in something more useful!","replies":[{"poster":"PoE00dpWDk","date":"2015-01-29T04:10:50.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when they were doing the rework I was hoping they would change his E into a burrow like ability allowing Skarner to dig under ground (untargetable) in a straight line and pop up again. This would allow Skarner to juke throw walls or bypass the front line to get to the back and ult the carry, though it seems that idea got put on Rek'Sai with tunnel. Other than that I did have this one crazy idea were Skarners ult would be moved to his E, It would change the suppression into a stun or maybe a movable root and lose all damage along with getting a lower cool down of around 20-30 seconds, I had no idea what to make his new ult though.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-29T14:10:00.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least put a little more damage in his E or may a new mechanic like put 2 stacks of crystal venom instead of 1 stack.

It sort of confused me when the did his buff in 5.1 by lowering the cooldown (IMO not much of a decrease) on it, since that was the one thing about the ability I never really though of as being an issue. This may be a little bit in the tinfoil hat area, but I think they just made this change so that they could say they are activity adjusting him without really doing anything impactful, though i did like the Q mana cost decrease.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Killstrado","date":"2015-02-03T22:57:48.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-02-05T21:58:03.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So give your thougths: why I'm a wrong?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-01-26T14:39:11.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of this together is too much. The Q changes just can't work. It's way too high of a damage increase, even if his E doesn't do damage. The shield working off of HP could work, but Skarner is actually tooled right now to not be a very HP reliant tank, and giving him tenacity is a huge benefit for a champion with high movement speed. E not doing damage is actually a good idea, and one I'd like to see them adopt, although the benefits he received in return couldn't be nearly as big as you want. As for the passive duration, my change would be to make it go from .75 -> 1 second at level 9, to help it out in the early game but not boost it later.\n\nThe problem Skarner has isn't really that he's underpowered. He actually does pretty well. The problem is he has nothing unique and he excels in no job or function, which is made worse by how easy he is to counter. He's a very unreliable initiator, his peel is delayed, he has decent sustained damage but unreliable sticking, and he's very reliant on a narrow slow that is very punishing to miss. He's just a bad mix of a tank and a bruiser without great traits from either class, which means that he has nothing unique that makes him fit any given situation. This is a huge design problem. Right now, I can always pick a champion that is better for any given job than Skarner, and that will remain true unless he's numerically the most overpowered thing in the game. It's a bad design. Ultimately, he needs another reworking, or he'll never be put into a really satisfying spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-26T15:36:58.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you think that Skarner need more \"unique\" abilities to make him more \"viable\", I really think that his E need more mechanics some uniques mechanics like a some kind of \"bounce beam\" so if his E make contact with a structure bounce in another direction and gain missile speed, damage, and more power in the slow depends on the numbers of bounce that his \"Fracture\" does, what do you think about an bounce beam? U can make a really cool plays with Anivia Wall for example.  You can use the Fracture like a ball in a \"pool table\" xD. Obviusly the range of the missile need to be more large something like Ezreal Q for example","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-01-26T16:55:41.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose it could be an interesting mechanic, although my primary question would be the effective range. Getting multiple bounces doesn't seem like something that would happen in anything but extremely rare scenarios because the range necessary to bounce multiple times would be a range much higher than would be allowed for more general usage. I think that's a mechanic that might fit better on a poking or damaging ability than a CC one.\n\nThat said, I don't really think that having his E be the defining unique mechanic of his kit will really be great for him. Giving the E too much power is kind of the problem his kit has right now. Numerically, it's a stupidly strong skill. It's just not very good at fulfilling his needs. I'd favor a rework focusing on the melee disruptive and damage parts of his kit and completely revamping the E. As far as I'm concerned, the entire linear skillshot mechanic is not interesting for his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-26T20:03:12.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think about my changes or new mechanics?\n\nE.
