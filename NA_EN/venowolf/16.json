{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-14T13:33:07.518+0000","title":"Soraka Passive need some more.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":43,"down_votes":8,"body":"Actually, building hp is already the WRONG way to go. Most of your health is lost as that 10% donation, and your healing skills/health regen are not %, so building health actually hurts you more than it helps you. Armor and mr are not just the best way to get tanky... it&#039;s the only effective way.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3jub5SN.jpg\n\nWell the actual passive its so weird and need some more to be efficent. Actually only works its someone \"weak\" its near to you, so much of the time you never uses it, I really love the idea of a \"health conversion engine passive\", when the Soraka rework comes out she have a secondary passive that turns every 20% of armor and 20% of mr into AP, so if you build a Zz&#039;Rot Portal you gain 48 of armor, 48 of mr and 24 of AP, instead of 60 fh armor and 60 mr. Here her [passive](http://i.imgur.com/illuCmp.png) \n\n>http://i.imgur.com/illuCmp.png\n\nWith more AP you have more damage and health amount, yeah sounds great \"on paper\" but at the cost of lose more defenses, and hp being a not \"useful\" stat on her, Soraka turn into a Mega Squishy champ, and obviously very easy target to get down. They notice that and remove the secondary passive but never give \"something new\" to the empty slot in her secondary passive. \n\nSo why not try some kind of the Vlad passive (not the same) but with the \"conversion\" effect and make a new secondary passive. Something like this:\n\nFirst we need to understand some \"vital\" aspects to the conversion.\n\n> Every 1 hit point is equivalent to 2.67 gold\n> \n> Every 1 ability point is equivalent to 21.36 gold\n\nThis mean that every 8 hit points equivalent to 1 ability point (2.67 * 8 = 21.36)\n\nThat is equivalent to a 12.5% = 21.36 * 0.125 = 2.67\n\nSo 12.5% is the key number.\n\nSo with this in mind the secondary passive of Soraka try about a coversion of health into AP:\n\n> _Secondary Passive_: 50% of Soraka bonus health is turning into AP.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/3zml7uR\n\nSo how work this?\n\nA example of this conversion: \n\n> Soraka builds a Sight Stone, (150hp) Spirit Visage(400hp), Warmog&#039;s (800hp).\n> Its a total of 1350 of bonus hp. \n\nThis means that the _secondary passive_  took the 50% of 1350hp and turn 12.5% into AP:\n\n> 1350 * 0.5 = 675 (this is the real value that Soraka gain in hp)\n> \n> 675 * 0.125 = 84.375 (this is the amount of AP that Soraka gain)\n\nThe final numbers of _secondary passive_ are:\n\n> Bonus Health: 1350\n> HP that Soraka gain = 675\n> AP that Soraka gain = 84.375.\n\nSo instead that Soraka gain 1350 of hp , she gain 675 hp and 84.375 AP.\n\nWith a Simple Warmogs this works like this:\n\n>800 Bonus Health\n>400 HP that Soraka gain\n>50 AP that Soraka gain\n\nSo instead that Soraka gain 800 of hp , she gain 400 hp and 40 AP.\n\n_PD: Maybe the 50% of Bonus Health can slighty benefit her but low the amount of bonus health can put her in more balance. Its only a number, all numbers can be tweaked._\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Is this equivalent in gold?**\n\nTurning back to the \"conversion aspects\" :\n\n> _ Every 8 hit points equivalent to 1 ability point (2.67 * 8 = 21.36)_ where: \n\n> 2.67 = price of hp per point\n> 8 = amounts of hp\n> 21.36 = price of Ap per point\n\nThis means:\n\n> 8hp = 1AP in price amount.\n\nThe \"gold amount\" conversion:\n\n> 84.375*21.36= 1802,25\n> \n> 675 * 2.67 = 1802,25\n\nAnothe equivalents:\n\n> 675 / 8 = 84.375\n> \n> or\n> \n>  84.375 * 8 = 675\n\nYep is the same amount of gold. _AWESOME!_\n\nSoraka don&#039;t lose any gold in the conversion, and now she gains AP when builds HP. This mean that if she builds a lot of HP, gains some of HP and her 10% max health ist not hurt her a lot.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore HP would mean Soraka would live longer before/between heals, but in the long run, her team would suffer if they need frequent heals. Warmog&#039;s Armor and Spirit Visage are HP items that are commonly built on Soraka, but the biggest reason is the regen. Soraka thrives on HP regen.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis mean that with this new secondary passive she can health better when build some HP.  Ideally, you&#039;d itemize for defense like most defensive builds. Resistances and HP, prioritizing resistances. You don&#039;t want to be completely HPless, but you don&#039;t want to take full damage from people, either. So the AP bonus that her secondary passive grants its not so high but its a considerable amount to help her. So this don&#039;t turn the HP stat in garbage in her kit like the actual. Build more HP hurt her more when health someone (if you have 2500 you lose 250 if you have 1900 you lose 190hp) but at the same time makes the health more powerful (THIS! this have a lot of sense) and lands your&#039;s Q and the very difficult to land Equinox a little bit more powerful too. Maybe Q and E need a AP ratios reduction to avoid make her very opressive.\n\n So its a risk with a reward, Soraka healths (her W) cost more, but health&#039;s more and cause more damage with her other spells (maybe not much if we reduce the AP ratios). This change can turn Soraka in a better spot an make her more funny.","replies":[{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2015-04-14T18:21:14.993+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"@OP, while I agree with your idea, I would recommend trying to use fewer words to describe your idea.

I'd rather see her W just not include bonus health in its calculation (only include 10% of her natural maximum health for her level), so she doesn't outright *benefit* from bonus health like {{champion:44}}  does but isn't punished for it either, but then that might lead to more {{item:3083}} /{{item:3065}}  \"sustain yourself in order to sustain your team\" builds rather than improving the health-efficiency of W through AP (or CDR to land more Qs).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-04-14T16:17:00.929+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"So warmogs would give 100 ap and 400 hp, for about 400 gold less you can get NLR and AMP tome giving 100 ap.\n\nI like the idea but to give a support that much ap for not having to build any of the major ap items seems wrong.\nBecause it's not only giving her more health, its also making her abilities do more damage simply from building health.\n\nI think it would be better to add say:\n1% effectiveness to heals(self and target) per 100 health\n\nat 3000 max hp, 1500 current hp 0 ap\nq would heal for 96.5 *1.3 = 123.45 compared to the 139.45 that your idea would give and the 96.5 that normal gives\nbut it also would not effect her damage output.\nthis would also translate to increasing her w and r effectiveness.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-04-14T19:40:04.130+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Because it's not only giving her more health, its also making her abilities do more damage simply from building health.\n\nA) The proposal would reduce the amount of health she gets from these items.\nB) Her W costs 10% max health, while her Q heals a base amount with low scaling.\n\nWarmogs would be a good buy *only* because of it's passive.
