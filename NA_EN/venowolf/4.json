And the fantaastic oprtunuty to make \"cool\" plays with the boomerang move (His new tenative active E). \n\nAll this time I wait for news about this rewok, specially when WW received the quadra nerf on the 4.21 \"Destroy the Wolf\" patch, probably one of the most recently **HARD OVERNERF** champs, I mean:\n\n\n1\n>W - Hunter&#039;s Call\nDURATION 10 seconds &rArr; 6 seconds\n\n2\n>R - Infinite Duress\nTOTAL BASE DAMAGE 250/335/420 magic damage &rArr; 150/250/350 magic damage \nCooldown increased to 110 / 90 / 70 seconds from 90 / 80 / 70.\n\n3\n>Skirmisher&#039;s Sabre\nSTOP IT WARWICK : Basic attacks against a Challenged target deal 17-51 (based on level) true damage on hit &rArr; 60-162 (based on level) true damage over 3 seconds\n\n4\n>Enchantment - Devourer\nMAGIC DAMAGE ON HIT 40 &rArr; 25\n\nAll this in the same patch, why so much hate for only one champ, I know he deserve some nerf but not all these at the same time...\n\nSo after that HUUUUGEE OVERNERF, I really think that the Warwick rework is ready to show up, I mean after that why I want to use a practically useless champ but has been past 4 months and we don&#039;t have news about Warwick rework because the actual state its very poorly.\n\nAnd yes its \"practically useless\"  a completly overnerf champ that have a main role in the jungle but sadly he can&#039;t gank before he reach the lvl 6, I know sounds ironic but its true, but thats its not enough the list its more large: \n\n* don&#039;t have any AoE damage in his kit \n\n* his W AoE buff have lot of hidden power that its completly nocive for the game (40% of the time nerfed in the 4.21 destroy the wolf patch)\n\n* his mana values are too high in comparision with his poorly mana pool (750 of max mana and 110 mana cost by one simple Q holyyy sh.... saadly its true)\n\n* his ult don&#039;t have any counter-play if he see you and you are in his range, he \"magycally\" appear on you and destroy you without any chance of respond if you are alone, the problem its not being destroying by him, the problem its how the hell I can avoid him?\n\n* his ult its a double-edge sword bad design move, if you catch someone else alone: worth, if he its with any other and have a hard cc: bye ww.\n\n* his E its a very situational ability that only active its someone near are weak, so yep sometimes can stay \"off\" by a loooong time.\n\n* he can&#039;t gank before he reach the lvl 6 (that its so ironic... yeah I know that I say this before but pls he is THE jungler)\n\n* Its a Hunter but most of the times he run away cowardly, I really hate that WW uses his massive movement speed to run away, He is suppposed to be the hunter not the prey\n\nAnd the best that he can do (duel and shreding tanks) received a very massive nerf on the 4.21 \"Destroy the Wolf patch\" and sadly another items affected by this... Poorly Devourer enhanced :(\n\nActually he really need to past a huge amount of time stacking devourer to stay revelant in the game, his actual kit have numerous problems and put Warwick on that \"bad spot\" champs. So now its a very good chance to put the Warwick rework on, he really need to stay in a healthy side, and the ZenonTheStoic rework kit its a good solution for this because much of the core problems have been solved and more important received a very good \"playmaking\" move like the \"Boomerang Wolf\". so please ZenonTheStoic put this rework alive again and give us the new Warwick because the actual is a joke, a vagabound wolf dyng slowy in the misery...\n\nPD: The link of the ZenonTheStoic rework kit (IMO a great work for Daniel kLein): http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/232dan/warwick_rework_teaser_e_boomerang_move_block_from/cgsv64r","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-04-09T10:43:32.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was badly designed, made him a mage instead of what he is supposed to be and buffed literally everything about him.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-09T22:03:23.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs it though, he's not in a good position kit wise.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-10T02:03:52.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually Warwick have a more kind toxic state and after 4.21 patch he its really overnerf, so yes, he really need a more positive kit","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-10T13:58:31.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that's what I was getting at, while he's not powerful his kit is toxic and needs reworking to bring him in both a healthy and viable state.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-10T23:59:29.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zenon its working on a new champ so we need to wait for the WW rework!","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-11T00:02:15.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who?

I guess i'm confused.. Warwick isn't meant to be an overly complex character. His \"Skill\" comes from knowing when to take objectives, when to engage, and when to gank. There's nothing wrong with him competitively, you just feel like his playstyle is a bit \"boring\" or so I gather?\n\nTo that point, I agree. He is a bit boring. But not every champion in league needs to be a skillshot champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-05T23:50:14.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick don't need much skill, he only need a good \"decision-taken\" like you said when to take objectives, when to engage, and when to gank.\n\nMy point is not this, is about the ww kit. \n\nI gonna try to make a more deeper opinion in my previous suggested \"fix\".\n\n> -Remove W on his kit, replace with a skill that allow him gank pre 6. \n\nWarwick is not a jungle champ is \"the jungler\". But ironic he don't have any tool to gank in previous level 6, in competitive gameplay the early ganks allow the snowball effect on your lane teammates and ww don't have this, I know he have another strenght but IMO all the junglers need a tool to gank pre 6.\n\nNow why I want to remove his W, because his W is a skill with a huge \"hidden power\" when is used to push, they recently nerf the duration so now the skill is nearly usseles if you use to \"clear\" camps, I think that thematically don't fit with \"Blood Hunter\" theme. So is a skill that can be take off of the kit and replaces with a new skill that fit thematically and allow him to gank pre-6.\n \n> -Make his E works only towards enemies (like Vayne passive, Soraka Janna)\n\nHe is a Hunter, so wtf... he can run away with MS boost when he is escaping, this don't have any sense, I personally abuse this a lot to run away, trade some hit's and when they come in group, put the hp on someone in >50% and run away... please,this not the things that the hunters do... The MS boost only needs to be avaible to chase enemies and not allow ww to run away. So this need a fix\n \n> -Add more interactive gameplay on his E (passive and active part instead a toogle)\n\nAnd YEEES! His kit is sooooo boring, Is my fav champ but We all want more interactive gameplay on him. so take off the toogle I put the actual Blood Scent in the passive, and add a new active component to make WW a more fun champ, something that have more sinergy with his Blood Scent.\n \n> -Turn him R into a skillshot like Sejuanis Q, Gragas E or Malphite R to add counterplay, and add A CD penalty if he uses his R to escape to minimizes his escapes chances.\n\nHis main problem and the one that need a real fix, his ult. DON'T HAVE ANY COUNTERPLAY, if a huge tool to kill if you cast on a isolate target, because you only press R and catch him. When I use ww I feel powerful, but when ww makes to me is a veeeeryy fustrating because we don't have any chance to evade this, So making this skill a skill shot allow the enemy some of coounterplay because they can dodge or ww can miss, obviusly this add a huge missile speed and a very good width to allow ww \"fail\" to the minumun, also add a high cd but reduce to the half if hit someone, this to create some kind of penalty if ww use to run away. Increase the damage and stun duration to balance the \"skill-shot\" part so if you hit your ult you hit very hard but if you miss you are a very vulberable for a long time\n \n> -Give him a damage reduction when he supress an enemy to reduce the vulnerability.\n\nWhen ww ult someone he also supress him, and make very vulnerable, so adding a damage reduction component during his ult can help him to reduce the vulnerability.\n \n> -Fix his mana cost and mana pool.\n\nWW and Poppy are the champs with less base mana and less mana gain per level, also WW Q cost 120 and he only keepts 720mana, that is my main reason to build FH on him every game.\n\nTL-DR: He is a jungler but ironic don't have any tool to gank in pre-6 state, his ult don't bring counterplay and locks him too, w has a much hidden pwr, mana pool exccesive, kit boring, HUNTERS DON'T RUN AWAY, .","replies":[{"poster":"BringYourOwnPuma","date":"2015-05-06T02:31:12.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to address your points as I don't want to seem as though I'm completely ignoring your suggestion\n\n1. Not every character or team composition needs to play out exactly the same. Warwick is really unable to gank at 6, but this comes with the benefit of being one of very few champs that can solo a dragon at 3 minutes. And despite what most people may believe this is a huge advantage late game (when you can have 5 stacks at 28 minutes and baron.) If you are playing Warwick at high plat (as you say you do) your team should be well aware of warwicks limitations and realize they need to be extra careful while you get 6. And if in fact they are able to do this your team will end up far ahead of the \"early jungle ganker\" team because he spent time sitting in brush and attempting to get a gank in.\n\n\n2. Warwicks \"W\", his Howl - This lasts just long enough to assist in clearing the large monster in most camps, and late game a Warwick doesn't need to rely on this as much since most WW build Tanky/Aspd/OnHit. For instance, my build at level 36 minutes has 2.3 attack speed -BASE-. W will easily cap it out at 2.5 - Where does it come into use? Team fighting! It gives your team an attack speed boost and will enable you to gobble up assists. Warwick is an auto-attack Sustain/tank champion. This ability fits in his kit. \n\n3. Warwicks E - Blood scent is fine the way it is. Vayne has to move towards champions because vayne is ranged. Warwick is not. Same logic for the other champions that have that \"Move toward opponent only\" effect. Blood scent is intended to be used as both an engage and an escape because frankly thats all warwick has. Warwick cant tumble. Warwick cant fire from ranged - and it too fits with his kit. Also, toggling blood scent and timing for ganks is a skill that sadly most warwicks dont have (I facepalm every time i see a warwick that LEAVES THIS ON!).\n\n4. Warwicks R - Infinite duress has two hard counters. First: any kind of stun or knockup will free an opponent of infinite duress. Second: QSS or Zhonya's will practically invalidate warwick's ultimate. Turning it into a skillshot would be nothing more than a nerf to an already underwhelming ultimate that has seen nerfs recently. Right now its useful, not overpowered but certainly not garbage (as turning it into a skillshot would do). Secondly your change would literally turn Warwick into Sion. We don't need another Sion.\n\n5. Warwicks mana/mana pool - I'm not sure why you have issues with mana on warwick. I honestly rarely ever have this problem, and it's certainly never precluded me from being able to do what i need to do in a teamfight. If you're able to expend all of your mana in a fight as warwick there's a good chance you've probably won that fight.\n\n\nLastly - The reasoning for you wanting this rework as stated in your OP is that he was nerfed severely, yet most of your suggestions are in fact nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-06T04:11:09.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot the new W anxd E active part...
