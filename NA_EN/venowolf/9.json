After 4 seconds, Stretching Strike is automatically cancelled, going on full cooldown and refunding half of its health cost.\r\n\r\nSECOND CAST: Zac lashes out with an elastic punch, dealing magic damage to all enemies hit and pushing them back slightly, and slowing them for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nRANGE: 375 ~ 825\r\n\r\nMINIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE:  50 / 83 / 117 / 150 / 183 (+ 50% AP)\r\nMAXIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE: 90 / 150 / 210 / 270 / 330 (+ 100% AP)\r\n\r\nSLOW: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHe also need this:\r\n\r\nR - Letâ€™s Bounce!\t\r\n\r\nPassive: Zac gants tenacity bonus\r\n\r\nTenacity: 15 / 25 / 35%\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n So with these changes he now feel more elastic and have more cool  plays in his limited repertory.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-04T23:04:37.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stick like Nautilus Q","replies":[]},{"poster":"X8ViEhkPS0","date":"2015-03-09T19:09:56.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I commented on a Zac post a long time ago.

It's immersion breaking and dumb, and completely screws him out of any ability to lane against ranged or high dps opponents. They need to rework his passive completely or revert and rebalance it so blobs will actually fall randomly again but he's punished more for losing one or rewarded less for picking them up.","replies":[]}]}
