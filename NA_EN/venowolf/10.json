He&#039;s a scout.\n\nHe should be in the jungle scouting the enemy jungle. Giving his allies vision, setting up traps to protect lanes, and counter ganking with his invisibility.\n\nWhy is he not centered around this? Rito please. This is the perfect time to throw the guy a couple things to allow him to jungle. He doesn&#039;t really fit in the lanes. We love diversity in the jungle. Would be awesome as hell to see Teemo jungle in LCS too.\n\n_\"POPTART DELIVERY\"_\n\nSo I make a Teemo jungle kit without change his core kit, so this is my kit. \n\nMy Teemo kit (very useful on jungle)\n> Passive - Camouflage\t\n> \n> If Teemo stands still and takes no action for 2 seconds, he becomes stealthed. Teemo can move without break his camouflage during the \"move quick\" active duration otherwise when \"move quick\" duration ends or taking any action or being moved without \"move quick\" activated will break his camouflage, giving Teemo the Element of Surprise, 20% bonus movement speed for 3 seconds.\n\nYeah its happenig, Teemo can move stealthed by 3 beatiful seconds, this allow him to make some nice ganks (Wukong,  Eve or Shaco style gank) and create \"uncertainty\" on the enemies. Changing the \"Element  of Surprise\" into a movement speed buff instead a raw attack speed buff allow him to keep a constanly speed to \"outspeed\" his targets, and put some \"well placed\" shrooms, remember he is the \"Swift Scout\" so he need to be swift.\n\n> Q - Blinding Dart\n> \n> ACTIVE: Teemo&#039;s next attack within the next 5 seconds deals bonus magic damage and  blinding them for a few seconds.\n> \n> RANGE: 500\n> COST: 60 MANA COOLDOWN:  8 / 7.5 / 7 / 6,5 / 6\n> BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE: 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 / 160 (+ 50% AP)\n> BLIND DURATION:   1.75 at All levels \n\nWell say \"bye\" to his burst damage, but say \"Hi\" to the \"Blind Spam\", with the 80 range nerf, his enemies have more \"chance\" to evade and stay more \"safe\" to his new opressive and spammable Blind. Also cost less mana, having less CD, and now have the \"on-hit\" effect, so this can open new build paths and put more \"Teemo diversity\". The Blind duration nerf into the final ranks its a must because now its more spammable and the physical dps enemies need some chance to \"wrack the devil\". So be careful because Teemo can let you like a {{champion:64}}  --> literally Blind.\n\n> W - Move Quick\n> \n>PASSIVE: Teemo gains increased attack speed.\n>\n> ACTIVE: For 3 seconds, Teemo gaining increased movement. The movement speed bonus decays over the duration. \n>\n> _During the active duration Teemo can move during the camouflage effects_\n> \n> PASSIVE ATTACK SPEED: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26%\n> ACTIVE MOVEMENT SPEED: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80%\n> COST: 50 MANA COOLDOWN: 17\n\nWith these change and his \"new\" passive he can advance some considerable distance stealthed to make ganks, the decoy effects its a must because his passive now give a standard 20% when he break the stealth so the speed change need to be more stable. The cost mana up its to compesate his \"new tool\" to gank. And the previous attack spped attachted in his passive its now a permanent little buff to help him to clear a little faster.\n\n> E - Toxic Shot\n> \n> PASSIVE: Teemo&#039;s auto-attacks deal bonus magic damage and Poison icon poison his target, causing them to take additional magic damage over 4 seconds. Subsequent attacks only refresh the duration.\n> \n>  MAGIC DAMAGE PER SECOND: 6 / 12 / 18 / 24 / 30 (+ 10% AP) \n>  MAGIC DAMAGE ON-HIT: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+ 30% AP) \n\nIts the same Toxic Shot, the main idea its turn Teemo in a jungler without change much his kit and this skill its by far the most stable and balanced in his kit, so I don&#039;t change anything.\n\n> R - Noxious Trap\n> \n> PASSIVE: Teemo generates a new trap periodically, and can only store up to 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 traps at once.\n> \n> ACTIVE: Teemo places a mushroom trap on the ground for 10 minutes, which stealths and arms after 1 second. While armed, the traps grant vision in a 212.5-radius.\n> If an enemy comes within 60-range of the trap, it will detonate, Poison icon poisoning, Slow icon slowing and dealing magic damage over 4 seconds to nearby enemies within 200-radius. **Also Neutral monsters are also stuneed for 1.5 seconds.**\n>\n>**_Teemo start with 1 rank point on Noxius Trap_**\n> \n> RANGE: 230\n> COST: 50 /  75 / 100 / 125 MANA \n> COOLDOWN: 1 \n> RECHARGE TIME: 39 / 35 / 31 / 27\n> \n> MAGIC DAMAGE PER SECOND: 18.75 / 50 / 81.25 / 112.5 (+ 12.5% AP) \n> SLOW: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50%\n\nAnd finally his more iconic skill and more beloved \"Noxius Trap\", and here the main change is amazing,** Teemo now start the game with 1 rank on Noxius Trap**, awesome no? This turn Noxius trap in a 4 rank skill, but don&#039;t be afraid the first rank shroom its basically to help him to clear the jungle, the slow and damage its very awful, another important change in Noxius Trap its that now his \"store amount\" its change based on his Noxius trap rank, this its to avoid that Teemo can put a lor of shrooms repeatly in the pre 6 state,** the stun on neutral monster its to help him to clear the first camps**, like I said before the rank 1 Noxius Trap its to help him to clear and gank in pre 6 state, scouting the enemy jungle, giving his allies vision, setting up traps to protect lanes, and counter ganking with his invisibility... Also in the late game Teemo can have more store chance to make more funny his late-game.\n\nAnd its this my Teemo Jungler kit, without change his core \"gameplay\" amazing no? Oh wow I was just throwing out how I feel about it and this got a lot of approval. I don&#039;t really want a rework. Just something to make him work as a jungler. He can very well do it atm just not as efficient as other junglers without some sort of kick in it. \n\nSo what are yor thoughts on this Teemo Jungler, its too OP or can be a viable jungler?","replies":[{"poster":"RouterSmiter","date":"2015-04-12T04:36:46.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jungle camps have 5 soft leashes before they reset, teemo has no stun or self heal, clearing that first red makes him really weak...","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-12T04:43:21.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By that same reason I put a 1.5 seconds stun on neutral monster on his R.","replies":[{"poster":"RouterSmiter","date":"2015-04-12T04:55:52.708+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol. this would turn him into the new shaco he could clear a buff without taking anything then just walk to the enemy jungle and go ham on there second buff.

Now you have another decision go to gank or go to shop, this depends  that how the game has turned, but you are now very near to the mid lane, and have the crab mov speed shrine (depends of your side blue or red), so bot and top are another  \"gankeables\" lanes, with the red buff near to the ends you can try a gank in some lane and after that \"gank event\" make your first shopping, boots and the 2nd tier jg item, (Stalker's Blade the prefered option) and afther al this, the game turn a into a constanly \"take decision\" mini game because now the shrooms can be used to clear the junglefast ot use your shrooms to counter jg, gank or utility, the \"take decisions\" on Teemo jungle its vital to his future play style, very different to Shaco that have Jack in the box every 15s, and only last 1min... This don't mean that  Teemo don't have some similar kit to the Shaco style (Shaco stealth and Jack in the Box, with the blind) but with a \"take decision\" factor more decisive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-04-13T00:34:01.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this sounds way more fun then current teemo","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-13T00:37:51.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep you are rigth and the kit its the same, more shrooms more fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"notawinner","date":"2015-04-12T13:05:23.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea, but the stun would have to have a timer (i.e cant be stunned for x amount of time after they've been stunned by 1 shroom) to prevent too fast clears.\n\nAlso, that cd is very low for blind late, and combined with the passive atk speed might make him too good of a split-pusher.

SPAM TARGET blind? Yeah. Fuck that noise. 2 seconds of helplessness you can't even prevent because Teemo can close a gap, or run away so fast isn't cool already.  Remove the blind entirely, ranged heroes should NEVER have point and click blind. And most definitely not like Heimers old grenade or Corki's Phosphorus Bomb. At the very least if they want to keep it, make it a skill shot like Quinns so theres some counterplay to it. \n\n I'm still freaking shocked Teemo remains to have a point and click blind nuke.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-18T05:54:22.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what u propose?","replies":[{"poster":"Chibi Templar","date":"2015-04-18T06:16:44.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Venowolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RVEBxBzj,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2015-04-18T05:54:22.638+0000)\n>\n> So what u propose?\n\nSkillshot.
