Because are stats that work's well in lane phase, specially in the early game, also are most \"general\" stats, and everybody build the sighstone like first or second item when play as support. \n\n_Soraka for example have a negative impact when she builds the actual Sightstone because her W cost 15 hp more and don't grant anything in exchange._\n\nOthers like Braum or Taric benefits a lot when builds the sighstone.\n\n_Braum gains extra 4 of damage by evey Q._\n\n_Taric gains extra health on his Q: 8 hp in his allies and 11 hp himself._\n\nSo we need a sighstone more cheaper and with more \"useful\" stats.\n\nThe Standard Sighstone http://i.imgur.com/9AIFmsY.png can build into 3 differents \"Sightstone\":\n\n* Ruby Sightstone {{item:2045}} \n\n*  Sapphire Sightstone {{item:2049}} \n\n* Citrine Sightstone http://i.imgur.com/wVPEE8K.png .\n\n\n\nRuby Sightstone {{item:2045}}\n\n> Standard Sighstone http://i.imgur.com/9AIFmsY.png + {{item:1028}} + 500g\n\n> Stats:\n>\t+75% Health Regeneration.\n>                 +75% Mana Regeneration.\n>             +350 HP.\n\nSapphire Sightstone {{item:2049}} \n\n> Standard Sighstone http://i.imgur.com/9AIFmsY.png + {{item:1027}} + 500g\n\n> Stats:\n>\t+100% Health Regeneration.\n>                 +100% Mana Regeneration.\n>             +350 Mana.\n\n\nCitrine Sightstone http://i.imgur.com/wVPEE8K.png .\n\n> Standard Sighstone http://i.imgur.com/9AIFmsY.png + {{item:1052}}  + 500g\n\n> Stats:\n>\t+50% Health Regeneration.\n>                 +50% Mana Regeneration.\n>             +50 AP .\n\nObviusly all the 3 have the same passive and active.\n\n> Passive\tUnique: Ward Refresh - Holds 5 charges and refills upon visiting the shop.\n> \n> Active\tUnique: Ghost Ward - Consumes a charge to place a Stealth Ward that reveals the surrounding area for 3 minutes. A player may only have 3 Stealth Wards on the map at one time.\n\nI know that items like {{item:3801}} {{item:1026}}  or {{item:3114}} can fit better, but the idea is the each gem, crystal or book give the new color and stats to the Standard Sighstone http://i.imgur.com/9AIFmsY.png .\n\nSo what are your thoughts? Can this create more diversity on the Sightstone?","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-05-05T01:46:01.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Props for your effort.

So you could have frost queen and what ever. I just think the percents are off. But Riot would balance that themselves. Probably need one with magic resist and armor more than 50 ap. Or something that did additional magic damage on hit.

It would be nice to have a extra ward that generated after placing your first ones and move up the ward line. Another cool one that probably isnt very practical since they put kalista in the game is a ward that scouts, but is not very practical because it would devalue kalistas traveling spook things alot. I like the idea of different sightstones alot but giving them benifits like 40 ap is too good  imo because some junglers already pick up sightstone but sacrifice more tanky stats I think giving that option would just increase the amount of sightstones we see outside of supports making junglers like nidalee not have to sacrifice much as far as damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-05-06T23:39:36.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why some people are hesitant to buy sight stone in the new order of having trinkets.

My concern is that adding sightstone upgrades that are clearly worth buying will cause almost every support build to necessarily include an upgraded sightstone, aggravating the already semi-present problem of supports having largely pre-determined build paths (such as {{item:3069}} {{item:2049}} {{item:1001}} {{item:3222}}). I enjoy the thought process involved in selecting mid-game items based on how the game is going, but adding a semi-mandatory sightstone upgrade would delay the interesting part of my build and generally make the game just a little less interesting. It is basically the reasoning that Riot representatives have used when explaining why {{item:2045}} has been kept so weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-05T03:20:42.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the decision depend one each user, Example: \n\nI personally using Soraka try some like this: Start with {{item:3301}} and in my first  two backs get http://i.imgur.com/9AIFmsY.png , {{item:3096}} and {{item:1001}}. in my next back then complete {{item:3069}} and {{item:3117}}. Next I build a {{item:1027}} and try to rush{{item:3105}} to eventually build into {{item:3060}}.\n\nMy build in taht moment is like: {{item:3117}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3060}}  http://i.imgur.com/9AIFmsY.png and {{item:1027}} (Maybe a{{item:2043}} {{item:3341}} too)\n\nSo in that point I can decide to build my {{item:1027}} into {{item:3024}} or {{item:2049}} (the mana enhanced) That depends of the \"events\" of the game, but this is the point, with more variety we hace more acces to different build paths. a simple {{item:1027}} can turn in more armor or in a more utility. If they have a HARD AD team comp I rush the {{item:3110}}. if not can go {{item:2049}} . At this point I maybe win or lose the game, but I have a chance I end with {{item:3285}} on My Soraka to the extra spd and push more fast ({{item:3023}}  can be other option). but I don't see any problem with the Sighstone diversity.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2015-05-04T22:04:22.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the mega-thread suggestions.\n\nLet Riot know!\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/MwbdZBtw-the-live-gameplay-team-presents-the-live-gameplay-qa-feat-you","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-04T22:14:45.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2015-05-04T22:17:26.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Venowolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5zqqGQx3,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-05-04T22:14:45.307+0000)\n>\n> ok.\n\nJust put in the phrase of, \"When are we going to see this Rito?\" and I'm sure they'll get the gist of what you're saying.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-04T22:18:53.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I made this and another cool ask in the ask.fm/asklivegameplay.
