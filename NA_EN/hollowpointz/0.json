I have issues with the ranked system and its concept of being balanced or fair. It is anything but that, your giving a personal ranking in game which is based on win/loss ratios. How can one being given a personal ranking in a team scenario? The logic of Riot is like taking a test on a school exam getting an A personally but since the rest of the class failed you get an F too? They either need to remove personal rankings or make a way where other players have no effect on your personal ranking. Reward people who play well and not those who don&#039;t. there has to be some kind of analysis based on your play not a one shoe fits all win/loss mentality. Essentially in the current system bad players can be carried and good ones can lose because of others. Generally people have control of their own destiny but in League your destiny is decided by how other people play and that isn&#039;t fair if your being given a personal rating.","replies":[]}
