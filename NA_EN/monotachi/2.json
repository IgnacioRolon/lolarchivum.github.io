Just this one simple aspect needs to be brought back in for Akali.\n\nJayce Patch: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V1.0.0.142 \nRelease Date (US) July 7, 2012 \n{{champion:84}} Akali\nCrescent Slash\n•\tEnergy cost reduced to 60/55/50/45/40 from 60 at all ranks.\n•\tNow activates Mark of the Assassin.png Mark of the Assassin's secondary damage. \n\nI swear, alot of Akali's can apply damage way too easily because of Crescent Slash detonating Mark of the Assassin? Why? \n\n•\tBecause it is way more easier to press a spell button to proc MoTA, than it is to autoattack in melee range as a squishy champion. \n\n•\tAutoattacks can be cancelled, therefore adding counterplay, via CC or simply moving out of melee autoattack range (125).\n\n•\tCrescent Slash allows Akali's to have much more room for error, it has 325 range, that's more than the standard 125 autoattack range, therefore Akali is not fully in melee range to proc Mark of the Assassin.\n\n•\tIt makes double-proccing very, very easy. Something alot of players overlooked. Making it AA-only would improve Akali's counterplay against several champions (especially melees), where MoTA's debuff lasts longer than the cooldown. Therefore simply having the MoTA debuff on you doesn't mean you are infinitely zoned from minions. You simply have to run backwards to avoid getting popped so easily.\n\n•\tAkali can Shadow Dance from max range, and quickly Q -> E for harass, something that cannot be easily done if it was AA-only. With AA only, in order to harass at max Shadow Dance range, you would have to R to get into range, then Q to apply the debuff. At this point, the opponent would of moved out of melee AA range, so you would have to R again to proc the first Q. Therefore you had to commit 2 dashes instead of 1. The amount of dashes required to commit to a kill is much more higher **therefore allowing Akali to make mistakes. **\n\n**This is essentially adding a skillshot-like feature/requirement into Akali's kit without having to actually change any of her skills into a skillshot. The outcome of R -> Q is not always guaranteed with MoTA AA only.**\n\n**Currently R -> Q is guaranteed because of Crescent Slash proccing MoTA. R -> Q -> E is almost always guaranteed.**\n\nIt dumbs down her play pattern tremendously. Alot of Akali's use Crescent Slash as a clutch to proc MoTA when they failed an AA. Alot of Akali's would fall flat on their faces without Crescent Slash proccing MoTA.\n\nBack in Season 1 and half of Season 2, Akali only was able to proc MoTA via autoattacking only. I believe this to be a core aspect of adding counterplay and mechnical intensity on a kit that is all point-and-click, and **allowed Akali's frustration levels to be maintained to a minimum**. There's a reason why Coronach only allowed AA's to proc MoTA, and not via other spells, i.e. Crescent Slash, heck not even allowing Shadow Dance to proc MoTA.\n\nTry for yourself. Go and play Akali and try not to proc MoTA with Crescent Slash at all, like if it was Season 1 and half Season 2. I assure you, Akali would be much harder to play. \n\n**Compensation**\nSeveral low-scope buffs/tweaks that would be used to replace this removal could be the following:\n•\tMove the slow from the Twilight Shroud and add it to Crescent Slash. Lasting 1.5 seconds, to all targets hit. If the target is alone, the slow strength is doubled. That way, having a powerful slow to be able to proc MoTA is now available, while also adding a ton more use cases to Crescent Slash since it now has a slow.\n•\tMake the burst of speed and decay time on Twilight Shroud much more potent. At Rank 1, the effects are pretty unnoticeable. This would emphasize her ninja theme more strongly and allows for more outplays.\n\n**TDLR:** Making Akali back to Season 1 and half Season 2, where Crescent Slash did not procced MoTA, would give Akali enough mechnical intensity for suffiicent counterplay in the mean time. This simple change would help in adding back some finesse in playing Akali, with small changes to increase her skill ceiling at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2014-12-29T10:03:38.385+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"wait we're giving AKALI more counterplay? picture this, i'm twitch and alistar is my support. akali comes SPRINTING down the lane for my blood, dashes to me and gets punted away by alistar\nthen she dashes AGAIN and gets knocked up by alistar\nnow that's where i should be safe but then WHAM another dash and my CC-bot support has done all he could but alas, could not repel a lone champion\n\nto be fair though, after that happened, she tried the same thing again and i killed her while alistar was CCing her.","replies":[{"poster":"Monotachi","date":"2014-12-29T10:53:27.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"It is correct to say that Akali had more counterplay during Season 1 and 2, therefore why her frustration levels were very low.

The scaling is shitty, the base damage is nothing special, it's low range, and also self-roots akali for it's duration . On top of that, it had absolutely *zero* synergy with the rest of her kit prior to that change - a problem many older champions have  -  and with the high energy drain you just hadn't much of a reason to use it outside of clearing creeps. Adding the detonation trigger gave the skill at least a small connection to her kit. It was still bad, but at least it had a purpose.\nThat being said, I actually like the idea of adding the slow instead - it would add gameplay and still connect the skill to the rest of the kit. \n\n\nNow, for something  offtopic:\nI still think it doesn't adress the main problem - but that was probably also not your intention.\nAs long as Akali has her targeted/instant/800 range/tripple/low cd/no cost/decent damage dash she'll always be a huge pain to play against. I mean, just look at that description; it makes Yasuo's dash look like trash. She's hella outdated - her skills are clunky, she's got neither much gameplay nor counterplay going on, but at the same time snowballs ridicously easy due to having the ultimate gapcloser. Frankly, she either needs a \"gameplay update\" or a rework, to bring her up to date & solve the issues of her kit.

The gunblade gives her way too much spellvamp with her passive, this means that even if you go even in trade, she will q a couple minions and constantly heal until you are forced to base or risk dying to her shadow dance.

Look at it this way. Akali heals when she applies spell damage. If AAing delays proccing MoTA debuff then Akali won't be healing as fast as she would want to. Crescent Slash proccing MoTA is pretty much instant with no delay therefore Akali gains health back instantly. When it comes to trading this is a small detail that players overlook. AAing also is guaranteed to draw minion aggro so she either forced to back off or use shroud.\n\nCrescent Slash doesn't draw minion aggro therefore it dumbs down the skill required to play Akali.
