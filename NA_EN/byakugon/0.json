I have the same dream of working at Riot, though I truly want to work in Player Support, (~~yes, I believe my calling is answering tickets, i love every day of helping people xD~~) I also do a bit of art on the side. Here's a few tips I can give you, though I do more GFX I have a sister who does illustrations and friends in animation and coding.\n\n1. Practice. All the time, everyday, as much as you can. You'll only get better if you work at it as much as you can!\n2. Be open to criticism. A lot of people might take criticism personally, but don't! It gives you a chance to improve as an artist, and a person, by being able to apply that advice.\n3. Don't work off an artstyle. A lot of my friends tell me they draw by using real life poses/references instead of other anime ones, as it causes them to force a style like the reference that might not necessarily apply to their general art.\n4. Don't be afraid to try new things! If you want to try a new angle, medium, program, design choice, color scheme, go for it! You never know what you're capable of until you try.\n\nFor programs; I suggest paying the monthly price for CC as you can get things like Photoshop (if you draw), or Illustrate (Graphics.) My sister also recommends ToonBoom for 2d animation. For 3D, you can use Maya and 3dsMax for free under a student license for practice, which is a 3d modeling/animating program! There are also artists who use ZBrush to model out detailed concept for characters.\n\nI hope this helped a tiny bit, if you have any specific questions feel free to ask! Also, sorry if I didn't make much sense I'm very tired IRL haha.","replies":[{"poster":"sh1be","date":"2017-10-07T03:15:38.884+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amazing advice, hope you make that job!","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2017-10-09T04:09:27.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustTryinM8,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=UMEnNJWf,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-10-07T03:15:38.884+0000)\n>\n> Amazing advice, hope you make that job!\n\nThank you! ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Byakugon","date":"2017-10-07T00:06:58.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-06T23:46:39.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I was 14, I had ambitions to work for a video game company.  Let me tell you this right now, **don't give up **on your dreams.  The industry could use more passionate players, and I admire you for hungering for knowledge.  There is always room to learn and grow!\n\nThe biggest tip I could offer you is to do this for your passion, and not what you perceive a company to want.  I couldn't tell you what to pursue or do, that choice is entirely up to you.  Make your own path, find what best fits for **you**, and keep practicing!  \n\nThere is also a fine community of artists at the [Art](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art) boards.  I'm no artist, so they might be able to offer tips and resources better than I could!  I also wouldn't be surprised if there were reddit and discord communities.\n\nStay persistent and persevere, friend!","replies":[{"poster":"Byakugon","date":"2017-10-07T00:07:25.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks you i will contact the arts board","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sh1be","date":"2017-10-07T03:18:30.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man!
