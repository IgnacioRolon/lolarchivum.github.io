All who challenge the &ldquo;Truth Bearer of Nagakabouros&rdquo; soon discover Illaoi never battles alone - the god of the Serpent Isles fights by her side.\n\nBut what exactly does this mean, and how would her abilities be expressed in the context of a fight? I&#039;ve read Shadow &amp; Fortune and instead of engaging in combat with the champions of the Shadow Isles she channeled the energies of Nagakabouros to drive back the fog and stop the harrowing, but what would have happened if she was forced into a battle with Hecarim or Thresh? If her powers are innate, it suggest she&#039;s the living embodiment or the direct vessel of a god(or LoL&#039;s most powerful lore character to date), and if that&#039;s the case I&#039;m curious how she stacks up against the Ascended, the Aspects, Aatrox, Tahm Kench, Mordekaiser, Braum, and some of the LoL universe&#039;s more powerful champions given rioters descriptions of her powers: \n\n> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Go5ya3eE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-11-25T17:58:09.511+0000)\n>\n> +1. \n> It is rare,  but it is only a &quot;tool.&quot;   Like a hammer or saw.

The faith of the Serpent Isles is just one of the many religions across Runeterra, and not even a major one in comparison. It is possible that Illaoi's religious rituals and mantras are only a means of channel her own innate magic, in which case Illaoi wouldn't last very long against the more powerful champions like the Ascended.\n\nAs for who would survive the test? Anyone with a strong motivation to achieve their goals is \"in motion\", so any champion on an important personal quest should be able to pass.\nI think it's easier to list champions who _wouldn't_ survive: {{champion:69}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:154}}  come to mind as possibilities, but it this is pretty subjective to how you interpret these character's motivations.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-03-27T05:18:21.297+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing about Nagakabouros is that there's tangible evidence to the power the god represents existing; in Trial of the Kraken Priestess the man sees tentacles coming out of literally everywhere, showing the extent of her reach, and the powers Illaoi invoked were capable of en masse purifying the Black Mist in Shadow and Fortune. Hell the powers at play here prove people actually have souls, which is kind of a big deal. We players may have figured it from the scores of monsters from the Shadow Isles, but a lot of people probably don't get to see Harrowings all that often.. Nothing about the way Illaoi's power is showcased implies it comes directly from here; she merely bears the burden of wielding that power. It manifests externally in the world and responds to Illaoi's actions, but it comes as a result of the Eye of God and how Illaoi uses it.\n\nWhile the Buhrun interpretation of whatever Nagakabouros is or represents may be incorrect or limited in scope, Nagakabouros's power has been showcased before, doing things that imply a connection to the souls of things in general. And when you've got beings like Aurelion Sol saying things like \"I've seen the main act. Your only a third rate cover band.\" It speaks a lot to just how much greater the power here is. While Nagakabouros as an entity may not be real, the powers that she represent most certainly are.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-03-28T07:36:31.971+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":2,"body":"On Nagakabouros faith:   \n\n \"A god's appearance is limited only by those observing it\"  -Illaoi\n\n\nIllaoi's power: \nIllaoi is powerful because she is personally capable of serving her god--- that's actually a rare gift.

Illaoi is one of my favourite champions and even outside of the game, she has a place close to my heart for teaching me so many things, but surprisingly the doubts that this discussion has inspired me are actually about this \"Jhin wouldn't pass it\" statement. Let me try to explain myself...\n\nIllaoi tests people with desires of great potential who are stagnated and don't fulfill them, effectively blocking the flow of the universe. The test would consist of the three parts the \"Trial of the Kraken Priestess\" revealed: Motion, Focus and Truth; all concluding to the same end: empowering the \"tested\" to fight against whatever is restraining them, awaking them from their lethargy and revealing them how the world and the universe truly works.\n\nThat concludes in the question of why would Illaoi test Jhin? From my point of view, I think that being happy or not is not particularly relevant here, though the second question has much more depth: Is he actually chasing what his heart wants him to do? Is he fullfilling desires and then collaborating in the evolution of universe? In the end: does he enjoy killing and turning it into art? I'd say it is hard to say no as an answer to that, because that would imply two things: firstly, his enjoyment expressed in all of his lines is actually staged as he isn't enjoying any of the carnage; and secondly, the whole character is an empty shell and all the characterization he has been given is false as he has ulterior motivations, his heart wants something else we don't know. I'd say the thematic pillar of Jhin is the \"serial killer whose whole life revolves around it, making every kill theatrical and dramatical\", a quite concrete fantasy that he perfectly embodies. And to add insult to injury, every hint we have about his life points out to the fact that that fantasy is in fact his true nature, with that \"normal person in everyday life, serious killer when he shows his true nature by masking himself\" ambivalence, a truly dramatical situation. There are so many things pointing out that Jhin lives for killing and he enjoys how he kills that I don't see any reason why Illaoi would target him as a stagnated soul nor why he wouldn't pass it, as he is in motion and is focused in what he does. Nagakabouros just cares about if you are following its rules or not, anything else is completely irrelevant to its will.\n\nAfter thoroughly thinking about this since you posted this, I've only came up with two possible reasons why he would fail: he isn't killing as much as before after he got out of jail (dreaming of killing Sona, Garen, Zed and Vi but in the end nothing was done) or he is way too much a perfectionist that is never satisfied with his own job, being by default unable to fulfill his desires (as some of his lines probably mean), what Illaoi would probably see as a \"defectuous human\". The former seems plausible, though I don't really imagine Jhin resisting the urge to make art, and you haven't implied that the reason would be in that direction; and the latter, while it's truly powerful from a narrative point of view, would mean again that he doesn't enjoy any of his killings as every one of them was not good --perfect-- enough, something that as far as we know thanks to all his other voicelines and lore pieces, he has achieved, so I'd say it doesn't hold water either. Being him a slave of his work, being consumed by it, being tortured by the pressure of having to create better and better plays every time doesn't imply that he doesn't enjoy his work. By fulfilling these desires, he collaborates to the flow of the universe, so Illaoi shouldn't target him and even more: killing him would be a mistake as he really is working towards the will of Nagakabouros (so passing the test would be the logical outcome).\n\nLong story short: I honestly cannot see any way in which Jhin would fail Illaoi's Test of Nagakabouros, though you really have the full view of their whole personalities and, more importantly, their secrets, so you know what's the reason. What is it then? Is he really faking everything he is and we know about him? I know that this is some kind of \"we cannot reveal the whole character like this\" situation, though from my experience, these kinds of tidbits never get to see the light in an official lore content. It's never revealed and it's always left in this kind of \"lore limbo\", something I honestly hate cause, even though I wouldn't mind if it gets revealed sometime, the most probable outcome is that even after a whole year, this situation won't be discussed in lore. \n\nThank you again for discussing this with the community!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-03-28T22:00:57.354+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I can agree with what you're trying to say, you can also interpret that line as in he loves his hobby so much, nothing else can compare.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2017-03-30T21:34:59.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't get me started on this again xD\n\n\"I am a slave to this passion.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2017-03-28T13:33:14.964+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he's unwilling to look BEYOND his art.

We know very little about who Sion was before his death. Leblanc calls him more of a killer than a leader, but it's also **Leblanc** who probably didn't have much respect for him at all (especially given Sion's dislike of magic). We do know he reached a high rank in the military and ended up killing the king of Demacia at the cost of his own life. \n\nIf Illaoi's test is a constant struggle to change and life your life to the fullest, then I think Sion could pass it. Sion was probably a very violent person, but we don't know if he was violent for the sake of being violent (though he probably found it enjoyable) or if he had another goal in mind. \n\nDid he have family he wanted to raise?  Did he have a dream for Noxus he wanted to see come true?  \n\nPersonally I like to think he had other reasons for living beyond committing violence, but that's mainly headcannon.

Our real world pantheistic religions do not (and did not) believe in individual gods in a childlike way.

I&#x27;d always been under the impression it was some kind of super powerful sea spirit, but the context provided here leads me to believe otherwise.\n\nmy guess is because he onlly did that in one dimension while a real god can go to multiple dimensions {{champion:432}} , or real gods are just 10000x stronger than him and hes just really weak compared to him but i think its the 1st","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-03-28T16:12:24.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=icewate2,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2017-03-28T07:36:31.971+0000)Aol Sol is, at best, a demi-god-- he serves only one reality and exists on only one realm.\n\nOut of curiosity, how do the following powerful, supernatural characters compare to someone like Aurelion Sol?\n\n* Kindred\n* Bard\n* Soraka\n\nIf I were to guess, Soraka feels like the weakest, most earthly \"celestial\" being of the bunch, and Kindred feels like they are perhaps all-powerful on Runeterra, but locked to a single realm and only crossing into other realms for brief moments.\n\nBard is the wild card -- there's something alien and unknowable about him that makes me thing he operates, on some level, on a different plane even from extremely powerful entities like Aurelion Sol. Perhaps it's his strange, unspeaking, seemingly uncaring nature, but I almost imagine him as someone who even Aurelion would think twice about angering, if Bard even HAS emotions, whereas I can't see Bard worrying about whether or not Aurelion Sol gets angry at him...\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Yadid","date":"2017-03-31T04:26:20.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to the old lore, 'raka is the most earthly b/c she 'fell from grace' by helping old WW.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CoolMamo","date":"2017-03-30T03:58:07.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait didnt aol sol create everything?

Then again my current running theory is that they're a type of spirit or faerie in the new lore, so...that might explain that.\n\nGragas, Jinx, and Olaf seem like good candidates to not need to be tested given how large they live and how little hesitation with their lives they show, although it's possible Jinx has some well-repressed doubt somewhere in her psyche than I'm sure the test would uncover. Other candidates are Darius and Draven, although it's possible they're more restrained in his personal life than we see on the battlefield.\n\nAmusingly, it feels like the biggest category that causes *League* champions to fail is restraint. There are a lot who feel like they're holding back a bit too much, or otherwise would be fantastic candidates.\n\nI'm unsure of Tryndamere, since his lore is so old.","replies":[{"poster":"Nobody1111","date":"2017-03-29T21:30:17.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kled would just tell Nagakabouros to get off his property, those damn interdenominational trespassers","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
