His early game is extremely safe when played properly and he easily ults his most reliable DPS individual in a teamfight to make the enemy lose. It's no joke when a Zilean is on the enemy team and makes a jungle Draven function well to such a point where the Zilean needs to not have ulti or you can't win a fight.\n\nSaying that ANY champion is a liability because it is only good as their teammates means you may as well put the entire support roster onto this topic save for Zyra/Brand. That's not a reasonable way to declare any champion's current state, you need to actually compare them to what others in their role do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ºˉ GeMıNı","date":"2017-04-23T09:00:13.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=eM tropeR,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KHmME4j5,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-04-23T07:05:04.009+0000)\n>\n> Which is good, if you have good teammates to revive, but what else can he do?

Just ask anyone who tried him in Nemesis Draft. He's not weak at all.  \nKennen is a pocket pick for a lot of roles and sees competitive play.  \n\nKarthus, too many counters (like WAY TOO MANY) so yes. Though Lost Chapter helps him out A LOT. Fiddlesticks as of right now, yes. Kindred, yes, but only because Squishy ADC jungler makes for terrible team comp balance and games are too short for her to scale.  \n\nIf I had to add to the list it would be:  \n{{champion:86}}  (worse version of Darius in every relevant category)  \n{{champion:76}}  (relative to how hard she is to play she is quite weak. Too many dashes to make her spears worth a damn)  \n{{champion:44}}  (anyone who doesn't one-trick this champion is going to have a very-very bad time failing their ults and subsequently doing practically nothing)","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllegalBagel","date":"2017-04-23T07:49:38.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when has karthus been weak 60% winrate if you play more than 20 games on him","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBenchedKench","date":"2017-04-23T07:11:23.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean - Has a 99% slow that he can do twice, and at max-rank/45% CDR he can spam that thing on someone every 3-4 seconds twice. \nHas a 34 Second GUARDIAN ANGEL.\nHas a 100% AP SCALING AOE Stun bomb \nHas a 99% Speed boost that he can do twice, and at max-rank/45% CDR he can spam that thing on someone every 3-4 seconds twice.\nHas a really spammable kit that allows him to run at the speed of light after he gets Ludeons. \nZilean is useful.\n\nUrgot - Urgot is trash, he needs a rework like right now. \n\nKarthus - Hah aha what? \nQ - Does crazy spam-damage when their alone and medium aoe-damage when grouped. \nW - A huge slow thats almost as long as the whole lane that decreases their defenses as well?\nE - The ACTUAL main DPS of Karthus.

It's biased to say that Kindred is useless since she takes a lot of knowledge and consistency to succeed vs. the \"AA>Q>AA>R\" that Graves does. Hell, you could even argue Shyvana but it's simply based on the player. Can't agree with Kindred or any jungler you've slapped onto here.\n\nZilean is one my most hated champions because a good one actually makes the game that much harder to win. And on your end, it makes plays a lot safer to pull off. You must not have ever met a good one in your games before. Urgot is already getting a rework. Karthus scales based off of enemy's lack of awareness (which is high in solo queue). On-hit Kennen isn't a liability, but AP Kennen is. Aurelion Sol was downright broken on release but was overlooked due to lackluster gameplay. Kayle is a good champion when used properly, I suggest you actually look at her winrate and who actually uses her (typically you will see lo boosters picking her up for extremely high winrates). Dark Seal Singed is far from a liability. It's still nasty when used properly but you can't expect just anyone to be playing Singed intelligently. \n\nIt's sounding to me more like you're getting teammates who are not that experienced on these champions. Why not {{champion:17}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:7}}  ?
