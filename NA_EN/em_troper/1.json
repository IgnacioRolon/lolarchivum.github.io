{"poster":"eM tropeR","date":"2017-08-12T01:24:10.419+0000","title":"Elo Hell","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I noticed something interesting about the match making system. If I get a piece of shit on my team who farms minions during a team fight, of course, I will usually will give him shit for his trolling behavior, and then shortly afterward I will receive a ban for giving him shit, since giving him any criticism what so ever is considered to be &quot;toxic&quot;. \r\n\r\nWhat is interesting is in the games that follow. Once I get reported a couple of times, the games that follow are consistently stacked with toxic teammates. It is as if the match making system is purposely putting all the ass holes on my team to increase the chances that I will rage at them and get banned faster. On top of that, the enemy team is stacked with highly skilled opponents to make the games completely unwinnable. \r\n\r\nIt is as if the match making system is trying to create toxic games for me because I have been flagged from previous reports. It literally creates an &quot;Elo Hell&quot;.  \r\n\r\nThis is actually very easy to test. For example, if I choose to be completely well behaved, I never feed any kills, I get amazing CS, and I do not say a single word in the team chat, at the end of the game, somehow the ass hole teammates that the match making system has picked for me will still all start blaming me for the loss and asking each other to report me. Even if I have zero deaths and say exactly zero words in team chat, by the end of the game, the teammates are all still begging each other to report me. \r\n\r\nSo in reality, it does not matter if I feed fifty kills or call people every swear word in the book. What matters is, I have been flagged as a &quot;toxic player&quot;, and therefore will continue to get matched with the worst of the worst possible teammates, who are always going to blame and report me no matter what I do. Once you are in Elo Hell, you are in it until you are permanently banned. There does not seem to be a way out. \r\n\r\nWhat I see very clearly is that Riot does not care much for reform, but rather wants to encourage witch hunts and beheadings to create the illusion that they care about player behavior. Riot knows that a certain percentage of people who get permanently banned are going to spend money to reload a new account will all new champions and skins. Therefore, consistently banning players left, right, and center does increase their revenue substantially. \r\n\r\nPretty sad, but the truth usually is. Unfortunately, this is the reason I will NEVER spend one dollar on this game, and I would encourage others to never spend money on it either.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-08-12T01:35:39.486+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It must be unfortunate to be so angry at the world, i am glad i am capable of taking responsibility for my own actions.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-08-12T04:55:20.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seriously wanna know how advanced we are now that computers are chatting for us.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-08-12T01:59:06.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait a second... so you're stuck in this game with a guy that you say is a \"piece of shit\" and your first instinct is to _give him shit_.

No problem. It's alright if you are a little slow.
