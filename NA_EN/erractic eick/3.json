There's lots of people who enjoy support, and enjoy it consistently, but know it doesn't have equal impact on the game. \n\nSupport exists as a position because there isn't enough xp and gold on the map to sustain a full fifth position. The items and strategies surrounding support have served as a means to alleviate that reality and try to allow a fifth full member to exist. It has contributed to the game because it allowed for some a-symmetry and that's interesting. \n\nThat doesn't mean that the support player has an equal say in the game, though. To me, that's the key problem that needs fixing. Supporting is fun, supporting is helpful, but it doesn't carry the same impact as other roles. As such, it will always be a problem for queues and for the game. Riot needs to fix the harsh reality that a position with less xp and gold than other positions is going to be less helpful. It's just the cold, hard, truth.","replies":[{"poster":"Erractic Eick","date":"2016-11-29T22:00:58.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> But, your poll isn't necessarily that informative.

Sightstone feels pretty bad (imo) to keep vision up since it's basically hard countered by a free trinket and the enemies can force me off the map purely by playing the vision game without ever seeing me (feelsbadman, especially if you're an Enchanter with a chalice item because your HP/MP regen is high). Some updated mechanics specifically aimed at support gameplay would go a long way towards making the role feel better... some of the biggest problems right now:\n\n**Super boring build paths.** All tank supports basically want to make the same items, all enchanter supports basically want the same items, even if they function completely differently than their counterparts, due to the high efficiency of the items when you include actives (Knight's Vow, Locket, Face, etc). \n\n**Lack of real safety.** Right now, it feels like the lanes need some love. It's currently very difficult (except for someone like Janna) to deal with towerdives in a meaningful way. With the increase in mobility and tanks entering the meta again with CotC, it can be very easy for the tank to assume and keep tower aggro through an entire dive and shrug said tower aggro off with shields from CotC. Everyone has experienced the 4-5man fiesta bottom lane, and it's not fun - either make other lanes more appealing to gank or make bot lane harder...\n\n**Lack of champ diversity**. We haven't received any real, game-changing supports since Bard (2 years ago), and it would be really nice to see Riot put some effort into developing interesting supports, especially now that they have a better idea of what \"classes\" of supports they'd like to support (enchanters, vanguards, etc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"iKitten","date":"2016-11-29T21:31:46.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love being a support main, although it has it's ups and downs.

I liked picking a utility mage and still doing ok to good damage, but that isnt really a thing anymore.  I liked when tanks were actually tanks and could reliably survive long enough to do their job.  That has steadily been nerfed as well.\n\nOverall the game is under going a constant arms race that seems to heavily favor the flashy play makers and high bursters.  Recent changes have helped reduce that gap but it isnt where it should be due to the state of the \"true\" support champs not being  in a fun state.
