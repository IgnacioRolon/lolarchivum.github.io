It did not pop up. I attempted to quit, and clicked the icon again. A black rectangle the size of the log-in screen popped up. I tried to quit again. I could not. I attempted to force quit. The option is not allowed. I attempted to shut off the computer. I was not allowed to by my own computer on the grounds that the League application was still running. A pop-up showed up asking if I want to retry to close the application. I tried three times, and none of the attempts worked. I tried uninstalling the application by dragging the app to the trash can. The app merely popped back into its original place. I tried again with the dashboard icon. It merely deleted the app from my dashboard.\n\nNeedless to say, I am not tech-savvy in the slightest, but what are my options?\n\nEdit: I have not yet tried force shutting down the entire computer, but I would prefer to find out why I had the problem in the first place before I try that.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T02:59:55.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your OS is having a really hard time getting league to launch for some reason.

I don't want to waste your time, so if this issue no longer warrant your attention, I fully understand, but if possible, could you help me figure out what caused the issue?\n\nI've looked through the steps, and I have the minimum system requirements, the operating system has fully updated, administrator privileges are all configured to the specified settings, and the in-game settings were all default save for all forms of audio, which was turned off. \n\nThat leaves the possibility of needing to repair corrupted files, reset the SMC, or reset the NVRAM. Seeing as there were power outages recently in my area, I'm tempted to suspect the SMC is the issue, but as I said, I'm clueless when it comes to electronics. \n\nI don't know if this issue will come up again, but do you recommend reseting all three regardless, just to be safe?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T20:22:42.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hrrrrrmmmmmm that may be a little out of my 'league'.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nLet's get you in touch with our tech guys through a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get to the bottom of this and make sure we get everything taken care of properly!","replies":[{"poster":"Erractic Eick","date":"2017-04-07T21:14:37.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, and sorry for taking so much of your time, again!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
