I dont really like to complain, especially about a game ive only been into for 2 years. I have always had some sort of internet problems, and they have always gotten in the way of games ive loved to play. Ive only lagged out games 2, maybe 3 times max. This is the second leaver penalty ive gotten, and would love to have this gone. I normally start the game with 50fps and 120ish ms, but it normally spikes to 10fps with 1000-5000ms. I just leave my computer alone when this happens because i dont want to be reported for intentionally feeding when I cant tell what is happening, but then I get an afk penalty. Please help. I dont want to be banned for this. I play in blind pick, which is seen as casual play. Me being afk sometimes is a lot better than accidentally feeding. Can I get some help sorting out these bans please?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T22:50:07.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can't just up and remove someone's ban when they ask, we should definitely look over how the connection is being routed to see if I can get you a better ping in-game.

I went in and tampered with my vpn, and fixed the lag/ping problem. Just really wish there was a way though for people to not be banned because of problems like mine. Everyone sees bling pick as casual, so it sucks people get banned for things that happen. thank you though.","replies":[]}]}]}
