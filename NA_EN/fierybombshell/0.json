Part of the way through the game my q and w seemed to fix itself, but my e and r did not. They seemed to be on like a .5 to 1 second lag timer. Which is quite annoying when you are trying to bomb a minion or champ and end up running straight at them. Nothing else was unusual. My frames and ping was roughly what they always are, nobody else seemed to have any lag, heck, I was even ethernet'd into my router.  How can I fix this or is there even a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T01:12:44.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that kind of lag almost always points to issues with packet loss, which happens before your connection hits our servers. Most of the time it happens from how your ISP is sending your connection, or just due to a damaged node along the way. \n\nGrab the network logs from that game if you can and have this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them. Take a screenshot and post it back here so I can take a look for ya.","replies":[{"poster":"fierybombshell","date":"2017-10-18T01:19:21.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where do I find the network logs from that game?\n\nEdit: Just saw the directions on the link you sent","replies":[{"poster":"fierybombshell","date":"2017-10-18T01:31:24.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here ya go](https://imgur.com/a/uyWij?)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T02:05:54.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm alrighty, doesn't actually look like packet loss is the main issue here. I'd like to go ahead and try something else, let's update a couple network settings to make sure this isn't just some basic lag issues. \n\nCheck out this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for the steps on port forwarding and dns settings. Adjust those and test it out in practice game for me really quick.","replies":[{"poster":"fierybombshell","date":"2017-10-18T02:35:29.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like one of those fixed it.
