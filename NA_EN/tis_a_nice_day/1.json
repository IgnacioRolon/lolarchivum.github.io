To buy Nashors tooth instead of an other on hit item, is often a decision for CDR and against (base) on hit damage. That you have to make this decision during the build path, make sence for me.\n\nAnd I don't think that Stinger should be removed. 40% AS+10% CDR is probably better in many situations on many champions than 30% AS+10 on hit. Sometimes I buy Nashors Tooth because of the CDR, and i want to have that CDR as soon as possible. Stinger and Nashors Tooth are underrated items.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-17T08:00:27.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its better if Stinger its removed","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-04-16T01:15:22.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tis a nice day,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bozHWRn3,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-16T00:09:49.460+0000)\n>\n\n> Recurve bow now valid item?\n\nIt's not that it ever was an invalid item, it's just that it only builds into two items that have niche uses. _And there's nothing wrong with that._\nIt doesn't even seem needed, because it's not like there is a huge gold amount to get the bow; BF is 1550 after all.  It's odd for Riot to make Daggers into Recurve bow; it doesn't need steps.   What, are they going to make Recurve Bow just a pair of daggers in recipes?  Is every item with more than 30%AS going to need a bow now?  It's just senseless to do that, so why Riot would even bother with the recipe change is a mystery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-04-16T00:32:47.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"valid? nah\nsave me 1 slot when I'm trying to build stalkers? totally","replies":[]}]}
