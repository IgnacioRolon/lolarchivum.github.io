Really tall, muscled Noxian soldier.\n\nI dont think i'd want a human skin for Urgot (unless it's legendary or even ultimate tier, in which case it'd probably be bad-ass.) An official artwork is everything i could wish for. I just want to know who he used to be, as it's very hard to tell with how he currently is. You can't even tell with certainty what his face used to look like.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-05-24T17:04:08.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If pictures of his time before Zaun exist, he would go on a raid to destroy them all.\nUrgot wouldn't ever want anyone to see him in his weak state.

Urgot is more about the present and your future, to suffer to become stronger.\n\nAnd I prefer the lore to keep going forward for now. They have spent quite alot of time looking at Runeterra's past. Let us now see in which direction the champions are going with their future now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2019-05-24T11:51:29.565+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zuHjQcv3pN8/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"EdgeLady","date":"2019-05-24T14:02:10.371+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing he used to be a huge and very muscular man.
