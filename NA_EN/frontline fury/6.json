The lane is so long, that you're easier to gank or chase before reaching tower.\nAdditionally, an adc can't roam from mid because they're useless until a few items. Mages and assassinscan shove and roam with ease. If the support roams, the adc is alone against a midlaner who is ahead due to solo lane xp and msot likely able to oneshot them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2020-02-03T03:33:18.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's spelt outlier.  \n\nAlso, riot is fine with outliers until a support gets involved because riot hates supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-02-03T12:03:29.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or maybe it is because supports in solo lanes tend to become problematic... just maybe?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2020-02-03T03:35:15.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well spelling has always been an issue for me , being dyslexic and all. \n\nbut thanks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-03T01:35:03.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funneling actually did get some targeted nerfs with a partially-complete jungle item causing reduced gold gains from lane minions if you started taxing too much, so I wouldn't be surprised at more nerfs if that strategy is really making a comeback.
