Intermediate and beginner bots will be removed leaving only intro bots left. That way no resources will have to go into adjusting the item loadouts of the bots when items are changed around competitive play, or a champion gets a rework.\r\n\r\nWhat feature do you think is next to be stripped for revenue?","replies":[{"poster":"Busty Demoness","date":"2019-08-10T03:18:07.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next in line?
