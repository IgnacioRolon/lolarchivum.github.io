Trynda (often being called having great base stats has 85 armor, which is also low, so this is another myth - he has great base hp, his armor is garbage - I guess the balance team wants melee DPS characters to be weaker to other autoattackers).  53.4 mr lvl 18 - the majority of champions have this (mages/enchanter supports and adc have 38.5), so - he is the same as everyone in this regard.

By the time you get this damage, he typically has more of his build filled in - with items that provide health and resistances, negating your burst damage. \n\n\"He should be dead before he even gets near you\" He ults, flashes close enough to Q on top of his target and kills them in three basic attacks - roughly 0.4 seconds. He also has four teammates you have to worry about as well, which may also require whatever cc your champion has at hand.\n\nPoint is, at the moment counterplay to Yi depends solely on Yi making mistakes.
