League of Legends What is this garbage? I get banned because i tell the karthus to stop trolling me, this game is going further and further down the drain i get banned every week now, for the most mundane shit, I've had this account for a long time and if it gets banned again I'll just stop playing this game altogether, its not even worth spending my time on now. I am the last one of my friends to play this game, and now i understand why they all stopped.  #LOLisdead","replies":[]}
