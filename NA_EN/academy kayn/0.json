Either drop the AP scaling or add more of it for starters. Then, might as well take away health scaling on the healing...don't know what you'd replace it with, but good W builds always revolved around lifesteal, and they will even after this rework. And finally, just want to point out that critical strike items are the only thing he can buy viably now because if he gets anything else, he doesn't have anywhere near enough attack speed to get his blood rush going AND have relevant damage to go with it. I'm okay with him doing well with critical strike items personally, but I think it's weird that the player base doesn't know to build it. If the ultimate damage and W healing(just an easy example of a change that wouldn't change much I think) scaled with critical strike stats, then it would be more obvious they should be buying it.\n\nOther than the primary concern over players not knowing what works good on him, there is the idea of what else you might buff. I was getting Essence Reaver and even though the mana part of it isn't necessary on him, the item performed well by giving him a lot of CDR. So, I would target buffs primarily on CDs for his abilities if I were you guys, just my thought. It's difficult to imagine him being tanky working without a lot of attack speed and believe me, I tried Wit's End...it's just not viable...if the cooldowns were reduced then maybe, just maybe, tanky Aatrox would work. How do you get his pool to activate if you're attacking slowly? Got to use E and Q more often. You'd also need to greatly increase the health scaling on the W if you really wanted to stick with that. Maybe add on health scaling into damage on E like Braum has health scaling into damage on his Q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-03-08T23:10:23.980+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably to push him more towards their newer idea of Divers, but still an offset variation of a Skirmisher.

Okay sure you can make his numbers better, but hes not fun to play anymore. How did you guys expect better performance? Every Aatrox main took one look at the changes and instantly knew he was going to do worse. What tools do you use to come to these conclusions? Its mind boggling.\n\nI'm sorry dude, but Riot had 2 years of input from Aatrox mains and you guys ignored nearly all of it.  In fact the changes made his problems worse. \n\nKeep this in mind too. He is the only fighter or top laner you will see that has no built in blocks, parries, resistances or shields. With the old Aatrox his sustain was his defense. That is severely gutted. So he builds tanky now? So what, anyone can build tanky. The difference is when Olaf does it he still does true damage. When Voli does it he does damage based on his max HP.  Him building tanky makes him do even less damage because his W was completely gutted. \n\nThat bonus AD on his Blood Price in now way compensates for 60-200 plus 100% bonus AD.  The W was a nerf, the slow is much worse now, due to its duration. No one wanted to asked for his Q scaling to be better. \n\nAlso, look at how many champions he will be facing do mixed damage and percent of health damage. Why did you insist on making him even easier to shut down with a few armor items? Why is he the only one not allowed to being doing either true damage, bonus magic damage (like jax) or %of health damage. Furthermore, he has no built in armor pen or crits. \n\nSo Aatrox is the only champion who is basically bare bones. No shields, no blocks, no parries, no built in resistances or tenacity, no built in crits or armor reduction and no magic damage, true damage or percent to health damage.\n\nThe reason why his revive doesn't count as a defensive stat in the same category as the ones I mentioned is that the other champiosn defensive stats help keep them alive while doing damage. Nasus bonus health and resistance and health, Pantheon blocks, Fiora spell shields, Riven has a shield that scales off of AD, etc etc etc. These are way more useful in more situations than a revive that leaves you a sitting duck.\n\nThe ONLY reason it was okay for him to be such a bare bones champion was his incredibly healing. Not his passive, but his healing. And this gone. \n\nPlease listen to your customers more next time.

Ask Malicious Metal if you don't believe me. And I kinda don't understand the fact of \"Let's actually put some effort into trying to make him buffable, and then not buff him\", because that was the point of the rework. To make it so that he could be buffed. \n\nAatrox does need an actual rework yeah, but so do SOOOOOOOoooooo many other older champs, like the newest Galio, or people like Urgot, Evelynn, Swain... you know, people who were made long before 2013. The mini-rework was meant to put Aatrox into a buffable state, not just to buff Aatrox.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkadije95","date":"2017-03-10T00:20:00.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think Mordekaiser is a good champion now then good for you, go and play him then. A rework is meant to fix a champion not to put them into whatever bull crap Rito has be feeding you with state you mentioned. And as for the whole Urgot, Evelynn and Swain thing you said do you know what those champions are that Aatrox is not? You do not know? Ok, I will tell you. They are PLAYABLE, VIABLE, IN AN OK PLACE AND WHATEVER TERM OR PHRASE YOU CAN THINK OF THAT MEANS YOU CAN PLAY THEM WITHOUT FEEDING OUT YOUR ASS. Also Aatrox is the worst champion Rito has made balance wise and gameplay wise. So yea, sorry that I want Rito to put in actual work into their reworks and not in their skin line and meme production and I think that the WORST CHAMPION IN THE GAME COULD USE SOME ACTUAL EFFORT AND LOVE. But like I sad, what do I know? You clearly have all the answers. And do not tell me that its a game with a 130 something champions, they have to have everything into consideration, game balance and all other bull crap, because this is a company that makes a lot of money, meaning that reasors are not a problem. And if Rito cares about balance the explain Camile.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
