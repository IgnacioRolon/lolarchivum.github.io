Only bring the power picks in line. (Like Tankko, instead of completely trashing them because you hate his guts.)

I've watched only the first game that Bard saw play, but thats it. So i'm not the best person to debate this without some more details.\n\nWhat i can comment about is the fact that Pro's will usually try to pick the best or safest picks. Especially in a\n coordinated team, who discuss their picks, there are always going to be those Champs who are viewed the safest/best of the best. Elsewise, they're picking champs who innately counter someone. I can't remember, but didn't Urgot see proplay as a direct counter to someone?\n\nI don't blame Riot for balancing around a certain set of champs, because I don't think it's all their fault. Pro's are going to pick the top dogs, and that itself is tricky to make diversty work.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2016-08-16T10:41:15.835+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or when they complain about lack of variety in LCS and then complain that champions who have been consistent staple picks like Azir get nerfed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-08-16T16:12:20.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"i like how riot tries to do balance changes for worlds\n\nand then buff vayne's Q AD ratio BACK to 70%.\n\nmeanwhile {{champion:11}} {{champion:23}}  balance changes around world is just a dream","replies":[{"poster":"Veltox","date":"2016-08-17T00:04:08.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless trynd is battshit broken he is never gonna see play in lcs at how reliant on rng and predictable for a coordinated team he is.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-08-17T00:52:44.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-08-16T14:13:46.167+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like to see shit like\n\n{{champion:83}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:11}} getting played in the lcs, not just ashe, vayne, skillven and cancer fireman.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-08-16T21:00:54.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those people have design flaws that make them not pickworthy, something that isn't fixed by buffing a number, unlessmit broke them past hell.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-08-17T00:51:18.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, but seriously lcs looks like the 44 same champions each year.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CeexSett","date":"2016-08-16T18:28:22.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust me, Morde was already picked and NO ONE wanted to seem him again, not even the pros themselves.\n\nMaybe Yorick will be good after his rework, Poppy and Sion both got very strong in competitive after their reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-08-16T19:00:51.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a morde main :  fyi he WAS broken.
