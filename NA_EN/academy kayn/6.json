For example, if I auto-attack Yasuo the most and summon the plants to attack him, will the plants continue to priority him when he gets out of the plant's range or attacking minions instead? or do I have to auto-attack him again to make the plants switch the target? Sorry if I'm confusing you.","replies":[{"poster":"CertainlyT","date":"2015-09-03T08:36:51.110+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra's plant logic will not be that much different.

If I'm understanding this correctly, 3 & 4 have always been part of the plants' AI? Those two combined mean that if Zyra QWs right on an enemy, the plant will attack the champion (because of 4), and then will continue to attack the champion as long as they stay in the plant's range (because of 3). In my experience this doesn't happen reliably on live (the only way to get plants to attack a champion reliably is to autoattack them).
