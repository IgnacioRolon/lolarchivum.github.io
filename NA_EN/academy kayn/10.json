Solos were abused (I was one of them), integrity was all over the place, animals were boosted, frankly it was the Wild West for ranked. Combined with the bad communication on Riot's part, their earnest effort was met with too many mistakes, unfulfilled promises, and yeah, in a couple of cases, some lies. \n\nThat said, those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it, and in this case, I want to tackle an issue that I see being talked about. \n\n# That Strategy is dead in League.\n\nAs from what I've seen, and you lovely folk are free to add in other reasons that I may have missed, but the complaints about there being no strategy I've seen stem around, well, mainly it being because of damage. The issue that people die too quick, teamfights don't last long enough, everything is a oneshot fiesta. But... that isn't strategy. Don't get me wrong, there is certainly an aspect of strategy in fights, but by far and large, that area is determined by Skill, not strategy. \n\n---------------------------------\n\nTo go further in depth, how you fight, from my opinion, is largely skill instead of strategy. Skill is the fulfillment of your own ability, your task, your job. In many cases, positioning, front line, back line, those are formations in a fight, but being able to execute and use these formations dwell purely down to skill alone. So, if that's the case, what is strategy, you lovingly, condescending asshole Kayn?\n\nWell first off, I love you too, but we can cuddle infront of the fire later, I'm busy. Secondly, Strategy is not how you fight fights, but it's how fights start. How they begin, where they take place, how you avoid them, etc. In the past, this has taken past in certain comps but that's honestly base level. Siege comps, split push comps, Protect that carry comps, but all those have died out. Why? Because we've gotten better. \n\nWhile team composition is still important, nowadays we favor more balanced team layouts than specialized ones. Why? Because Carries learned to kite, junglers learned better jungle rotations and gank patterns, we've learned lane pressure, minion wave manipulation, Skill has overrided a need for team comp strategy, because at the end of the day: \n\n#Strategy is a crutch. \n\nStrategy is how the armies of old and modern overwhelm superior forces. We've starved out invincible strongholds, massacred the cavalry of Roman armies to devour their infantry, lead fucking WAR ELEPHANTS to intimidate and panic enemy soldiers. We've lobbed cows with catapults for petes sake! Strategy from then to now has always been about winning before a battle has even started, or more importantly, how to win from behind. When you have shittier soldiers, strategy is what wins battles!\n\nAnd you know what Strategy isn't? It isn't a bunch of people fighting together, but separate. If you want strategy, you need people willing to listen, and you need people willing to lead. And I think most of can agree, it's far rarer to find cooperative teammates than it is to find someone willing to tell you to shove your keyboard up your ass. When we need strategy the most, people are calling for FF@15, or calling out Jung diff. \n\nThe reason why snowball games happen so much, is not because of damage, but because the winning team doesn't need strategy. They already have the better players, or their early game rotation by jungler netted them a lead, negating the need for a strategy outside of basic map rotation and warding. It's the inability to work together and create strategy that I think really loses teams games. And despite all it's faults, this is what Dynamic Queue tried to fix.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, that's right, he finally got to the title of the post, let's give him a round of applause. I enjoy my flowery writing thank you. But enough of me, let's talk Dynamic. Dynamic Queue tried to bring League back to what it was always meant to be: A Team game. The existence of Solo Queue Ranked is almost an oxymoron to the idea of a team game, and entirely befits the importance of skill over strategy. You may have a team, but at the end of the day, the only person you can rely on not being bad is: You. \n\nSo how do you reintroduce strategy? Simple. You remove the randomness of people you can't rely on. You bring in your friends, your acquaintances, that guy who carried you 15 games ago, and who you played with for like 4 more, but then you never talked to again. You bring people who you can talk and be comfortable with, and you talk, listen, and discuss just what everyone should do. So that sounds fine and all, so what's the hook up?\n\nWell, they didn't go all the way. We have 4 mans, 2 and 3 mans, 2 2 mans and 1 man, all you really did was introduce a slightly more awkward hook up of people than a double blind date. Combined with the fact that there was a large degree of different skill level differences that could make these comps, and that such a system was inserted back into a non-changed Ranked structure to accommodate it, we got the famous boosted animals. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhich is why, as my time grows shorter at work before i must leave (Christ I have too much free time, why do they not block the internet??), I bring us to our conclusion. \n\n#Clash\n\nOh baby, there it is. 5 short letters but all the difference between Skill and Strategy. I'm hoping that Clash succeeds where Dynamic has failed. In giving an actual environment ~~Rot in hell Flex Que~~ for people to put Strategy back to use. Zero randos for teammates, a completely new system unattached to normal skill levels. \n\nSo, was this post juts a vaguely hidden \"Can't wait for Clash post?\" Yes, but also no. My point here, is that there really hasn't ever been any strategy in League, not in Solo Queue. It's an environment that far pushes individual skill over coordination, which is why quite commonly people feel the need to be the one to carry their team. To be the carry, instead of the team player. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainAntiHeroz","date":"2019-11-14T20:10:03.093+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"man this means i need friends lmao XD\n\nbut yeah the meta is as I would title it \"Who has the most CC and Burst Meta\" although I've seen some people who would probably argue its \"whoever has the most of the new op champs wins meta\"","replies":[{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2019-11-15T16:02:34.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the meta tends to have cc and burst lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tokishi","date":"2019-11-15T00:38:58.472+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, I'd say the biggest issue ranked has right now is getting 4 other teammates that will play the game from start to finish.

However the reason for strategy dying off isnt because players gotten better, its because the comps that was relevant either got nerfed or became obsolete by newer champions. The reason why comps existed in the first place was because at that time, champions had more of a clear and defined strengths and weaknesses. Where champions was designed more as a piece to a puzzle rather than being the whole puzzle. You were limited to what you could do and you had to figure out how to make the best out of it.\n\nCompare to champ design back then to now. Now we have a multitude of modern champions having an absurd overloaded kit that makes the older designed obsolete. In it's attempts to make the game more \"dynamic\", it made the game more linear and homogeneous because of it. Which thus makes the game more about mechanics and less about strategy. \n\nI really dont know how you came to the conclusion of Clash being an opportunity to bring back strategy with the reasons I and you yourself stated.

(which, to be fair is the vast majority of players)  The original design was that you have a litany of champions and some provide damage and others provide something that ISN'T damage (be it tankiness, or cc, or whatever).  The original META is based on the theory that having a good \"blend\" of options is the best thing and having 5 damage dealers will normally lose because the flexible team can deal with you.\n\nThe STRATEGY comes from properly deploying your resources in the optimal way.  The way things were, most support mains would probably climb simply by dint of being a scarce resource that provides an optimal return and low elo would be littered with people that just want to play carries simply because many would consistently be teamed with people that don't want to play other roles and consistently have less than ideal comps.\n\nThe core problem here for Riot as a BUSINESS is many people would probably just leave rather than adjust their play-style.  If you have 10 teams and 20 guys that want to play QB, some of them should try to be a WR or RB or they won't get a team rather than saying \"let's see how we do with 4 QBs\".  So the game has moved in a direction where non-dmg heavy champs have less influence because otherwise the small proportion of people that play those champions have out-sized influence.  This is not a problem with game design, but with player choices and expectations.\n\nThe \"META\" doesn't mean you literally CAN'T play anything else, it just means that X selections are the strongest choice.\n\nMore than the above (which I think is a huge problem and major factor) though, the biggest reason for the loss of \"strategy\" is the massive cuts that have been made to vision.  \"Strategy\" is the art of using INFORMATION to deploy your resources in the optimal manner.  Without vision you are missing a LOT of information.  But again, a lot of people (self included) didn't want to \"waste\" money on wards and/or didn't utilize vision well, so people that did had an enormous advantage, so it's been systematically reduced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boomer","date":"2019-11-15T08:55:13.772+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure you know what the word \"prodigy\" means.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-11-15T15:05:38.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"*Resists the urge to say Ok*","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2019-11-15T19:19:39.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're looking for protégé","replies":[{"poster":"Boomer","date":"2019-11-16T01:58:40.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or progeny.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boomer","date":"2019-11-16T02:26:39.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:33}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sleeping Bat","date":"2019-11-15T11:43:26.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Academy Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p7eaKpYb,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-14T20:02:39.630+0000)\n>\n> The reason why snowball games happen so much, is not because of damage, but because the winning team doesn't need strategy.\n>winning team doesn't need strategy.\n\nAnd this must show to us that strategy in lol still exist? {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-11-15T15:20:44.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The british with superior fire arms (and the gattling gun), were able to subdue and take over most tracts of land in Africa, because when you're a superior force, brute strength is fine enough.
