I salute you Rito.\n\nRiot did a great job with this event, I think. (Except for the damn quests, those were a pain in my fucking ass. Seriously, 5+ ARAM WINS, hundreds of CS, hundreds of kills, 6-10+ BMB wins, building the new items for no reason other than to complete the quest, and buying other Brawlers you don't want.) The story was engaging and dramatic and gave each character some personality (except MF, her backstory is really cliche in that it can literally be summed up like this: \"Hello, my name is Sarah Fortune. You killed my parents, prepare to die.) and making them seem more like people than just avatars of death on the Rift trying to kill each other for no reason.\n\nGraves is a thick-headed, hard-headed gunman with a bone to pick. He's a crack shot and not to be messed with.\nTwisted Fate is a slick-talking card shark with bounties on his head. He always has an ace up his sleeve when trouble stirs.\nGangplank is the cruel and tyrannous ruler of Bilgewater with enemies. He's intimidating, he's commanding, and he's a TOTAL BADASS.\n\nIf they can keep this string of stories and lore going into other characters, I can't really wait to read more about the world of Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-08-04T22:24:17.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HVGHighVelocity,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=hf5KgKc4,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-04T20:46:36.711+0000)\n>\n> Riot did a great job with this event, I think.

She's only cliche because they did her in third person.\n\nRemember, you can make ANYTHING sound bad when said in that way.\n\n\"Graves is so cliche. He's just a typical gun-slingin' badass who does what he once cause he's badass.\"\n\n...Actually, I think that can go for GP too.\n\nCan't say anything bad about Twisted Fate.
