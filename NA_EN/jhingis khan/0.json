But for whatever he reason, my GPU runs so hot that in 5-4 min interval it has framerate drops in games, and whenever a big teamfight happens. So I always try to limit my framerate so it doesn't overheat my computer. I set my cap at 60 fps but the game always runs at the maximum fps, and I have 140-160 fps most of the time, and it drops to 10-15 fps when the framerate drop occurs.\r\n\r\nThe framerate cap is not working as intended, is there any way to fix this?\r\n\r\nP.S. playing {{champion:53}} with sudden ping spike is not good","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T20:58:30.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The framerate limit should definitely cap your FPS, so it is fairly weird that it isn't doing that at all.  It may suggest some type of issue or corruption with your game.cfg file found on your installation which controls your in-game settings.  I'd recommend completely deleting this file which will force your in-game settings back to default, but it should let you toggle the Framerate option to have it work properly.  To do this:\n\n1. Make sure you are signed into League and are on the Client\n2. Open your installation of League:  C:/Riot Games --> League of Legends --> Config\n3. Find the files game.cfg and persistedsettings.json and delete them.\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing the same issue!","replies":[]}]}
