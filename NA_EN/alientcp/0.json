So in most of my games i get a decent advantage around lvl 8-12.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the problem lies, let me explain the worse case scenario here. I cant add too much pressure to second tower due to enemy jungler/mid keeping tabs on it and my team not following up. If i force it, will get ganked and lose the small advantage i have.\r\n\r\nThey have good stalling champs on mid/top, usually cant take the tower fast, but even if we manage to do so, we got stopped in next tower for a long time.\r\n\r\nDuring this time i lose a lot of farming time, and my advantage gets thinner every single minute the game goes on, resulting in very long and unfortunately about even games where the one who score an ace first wins. I want this to stop, i want to learn how can i snowball, to get further ahead and win games in under 30 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"OhBoyItsaMegaman","date":"2014-11-04T20:48:52.294+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> And this is where the problem lies, let me explain the worse case scenario here.

After towers begin to fall, you have to play the whole map. You really do not want to linger in bot pushing for the 2nd tower unless that's what makes sense. It will usually be better for you to push out that bot lane and then roam to mid and group up to take that down, or group for dragon. On the other hand, if you are stronger than the enemy bot (which you probably are if you took their tower first), you can freeze the incoming wave near your tower and deny it from them. This forces their bot to overextend and risk fighting you, or steal jungle farm, or roam to mid where your whole team can collapse on them.\n\nAbsolutely don't continue to push to 2nd tower and try to damage that with just your support for backup as if it's still the laning phase, unless your team is creating a ton of pressure in top and mid at the same time to ensure that the jungler is being drawn all over the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Alientcp","date":"2014-11-04T21:39:47.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha. Freezing lane, thats genius, never thought of it, aside when im losing. It does make a lot of sense, since they are behind in cs, they wont gain experience and since im not too far out of my own turret, might get the jungler out of position, then i might be able to push bot with my support, give time to my jungler to come along and then actually maybe assault their second tower backed up with a super minion wave, or either collapse on mid and get superior numbers since bot lane has to defend their tower.\n\nYeah, that might solve the problem. Will do it too see how it works. Thanks for the advice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-04T21:47:04.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"add my username stormysbigsword and i'll spectate a game or so.\n\nalso if you plan on freezing the lane, if their bot decides to group up mid, you should stop freezing, shove the lane as hard as you can, and then go mid. Your goal with cs is always to have more than the enemy/prevent them from cs, not as much \"most cs in the game\".\n\nOne thing I notice that I do that most people don't, is they B too fast. Even if I have no mana, if I have health, I look around for other sh*t I can take- if theres 5 people bot and you are alone top, it means you can free farm/take turrets, even if you only have 100 health. If the whole enemy team just went back, you can farm your own jungle before you back. Just because you have 2000 gold to spend, does not mean you have to spend it immediately if you can increase it just a little bit more. If you look at my stats, you'll see my average cs score is in the 200+ range, and its because I make more efficient use of my time by refraining to back at every chance I get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2014-11-06T03:24:22.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of pressuring their 2nd turret, you should rotate to either mid or top and take out those 1st tier outer turrets first. They're much easier to take down than a 2nd tier turret when u have to deal with constant pressure from the enemy jungler and mid lane. You can also rotate to dragon and take it with your allies as well. You have other options rather than to stay bot and not get that 2nd outer turret. The easiest way to snowball the game is through objectives. Take more objectives and your team gets so much global gold and extra experience. \n\nAlso, you might consider not taking out the enemy turret so quickly and *instead*, freeze the lane and deny the enemy ADC cs during laning phase. Thats the easiest way to snowball an advantage for yourself and denying the enemy bot lane at the same time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MattAkhavan","date":"2014-11-05T00:28:26.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After you take tower all you have to do it shove bot, and go mid.\n\nWhen you shove bot it forces their bot lane to either take the farm mid or defend bot. if the support comes to defend mid you should try to get a few hits on it and go back bottom to shove the wave out again and rotate mid again. rinse and repeat until you have all 3 outer towers and dragons etc. \n\nKey notes:\n\nIf AD comes mid to protect 4v4 then bot lane 2ndary turret takes damage. rinse and repeat and the tower will fall **AND** you are stronger than their ad to you will win a 4v4\nIf AD stays bottom you have pressure mid and can do some good damage before things get hairy\nif support and ad stay bottom free mid turret\nIf you are pushing the secondary tower you will likely die due to collapse, unless your team has so much pressure on their lanes that the jungler and mid cannot rotate bottom.  **you need some sick ward control of bottom enemy jungle**\n\nI do not reccomend freezing lane because\n1) big wave of minions do a ton of damage if you duel\n2) your team is 4v3 somewhere else on the map.\n\n\n**solo que players will always take farm if it's available.
