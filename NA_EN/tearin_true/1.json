Possible bug?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just now I was in champ select during the ban phase of the game I am having a conversation with my team and everything seems fine.  I get a message saying it is trying to connect me to the server.  When I get connected a short moment later I am back in queue waiting for a game because someone dodged.  After like 3 minutes waiting for a game I realize I cannot even exit the queue so I quit league and open it back up and when I try to start a new game I have a leave buster for 2 and a half minutes. ??????\r\n\r\nI know I cannot get LP back and stuff but reporting in case this is part of a larger bug thing.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T02:59:58.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks that you got hit with a low priority queue for a simple disconnect. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nLet's see if we can fix the underlying issue to try and stop that from happening again! This sounds like for some reason you network is having a hard time talking to the game server you were placed into. Go through our [**Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if we can spruce up that link between your network and the servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Tearin True","date":"2017-04-03T03:16:02.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks the the reply!\n\nYeah I have been through the troubleshooting.  I just bringing i up because I have never seen that behavior of being re queued after a disconnect in the past few years I have been playing so didn't know if it was an issue with the new client.  Sorry should have mentioned I am on new client.  \n\nAnyways seems like it was a momentary thing on my end.\n\nThanks again","replies":[]}]}]}
