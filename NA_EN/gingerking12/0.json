I don't remember when the last time Aatrox was complained about for actually being good let alone oppressive. \n\n\"Aatrox's entire kit resolves around outstatchecking which is literally one of the most unhealthiest game mechanics possible. There is no interaction against an aatrox. You have more stats or you don't. It's not the same with Yasuo.\"\n\nThe only 'good' feature about his kit is as you said Invisiblecat, a little sustain a revive and a decent steroid passive to help with the sustain. To actually think that this guy thinks Yasuo, is not a statcheck champion is fucking hilarious. He's not only a statcheck, he statchecks with insane cost efficiency AND you get the same \"no interaction\" with yasuo because he has an answer to EVERYTHING you do. With Aatrox his ONLY answer is sustain - if you lock him up he can't sustain, if you build executioners he sustains less, if you build randuins he sustains less, if you avoid him he sustain less. Let's look at Yasuo now, if you lock him up - oh wait you first actually have to catch his speedy arse and hope his windwall is on cooldown and that he doesn't have a minion wave. Er what about executioners? He doesn't even need sustain to statcheck your ass but even if he does build that bt along the way, exe won't mean much when he is hard critting you down. What about randuins? Randuins is definitely a good buy against him but if or rather when he lands his ult on you, prepare to spread your arse cheeks cause now he has armor pen.\n\nLike seriously, are we really comparing Yasuo to Aatrox and saying Yasuo is more healthier than Aatrox?

Well let's say we removed it - congrats you've actually made the most worthless Auto Attack champion in the game. He now has 0 defensive steroids and his niche for sustain is gone. He auto attacks for no real purpose and has health costs.\n\nNow If I asked you what was your most frustrating thing about Yasuo, what would it be? His Crit Passive? His Shield Passive? Even if we removed both he still has armor pen on his ult, a long ranged cc that he can hold to zone you off, good mobility and an auto attack reset - you might actually see bruiser yasuo become the real build if this were to occur. The fact that he has so many frustrating things about his kit and even if you removed 1 or 2 it wouldn't changed how annoying he is to fight against just flat out tells us that he has too much.\n\nNot saying nerf Yasuo but tell me his kit isn't overloaded.

In his current state however, he barely heals for all the much if you want to compare him to other sustain champions (WW, Xin, Irelia, Darius, etc).\n\n\"I think the objection to a strong Aatrox is that he relies on sustaining through your damage. That is fine, but he doesn't do it by landing skillshots or effectively juking damage.\"\nI don't know why you wrote this to be honest. All ADCS heal off point and click autos with increased efficiency for every damage + crit item they buy. Yasuo does the same but at a melee range + decent range from his q with immense steroids to bolster him up. Xin, WW and Irelia have their healing toggled on all the time and are decently tanky whereas Aatrox is the only champion who actually has to choose between doing damage and healing lol...\nThere is no champion in the game who is rewarded for sustain by \"landskill shots or effectively juking\" iirc.\n\n\"He does it by having more stats than you, turning his W to heal mode, and turning on auto-target while he walks to the kitchen and grabs some Pizza Rolls.\"\nAatrox because he is a health based champion with his only steroid being attack speed needs to invests in A LOT of stats to stat check you. \"Stat Checking\" the way you're referring to, seems to be having two champions sit side by side hitting each other until one person dies. Unfortunately this rarely at all happens in the game anymore and with damage being much greater than it was in the past, fights end in seconds. In this case, why would you pick a sustain dps champion when you could have just blown up your target with high amounts of burst damage? \n\nSpacedude, I think I get where you're coming from though. If Aatrox were to be buffed or made into a state where he is realistically \"strong\" and not \"decent\" he could become a problem. I just doubt thit will happen though because his kit simply lacks more than just numbers, he literally can't keep up with the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-01-26T01:33:52.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally the entire point of this thread is inquiring about Aatrox buffs.\n\nThe entire IDEA of this specific comment chain is \"Aatrox would be unhealthy for the game if buffed up\"\n\nThe VERY REASON everyone knows Aatrox cannot be allowed to be strong is because as you said, \"all he has in numbers.\"\n\nHe is a statcheck machine, and that is why he cannot be allowed to be strong.\n\n\nI think your issue here, is you are trying to tell me I am wrong, but then say I am wrong because my point is correct.","replies":[{"poster":"Slave Knight","date":"2017-01-26T02:03:21.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not even saying it's 100% necessary for Aatrox to even be buffed, I'm just saying it would be nice to be buffed.\nYou're telling me if he ever got buffed he would be broken but that's assuming they \"buff\" him purely through either giving him insane numbers or straight up adding things onto his kit which in a likely scenario, they will not do.\nIf anything, I'm sick of people actually saying what you're saying \"He is a statcheck machine, and that is why he cannot be allowed to be strong.\"\nThe hypocrisy behind this is he is no more stat check than what you would consider stat check. \nLike really, what stats does Aatrox \"check\" actually?

If he is even not ahead by enough then the enemy team will come back with their stats quickly and outscale him. He needs to be spoon fed like 5 kills with 100 draven adoration stacks for each of the kills to be better than his opponent or stronger. I have experienced it enough.

If you pop his passive, he is going to be on kill health and you can easily kill him again because he will have 0 passive attack speed and to charge it up he has to use more health in which he does not have to spend carelessly.

As bad as Aatrox is, he is supposed to be a sustained fighter but in order to build decent sustain, you have to build damage so your heal can be worth something. Building rageblade is essential in order for him to be at all relevant.\n\nNow? Warwick is better than Aatrox in quite literally, every way that it is laughable to compare the two. Lets just compare the two's sustain.\n\n> WARWICK\n> Warwick's basic attacks deal 10 - 44 (based on level) bonus magic damage on-hit.\n> While below 50% maximum health, Warwick's basic attacks also heal him for the same amount, with the healing tripled to 30 - 132 (based on level) while below 25% maximum health.\n\nSo in other words, below 50%, WW heals 10 - 44 flat per auto. Below 25%, the heal is tripled. That is per auto. Thats not even assuming if he has Rageblade which will double his healing potential. Thats not even including the immense damage AND heal from his Bite.\n\n> AATROX\n> BLOOD THIRST: Aatrox heals himself on-hit every 3rd auto. While Aatrox is below 50% maximum health, heal is tripled.\n> 「 HEAL: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 25% bonus AD) 」\n\nLets even assume Aatrox has 100 bonus AD and it's maxed rank. He heals for 115 below 50% EVERY 3RD AUTO. \n\nThis means that Warwick can outheal Aatrox immensely despite not building any damage. Aatrox is now literally useless. Xin is a better sustained fighter with the buff to his crit, and now Warwick. \n\nThey couldnt even bother to make Aatrox untargetable while in midair on his Q. Everything about him is counter productive.","replies":[{"poster":"Slave Knight","date":"2017-01-26T00:29:50.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick has always been out-healing Aatrox sadly, it's just back then Warwick didn't really feel like he had a completed kit whereas Aatrox whilst kind of mismatched together at least had 4 abilities.\nIt just seems in isolate cases where Aatrox is the only sustain champion in game and builds for his sustain that people see the need to \"keep him in check\". Realistically however, Aatrox's sustain mechanic is arguably a lot worse than other sustain mechanics (WW, Xin, Irelia) as they have can both damage and healing which in turn increases their healing. Aatrox on the other hand choosing only 1 or the other (Blood thirst for sustain and blood price for damage) has to forego his only means of inbuilt sustain for his only means of inbuilt damage enhancement. \n\nLooking at the ability:\nBLOOD THIRST: Aatrox heals himself on-hit every 3rd auto. While Aatrox is below 50% maximum health, heal is tripled.\n「 HEAL: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 25% bonus AD) 」\n\nPeople don't seem to understand that Blood Thirst, with that terrible AD ratio and pitiful base heal alongside the 3-hit gate makes it much harder to heal while in combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-01-26T12:51:49.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldnt go to the extent of saying pre rework out heals Aatrox as the heal boost is actually significant below 50%. From 25% bonus ad to 75%.  As to why its bonus and not just flat AD I have no clue in hell. I will however will not deny his lack of relevance due to the nature of his kit where Aatrox must build damage in order to see any significant impact from his heals whereas you have tanks who can dish out damage and be sustained IE Xin and Darius.\n\nI've been trying to desperately find ways to make Aatrox relevant with experimenting builds and runes but the end results always comes up short. Like I said, everything about Aatrox is counter productive. He cant initiate without being blown up. He cannot initiate and ult without being blown up. He cant build damage without being blown up. He cant build tank without being useless. He cannot attempt to knock up without CCing himself and can be interrupted.\n\nAnd I dont think people seem to get that either hence the reason why I mention Rageblade because without it, youre essentially screwing yourself and your team over. This extends to Xin too as I view Rageblade much more valuable than Trinity that people keep building onto him. \n\nThe thing is with Aatrox,  i think there is an easy way to fix him. Make him untargetable while in the air, and combine Blood Thirst/Price when Ult is active and remove the health cost for the bonus damage, and remove the active damage  from ult as compensation. I also was never a big fan of increasing his auto range as while you're autoing someone like Lucian at max range and he dashes away, that increased auto range actually gimps your abilities as their range doesnt increase in turn making you even easier to kite.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
