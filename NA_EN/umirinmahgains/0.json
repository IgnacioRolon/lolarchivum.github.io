I am beginning to doubt that all champions have an equal % chance of being selected. My reason for this is that I have played ~55 games of AR URF in the past 2 weeks. Counting rerolls and champ select, I&#039;ve had around 100 separate opportunities to roll champions. Yet I&#039;ve only played 20-25 unique champions. I have a champ pool of 90 or so. This seems a little weird to me. More weird is that not only do I not see much diversity in my own pool, but the people I play against are always the same 25-30 champs.\r\nI have specifically had Jhin come up 8 times, Kayle 6, Morgana 6 as well, counting only my own rolls. Getting 3 champs for 20 / 100 potential picks is odd when I have ~90 to choose from.\r\n\r\nThis is why I&#039;m starting to think it may not be equally random for all champs and may be weighted towards some. I do know that I may be playing with people who have aram / urf accounts and have limited champ pools, thus increasing the likelihood I see specific champs, but this doesn&#039;t explain why I&#039;m not rolling more of my own pool.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2017-03-03T21:39:15.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same as ARAM, if you lose too much you get champs you play a lot otherwise champion you don't play often.\nDon't know if champion on free rotation are weighetd more than the one you already own though.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-03-03T22:42:31.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[L4t3ncy's specifically said before](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3705892&page=4#post49448041) that ARAM is true random.
