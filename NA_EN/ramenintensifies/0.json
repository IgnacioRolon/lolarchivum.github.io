The game crashed and when I tried to reconnect it continually crashed. I then restarted the client and when I clicked Launch (still using the legacy client) it told me I had 'corrupted files' and underwent a patch or something of the sort. When I went back in to reconnect I found that my team had remade and I was given LeaverBuster. I don't think this is fair at all that we should be punished for something out of four control, such as clients crashing or internets disconnecting during the game, as LeaverBuster punishes all of these things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-12T05:46:55.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you see a bug splat error when the champion loading screen crashes, it could be due to outdated graphics drivers. Be sure that all your drivers are up to date. If that doesn't seem to be the issue, let's also go through each setup in our [Bug Splat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) to rule out any other possibilities.\n\nLet me know how this works for you!","replies":[]}]}
