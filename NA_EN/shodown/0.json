I have my two sons (19 &amp; 22) set up in my office on a lan.  I got into LOL to play with them and have really enjoyed the game.  My son noticed that i was at 999 wins and since he reads the forums mentioned that i may be able to play with a rioter for my 1000th.  We have a fourth person, one of my sons friends who lives down the street. Curse Voice would be an option.
