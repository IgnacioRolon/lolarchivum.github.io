I have used different computers( there are 2 in my office) and different hard drives.\r\n\r\nI am paid to be seen untill needed so i have a lot of free time and fill it with what ever will run with out admin.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T21:53:50.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue you're having does seem network related.  Regardless of different computers, are you using the same network or wifi?  On a side, while I don't think this may be a cause, running League off an external could cause problems.  It may cause your patcher to only temporarily install updates if at all.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"MrWoods","date":"2017-12-01T22:14:01.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been running league for a year or so like this. \nIts both on the same wired network and different versions of windows.\nIssue only arose after the last update.\n\nI was thinking possibly packet loss but i work for a college so its T1 internet so idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T22:19:27.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info here.  When you get a chance, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on some of these impacted games to give us a better overview.  Is there a possibility of some firewall protections while on this campus connection?

I would guess something with the networking has changed in the way the game connects to the match servers.\n\nContacted our I.T. to get it fixed hopefully.\n\nThanks for the help.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
