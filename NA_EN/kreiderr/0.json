Please wait or attempt to manually reconnect using the \"Reconnect\" button.\r\n\r\nI've tried connecting to a game so many times that the connection timeout to the server has put a 30 min timer on my account now thinking that ive failed to connect to a game.\r\n\r\nI've tried reading other forums for help mainly the IP helper in servies.\r\nEven downloaded the Hextech Repair tool. Tried re-installing the game from scratch.\r\nNothing happens. Same result.\r\n\r\nPlease help Riot. \r\nIt was never like this before. I was always able to play your game smoothly with no hiccups.\r\nAny help is much appreciated.\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-10T19:51:57.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A connection time out suggests that your network is being blocked from reaching the game servers, and staying connected if it does get through.
