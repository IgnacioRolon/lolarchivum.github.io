Also, if a player were to open an Orb of Order/Chaos and receive a random number of tokens along with the guaranteed legacy skin shard, is there a minimum and maximum amount of random tokens that can be acquired?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T02:48:16.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooo that's a good question! A number of tokens you get from orbs is random, and I'm actually not even sure what the maximum possible drop is. I can say I've personally seen 20 drop each time, although I've only opened 2 so far xD!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
