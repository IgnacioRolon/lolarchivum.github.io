However, when you choose the category \"Game and Features - Feedback\", it disables the \"Submit\" button at the bottom of the page and redirects you to the boards. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that the Client Discussion board is essentially dead. Players are constantly creating threads on that board but the most recent response from a Rioter on the Client Discussion board was over 9 months ago. Is there a more appropriate category that I can select when submitting my support ticket or do I _have_ to post my thread in the Client Discussion board?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T02:02:17.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yoooo NinjaGuy69, how ya been?\n\nYou're more than welcome to shoot feedback over our way in a ticket, but the best way to grab the devs attention is indeed posting over in [**Client Discussion**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) or [**Report a Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) depending on the context. If you send your feedback to Player Support in a ticket, there's no guarantee of it making its way to the dev team.\n\nWith that being said, what kind of ideas were you thinking of?","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-15T03:22:19.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> With that being said, what kind of ideas were you thinking of?\n\nI haven't been too bad. I hope you're doing well Broporo. \n\nI wanted to submit a small suggestion regarding champion select. Yesterday alone, 3 people banned Kayn when I was attempting to play him. I had him hovered as my Pick Intent but they still all banned him because they simply weren't paying attention. My suggestion is that I was wondering if the Client Team could add a dialogue pop-up into the client that informed a player that they were about to ban a teammate's Pick Intent and they would have to press \"Yes\" to confirm the ban (or \"No\" to pick another champion to ban). \n\nI think this could solve the issue of people accidentally banning a teammate's Pick Intent because they were distracted or simply weren't paying attention. Others have also suggested similar solutions to this issue as well. I know that the appropriate place to post this type of feedback is in the Client Discussion board but in all honesty...that board is more dead than the \"But Graves Still Can't Have His Cigar\" meme.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T04:10:07.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooooo okay first of all, I appreciate that sick Graves meme burn xP!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n\nMoving right along, that wouldn't necessarily be a terrible idea! I've seen it happen quite a lot myself. Sometimes it might be because the player really just doesn't the enemy team to pick that champion either, which can be a good thing, but it definitely doesn't feel good to have your main banned -_-'.\n\nI can understand your feelings about the Client Discussion board feeling dead. I can personally assure you that we do check up on those boards from time to time, and the Devs even take a look as well to see what players are wanting and how best we can accommodate. I get that you don't feel like you're being heard because we don't always respond on that board, but it always helps to get your voice out there. If you want to make triple sure we see your \"intent to pick\" change, go ahead and shoot us a ticket so that we have that on file to reference ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-15T04:25:04.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be more than happy to shoot a ticket over to player support, but which category would be the most appropriate in regard to this topic?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T04:31:29.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Choosing the top option \"I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games\" should suffice ^_^!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
