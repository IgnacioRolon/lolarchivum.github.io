I double and triple-checked that I was typing in my username and password correctly when trying to log back on. I also couldn't submit a ticket because it wouldn't let me log on to the support website. It stated that the \"combination of username/password and region doesn't exist\". This is the first time this has happened to me in almost 4 years of playing this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T02:39:18.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there again NinjaGuy69! \n\nI've got your account pulled up now and it looks like someone else might have been able to sneak their way onto your account.

I've been able to access my account again since posting this and I've already submitted a ticket detailing what I believe happened. I won't speak on it because I don't believe that you would want me doing that in a public space such as the boards. However, I was curious about one thing. On the login screen, can anyone change their username to another person's username and then click on the \"Forgot Password\" link in the bottom right-hand side of the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T04:11:25.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aaaare correct sir. If you click forgot username, you can essentially request that email for anyone's account. The email will only be sent to the verified email that they set up though.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-18T04:29:40.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You aaaare correct sir.

Is Riot not aware of the implications this has in regards to possible abuse cases?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T04:49:10.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't talk too much on this since it can give insight on how to cheat the system, but rest assured we have certain steps in place that help prevent people from just snatching up others accounts!
