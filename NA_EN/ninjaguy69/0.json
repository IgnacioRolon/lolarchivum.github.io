My assumption is that I was banning because I heard the sound effect for it but I couldn't do anything because, again, I had a black screen. Is there any way to remove, what I assume will count as an automatic loss from my account?\n\nEdit: I just tried playing my third ranked game in my promo series, and of course, everyone on my team fed and I lost my series. Plus, I highly doubt anyone from the Support Team will even have the  decency to reply to this thread and help make amends for the client bugs that are causing so much recent frustration among the player-base. Fucking massive waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Quill√≠on","date":"2017-02-25T20:35:32.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep same thing happened to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thamairenshort","date":"2017-02-25T06:51:17.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same. I was 1/1 in my promos to gold and the client started giving me black screens, forced queue dodge and I was removed from my qualifications.

Be sure to go over a custom match first just to be sure.  While we can't adjust game stats, I hope that can help.
