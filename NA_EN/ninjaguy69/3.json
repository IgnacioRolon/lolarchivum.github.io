I only received an A+ for that game and it was really disappointing - especially given the fact that our Soraka got an S even though I had a higher kill participation than her. \r\n\r\nhttp://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Confused-Jacksonville-Jaguars-fan-in-stands.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T03:22:45.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest misconception about champion mastery is that you just need to do certain things or get a certain amount of kills/etc to get an S. Mastery works slightly different than that however. Essentially, your mastery score is decided by looking at how you did with that champion in the role you played them as, and compares that to others who were playing the same champion in the same role. \n\nFor instance, if you play Annie Mid you will be scored slightly differently than if you were playing Annie Support because you would play her quite differently in those two lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-03T03:36:31.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Essentially, your mastery score is decided by looking at how you did with that champion in the role you played them as, and compares that to others who were playing the same champion in the same role. \n\nI'm aware of this already but I guess it must be a pretty rigidly tuned algorithm.

A lot of people think the most important stat is your KDA is a little skewed, but theres a lot more that goes into it than just that.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-03T04:20:49.842+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes sense.
