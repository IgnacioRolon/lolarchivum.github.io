I won an ARAM where Ornn was on the enemy team and I got credit for one of the new Ornn missions. The text clearly states \"Win 2 games with Ornn on your team\", however, he was on the enemy team. I'm not complaining - I'll take what I can get, but I just thought you should know.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-24T02:21:07.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been told that this is actually working as intended. The mission itself seems to be worded incorrectly, and should be updated soon to state \"Win 2 games as, with, or against Ornn\".","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-24T02:28:52.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the clarification Broporo. That makes a lot more sense considering all the other similar mission have been worded as \"play as, with or against....\" in the previous missions. Good to know!","replies":[]}]}]}
