The person playing Jinx wasn't toxic but Star Guardian Jinx is such a damn annoying skin. I thought you could mute a champion's laugh/joke/taunt(s) by muting the player but does this not mute their other emotes?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T01:28:10.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh yea I can understand where you're coming from, except for me it's Star Guardian Lux XD!\n\nMoving along, you can actually 'mute' those emotes and such by going into your in-game options and turning down/turning off **Voice Volume**.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-05-28T01:33:56.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ahhhhh yea I can understand where you&#x27;re coming from, except for me it&#x27;s Star Guardian Lux XD!\n> \n> Moving along, you can actually &#x27;mute&#x27; those emotes and such by going into your in-game options and turning down/turning off **Voice Volume**.\n\nHi Broporo. Just out of curiosity, would lowering the Voice Volume lower it for all champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T01:40:00.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will indeed lower it for all champions. I know it's not the best solution, but as far as I know, that will be the only way to not hear her tilting voice anymore lol.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-05-28T01:51:16.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It will indeed lower it for all champions.

Also, can you please pass it on to the Skins Team that it can get annoying if an already obnoxious champion like Jinx has too many global emotes that _everyone can hear_? Thanks for the assistance. You get a 10/10 on my feedback survey that Riot sends me on occasion.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T01:53:56.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll do my best to pass this suggestion along!
