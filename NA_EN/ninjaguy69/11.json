I already tried restarting my client to see if that would resolve the issue, but it didn't work.\n\nEdit: A fix I found to this issue is using the old \"Arcade Star\" icon that I believe you were able to buy for IP one or two seasons ago. I used that icon and played a game and earned progress towards the new missions. I hope that helps. It looks like this one:\n\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/skins-arcade-2016/en_US/f4c1e232ac42e2be734952e1a577f096f02b955b/assets/images/icon-power-up.jpg\n\nEdit #2: I believe Riot is manually distributing the icons now because I just got mine. They are aware of the problem and I hope it's resolved soon.
