I've finally ascended to the legendary meme tier of Honor Level 3. I'm aware that key fragments are replaced by Honor Capsules once you hit Honor Level 3. I believe that Honor Capsules also allow a player to bypass the limit of 12 key fragments per month. However, do the drop rates of Honor Capsules match the drop rates of key fragments? For example, if you earned 1 Honor Capsule already, does it get progressively harder to earn a second capsule? Also, is there a limit on how many Honor Capsules you can earn each month? Sorry if these questions have been asked already.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-05T18:06:54.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grats on your progress.  To clarify, though, key fragments **are not replaced **by honor capsules.  Capsules are_ in addition to_ the normal frequency of the 12 per 28~ day drop rate.  Capsules are totally random, though, and don't recall their being a limit on its drop rate.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-05T18:13:33.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I must have misread something due to skimming over the FAQ too quickly.
