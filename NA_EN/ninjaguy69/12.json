High honor players are probably not toxic hence how they likely achieved that honor level.  Also making honor levels visible to other players would likely decrease the amount of toxicity because players wouldnt want to been seen with a very low honor suggesting they may be toxic.  IMO visible honors will influence more players to be less toxic and work harder to be a good sports man and  earn that honor. It just seems weird to hide honor levels cause your worried about higher honor players flaming lower honor players, it almost defeats the purpose of the system as its suppose to reward sportsmanlike/non toxic players, so why would you be worried about these people flaming.  If they flame they put themselves at risk of getting reported at least if it happens in game.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Paramyrddin","date":"2017-07-13T21:10:44.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only there were more people with this level of logic in the world ...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hizenhawer","date":"2017-07-03T16:24:44.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=qmtAAbGs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-01T00:10:08.206+0000)\n>\n> For now, this is intended.

There is no (or almost no) flame with ranked level so i wouldn't expect it with something far less important as honor. And it's a nice thing to compete between friends. May be make it visible for clan members only? \nAnyway its up to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempting Tarsier","date":"2017-07-06T05:19:55.513+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or make it visible for friends at least.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tekoa","date":"2017-07-04T14:46:36.297+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"wouldn't it be better to not show an empty space in the profile then, when looking at another person's profile.
