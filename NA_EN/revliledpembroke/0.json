Long story short (and, uh, spoilers, but I think you&#039;d rather read the spoiler than watch V, to be honest), Spock&#039;s brother has made an army out of people who had been &quot;unburdened&quot; (if memory serves, he took away all of their pain) so he could take over a starship and fly it to God (who turns out to actually be the Devil... or something). \r\n\r\nI&#039;ll let you sit back and absorb that one for a bit. The line &quot;Why does God need a spaceship?&quot; is actually said with all seriousness. (This is why you avoid the odd numbered Star Trek movies. Except maybe III. Jumping from II to IV would be confusing.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, Spock&#039;s brother offers to do his &quot;unburdening&quot; thing to Captain Kirk, but Captain Kirk refuses because, well, pain is part of what makes us who we are. He doesn&#039;t want his pain taken away. HE NEEDS HIS PAIN! \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s an interesting philosophical point about what makes us, us. It&#039;s just about the only thing from that movie I care to remember.\r\n\r\nSo, what&#039;s the scoop, Riot? Did one of your writers remember that when drawing up Garen&#039;s short story? If so, can you draw from Wrath of Khan next time? \r\n\r\nGranted, you still took from one of the better moments in the odd numbered Star Treks, but, come on, Wrath of Khan or The Undiscovered Country would be so much better. I don&#039;t know how you could draw from The Voyage Home, but if you could find a way to make time traveling to rescue humpback whales into League, I will be very impressed.\r\n\r\nUnless the Harrowing is happening because there aren&#039;t any humpback whales on Runeterra. That would be stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"reverendanthony","date":"2017-10-25T20:52:18.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, shit. Now that you point it out...I guess, yeah, that monologue (which is literally the only part of Star Trek V I have seen) almost certainly influenced Garen's reaction to the hag.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-10-25T21:22:50.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too bad you couldn't find room for space whales.","replies":[{"poster":"revliledpembroke","date":"2017-10-25T22:32:01.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, you do already have the Space Dragon, so I guess a Space Whale isn't that much of stretch.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
