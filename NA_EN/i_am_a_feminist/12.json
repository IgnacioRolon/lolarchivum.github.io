Its always the point of my team doesn&#039;t peel, they chase kills, and then boom I&#039;m dead, or his poison never gets those 10 hp enemies who just manage to get away, or I stealth but the enemy team manages to get a hit on me before I go fully into stealth, and I don&#039;t outdamage other adc&#039;s in 1v1&#039;s. The only way I can get fed is if my supp is half decent and actually pokes/peels, but all you can expect from supps in my elo is people who don&#039;t speak english, grills, and people who leach exp and sit in the bush for the whole of laning.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I steered off track. Whats the point of twitch over vayne in a self peeling, independent environment? Or as an adc in whole?","replies":[]}
