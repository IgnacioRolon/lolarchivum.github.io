Yesterday I had a league marathon and she comes in yelling her throat out that I shouldn&#039;t be inside all day and she can&#039;t take it anymore, so I told her fine, tomorrow I&#039;ll be out again. Today I was out with friends for about 4-ish hours, but after coming home for 30 minutes, taking a dump and strolling GD, she does it again. &quot;I wish you wouldn&#039;t be out all day, you&#039;re addicted! I can&#039;t take watching you and your stupid TV all day, go read a book!&quot;. First of all, I was out since 4:30 and I got home at 9, literally 30 minutes have past. Second of all, I haven&#039;t even been playing video games since I got home. Yesterday she was complaining that I wasn&#039;t out as much and today she&#039;s complaining that I should be reading. Like goddamn, its summer! I shouldn&#039;t be reading all day long, right? \r\n\r\nDid my mom just like watch the movie Perfect Family and has begun morphing into Kathleen Turner or am I really obsessed with playing video games?","replies":[]}
