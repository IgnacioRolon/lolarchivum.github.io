Mods on PC can make it happen.\n\nYou probably played it a lot later than I did.\n\nThe game is probably reasonably patched out now, after almost a decade of community fixing that is which they just stole to be incorporated into the base game (and funny story, most of it is taken from Unofficial Skyrim Patch that was released almost as soon as the game was out, fixing THOUSANDS of bugs, updates every time Skytim gets a patch, and was all the work of like 1 or 2 guys; no prizes for guessing why Bethesda couldn't match that, especially since Fallout 76 bullshit).\n\nWhen I played, there wasn't even any expansion pack out yet so it was pretty early. And the game was buggy as sin. if anyone had developed a habit of over-saving the game between the year 2011 to 2017 and you asked them where and how they developed this habit, I can guarantee you 8 out of 10 would tell you something along the lines of \"well, I played Skyrim\".\n\nAlso, the modding tool is just the development kit. The devs at Bethesda were just too lazy to actually use it to develop the actual game so they release the actual development kit hoping players would forgive them for not actually doing their job of making the game, but somehow the fans just ate it up.\n\nThis isn't to say modding is a bad thing. But Skyrim wouldn't be the first and only game to release the development kit for the players to mod at their leisure; I mean, where do you think League even came about if not for the fact it was from DotA which was a custom map made on the Warcraft3 game using Blizzard's Map Editor (and yes, you can change just about most things about the game with it and a good use of other design techniques)? The catch is that other games usually are released far more complete than Skyrim when it comes to the base game so I guess people just defend that more because that's just about the biggest thing that's defensible about Skyrim, but hey.\n\nI've said this before and I've said it again. Mods should exist to make great games even better, it shouldn't exist to make trash games good; the players shouldn't pay the devs to do the job of actually making the base game for them, that's insane.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptainAntiHeroz","date":"2019-08-18T20:24:29.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=LNegJEoH,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-08-18T20:06:46.650+0000)\n>\n> Unless the DLCs changed it, I played the base game and hated it to my guts.

Imagine that.\n\nBy \"some MMOs\", you have to refer to the pedestrian ones? Because I'm sure even WoW's crafting system is more intuitive and more comprehensive than Skyrim's, where AT THE VERY LEAST, you don't become a master blacksmith by smithing out 2000 iron daggers which Skyrim's crafting system somehow allows. And remember, singleplayer games are SUPPOSED to have better crafting system than MMOs PERIOD, if ofc, they decide to include it in as a part of the feature. The fact you even stoop as low to compare Skyrim's crafting system with \"some MMOs\" is the kind of apologetic low you have to go just to justify an unfinished, buggy, and badly designed base game that's Skyrim.\n\n> But literally the Civil war itself is a huge decision that will impact a multitude of people and places on its own\n\nIt doesn't. All it changes is the outfit the generic soldiers wear at the cities (not even at the camps). And there is barely any change or progression after the civil war.\n\nGoing back to the previous example being brought up, Fallout. An actual impact of multitude would be something like in Fallout: New Vagas, a Fallout game Bethesda didn't make, where failing to disarm a bomb on the monorail meant the bomb goes off and disables the monorail permanently on that playthrough. Nothing of the sort happens in Skyrim, all consequences are tuned intentionally by the devs to keep to the absolute minimal and result in things as big as a regime change being merely an outfit change for the NPCs and quite literally nothing else.\n\nIs there new laws that are enacted that forbade the usage of the term \"By the Nine!\" if the Imperials were to win the war, given the Imperials do not acknowledge/recognise Talos? The answer is obviously no, even when it is as simple as adding a single 'if statement' to the game code that excludes the usage of the line from the quote rotation (no need for re-recording lines, all it needs is that those that do use the line is forced by law not to use it and so they were forced to shut up about their faith).\n\nRegime change also doesn't result in characters in position of power resigning due to ideological disagreement or executed due to previous affiliation reasons. Yeah sure, Solitude and Windhelm's leadership change as their leaders are both the faction's leaders so either of them die at the end of the war, but other than that, nothing really change even in Windhelm and in Solitude and the only differences are mostly superficial level; and outside of that, there is literally no change in any other hold, people of other settlements don't seem to even care about the regime change. They could've done anything to make the civil war more impactful, but they kept it at the absolute minimum either because of some misguided design logic, laziness, or a bit of both.\n\nThe same goes for the fact nothing you do is acknowledged in the game whatsoever barring an extreme handful of instances. You can kill a dragon in Whiterun, literally in the city as the citizens cower and the dragon flexing its flamethrower on the houses while perching on the palace and the heroic you showed up and defeat the dragon saving the day, and the assholes who've always been anal to you would still be an asshole regardless how many lives and their fat-ass you've saved them that day; or the guards would still treat you like a peasant even if you belt all over your body the literal dragon bones while brandishing a glowing majestic magical sword or if you are the literal thane of the very hold the guard is serving.\n\nAs far as the game is concerned, hardly any choice actually matters since almost nothing will actually change regardless of the size of the event and the decision. The lack of your impact to the game world as well as the absolute absence of any urgency or consequences/choice is indeed, one of the major criticism of the game that's even well covered by mainstream game reviewers. \n\n> Same with the companions and the events that happen in Dawnguard \n\nCompanions are nothing to write homes for since as far as the game is concerned they are just companion dogs that use voice lines and can carry stuff for you. And they don't do anything different from that.\n\nI also made it clear I only focused on the base game. Obviously expansions add to the game and they are kept at a higher quality than the base since the scale is smaller. That's common sense. Or are you so desperate to praise Skyrim the fact the DLC isn't as rubbish as the base game means it's worthy of praise?\n\nTons of shit games have good expansion/DLC, even Diablo3 has it after the shitshow that was the game's initial launch. It's not a high bar to clear and you shouldn't treat it as one.\n\n> And sure the companions are lacking at some times but modders have been steadily working on overhauling aspects like stagnant companions, enhancing enchanting, magic, crafting, perks\n\nThe modders shouldn't have done the developer's job.\n\nNothing changes the fact the things in the base game were hilariously unfinished, sometimes not even started, and the obsessive playerbase making the game on the behalf of the game dev doesn't change a single fact the base game was a piece of shit.\n\nModding should be making a great game even better, and not making a shit game good.\n\n> And even without those the game itself is more than competent on its own\n\nIt isn't.\n\nSay what you want about Oblivion, but at least Bethesda seemed they at least still grasped game development up until Oblivion before they took the forget-pill. Barring the hilarious speech system and the fucking Oblivion gates and a couple minor things like the somewhat aggressive weapon degradation system, now that's a good game that on its own stand with its two legs that only needed a slight nudge of the modders to make the game super great. \n\nThat is NOT the case with Skyrim. The base game was barren where the game world, the scenery, is almost as far as the devs ever got to do the game and the rest were barely started besides a few interest locations that you knew that actually went through development such as things like the Dwemer ruines and for some reason Markarth (which had a crazy amount of the game's best contents in it, despite being stationed at the map's corner and treated seemingly without much care as no quest barring like 1 in the end of the main quest actively made you visit that region unlike the other ones. Markarth is the most memorable hold that gets the least attention from the game itself), while the rest were obviously just cobbled together copy pasta contents like dungeons that probably each received about 3-4 hours in a map kit, the  yet another bandit hideouts (hilariously, the vast majority of Skyrim's population are either bandits or undeads; the former is reinforced by the fact normal citizens only ever exist in settlements and none of which exist or move outside of it, so we get 99.5% of the map space being occupied by hostile entities like a post-apocalyptic wasteland except Skyrim is supposed to be a land with civilisation and order. There is a reason why the Imperial City occupied such a large area on the map of Oblivion and most part of the overworld, excluding dungeons, is basically non-hostile because that's what actually makes sense). and broken RNG then dominates a good chunk of the things that would happen in the game due to the obscene amount of encounters being decided by them. \n\nFor fuck's sake, Whiterun, the hold that they clearly spent the most time working on next to Solitude, wasn't even finished and you see shit like that snobby self-proclaimed rich guy ended up living in someone else's home.\n\nSkyrim's base game did NOT stand on its own, it's quite literally in alpha if we strip away the graphical assets. Let's all be real.\n\nMaybe it was too ambitious and larger than Bethesda could've chewed back in 2011. Maybe. But it doesn't change the fact the base game was VERY unfinished. You could like it in spite of it, sure, but you couldn't just deny that fact.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-08-28T13:51:17.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game has a huge number of choices by default on how you approach stuff.

That character couldn't make past level 28 so long I don't go out of my way to do other things if I recall correctly. I eventually plateaued at level 30s after accidentally catching xp from doing other things and it was at that level that character beat Alduin. Granted, I didn't play on a hard difficulty due to the primitive combat system mentioned that I felt was nothing but a chore, especially if you're a melee character where on a higher difficulty you're just playing inventory sim and spamming potions, so why bother; so you can imagine how thrilled I was with the experience with being denied the fun both ways.\n\nEnemies in Skyrim are not only scaled, but also higher end enemies and items also spawn with respect to your level, so long we're not talking about a guaranteed drop like a specific quest reward like Dawnbreaker (which they have a tendency to, or at least used to, if I recall correctly, scale their base damage with your level so you're also punished with a shittier version of the weapon by attempting the quest at a lower level because reasons). It's not as extreme as it was in Oblivion where combat is basically equally hard regardless of how geared and how leveled you are since all mob's combat stats scale with your own, but in trying to fix that Bethesda simply turned it into another pit of problems by changing the stat scaling problem into a spawn scaling problem. The actual problem remains almost unchanged. \n\nIf anything, it made it worse because it now gates players off from even seeing late-game mobs (save for Alduin) should they choose to specialise their character's build path since now leveling is also directly tied to being as generalist as possible (unlike in Oblivion that at the very least you still get to see the late-game mobs, just that the whole leveling up process is pointless since there is little to no difference between trying to fight a daedra as level 1 and as level 50).\n\nThe enemy mobs stopping to scale at a mid-level or so is also a design flaw of the game. That's the exact complaint people had when they say you get overpowered too easily in Skyrim; not for the actual role-players, but it's way too easy to get overpowered for meta gamers who generalist everything as INTENDED by the game. Beyond a certain level and certain level of gearing, a single arrow could outright kill or almost down a high level dragon and almost everything dies in 1 hit.\n\nSo Skyrim is in a situation in which its leveling is dissatisfying to BOTH the role-players (who came in for the genre of the game) and the meta-gamers (who are attracted by the generalist focus of the game). It just means it's not particularly well designed.\n\n........\n\nAs an end-note, I shouldn't be forced to \"just because\" and do a bunch of other shit that my character wasn't supposed to do just to level up; if I wanted a mage character, I will create a damn mage character on another run, or is the concept of replayability and role-playing way too alien to Bethesda when they were making this \"\"\"RPG\"\"\" game and they automatically assumed everyone wants to play a character who wants to be the master of every craft, the thane of every hold, the leader of every guild, the champion of every daedra, and the most badass hero and the worst murderer of everything all at the same time? I should be free to actually role play my character in a RPG game and specialise my character reasonably without being severely punished by not even allowing me to level if I don't do everything in the game.\n","replies":[{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-08-29T07:14:41.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a patch they allowed to turn skills legendary.

The only time I've ever had trouble with Dragons past a certain point is with mods that increase difficulty. Also, who gives a crap if a courier dies? \n\nUnless they changed that with later patching which good riddance, but otherwise it's always been that the random encounters especially dragon spawn were obscenely disruptive to your gameplay. There were even spots where dragon spawns were all but guaranteed, such as Winterhold which for as far as I remember, visiting the place on foot already had a high chance of dragon spawn and if you decide to fast travel there it's quite literally guaranteed that the moment you finish fast traveling the first thing you'd hear is a dragon roar. Dragon spawn was also so much that it was very common that fighting a random encounter dragon turned into a fight of 2.\n\n* That's not mention that Bethesda seems to code the all the random encounter events sharing the same RNG parameter or something because it seems all the RNG events happen at once. That's why couriers seem to have an thing with finding you during an intense battle with the random encounter dragons.\n\nThe dragon spawn was so pervasively bad that I had to look up the way, in vanilla, to disable dragon spawn. And it turned out, if you've never visited the Greybeards, the dragon random encounter wouldn't even be turned on, as you briefly mentioned (it's also not a \"certain point\" in the main story, it's like the very first thing you're asked to do after visiting Whiterun, which in turn is the first thing you're told to do after tutorial. But then again, given how hilariously short the main quest is so I guess \"certain point\" is a technically appropriate description). And it's at that point that I simply give up ever visiting those old twigs up on the mountain for the remainder of my play time in Skyrim, and I've never felt better. I've beaten the main quest, very disappointly so at that, in my first play through anyway. \n\nIt's not that the dragons are hard, well they were before you get the gears and all. But annoying is what they are. They are the Skyrim's equivalent of the Cliff Racers or the Oblivion gates. I have no idea what is it in Bethesda's head that makes them feel it's essential to include something that haunt and frustrate the player in every modern ES game. And they just had to make dragons (which Skyrim's dragons aren't actually dragons, but wyverns) the annoying piece of shit that ruins your game experience, because that's such a good idea.\n\n.........\n\nRegarding combat elements, I've always maintained that the entirety of the combat system is supremely underdeveloped Skyrim; a theme running consistently through most aspects of Skyrim. It includes both weapon plays, stealth, magic, and shouts (where while technically finished, most shouts are boring and useless; and it'd been far better if they actually went with the original vision where you could mix and combine different shouts for special effects).\n\n.........\n\n> I prefer the systems of previous Elder Scroll games, to be honest.

It just doesn't care if you are, so casual players are more than likely going to become generalist if they play a single character long enough.\n\nIt kind of does, though. Any thing that requires the game to spawn enemy into the game at any level of randomness world first look at your character's levels.\n\nAnd here's the deal: In Skyrim, your leveling is intrinsically tied to doing things. And if you've completely maxed out let's say 2 perk trees that you only intend to specialise on your character. Congrats, that's your character's max level and you can't go further. When that happens, any monster and enemy type that's intended to spawn when your character is high enough level will not spawn in your specialised character's game. You won't be able to see them until you start doing other things and level other perk trees.\n\nIt's effectively a skill tree system that punishes the player for specialising, so much so the entire game's spawning system jumps in with it. It's as backward and counterintuitive of it as you can ever imagine.\n\n.........\n\nI also lament Skyrim's utter absence of any proper boundary-setting, for a lack of better words (I mean that as proper interactions, requirement and consequences, and trade-offs, of different things). As you said, you don't even need to cast a spell (I think you only need to cast spell like twice, I vaguely remember once at the door and once during class) to go through all the quest of the mage school and be the new archmage. That kind of issue I touched on in an earlier reply where I said Skyrim is wrong to allow and even encourage the player to be \"the master of every technique and ability imaginable, the guild master of every guild, and the thane of every hold, the champion of all the daedra featured in Skyrim\"; there is just no boundary for anything, in the game's quest to make it as generalist as possible and in doing so it melts into a bland soup.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-19T23:15:32.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainAntiHeroz,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=LNegJEoH,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2019-08-19T14:06:41.951+0000)\n>\n> You do know that not every game holds your hand right?
