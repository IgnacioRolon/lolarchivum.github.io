KAYN, VARUS, AATROX!\"\n\nAnd yes, the weapons are probably coincidence. Swords and Bows are INCREDIBLY common in a high fantasy setting. Drawing specific inferences from characters wielding swords or bows is like assuming that people who wear glasses are smarter than you are.\nScythes, also, are popular weapons in pop culture. People have an infatuation with the concept of the Grim Reaper, as well as the scythe he wields. It's a very common fascination, so it's not terribly unheard of that it would make it into a game like this. Having it also be tied to a demon of the soul and Kayn's battle for his own stems from this connection to the Grim Reaper.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-01-30T22:28:01.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, someone wielding sword, bow or scythe is common in fantasy when it's independent. But they share theme. They are Darkins, quite obviously looking like judo-christian demons, the three Darkins just happen to wield these weapons. We have Garen who is the fantasy sword-wielder archetype, Ashe who is the fantasy bow-wielder archetype.\n\nAlso, I love how Kayn in your version is supposed to be inspired by death when the horseman of apocalypse that wields scythe in depictions is literally death, called Death and said to be accompanied by Hades. From this very fact I sense you are the fedora-type who just hates the idea that someone gets inspired by Biblical myths.\n\nIt's the same thing as If Riot released a wolf/dog-like champion from Freljord who represents doom, is connected to the end of the world by devouring and If someone pointed out it sounds like Fenrir you'd be like \"I grow tired of people who are trying to apply Norse mythology everywhere\".  LOL.\n\nOr If people would be pointing to Ascended being connected to certain Egyptian gods. \"I grow tired of people who are trying to apply Egyptian mythology everywhere.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dread Nacht","date":"2018-01-30T21:39:38.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hoky shit!

From a lore perspective, it would look bad if Riot tried to make a Shuriman-Demacian-Noxian-Darkin-Vastayan-etc champion. When you combine so many different themes together it begins to look like you were just checking off a list of things to include just for the sake of including them. It degrades the lore and robs it of its immersive-ness for the readers.\n\nIt becomes more of a homage to league's different factions than an actual character. Amumu, Corki, Udyr, and Fiddlesticks each have very strong thematics. Having a character with 3 or more factions combined into them leaves no room for cohesive themes to be core to the character. I honestly think that those 4 champions would have stronger thematics than the one you are suggesting here.\n\n_Edit: Not saying I have a problem with your character overall, a transforming mage/support character that can hulk out sounds really cool, but I do not think it would be wise to tie their lore to so many factions._","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2018-01-31T01:51:43.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a super cool idea but I doubt we'll ever see something with that many conflicting personalities.
