I&#039;m now in the 20 minute checkpoint and never in my life have I even been here. I&#039;ve never been in Low Priority Queue until this year as a matter of a fact, I&#039;m not doing this on purpose either I&#039;m not trying to ruin anyone&#039;s games I literally cannot control this and I&#039;m being punished for it. There isn&#039;t a thing I can do. \r\n\r\n&quot;Just don&#039;t play ranked&quot; and I honestly never do because of this reason, but sometimes I can be playing norms or ARAM and the connection seems fine so I decide I can maybe sneak a ranked game in or something, but it&#039;s just my luck of the draw that my internet decided to just keel over and stop working, and every game I DC it&#039;s a remake. which I get I&#039;m wasting people&#039;s time and I&#039;M SO SORRY, but I want to play too, and they didn&#039;t lose any LP or anything(I lost 16 just now) so why do I get punished so badly. I DON&#039;T WANT TO DO THIS. I can&#039;t help it \r\n\r\n&quot;Get an Ethernet Cable&quot; I can&#039;t. I&#039;m just a college kid with out a job, and my parents can&#039;t be bothered to buy me one. I know it&#039;ll fix all my problems, but it&#039;s just isn&#039;t in my reach, I want to keep playing and hopefully be able to play ranked, but it just gets harder every time my internet decides to just stop working. I&#039;m not asking to repeal the whole punishment system, but I don&#039;t deserve this. I can&#039;t do anything to help myself if there was I would&#039;ve done it a long time ago. I honestly don&#039;t expect this to go anywhere, I just need a place to vent while I wait out these 20 minutes in ARAM queues. I honestly want to keep playing league. I&#039;ve been playing league since like Pre-Season 4, and I have never been in low priority queue I don&#039;t like how this feels. \r\n\r\nI close everything that can take up bandwidth, I turn my phone off wi-fi, I do everything I can to let my Laptop play league and sometimes it works I can get games in no problem, but other times odds aren&#039;t in my favor. If anyone can help I&#039;d love to take any suggestions, but for now ARAM is about to start queue so this is the End of my venting.\r\n\r\nSincerely, A kid who wants to play his favorite game","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-08-25T05:21:46.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I would say: \nyou are responsible for your end of the game, its not riots fault that you have bad internet.\n\nbut seriously, A ethernet cable costs less the 5$ in canada, I doubt it costs sky high in where you live.\n\nand sometimes it can't be helped, but Riot is punishing you for giving your teammates a bad experience, not calling you out for having bad internet.","replies":[{"poster":"Canøga","date":"2018-08-25T05:43:22.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I deserve the 20 minutes low priority, and -16 LP?\n\nEDIT: it's only ever been like a max of 5 minutes man (remake), like...you can't be feeling that bad.

So, if your queue, ban, pick, and loading takes around 6 minutes 6 seconds, then the time you lose from this is equal to the time you wasted.\n\nAnd you're wasting the time of people who did absolutely nothing to contribute to the loss of time.

It could be regular maintenance. I have a bad habit of always running into line maintenance during a league game, and only during a league game. I never ran into a maintenance during any other game. And the ISP doesn't give you any warning until they shutdown the service lines. *shuts internet down* \"Oh by the way customers, internet is out for maybe up to 2 hours\".

It's not the same time either, could be any time of day, without warning.\n\nWi-Fi can be really difficult to deal with, especially if you can't figure out how to configure it. But you need to learn how to work with it. It needs configured properly. For example, Too many signals on the same channel will cause drop outs if they are loaded enough. Adapter settings as well, I experimented with adapter settings. I have a decent router with beamforming. A couple games can not perform well with beamforming. One game I have would get poor latency performance if the supposed performance boosting setting was enabled. I'm not sure if League has that issue or not, I never bothered to test.\n\nIf you don't have access to your router settings, then you are shit out of luck. Too many things can interfere with a Wi-Fi signal. Also, Location location location. You can have a dead single one place, move your adapter or device 2cm to the west, and then magically have a godly signal.\n\nEasiest thing to do. channels 1, 6 and 11 are the magic channels. Choose the channel least saturated. 3 channels on 1? 5 channels on 6? 1 channel on 11? run channel 11. Then you can go in between if you feel like it. Again, least saturated signal range. 1-4, 5-7, 8-11 or something like that. Assuming you can access your router.\n\nI would need to put holes in places I don't want holes. So I self taught a basic idea of how to use Wi-Fi. I rarely have issues. Well, my USB adapter had some, took over a month to realize the connector plug wasn't making a strong contact causing disconnects. \n\nAaah, fun stuff.
