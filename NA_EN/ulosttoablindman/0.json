This is extremely tilting, and the fact that I tried to keep my tilt in check all I said were things that have never been a big deal before.  Like I wouldn't have said anything if they weren't calling me bad, but I'm supposed to say nothing? I got tag teamed and still I GOT punished, not them. the other game was the exact same, If I get called bad I'm not gonna type in chat a smiley face and say \"oh your right.\" Like IG i need a new rundown on the rules because thats ridiculous, I'M Toxic when I didn't even start anything, I just defended myself. I'm not gonna let people just tilt me for an entire game and spam ping me, for the ENTIRE game. And yes, mutes a thing but that's so annoying to say when OBVIOUSLY they didn't Mute me? I'd have no issue if they got punished, but where is it that I went wrong that they didn't.  And it's not like I flame a teammate for doing bad I really don't mind a player that does bad, but if a player doing bad tells me im bad I'm not gonna be happy.\n\n\nI @ Riot cause I want them to look in the entire game chatlog and TELL ME PERSONALLY, where I went wrong and how they didn't since we were doing the exact same thing. I'm going to be playing for 9 months to get honor level two so you might as well take 9 minutes to tell me exactly where  they were in the right, and i was in the wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-10T02:41:43.723+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Riot gives you a punishment via the IFS, they don't give one whit about what other people did.
