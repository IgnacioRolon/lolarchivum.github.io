There is no reason to call for reports, because one report has the same weight as nine reports, therefore you are the only one that needs to report someone for an infraction.  If your report is determined to be a legitimate report by the system then those that are reported will have appropriate action taken against them---in the case of AFK they may receive a low priority queue, in the case of toxicity then it depends on the nature of how toxic they were... they may receive no immediate punishment but could be flagged for possible future sanctions---or they could receive chat restrictions or bans depending upon where they stand currently.  \n\nSo, calling for reports serves no purpose other than to further intimidate or harass players.  If you believe someone is doing something that is reportable than you are the only one that needs to report them, period.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-07-14T17:31:18.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped reading at the title but clicked on it for the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicideAll","date":"2017-07-14T18:43:48.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a giant waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-07-14T18:46:12.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you insinuating that I'm being homicidal with my time?
