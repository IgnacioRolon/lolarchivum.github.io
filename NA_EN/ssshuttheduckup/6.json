Champions like{{champion:114}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:56}}  {{champion:254}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:5}} were missing, and I think all of them are aggressive and assassin-like enough to find a place there. Maybe the list goes on for even longer, if we include other bursty characters. IMO a game mode with 20 champions pool is gonna become pretty boring pretty fast. What makes me think it? URF. IMO it was maybe the best game mode ever created. Was, because of all the try-hards who picked the same and the same OP champions in every game made it so boring. I have no problem with players playing to win, however a champion pool so narrow will make all the games feel the same. Maybe it will be great for  3-4 games, but after that IMO it will start feeling pretty stale. I understand why the pool is restricted, as it is &quot;Assassin mode&quot;, however IMO there should be more &quot;pseudo-assassins&quot; included in the draft. Especially considering how already there are champions, who are not assassins in the mode. The list, taken from FF@20 is:\r\nAhri\r\nAkali\r\nCamille\r\nDiana\r\nEkko\r\nElise\r\nEvelynn\r\nFizz\r\nKassadin\r\nKatarina\r\nKennen\r\nKha&#039;Zix\r\nLeblanc\r\nLee Sin\r\nPantheon\r\nRengar\r\nShaco\r\nTalon\r\nYasuo\r\nZed \r\n\r\nIt is just my opinion. I might be absolutely wrong, however, I might be, at least to a certain level, right. The point is to raise a discussion. So, thanks in advance for joining or reading, and best of luck on the fields of justice!","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-25T21:44:53.911+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should let all champs in but all items with health and resists are disabled \n\ntime to unleash my assassin Darius","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-01-25T21:50:16.713+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:113}}       {{item:3089}} {{item:3041}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3020}}\nBring it on :)","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-25T23:13:42.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:122}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3158}} {{champion:122}}","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-01-25T23:29:16.114+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"No fair, I only use one Sejuani, and you use 2 Dariuses","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-01-26T06:23:04.957+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darii is the correct plural form","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-01-26T08:03:55.734+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, not a native speaker here, so I agree","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Soireal","date":"2017-01-26T08:08:24.973+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3115}} {{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-01-25T22:06:59.213+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait yeah why aren't nocturne and yi allowed. wtf","replies":[{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2017-01-25T23:53:37.067+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"So its confirmed {{champion:11}} is neither an assassin or diver, the only champion without role ?","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2017-01-26T02:21:48.052+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's a skirmisher.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-01-25T22:43:44.753+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because RITO logic","replies":[{"poster":"SteelMankind","date":"2017-01-26T00:51:55.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First and foremost, several champions are colloquially called assassins, despite not fitting in to the modern definition.
