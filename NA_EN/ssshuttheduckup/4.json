Looking forward to new S6 update. I love new marksman change, it would be healthy, IMO, but i have a question. With all the upcoming changes both on AP and AD itemization - what will happen to one specific group of champions - low mobile AP casters - {{champion:143}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:63}} , etc. I mean - all of them kinda struggle against high-mobile, high burst AD midlaners like {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} . What i am afraid is that they would go completely out of the META, cause at the same time they are nerfed, while all of their natural counters are buffed. And i do not want it, cause they seem to be must fair champions, IMO. I mean - sure they have high dmg, but they are either combo-reliant, or need to land a skill-shot in order to be effective, so they offer a lot of counterplay. For me they are also fun to play, and i know i am not the only one. So my question is - would they remain relevant and worth-playing? Cause the opposite would be sad.\n\nThank you for your time reading that, and thank you again for your time answering.

The season 6 changes are going to make it even harder to succeed with these champions unfortunately, with everything getting more expensive and counters being buffed. Cass was in a bad state pre-rework, the rework made her worse, she got some compensatory buffs enabling her in pro-play and then she got nerfed back down again. Syndra got nerfed after she was played a lot in Season 4 worlds and now her early laning is garbage and her scaling is pretty bad. Zyra mid has been going from bad to worse ever since mid Season 3 where she was nerfed into support, the plant AI 'buff' she had a few months back was a joke. I really hope these guys get something soon, going into Season 6.\n\nI totally agree that playing against basically any AD mid now {{champion:238}}{{champion:91}}{{champion:157}}{{champion:41}} is going to be awful. Depending on how good the marksman changes are, we might even see things like Quinn Mid becoming popular.\n\nIt's all conjecture right now, but I agree with you that things aren't looking good for our beloved mages. :/","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2015-11-08T16:31:41.766+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"We had League of assassins, league of tanks, now we will have League of AD.

Tanks are not only necessary due to their tankyness. You also need the CC, peeling, and initiation power, which are other reasons to use tanks, and few other champions are capable of providing all this, and even then, the tankyness of tanks make them the best at this job","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-11-08T17:02:46.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that bad that Skarner is unpopular now.

Syndra's mid game is very respectable but by late-game she feels slightly underwhelming and it's harder to safely get a pick with a QE combo.\n\nMy main point is that she was left in a poor state by Riot and they've left her like this for a long time. She lost early Q damage and stun reliability in addition to DFG being removed. She is supposed to be a lane bully burst mage scaling well into the mid-game, but right now it's very easy to fall behind before you can reach your power spikes, this isn't likely to improve with the season 6 changes.

On the PBE. Just so you're aware. Unless someone on the enemy team disconnects or the enemy team is 5 squishies as well, a 5 AD team comp will lose. A LOT.\n\nThe easiest way to see this is to look at the capability to teamfight for most AD champs. Name for me 1 AoE CC non-ultimate ability that an ADC has. Now name good teamfight ultimates. We've got Collateral Damage, Bullet Time, and Varus ult, basically.\n\nNow look at the capability to teamfight for most AP champs. Mages, specifically, generally have at least 1 form of non-ultimate CC (AoE or otherwise), and their ultimate is either an additional CC (Lissandra) or a big damage ultimate (Brand). \n\nNow you compare the most important part - what do ADCs have to do to deal damage in teamfights, since their abilities don't lend to it as well as mages? That's right, they have to AA. Which means they have to stand in attack range of the enemy team to deal damage to you, and they have to do it for an extended period of time. Meaning that most ADCs are still going to lose a 1v1 to a Mage, and that having 5 ADCs vs a balanced team (fighter top, mage mid, adc support bot, with whatever jungler) will result in the balanced team having much better teamfight pressure in 90% of scenarios. Winning teamfights wins you objective control and vision control.\n\nIt's actually SUPER dangerous to play super squishy comps like this right now too, due to the vision changes. A 5AD comp loses in the early game, when the enemy team just has safer lanes and better gank potential due to their non-reliance on autoattacks.\n\nAnd this is JUST comparing ADCs to AP mages. When you start looking at 5 AD comps (even including an assassin) vs teams with a tank jungler and support, it gets scary. Sure, you can itemize into armor pen, but now LW only effects bonus armor, making it less effective early game (and, also, making early armor a more viable choice to counter the LW rush). People talk about the Giant Slayer item as well, without realizing that this item literally just makes up for the AD nerfs across the board on ADC items, allowing them to opt back into that damage if they don't need grievous wounds in the lategame.\n\ntl;dr: Play the patch first, because your assessment is pretty flawed at the moment. source: I've been playing on PBE every day since the preseason dropped","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2015-11-08T21:52:55.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your long answer.

The problem is her whole kit relies on her landing her e. If you don't land you e, you can't keep them in your ult. If you can't keep them in your ult, they will run out of plant range. She is probably the only mage in the game an adc can straight up duel throughout the entire game because of how easy it is to dodge her abilities as long as you avoid her e.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Hammerlock","date":"2015-11-09T13:55:21.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think riot for the time being should just increase the base armour of some poke mages to compensate for zhonyas(like by 1 armour like literally 1 base armour)","replies":[]},{"poster":"procrastinasian","date":"2015-11-08T21:57:36.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just kind of annoying that you aren't allowed to pick one role into another.

I mean, it's great that they're immobile but when they're squishy as hell and skillshot reliant, most of their power is lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaipop","date":"2015-11-09T00:39:16.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zyra with a defensive summoner and syndra can do perfectly fine vs zed, talon is definitely tough though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaipop","date":"2015-11-09T00:38:15.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All 3 of those champions can control lane and not die in lane then just buy Zhonyas before they get killed.
