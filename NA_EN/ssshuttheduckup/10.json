A silver scrub here.\n\nI love playing Quinn. I've read some guides about her and i have a question:\n\nWhich spell do you max second: her E or her W? And, if possible, please explain why. In all of the guides i see people maxing E first, but i just got the feeling that maxing W is stronger, cause of the higher MS/AS, which make kiting easier (and yes, kiting exists in Silver).\n\nWould love some good players to explain what is the logics behind maxing E prior to W.\n\nSorry if the question is stupid.\n\nThank you for your time reading and aswering","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-30T16:19:19.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/d83a9dae17234de080d6d2fedc2ceb8b.png\nOnly as adc tho..
