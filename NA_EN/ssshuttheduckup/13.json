They think that since he's 'annoying' they should never learn how to play against him.\n\nI used to give those same exact tips myself, even though I do not play Yasuo/know Yasuo well. I just figured it out from playing against him. As Lux, I auto to proc his shield, and only unload skills when I land my binding. However now I've stopped telling people how to play against Yasuo because I'm just going to be downvoted/whined at by people.\n\nIt's pretty disappointing... {{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-11-17T18:48:06.890+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of which you're at -1.\n\nSadly I can't vote, because some genius decided you need level 30 to do so.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2017-11-17T10:22:33.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo 20% banrate in diamond elo. \nDamn those fuckin silvers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ninjaroxas","date":"2017-11-17T12:32:38.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people don't have trouble with him they just find him annoying and unfun to play agaisnt.
