I frequently play ranked as 2-4 man premade, and if the game isn&#x27;t going well because of my friends, I&#x27;ll tell them. To be honest, I think banter like that is really fun when playing with friends. I think you just get the impression that premades only flame solos because (in most cases) they won&#x27;t use the chat to &quot;flame&quot; their premades, but will use it to flame the solo players.\n\nI started playing ranked to avoid premade groups around Season 2/3.  League was magically a much healthier place.\n\nIt doesn't take a very big leap of imagination to understand why and how premades are abusive.  \n\nI see it all the time, both directed against me and against another solo on the team in the case of 3x premades where I am outperforming.\n\nWhen you need someone to blame, you are going to look outside your group of friends. That shouldn't be hard to understand.  It's also not difficult to understand that quite a lot of people get upset when they lose, regardless of the reasons for it, and like to direct that anger and frustration onto another person.\n\nThe solo player is basically at the mercy of the premade. They technically aren't allowed to quit the game, and would have to mute the entire team to avoid the trash talking and even then, they have to stress about the premade soliciting reports and opinions from other players and whether or not it will get them in trouble.\n\nIt's not fun. I don't want to mute my entire team just to be able to survive a 30-50 minute game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KeepAmericaGreat","date":"2016-05-15T20:55:10.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The worst is when you're solo and your whole team is solo too.\n\nThen after the game you realize over half their team is pre-made...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-05-14T17:55:02.942+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"Concur.\n\nTrue Solo Queue please.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperatricis","date":"2016-05-14T21:29:52.789+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"at this point i don't even care what game mode, ranked or unranked, I just want something that can allow solos to compete against solos.\n\nThe ironic thing is, everything that is catered towards premades NEEDS solo players to work, and yet those exact solos are fucked the hardest","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2016-05-14T17:58:33.717+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"True Solo Queue is what a lot of people want","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lolptwo","date":"2016-05-14T22:50:38.395+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"True Solo Q would make me comeback to League I won't even deny it.
