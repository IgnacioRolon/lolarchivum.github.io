Sorry for repeating the same topic again. I will try my best not to be just another Yasuo-hater, who complains about him in this boards.\n\nIt would be hard, because i actually am Yasuo-hater, but the reason is not him being strong. I just hate the fact that when i am not playing him i am forced to listen to his VO. You know - \"hasagi\", \"aseryo\", \"taste the wind\".  Kinda annoying for me.\n\nBut let&#039;s be serious. Looking at his stats in EUW for last 7 days he stands on 49.62% winrate. That&#039;s just under 50%, which is actually the spot there he must be. But looking a different statistics - he is most-banned champion, standing on 64.92% banrate. And like 100 posts, complaining about him\n\nIn the meantime Brand stands on 55.69% winrate, but only with 5.28% banrate. And no topics, complaining about him\n\nI think the reason is simple. His kit is overloaded. Not saying overpowered. But overloaded. Infinite dashes, windwall, free crit and pretty big shield. Sure, his crit dmg is lowered, Windwall has a big cooldown and that is what makes him beatable. But the problem is that he feels unfair to play against. I am not talking about myself. Being a silver scrub i play versus silver scrub Yasuos, and have reasonable success versus them. \n\nAnd that is what all of this salt is all about. People do not complain about Brand, because he feels fair. If he beats me, i have the feeling he was a better player. If i beat him - i feel like it was because i was better than him - landing and avoiding skillshots and so on. But when it comes down to Yasuo - when i play immobilie mage and he rekts me - i have the feeling that i could do nothing to stop him. I know, that&#039;s not true, but that&#039;s the way it feels\n\nSo, that&#039;s my point. If you do not agree - do not be too harsh, i am just a silver scrub. What i hope is to have an honest discussion about him. Because what i read here - it is  a bunch of people explaining how OP he is versus yasuo mains explaining that he is not. \n\nThank you for taking time to read and answer, and wish you all a good day.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-11-25T22:00:55.932+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Many champions may be balanced, but ye _Gods_ they're obnoxious\nI've rated them here\n_REST IN SPHAGETTI TIER_\n{{champion:157}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:67}} \n_I HATE YOUR GUTS TIER_\n{{champion:107}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:39}} \n_I WILL TOLERATE IT BUT I CAN'T HELP UNCONCIOUSLY JUDGING YOU TIER_\n{{champion:64}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:35}} \n_OK TIER_\n{{champion:33}} \n\n\nYasuo's definitely VERY near the top, and it probably has something to do with how saturated with damage this game is right now.

That would change a few things in a significant way: As a self reliant fighter, he would have to build a bit beefier so that he could use his E>Q combo to set up his own ults without just being a squishy throwing himself to his death, and if he wanted to build more damage heavy, he wouldn't spike so hard or so early off of a couple overly synergistic items and would be much more reliant on actually being able to land his long range Q to get into a fight.\n\nWhen Yasuo first released, the original intent behind his kit was that he could build a small amount of crit and then beef up, allowing him to play as a light weight fighter with strong initiation. That play style actually worked really well. His shield was good, his kit was well rounded. Then the pros realized he could get 100% crit off of 2 items and the all out damage builds became the norm, and as a result his fighter attributes were kicked to the curb. Yasuo should be rough and tumble, like a ronin on the run, not the glass cannon melee DPS/assassin he is right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excitidly Insane","date":"2015-11-25T21:59:25.959+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"He doesn't have infinite dashes, spamming your E in a minion wave is a very bad thing, very bad.

If you stagger yourself properly to the _side_, you can last hit without Yasuo playing connect the dots to get to you.\n\nFurthermore, given how easy it is for Yasuo to hit multiple targets with his Q, he only gets to freeze the lane in his favor if you messed up your wave control somehow via, for example, firing a wave clear skill when the lane was even.

Still, that's hardly any different from the difficulties faced by melee-range top laners who have to get close to Darius or who get kited by Gnar. Some champions will simply excel against others in their given lanes.\n\nAlso, if you let Yasuo freeze the lane close to his turret, you've probably done something wrong by pushing, because if Yasuo can't get kills, then he wants to farm, and nothing is better than safe farm. Alternatively, you're playing Malzahar and everything you do pushes.
