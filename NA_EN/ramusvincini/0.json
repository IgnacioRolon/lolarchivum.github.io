Could there be an option to toggle in order to open the shop from the map?  I always use the \"Open to Buy\" Keyboard key \"P\" anyways  I end up screwing up a lot of fights because I open up shop, mid nexus defense.","replies":[{"poster":"Jumanna","date":"2019-06-12T11:46:02.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has anyone found a way to disable it ?

If anyone runs into it they probably brush it off.
