You are only held accountable for what you did, and they are held accountable for what they did. Basically, don't say anything if you aren't saying something productive or nice, leave stuff like \"these guys are cheating\" for the report text box.\n\nAlso, typically it is done by an automated system, although manual reviews do occur.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-10-02T16:49:32.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess mentioning the fact that there is no legal system in the world which isolates and passes judgements on behavior in this manner. i.e. minus any sort of context.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-02T17:15:32.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Troll Armada,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lbmUYKnr,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-02T16:49:32.848+0000)\n>\n> I guess mentioning the fact that there is no legal system in the world which isolates and passes judgements on behavior in this manner. i.e. minus any sort of context.\n\nThings that you can get banned for in this game are not acceptable in any context.

In this context, what you are doing is against the terms of service and punishable. You say that normal people are going to crack from time to time, but most people don't get punished and if that is all it takes to get banned then normal people don't do that.\n\nAnd, again, it does not matter how many people report you in a game, it only counts as being reported in one game. 20 reports in 5 games? That is 5 games you were reported in, not 20 reports against you.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-10-02T17:49:27.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Again that's absurd and doesn't even remotely take into account the nature of low elo matches, in which the troll/botter/boughtaccounts/streamertrolls/scripters literally outnumber nornal players.\n\nCheat scripts posts various \"strategic\" and \"positive/happy\" messages in game, whcih riot never notices HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING ACTUALLY OCCURING IN THE GAME.\n\nWe can safely assume that especially in low elo, valid reports are often treated as invalid reports due to riot support staff/absurdly simplistic algorithms inability to identify real trolling.\n\nI report almost every game in low elo, and my reports are probably worthless, even thought I'm filing valid reports, system probably sees them as invalid, because it can't ascertain nuance.\n\nPeople are naturally reacting to toxicity both obvious and passive aggressive in a human manner. Most people have no knowledge of the many ways trolls abuse the system. For example bots which are programmed to DO NOTHING other than run to real player and take all CS / and KS and then run back to doing nothing. This is percieved by riot as 'bad game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-02T18:17:49.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you thought that maybe the reason that all of the botters, bought accounts, trolls, and scripters are in low elo is because they are getting banned before they get very far?\n\nThere are people posting on these forums all the time saying that they got banned for all of that stuff. Less so trolls and bought accounts, because they know what they did and can't try to defend it. They still show up though. Your reports are helping, you just don't feel the impact of them because nothing is happening to you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
