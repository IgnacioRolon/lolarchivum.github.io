Usually I can turn my pc back on and reconnect and not have the issue but It crashed twice in the same game and now I left my team with a loss, going into my 10th low priority queue since this started.. I tried downloading DOTA today and it happened with that as well! No other games do this to my computer. And ill play xenoverse black ops 3 Dark Souls 3, South park and a lot of other games...... so what should I do? I don't want to quit because ive put a lot of money into LoL but its not worth me buying a new computer completely, please help, I'm sick of low priorities. I changed the fan and it stopped for a while but the fan just stopped working altogether again so I opened up the side of my tower and put a fan to the side of it and made sure it would be a lot colder.
