Then I was unable to log in. So I reinstalled the game and it still wouldn't let me log in. After typing in my password and username and entering, it takes about 10 minutes before it says \"Error: Cannot connect to PvP.net.\" It has been three days since and I have tried every possible way of fixing it and i still cannot log in. I have now reinstalled 6 times. It is driving me crazy that I cannot find a solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nFor everyone who is gonna say \"get a real laptop and throw the Mac\", I know, I hate Mac too but my other pc broke and I am using a hand me down until I can afford to buy a new pc.\r\n\r\nPlease help, desperate for solutions. Also, I am now using OS Sierra, 10.12.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T03:43:05.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues connecting to PvP.net are an indication that your computer cannot properly reach our servers.
