So im curious is there any ways to help bring the ping down to something reasonable? perhaps some settings on the computer? or something you download that helps ping? Would be cool to get some help and suggestions.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-20T00:41:42.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're playing from the NA region, your routing to EUW is generally going to be pretty high.
