The 20 minute wait period is terrible. Overall its a hundred 100 minutes that you have to spend just sitting there waiting to get a 20 minute game. Also another thing is that when it actually allows me to get into a match, I sometimes miss that three second period and then I have to wait a full another 20 minutes. I am suggesting you somewhat change this so that people that barely miss the que can still have a chance to get in without having to wait another 20 minutes for the game. I am just sharing my thoughts on why this should be changed and the leaver buster system should honestly be re-done completely because honestly it is_ not fair at all. _","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-12T00:29:16.273+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely get your frustration.  The LeaverBuster system works on a type of tier level.  If you have no history of leaving games, then you will not face a penalty if a random act of god happens.  However, if you continue to leave games, then you start to gain Leaver Levels.  Once you get high enough at a leaver level, even 1 single leave will trigger penalties.  Leaver Levels decay over time, so if you don't DC at all for X amount of time, you will drop a leaver level, and another, until you eventually reset back down to zero.  For the time being however, it seems that your Leaver Level is so high that even a single leave triggers penalties :(\n\nI hope this makes sense!
