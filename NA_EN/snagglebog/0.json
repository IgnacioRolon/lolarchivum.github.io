It makes the game unplayable. Most the time the games will start out at their regular ping (131) but by the first 10 minutes it increases to like 270 or so and makes the game a laggy mess. It stays a consistent 270 and doesnt drop and we've never had an issue until 8.1 came out. Any idea what we could do to fix this or what is causing the ping to increase?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T03:01:42.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without diving too deep, it's likely he's having ping issues simply from ISP routing his connection in odd ways. It'd be smart to go ahead and have them run through the usual basic troubleshooting like [**updating his DNS**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5) and switching to a wired connection. \n\nIt'll be hard to troubleshoot without information directly from them to see what's going on.
