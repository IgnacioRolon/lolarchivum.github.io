I don&#039;t believe I deserve the punishment that was given to me. I honestly make mistakes I am human but this is going to far. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the chat from the game below. Only one game chat log was provided. Also I was banned for 14 days but it was removed by a Riot employee since they did not believe the punishment was deserved. So from this chat it escalated me to a perma ban apparently. Riot support was no help and refused to help giving blanket statements about closing the ticket and sorry.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think after reading this chat log. I admit I am not the best chatter in league but I am definitely not the worst .006%. I feel I am the victim of multiple issues with Riots report system and that something of this magnitude should not remove a player completely from their account. Time and money aside that is my identity in the game and I feel like it was stolen by an imperfect system that doesn&#039;t look at all the variables. \r\n\r\nFor instance I even apologized for my actions in that chat. Is that not what someone that realized they made a mistake would do? I would just like someone to review the case and look at the missing pieces... are we not suppose to say anything when a player is running it down or refusing to assist the team? I am sure we all get heated when someone is refusing to help in a 5v5. I asked support for a little forgiveness seeing that this is not the worst chat in league it is actually pretty normal in most games I play(not from me) and I don&#039;t report it because it is a game and I have a mute button if I don&#039;t want to see it.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nMacanica: lol mid and top gives me support\r\nMacanica: anyone want to switch and let me carry?\r\nMacanica: nah\r\nIn-Game\r\nMacanica: sorry tech issues\r\nMacanica: got him\r\nMacanica: what you doing man?\r\nMacanica: draven is def a bronze\r\nMacanica: nah carrying bot\r\nMacanica: draven doesnt know how to spin axews\r\nMacanica: not the point\r\nMacanica: he doesnt know that champion\r\nMacanica: nah\r\nMacanica: cool you already are\r\nMacanica: cool bronze man\r\nMacanica: nah dude bronze 100% players\r\nMacanica: why are you a bad adC?\r\nMacanica: am i ?\r\nMacanica: I am silver and and I am not complete trash\r\nMacanica: i mean everyone but you can play\r\nMacanica: 1/3/6\r\nMacanica: lowest cs\r\nMacanica: draven dude you find the map to anything yet?\r\nMacanica: i mean you just earned a report so its whatever\r\nMacanica: im sure everyone else feels the same\r\nMacanica: yeah you bad\r\nMacanica: confirmed\r\nMacanica: just report the noob\r\nMacanica: when he gets banned and get deranked to bronze he will learn\r\nMacanica: cool then get to making boy\r\nMacanica: draven is just salty\r\nMacanica: draven 1/7 best adc\r\nMacanica: na\r\nMacanica: get a kill and ill be quie\r\nMacanica: omg soooo bad!\r\nMacanica: what you doing stopping!\r\nMacanica: Even when I give you kills you cant do it!\r\nMacanica: you sir deserve bronze forever\r\nMacanica: you are talentless\r\nMacanica: you must have just learned to paly\r\nMacanica: dont worry bout that guy he will figure it out soon.

Sorry for the report.\n\nHey everything happens for a reason. I needed a break and this is why. Currently there is to much trolling and lax players in ranked which lead good people to be toxic. When you are honestly trying to climb and you have nothing but bad games with bad players(AFK, trolling, feeders) it gets hard to stay positive. I make mistakes and I am willing to accept the consequences. I still don't agree with Riot that chat is something that should remove a player 100% from a game but I don't get to make those calls. \n\nMaybe a permanent chat disable following a 90 day to 1 year re-eval? If player shows no negative behavior from having chat removed after so long then in my opinion  that shows reform. How will you know someone has reformed if you don't give them the chance? Also this game isn't about chat and is a consistent issue so why not allow the option to turn it off before a game begins without having to type /mute all? \n\nI am not saying being toxic is ok but I think a lot of players have been negatively judged by their piers. For instance @KFCeytron it seems some people will just jump at these posts to tear others down that are already down and act like they have never done anything wrong. Justifying why you are posting \"I really hope you don't make a new account, because your attitude and behavior are not desired here.\" is something that would also not be desired in chat since it is not constructive it is only destructive. The whole community has a sickness and a lot of people should have been perma banned as well but some people feel the need to report every thing even when it isn't that bad while others do not. We live in a care bear society where everything said hurts someones feelings and therefore you should be punished for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Faneseeker","date":"2018-11-20T12:43:39.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze insults are so 2018....use iron 4 next time man.

The game in its current state skew towards encouraging negative behaviours because riot is doing very little to promote positive actions.  There is less incentive to be good. Punishment works only to the extent of hiding resentments. I see plenty of that same rhetoric on this board too. \n\nLeague has morphed into one of the largest competitive e-sports on the planet, with it the high pressure to perform. As all things competition goes, it is naturally a stressful environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Macanica","date":"2018-11-20T19:19:37.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly my kind sir. \n\nI don't think what I did was right and I would take it back if I could but we can't and what is done is done. It is definitely tough on most players because of the system, but we have to work with it if we want to play I guess. There are just different types of people in the world and some people can let things go and just sit there for 15-45 mins of trolling and not say anything while others with less time at their disposal get a little more upset feeling as if their time was stolen. the 15 min surrender is nice if the troll votes yes.... Also you can't go AFK and do something else because that is bad. So you really have no option but to suck it up and lose your valuable time quietly. That is the part I want to shed some light on. If this is a reoccurring theme shouldn't we look at the causes and try to eliminate them instead of fussing over chat. Yes chat can have a negative impact and should still count towards a punishment, but more than anything if a chat infraction is caused by another player there should be some reduction/leeway. I have known so many good players and people that quit this game because they got tired of the trolls and being unable to say anything for fear of a ban. It is censorship at its greatest! Don't say what you are thinking unless you phrase it in a creative way that sounds like constructive feed back. \n\nExample: Hey Draven, I know you are trying your best but can we try to play more passive?\n\nSounds great right? But wrong this is still insulting. You are saying they are to aggressive and they can take it as an insult and become more aggressive...\n\nThere is no winning. Silence is the winner which is like saying turn the other check as everything you love is being taken from you. I have limited time to play so losing a whole hour of my day to a troll is a huge blow. So I have decided to stop playing no matter the outcome of my trial with Riot. I would like my account to still be playable one day, but I dont mind if that is 90 days+ or never it will just settle the issue because I won't grind up another account I will just move on to another game. \n\nP.S.

Truth is not flame it is just a statistic. I also didn't say sorry to save myself I said sorry to get him to stop trolling and hopefully come mid to help the team for 1 time in the game. I admit I flamed him but at the same time another player was refusing to assist the team and has not been punished. What is worse the guys with words or the guys with the action? If I talk about it or do it what is worse?\n\nThat is all that I am saying. Yes saying things is bad but purposely throwing a game is way worse.\n\n1.) Never played champion or position\n2.) Didn't advise team he was trying something new.\n3.)After dying he started flaming me after I picked up the kills.\n4.) Decided to no longer help team and just farm bot lane for 20 mins.\n4.) His flame and lack of communication was the match that started the fire and spiraled the whole game out of control. It wasn't just me flaming either. Every single player except his friend was mad and telling him things. So why is it that all of that is ok and excusable is my point? \n\nI said things I shouldn't have and honestly deserve the 14 day suspension since I never received one officially. Also even though I said something I didn't \"do\" anything to negatively impact the rest of the team. I worked with them and even sucked up my pride and apologized to the troll to try and win the game for everyone. So if this is the kind of behavior that you don't want then so be it have fun with the trolls and the real people that ruin the game. When you blow up and get banned you will be back and think differently.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-20T06:43:46.387+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"_Everything you said_ over the _entire match_ was to put down a teammate. _**THE WHOLE TIME.

This is not shame for its own sake. I am telling you that your chat was unacceptable, and therefore you are banned, just like Riot's ban message no doubt tried to explain, but the message isn't getting through.\n\nFirst-timing a champ in ranked is not a bannable offense. Being bad at LoL is not a bannable offense. Ripping into someone over an entire match is a bannable offense, and that's what you did, so you are banned. If you were in charge of the rules, perhaps things would be different, but you're not, so they aren't.\n\nOne chat log like this in a month is actually a lot. Some people go months, years, or even indefinitely without being this toxic. The fact that your punishment was escalated all the way to a permaban means that it wasn't just one slip-up - your record isn't cleared every few weeks. If you can't go even a month without berating someone for an hour, that's just not good enough, which is why you are banned.\n\nI don't know how you're concluding that my behavior is something the community does not need, or what in the world it has to do with your punishment and the feedback you requested. This attention I'm giving you is a favor: I'm not being paid, and the only person it could possibly help is you. Maybe you'll realize that other people have deemed you behavior inappropriate, and that this is a time for you to change your behavior rather than deflect and defend and argue. It is a useful skill in dealing with people.","replies":[{"poster":"Macanica","date":"2018-11-20T17:22:05.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for stopping in.

Explaining that you are banned is not an insult. The 30-45 minutes of toxic sludge you dumped on your teammate did, in fact, largely comprise insults. So you are banned.\n\nMy behavior (which is perfectly fine, by the way, although I understand that you think \"poor behavior\" means \"anything that makes Macanica feel bad\") has nothing to do with any of this and really doesn't help your case. Do you think that if support actually came in here to review your case (which they won't, by the way) they'd be happy to see you raging and arguing at people whom you specifically asked for feedback?\n\nYou were banned for your behavior. Your behavior was bad. Complaining about the rules doesn't help. Complaining about other people doesn't help.
