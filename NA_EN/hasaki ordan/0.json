Having the stun set off more easily for softer characters that Zed would want to be fighting anyway just makes more sense.  A change like that actually makes me curious to see if the stormraiders mastery would look better on him than thunderlords.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skaiserus","date":"2016-07-29T20:19:07.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might have something to do with the Assassin Roster Update coming after Yoricks rework.
