It just offers way too much. Taric has currently been a pick or ban situation for me.\n\nI really sat down to think about Taric&#039;s kit and this is what I came up with on why he&#039;s good and where other supports lack:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) **He&#039;s Tanky. **This is a huge one. I&#039;m not saying he shouldn&#039;t be a tank, but with the current skills he has I think that&#039;s why he&#039;s so powerful right now. For instance there&#039;s not much point in playing Sona when Taric can AoE heal + Link ally AoE heal his teammate too, all while still being nearly as tanky as a Leona.\n\n\n\n2) **Armor Scaling.** Right now I think Bastion is possibly Taric&#039;s skill you want to max out first. The fact that you can just build full armor and scale with all while providing a bigger shield on your ally as you level up your Bastion is amazing. If you really wanted to you could just rush Guardian Angel against teams with split damage to get 60 MR/72 Armor with the ability to respawn after you die and it would still be a great buy.\n\n\n\n3)** AoE Abilities and Team Fighting. **This is another big one. This probably wouldn&#039;t be such a big deal if he wasn&#039;t hard enough to kill already, but the fact is if the enemy team has a Taric you can bet they&#039;re pretty much just going to team fight nearly the entire game because no other support has the kit Taric has. You have a Stun that pretty much guarantees you&#039;ll stun a enemy or multiple enemies even if you don&#039;t know how to aim it good simply because it covers so much of the board with your Linked Ally in team fights. His Heal with Windspeaker + 3 stacks can be a game changer since he can easily heal his entire team at once. He&#039;ll rarely take much damage because of his constant shielding and def build. There&#039;s no ult in the game like Taric&#039;s ult. Even Kindred&#039;s ult is a poor version of it since Kindred&#039;s ability affect&#039;s enemies as well.\n\n\n\n4)** Penta God mode.** There isn&#039;t much to say about this, but I don&#039;t see why Taric needs this ability when he already offers like the best protection in the game.\n\n\n5) **Communication.** I feel this is a big one. I think after this new Taric catches on Dynamic Queue will be heavily dominated by Mic Communication Teams running Taric. Having the ability to make your entire team Invincible is one thing, but organizing when to attack before using Taric&#039;s ult through mic chat is a whole other ball game of unfair.\n&nbsp;\n\nThe problem is with all this balancing I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a simply number change solution. The problem is just his entire kit altogether, it&#039;s just _too_ good. As a over view I&#039;ll now look on the surface of some of the meta supports compared to Taric:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Leona:\n**\nShe has amazing stuns and engage, but lacks in the department of heals. Since she has no heal she&#039;ll probably have a tough time laning against Taric due to his ability to shield himself and his ally, along with the ability to sustain with his heal. Late game Taric is a team power house too, while Leona feels more like a solo engage support that doesn&#039;t offer much other than peeling.\n\n**Alistar:**\nI used to always pick Alistar into a match when the enemy had the Old Taric. Simply because he is the most similar imo. Alistar has a heal and can peel for the team. Since Taric has a AoE stun and God mode Ult I feel Alistar is now not such an amazing pick since he will most likely just get instant stunned on engage and won&#039;t do much damage because of the tankiness, shields, and heals of Taric.\n\n**Blitzcrank/Thresh:**\nBlitzcrank lacks too much in sustain against Taric. Taric can also counter him easily by having his linked ally in the front of the lines with him so if either of them get pulled by Blitzcrank he can use his ult as the team fight breaks out. Thresh is similar, though I feel Blitzcrank will do better against Taric simply because of his burst damage compared to Thresh. \n\n**Sona/Soraka/Janna/Karma:**\nThese champions are really good at poking and shielding/healing. The problem is late game they are nothing compared to Taric simply because of his tankiness. All these champions are really squishy. Taric not only has a shield ability and scales with armor, but a AoE heal as well.","replies":[{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2016-04-22T16:47:19.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"His old counters still works.

However their are some things that need consideration:\n\nMages didn't recieve their buffs yet. Taric general weakness is magic damage. So it's logical in that he performs that wel on a patch that is focussed arround attack damage been the primary damage source. If 6.9 hit life servers I'm pretty sure his winrate will drop exponentially. Will this be enouge to ballance him: Hell no. However with armor itematisation for supports been in the state it is now. It might be risky to nerf him until we see the results of that patch. If their is a slight chance he might end up in an underwhelming state. I wouldn't take the risk to olaf him only to regret it afterwards.\n\nThe real question is how much will his winrate drop after patch 6.9. It's not that it's a crazy number like 57-67% what actualy is happend before. As far the patches goes, his winrate can only drop in the next patch. Underdirect nerfs can sometimes compleetly outclass a champion. Don't forget winrate doesn't tell anything and I think this is a good example of this. Whe are aware he's stronger than average but when whe look for the reason behind it I'm actually not that supprised.\n\nEdite: Btw: Before his rework Taric had a time his winrate was 57%. I didn't hear complains back than. To lazy to look to statistics but it might even been before this patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Faith Breaker","date":"2016-04-23T17:18:19.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A much, much better constructed format of your thoughts thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Viperjcs1985","date":"2016-04-23T17:26:07.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Following in true style he is an over-kitted support.

The OP mentioned a 53% winrate.\n\n53% isn't as bad as say 57% of the Tank Ekko. I would say that's actually an OK stat. Not all champions will be on exactly 50% win rates, we have to accept that (for example buffing Azir to a 50% soloQ winrate would make it a permaban in the LCS).\n\nThis stat is however totally meaningless. People don't know how to optimise the new Taric yet. People don't know how to counter the new Taric yet. I think taric is one of the champion that once people learn to counter him his impact will be quite limited.\n\nIn my opinion Taric is quite easily to counter as long as you can kite OR make his early life hell since I found his laning to be subpar.","replies":[{"poster":"resumed","date":"2016-04-22T17:39:01.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also the 53% winrate is from the old taric, who, if you look at his winrate history, has been above 50% for quite some time","replies":[]}]}]}]}
