You realize your monitor cannot even begin to display a quarter of that, or half if it is an expensive 144hz panel, right?\n\nSounds like system instability, either incompatible or unstable (badly overclocked) hardware/software or an update (windows 10) that broke something.\nIf you overclocked anything recently, restore it to default clockspeeds.\n\nStop overworking your gpu for no reason, turn on vsync or framelimit (it will increase your image quality as well, on a lot of monitors), and make sure your gpu is functional and the drivers are not corrupted/outdated, clean any vents/fans, and make sure it is set as the preferred graphics adapter for games (especially if you are using a windows 10 laptop, they hate using the gpu for anything).","replies":[{"poster":"lololololololol1","date":"2017-01-09T21:03:29.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"drivers are probably it too. i appreciate the help good sir have a good day but as a said in the last comment i do t overclock or anything like that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyperi√∂n","date":"2017-01-09T20:43:10.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check your graphics drivers.
