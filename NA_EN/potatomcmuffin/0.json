However when I select bilgewater as my background music it plays the old summoners rift music. Not sure if you intended to give us the bilgewater music or not but just saying it would be nice to leave it as an option.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-19T20:54:16.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThis music was removed after the Burning Tides event.
