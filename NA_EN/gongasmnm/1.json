You may need to return to the legacy client for now to see if your client works there:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that's the case!","replies":[{"poster":"Tenzin","date":"2017-04-20T08:55:24.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that error named 004 , the patches dosent install and they say us to check us logs .

This all happens before that. I found a workaround for my mac and one for Windows.\n\nI go into my Terminal (basically the DOS portal) and enter the line below. It will then ask for password. It runs my Legacy Launcher that somehow then prompts the current client to run the update. Did it for both 6.23 and 6.24 patches. \n\n           sudo /Applications/League\\ of\\ Legends.app/Contents/MacOS/RiotMacContainer\n\n\nFound this for Windows:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/irEothGt-workaround-for-launching-the-legacy-client","replies":[]}]}
