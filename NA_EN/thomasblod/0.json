(unless it would be better to make a new post)\r\n\r\n1/21/18\r\n\r\n-Is Vayne a bounty hunter or does she look for &quot;evil&quot; on her own accord and are they a menace or just misunderstood\r\n\r\n-are the creatures in Vaynes lore specifically in her story &quot;monsters&quot; are those creatures related to the vastaya?\r\n\r\n-what is Jarven III like? what are his views on magic specifically, and what is his relationship to lux? Friends? Or just another noble?\r\n\r\n-What is lux to the people? do they look up to her as a member of  the light bringers? (i was going back through the universe lore and i could not find a place where it said she joined the light bringers. is that old lore?)\r\n\r\n-who are the light bringers? do they harbor other mages unwilling to give up there gifts? Does jarven III or Jarven IV know? Do the annulers know?\r\n\r\n-Is Jarven IV open to accepting mages into society? it seemed like he was from helping shyvana. Does his father know and what are his views on Jarven IV relation with magic.\r\n\r\n-does Fiora share the veiws of the crown or does she have her own code of ethics?\r\n\r\n-Are the vastaya considered mages?

Void?\r\n\r\n-Does this mean a void rift opens near Democia? (do you have plans to expound on this?) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is all for now i would appreciate any and all answers or non-answers that you can give me(we will elaborate later or just we don&#039;t know yet, this is where i take creative liberty&#039;s), i want my fanfic to be an extension of your lore. I hope to make many of these stories, just characters interacting in ways the might in your world. I love every single story that come from Riot but its like looking at the world through a key hole, you get a very detailed and rich but limited view into the live of the people of Runeterra. If you have plans to elaborate on these points later i would love to be able to design my works around what you are makeing (assuming you would be willing to let me in on those things).","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-01-22T17:47:27.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thomasb, most of these questions won't have an \"official\" answer until they're explored in a story.

(even if you wont give me any info)\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}} {{sticker:sg-lulu}} {{sticker:sg-lulu}}\n\nalso I am interested in getting a job with your team there at riot. I hope this story, though it wont be up to the standard of a team of writers, i hope it can be an unofficial application of sorts to you guys. Willing to take advice, working on very rough outline. Would be honored if you took a look. \n\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Johnny El Rojo","date":"2018-01-21T13:29:08.146+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"-From what I understand, {{champion:67}} does take a bounty if there is one, but she hunts monsters for passion, so she probably also goes after monsters that trouble villages that have nothing to pay her, and lives from her family fortune.\n\n-The creatures in their story are monsters because they were transformed by magic, and didn't born that way. So I don't think they are vastaya in nature.\n\n-I guess the king has the same view on magic than most of the kingdom. And the Crownguards are the protectors of the royal family, so I guess his relation to {{champion:99}} is very formal. I don't think they could be called friends.\n\n-Her joining the lightbringers is still cannon, I think. And she operates more like a secret agent outside of Demacia more of the times. So I don't think that her family or the general public know much about her deeds.\n\n-Maybe {{champion:59}} views on magic are more open after meeting {{champion:102}} . But there is nothing established there.\n\n-I guess {{champion:114}} is vey by the books in what demacian rules and ethics means. I mean, she goes with honor to a extreme.\n\n-Nobody knows {{champion:102}} is a dragon outside {{champion:59}} and the men that were with him at the moment, and for what the vastaya universe page let us know, vastaya are considered as a myth for most people outside of Ionia. I guess they are even more of a mistery to a aislationist nation like Demacia. And so far, I don't think {{champion:102}} is considered a vastayna officially.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-No, it isn't.\n\n-Most likely, it's {{champion:56}} .\n\n-","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-01-21T19:46:03.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Johnny El Rojo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=r5HPmKZP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-21T13:29:08.146+0000)\n> The creatures in their story are monsters because they were transformed by magic, and didn't born that way.

They seem to actually be Vastaya al beit an off branch species of it.\n\n>{{champion:99}}  Her joining the lightbringers is still cannon, I think.\n\nAh no it wasn't the \"Lightbringers\" that Lux joined, it was the \"Illuminators\" instead. I know it's confusing how they seem like the same thing but from what I can gather they're separate entities. I think, granted I'm only guessing that Lightbringer is a term Demacian's refer to an IRL version of a municipal / civic corporation- local government in other words.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-01-21T23:52:51.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=thomasblod,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=r5HPmKZP,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-21T13:05:29.592+0000)\n>\n> \n> -Is Vayne a bounty hunter or does she look for &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; on her own accord and are they a menace or just misunderstood\n> \n\n\nAs Johnny already said,she'll take a bounty if there is one,but she will go even after targets with no bounties on their heads.\nAnd while some are definetly a menace,they don't have to be all evil.\nVaynes teacher for example gained magical powers through a dark ritual,yet she was a decent person and even used them to rescue Vayne.\nHowever Vayne killed her nevertheless,she didn't even let her master explain herself.\n\n\n> -are the creatures in Vaynes lore specifically in her story &amp;quot;monsters&amp;quot; are those creatures related to the vastaya?\n\nThe creatures in Vaynes lore seem to reproduce by infecting others with their magic,while Vastaya breed like normal humans,so they are definetly not vastaya themselves.\nWe don't know exactly where their origins are,but I doubt that they are related to the vastaya besides the fact that they are connected to the human race.\n\n> \n> -what is Jarven III like? what are his views on magic specifically, and what is his relationship to lux? Friends? Or just another noble?\n\n\nHonestly,we sadly have almost no information about J3,however he is most likely a capable leader,as the king gets chosen from among the noble families(so J4 isn't guaranteed to become the next king,its just very likely)\n\n\n> \n> -What is lux to the people? do they look up to her as a member of  the light bringers? (i was going back through the universe lore and i could not find a place where it said she joined the light bringers. is that old lore?)\n\n\nWell no one outside of the illuminators is allowed to know about her powers,so for most people she is likely a good soldier that somehow manages to achieve great things even without a lot of physical strenght\n\n\n> \n> -who are the light bringers? do they harbor other mages unwilling to give up there gifts? Does jarven III or Jarven IV know? Do the annulers know?\n\n\nThe group is actually called the illuminators and they most likely use magic for the good of demacia.\nSince they are said to be a religious group and not a militaristic one,it is possible that J3 does not know about their use of magic.\n\n\n\n> \n> -Are the vastaya considered mages? What are Democian views on them? Is Shyvana considered magic or a half breed/vastayan? \n\n\nVastaya are innately magical creatures,so the demacians would most likely see them as evil.\n\n> \n> -Who is the leader of the annulers? What is their Hierarchy?\n\n\nWe don't know that,you'll have to hope for a rioter or a lore update to clarify that.\n\n> \n> -What would the Jarvens each say about Galios meeting with Lux in &amp;quot;flesh and stone&amp;quot;?\n\nMost would likely laugh it off as a dream,since almost no one knows that Galio is actually alive(the few survivors in the battles in which he activates most likely sound insane to everyone else)\n\n> \n> -is elementalist lux a lore based skin?\n\n\nNo\nThough it is based on how Lux would look like if she was older.\n\n> \n> -What is the creature in &amp;quot;the light within&amp;quot;? Void?\n\n\n\nVoid creatures appearantly turn purple once they get into contact with runeterras atmosphere,so the creature in the video was likely not related to the void.\nThe video actually says in its descriptions,that the being belongs to an army of elemental beings that attack Luxs nation(yeah elementalist Lux is actually the queen in her alternate universe)\n\n\n> \n> -Does this mean a void rift opens near Democia? (do you have plans to expound on this?) \n\n\nThere might be already one,as Tarics men were slaughtered by void creatures.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thomasblod","date":"2018-01-24T05:22:12.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info","replies":[]}]}
