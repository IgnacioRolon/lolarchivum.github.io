I'd really appreciate it if you would actually post something of substance regarding the original post.\n\nWhile I really enjoy the cool behind the scenes insight that your post provides here, I must say your post is extremely off topic and comes off as an attempt to disrail the conversation off from what it was initially about.\n\n@Riot Bioluminescence, I love the fact that you are willing to talk to players about lore...but more often than not you don't seem to actually know enough about lore to create an informative response to players. \n\nAs a Rioter, your posts represent Riot, whether you like it or not. If you don't know enough about something to make an informed comment, you shouldn't be posting random bullshit about it, as it makes the discussion far more convoluted.\n\nThat being said, I do appreciate your efforts to reach out and try to fix the lack of communication that the lore community has had with Riot over the past few years. Unfortunately, you aren't up to this task, as you aren't actually part of the team in charge of LoL's narrative.\n\nFor some reason, the Rioter's actually in charge of lore at Riot won't engage with players on the forum, and they seem to send other Rioters to talk to us since they have plausible deniability in regards to any negative changes.\n\nI hate those kinds of convoluted business practices. I thought Riot was above that kind of shit.\n\nIf RIot want's to have an open dialogue with it's lore loving community, then they need to get someone on the lore team to actually talk to us.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-09-30T16:51:37.210+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really dude??????How many times have people told this???\n\n**BIOLUMINESCENCE ISN'T A PART OF THE LORE TEAM.** Of course she won't have the info on what's going on with the lore & she shouldn't be held responsible for that info either.She posts on these boards most the time not as a Rioter with all the info on the subject,but as a player who just wants to take part in the discussion in whatever she can.In other words,she wants to be part of the fun.\nSure as a Rioter she have a little more info than us non-Rioter players,but that's just it.She doesn't have access to the entire grand master-plan for the lore.She doesn't have access to the info us players desire,so we shouldn't expect it from her.\nCan we at least be happy that she's willing to communicate & take part in lore discussions on a regular basis?Sure,her post won't give us all the answers we want,but does that matter?But would you rather her use her ignorance as an excuse to not post on the boards?\n\"Oh,but as Rioters,her post represent Riot.\" Okay,but that doesn't mean \"Give me all the answers I want.\"She's isn't a dang encyclopedia here to give us all the answers.She's a human & a player as well as a Rioter,I believe she is allowed to post fun stuff.If she wants to post (as you called it) \"bullshit\",let her post \"bullshit\".Whether her posting \"bullshit\" increase or decease the value of her posts to you is your own problem,not her's.","replies":[{"poster":"Impetual","date":"2015-10-01T06:57:29.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jeddy017,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=H4FUULOT,comment-id=0004000100080000,timestamp=2015-09-30T16:51:37.210+0000)\n>\n> Really dude??????How many times have people told this???\n> \n> **BIOLUMINESCENCE ISN'T A PART OF THE LORE TEAM.** Of course she won't have the info on what's going on with the lore & she shouldn't be held responsible for that info either.She posts on these boards most the time not as a Rioter with all the info on the subject,but as a player who just wants to take part in the discussion in whatever she can.In other words,she wants to be part of the fun.\n> Sure as a Rioter she have a little more info than us non-Rioter players,but that's just it.She doesn't have access to the entire grand master-plan for the lore.She doesn't have access to the info us players desire,so we shouldn't expect it from her.\n> Can we at least be happy that she's willing to communicate & take part in lore discussions on a regular basis?Sure,her post won't give us all the answers we want,but does that matter?But would you rather her use her ignorance as an excuse to not post on the boards?\n> \"Oh,but as Rioters,her post represent Riot.\" Okay,but that doesn't mean \"Give me all the answers I want.\"She's isn't a dang encyclopedia here to give us all the answers.She's a human & a player as well as a Rioter,I believe she is allowed to post fun stuff.If she wants to post (as you called it) \"bullshit\",let her post \"bullshit\".Whether her posting \"bullshit\" increase or decease the value of her posts to you is your own problem,not her's.\n\nI understand all of that, and really appreciate Riot Bioluminescence's posts.\n\nI'm just saying that her posts are NOT an adequate substitute for post made by the actual Riot Lore team, who don't like to talk to us on a regular basis for some reason.\n\nIn some ways, it really hurts to see a thread about something I care about get a red response from someone who can't actually answer any questions definitively, just because they're not from the right team. \n\nIt feels like a cheap copout for Riot not to answer pretty much any question they don't want to...despite the fact that their awesome forum interaction in past years was one of their game's big advantages.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2015-09-29T01:05:39.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still on to you.\n\nhttp://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130102152734/paranorman/images/2/2b/Im-watching-you-meme.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serge THE GREAT","date":"2015-09-28T23:28:50.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=H4FUULOT,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2015-09-28T21:46:17.950+0000)\n>\n> Did you know that line was apparently originally imagined as being more along the lines of \"Who wants some coffee?\" and not \"Who needs safety goggles, anyway?

The old map had Piltover and Zaun separated by a large body of water that led out to the sea.  Ekko's comic had a Piltoverian kill his best friend, a high classed Piltoverian.  Now why would a high class piltoverian go all the way over to Zaun?  Crossing a large body of water for what exactly?  Perhaps the large body of water doesn't exist anymore, where now the parts that separate Zaun and Piltover are no longer just scientific beliefs, but a social standing?\n\nPiltover and Zaun are maybe the same city, but different parts.

The point is that I want League of Legends to have an actual setting, and a full, mildly detailed map (i.e. not the useless ornamental ones we've been given so far that give us practically zero information whatsoever) is the quickest and most direct way of establishing one.","replies":[{"poster":"MrMuffinZ1","date":"2015-10-01T15:05:42.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what you are asking for but remember in the original post you made you stated a drawing on a napkin would be okay, Riot could easily use that statement to post a small drawing on a napkin and say there you go its exactly what you asked for. Wording is quite important \"m8\" \n   And besides that keep your expectations low, then if something doesn't go the way you wanted you already expected it, but if it does happen the way you wanted you're just that much happier because you didn't expect it to happen. In my opinion, and from experience, its a decent way to handle companies","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-10-01T16:13:04.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as it was somewhat detailed I would be okay with a literal napkin sketch. A few landmasses, a few locations; that's all I'm asking for. The point of using the word \"napkin\" in my wording is that I would be okay with an unfinished or hastily made product, because it would at least show that narrative actually has something to offer. That's the entire definition of a \"napkin\" sketch -- it means it's quick, simplified, ad hoc. Perhaps you should read up on your English slang... m8.\nRelevant Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation\n\nAs for my expectations, they are already below the Earth's mantle. I expect quite literally nothing from narrative; this past year has almost completely eroded my faith.

You seem to be the one not understanding what i have said. Read the post again \"m8\" what i was saying, and ill dumb it down a bit, is that in your post you said a napkin sketch. Riot COULD take that post literally and post a picture of something written/drawn on an actual napkin. You should know by now that they like to tease, giving answers that leave more questions that what you started with and so on and so forth. That's the point i was trying to make.

I'm not the one with issues here i believe you are currently just arguing for the sake of arguments, and at this point that's what im doing as well as its quite obvious you are not at an intellectual level to hold decent conversation with people, you read what you want to read only understanding what you want instead of actually LOOKING at what was said and meant by the second person. But please before posting any kind of response look through my comments and tell me where i have ever stated to you that a drawing on a napkin is an issue. Unless you magically find a statement like that or are apologizing i would appreciate nothing more from you.

It seems like it's an issue to you, m88. In any case, if you were hoping to hold a serious intellectual discussion about the possibility of drawings being made on napkins, perhaps the problem lies on your end, friend.

I really don't care whether there be a map or not personally. To be quite honest i am bored and wanted to say my opinion on people complaining about Riot all the time. Also, on the subject of intellectual conversations, i never stated i wanted a conversation on napkin drawings specifically or that i wanted conversation at all. I was only saying that when it comes to having  a decent conversation you need to look at what has been said and what you are saying in order to properly determine a response to the prior statement. Alas, most people cannot. I have thoroughly enjoyed our small debate today though and would like to commemorate your grammar and punctuation skills with a virtual *thumbs up*\nP.S. Like every night i will be spending it with my woman so your hopes shall come true for me, thank you, and i wish the same to you \"friend\".","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-10-02T00:24:17.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I made it quite clear that I wouldn't have cared either way whether or not they took my request literally or not. And if you didn't want conversation, perhaps you shouldn't have directly replied to my comment. Aren't you foolish? Ho ho, checkmate. It seems I have won. I will admit it was enjoyable, but there can only be one {{champion:112}} in contests of raw wit and intellect such as these. Perhaps you will have better luck next time.

I believe i have made it quite clear that i was only stating a possibility for an outcome that could happen with the way you worded your request. The fact that you are taking it as a warning or me saying that you don't want a drawing on a napkin is pure folly on your part. Although everyone has different opinions and interpretations of everything that happens in the world so i do accept the chance that you may just be misinterpreting my meaning. It may seem very clear to me, however you don't seem to grasp the concept i am portraying. \n\n      On the subject of misinterpretations; In my previous comment i said i wasn't specifically looking for conversation however i did not say that i wasn't looking for conversation either. When we begin this endeavor i wasn't looking to converse with anyone but as the replies got longer and more intricate i found myself enjoying the events that were transpiring. Thusly i continued. So as for who has won or lost i don't believe either of us has really had an advantage over the other. As i stated earlier people understand things differently based on knowledge, experience, the way they were raised etc. 100 people in a room from all over the world may see or hear the same exact thing but when they explain what they say/heard every one of those 100 people may have a different understanding. Those are my thought on the subject.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lintu Puck","date":"2015-09-29T03:15:45.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Runeterra\njust gonna leave this here.","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-09-29T04:08:26.918+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for posting a link to all that pristinely outdated information.\n\nS+","replies":[]},{"poster":"CudyDarkyz","date":"2015-09-29T08:48:26.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lintu Puck,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=H4FUULOT,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-09-29T03:15:45.131+0000)\n>\n> http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Runeterra\n> just gonna leave this here.\n\nThat map is fake now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bunny1102","date":"2015-09-28T21:59:45.790+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"We have literally had the worst red posts this week.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-09-29T00:58:09.524+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Monday.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2015-09-29T16:02:27.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a tad dramatic. Having no drawn map does not inherently devalue every other bit of lore that the release.

It's not the lack of a map, it's the lack of foundation. There is very, very little that ties the disparate pieces of lore that they release together. If someone said that Ekko's comic (using that as an example since it's popular) was actually a teaser for a brand new series that had nothing to do with Legend League, there's nothing you can point to in the comic that would refute that claim save for just two proper nouns (\"Zaun\" and \"Piltie\"), which themselves are so ill-defined as to be meaningless. Even the Bilgewater event, the most substantial lore release since the retcon (aside from relaunched Sion), was restricted to just one city which we didn't get a decent look at (I would say it was focused more on the characters, which is what we do not need right now).\n\nA map would be an excellent step towards rectifying this. Aside from that, they could also release city-state lore pieces; little bits of prose that describe what it's like living in certain areas of Runeterra, either from a third-person perspective or the perspective of a regular (non-champion) citizen. The point is, we need to define the setting properly.","replies":[]}]}]}
