He then walks a lot until he reaches the League of Legends, where he fights.\nP.S. Might have also fought the Black Mist one time when it was attacking Bilgewater.&quot;_\nAnd thought I&#039;d start up a little discussion thread here on our lovely Boards (beta).\n\n---\n\n{{champion:111}} is a champion all about revenge, right? It&#039;s his driving purpose in life/unlife. Just take a gander at these quotes:\n&quot;I will have vengeance.&quot;\n&quot;They will pay.&quot;\n&quot;Find the guilty.&quot;\n\nSo one very obvious way of expanding Naut&#039;s lore and integrating him into the post-retcon Runeterra is to make connections with a couple of other vengeance-themed champions... like Kalista, for instance, whose whole shtick is aiding the betrayed in seeking revenge against their betrayers. Sounds like a done deal, right? Kalista x Naut ship confirmed!\nBut nope. Kal has nothing to say to Naut in-game, there&#039;s no connection via Friends/Rivals... there&#039;s nothing.\n\nAnother possible candidate is Tahm Kench, who doesn&#039;t deal specifically in retribution but presumably has the ability to lend Naut a hand (possibly even restore him to his normal sailor-y condition?). Nope, nothing here either.\n\nThe _only_ connections Naut has to other champions and places in Runeterra are 1) Fizz and Nami being listed as his rivals, and 2) his defense(?) of Bilgewater against the Black Mist. Rito didn&#039;t give Kalista any voiced interactions with him, even though it seems obvious, and they didn&#039;t give Tahm any interactions with him either (less obvious, but still notable). And in case you were wondering, Fizz/Nami have nothing to say to the Titan either, despite each of them supposedly being a rival (note: Fizz was released before Nautilus, but the point here is that there&#039;s no source behind these &quot;rivalries&quot; other than rito saying so).\n\nHm.\n\nSo why is Nautilus being isolated like this? Three possibilities:\n1) It&#039;s a shameful, shameful oversight by Narrative.\n2) Narrative has future plans for Naut, possibly ones that involve curtailing his obsession with revenge and/or emphasizing his relationship with his fellow sea creatures (i.e. the two fish listed above).\n**3) Nautilus himself** ~~just doesn&#039;t give a fuck~~ **is the cause of his isolation.**\n\nSo that&#039;s the crux of this thread. If offered help by the likes of Kalista or Kench, would Nautilus really bite? The more I think about it, the more certain I am that Naut wouldn&#039;t even give them the time of day. He wouldn&#039;t give _anyone_ the time of day. As his character stands now, he has zero reason to interact with any other character save for asking around for traitorous sailors -- and that assumes that he even remembers their names or faces.\n\nThis is getting into headcanon territory, but to me Nautilus comes across as the kind of guy who ignores shortcuts. And obviously not because of pride or anything; his tunnel vision has simply become so great that the possibility of a shortcut doesn&#039;t even occur to him. In fact I question whether places or people register with him at all. It&#039;s possible he woke up, found himself at the bottom of the ocean with nothing to do but start walking, and it&#039;s just been so goddamn long that he&#039;s become numb to literally everything, except for his betrayal and his ability to put one foot in front of the other.\n\nNautilus isn&#039;t really a &quot;vengeance&quot; champion. He is a perpetual motion machine. His friends, his family and his betrayers are all long dead, but the concept of revenge is the only thing keeping him sentient. Nature does its best to slowly erode his body and mind as he wanders the world, seeking the unobtainable... forever.\n\n---\n\nAhem. You can argue the merits of having a character in your story who doesn&#039;t interact with anyone and simply wanders around, occasionally destroying something in the way (i.e. Black Mist), but I think it&#039;s pretty neat.\n\ntl;dr naut is best champ gg ez","replies":[{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-03-01T23:09:36.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm not sure, but I know for a fact that I want to see more of the Kalista-Graves pact what with Graves forgiving TFate.

Then with Tahm Kench, he seems to immediately and 'easily' give people what they most desire - but Nautilus doesn't seem the type to want to make this quick and easy on anyone.\n\nI've no information to back this up, but it's possible that the crew of Nautilus' ship (if that continues to be canon in the future) may already be dead - maybe even of old age.  I'm not sure how long it's been.  Maybe he seeks out the descendants of that fateful crew like some inherited doom.  A mild mannered Piltover bookkeeper who's grandfather was a sailor, might not know the doom that walks the seabed for his blood...\n\n(Headcanon and speculation.

But I get the impression that there's a sort of disconnect between Nautilus and his revenge fantasies... he talks about it a bit, but I just don't get the feeling that he's going to make those traitorous sailors pay when he finally catches up to them. Ever hear the saying that someone is \"in love with the concept of being in love\"? Naut's like that, only with the concept of revenge. He remembers that he was wronged and wants to do something about it, but he doesn't really have a lot to go on (due to the whole spending-countless-days-and-months-and-years-in-an-abyssal-purgatory thing). Might chalk it up to how extremely slow-burn this particular brand of vengeance will be, how limited his current lore is, or my own headcanon-y biases, but that's how I interpret Naut's voiceover and background.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic of traitorous sailors... total speculation, but I would be very surprised if Naut's betrayers weren't already dead (or at least very very old). Just think about it: after blacking out for an unknown amount of time, Nautilus finds himself at the bottom of the ocean, at the very edge of the known world. It's almost certainly pitch black, and all he can do is start walking.\nIn a full-body metal diving suit.\nThrough water.\nProbably in a random direction.\n\nIs it really all that likely that he's going to find his way to mainland Runeterra within his betrayers' lifetime? Bit of a stretch if you ask me.\n\nPlus, it just makes more storytelling sense for him to spend countless decades trekking across the ocean's depths. If he somehow made it to the mainland and caught up with his fellow sailors, what's he going to do? Crush them with his anchor? Yawn. It's far more interesting to think how Naut would cope (or fail to cope) with being lost and forgotten, with no real way of accomplishing his only remaining purpose.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for your official, Narrative-licensed input Bio. I'll make sure to commit it to record. :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2016-03-03T22:58:26.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thinking that Nautilus only really half-remembers things from his previous life. He knows that he wanted vengeance on the people who abandoned him, he dimly remembers where he came from, but names? Faces? Places? All of that eludes him. All he's got left are his hollow emotions and the anchor that killed him. He'll take his vengeance on the other sailors, but he may not get any joy or satisfaction from it. Those emotions are lost to him. \n\nI do however think that his betrayers are still alive. Obviously this all depends on how far out to sea they were when he was dropped, but given that Runeterra is mostly one landmass, nautical expeditions probably don't get too far offshore. Nautilus also no longer needs to sleep, eat, or even breathe - he can walk day and night for _years_ without stopping, driven by his desire for vengeance. His comrades might be older than they were during the expedition - maybe years older - but Naut certainly has a chance to find them before they croak.","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2016-03-04T05:41:28.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree, Naut has almost certainly lost a lot of himself (both in terms of memory as well as emotionally).\n\nBut do remember that Naut's lore starts off like this: \"...Nautilus was a sailor commissioned by the Institute of War to explore the uncharted reaches of the Guardian's Sea. This expedition took him deep into unknown waters...\" So obviously the extent of the expedition depends on how well-known the waters surrounding Runeterra were at that point... and since we don't have any maps or other points of reference, that's totally unknown. But the way it's phrased, I imagine they were pretty far out.\n\nThat, coupled with the fact that his mobility while wandering at the bottom of the ocean is snail-paced, makes me almost certain that the rest of the crew is dead. Not to mention Naut has no realistic way of navigating through pitch-black waters (although I admit it's possible that his transformation granted him intimate knowledge of the depths, to the point where he could find his way straight back... but that's relatively unsubstantiated).\n\nI personally can't see Naut's journey back to the mainland taking anything less than a decade, absolute minimum. And in my headcanon I would put it at something like 40 or 50 years; assuming Naut's crew was comprised of hearty 20-30 year old sailors that would put them at 60+ years at the time of his return, which I would think is around the natural life expectancy of a human being in a fantasy world like Runeterra.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-03-02T07:49:45.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still, Kalista having a line like \"Will you finally join us, tinman?\" would make much sense.
