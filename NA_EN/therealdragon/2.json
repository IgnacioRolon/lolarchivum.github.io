For instance, champions like Kassadin. He's supposed to be a mobility king. But even spamming riftwalk, cannot escape Yasuo, Kalista, Ekko dashes etc. Are we going to see some toning down of the mobility on champions that perhaps shouldn't have superior mobility as part of their kit?

A champion with a lower skill floor would be best suited for lower tiers, but these champions should generally not have such a high skill floor to compensate.\n\nRegarding the comparisons you made, Garen and Amumu are supposed to be used more at lower tiers of play, but this is not the same as a champion being \"OP\" in that tier due to that tier not being able to perform counterplay as well. When a champion is picked in higher tiers more, a similar approach also applies: being meant to have a higher level of sophistication and skill put into that champion shouldn't necessarily cause that very champion to be worse in other tiers; they should be able to perform well in all tiers as the higher skill ceiling can be utilized better by better players, who may need this to do better against their high tier opponents. But of course, this skill ceiling should not translate to being OP in higher tiers.\n\nA good example of this COULD have been Ryze. He is a simple burst mage where you can go R>W>Q>E and try to kill someone. However, better players would be able to utilize the more sophisticated parts of his kit, and use other combos that use his full potential better. This does NOT mean that Ryze should have been able to perform the way he did after his rework, when he was OP due to the extremely high skill floor that you added, which was too much and made him OP.\n\nWhen designing and balancing champions, their kits do not have to have a team element to it (Fiora's new ult, Kindred's ult, things like that). A champion could easily have a full solo-player like kit, but to perform well with the champion, their weaknesses should correlate with how a team works (like an ADC should be immobile or lack defensive CC, and to compensate the support or other members of the team are able to peel with CC or healing).","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-10-09T02:20:27.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have mixed up ”skill cap\" with \"team utility\".

When it comes to hard to compare effects on the other hand, particularly when some are much more powerful in certain circumstances than others, it gets quite a bit more difficult. Comparing the value of Rek'Sai's tremor sense in organized 5s versus Silver solo queue for example gives two really different outcomes. It's a lot more valuable in organized 5s, what does that mean for the overall balance of the character? Heimer's turrets by contrast wreck a lot of players pretty hard in solo queue until a certain skill level, but then fall off massively in effectiveness against a team of skilled players, particularly when that team moves and coordinates well as a group.\n\nThere's only one level of comparison, the level of logic.

Balanced for pro play, such as Worlds, will sometimes be different to balanced for regular play (e.g. champions that strongly reward teams that have played together a lot and are on voice comms).

In worlds the players (are supposed to) have coordination and work together. In soloq high ranked, judging by complaints on the boards, the coordination isn't always there. \n\nAlso, when you say balanced, are you aiming for everyone to be OP and in that, no one is?

Increase the cd of Darius' Q. Currently, he can basically spam his Q and heal his opponents damage without much mana issues. If the cd gets increased however, he'll have to be more careful where and when to use his q. This will make players actually have to use his q skillfully instead of \"Oh I missed with q?

Even with the community saying \"Hey, he's kind of broken\" on PBE, his numbers weren't toned down. He's been banned every game, amongst others in Solo Queue. They're like old Kassadin, someone who had to be **begged** by the community to be nerfed, and even then he's still really strong now (but not stupidly so.) I'm just curious how 4 champions who were clearly reworked from bottom tier to top-tier picks/bans got through PBE without any foresight into toning down the numbers beforehand.\n\nI mean hell, I'm a dev in training, I know the struggle of balance, but with the community sending up red flags at every point that they could, isn't there a little bit. If champions have a sudden jump in ban-rate from 0% before worlds to 100% Pick/Ban participation, and the team that picked him wasn't even fully ready to play him (they just wanted to avoid BKT getting him,) and still tore up the enemy team, that leaves into question where the true balance of these champions lies. Their kits are heavy to damage, heal, and fight. But when you get one small lead on one of these, it's hard not to snowball.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ihaveapotion","date":"2015-10-09T08:25:07.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey im one of those players that intentionally picks 'up' champs and as a result of this loses every game, gets reported 9/10 and probably will end up a serialkiller irl because of the toxicity i have to deal with every single game of league.  greets.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-10-07T23:51:02.799+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get the point of this thread.
