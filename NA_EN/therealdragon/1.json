In my current pbe games so far, they aren't doing so well :/\n\nAlso in case you're confused, the \"minigames\" (in my mind) are a side activity you have to do while playing the game originally. Hence with bard you have to do all support stuff but at the same time, you have to know when to leave for chimes and when to come back. With fiora, you gotta somehow hit the vitals while trying to kill the enemy. And with Aurelion Sol, the enemy has to somehow dodge your stars while they just cs.\n\nNot saying its a bad thing on Sol, just saying that its there lol.

Similar dodge the stuff gameplay in a way other champions don't.\n\nno I don't see that as a minigame. I can see the confusion though. The thing is that Sol's passive is exactly that, his passive. It's up at all times. Meaning every second that you're near Sol you have to be wary of the possibility that one of those stars could hit you or their range could increase. Karthus Q on the other hand is not up all the time (unless the karthus casts is continually) and the simple counterplay to that is be near minions. If you're near minions it won't be worth it and the karthus will run out of mana if he continues.\n\nMore examples are like the other post said:\n-Skarner's passive (have to collect the shrines in the jungle as the skarner may beat your jungler up if he gets them all),\n- this could just be me but there's also dodge the hook but thats only because only one hook needs to land on the right champ to win the game\n-Illaoi's e passive is another. If you're turned into a vessel you have to cs and be wary of the tentacles while you're csing (or just stay under tower and kill them)\n\nIt's mostly on the newer champs lol. Don't get me wrong, I actually DO like this minigame on Sol and I love sol himself as he has weaknesses (get close and he can't do anything) and the player has the control with it. \n\nAnother definition for \"minigame\" is once the player hits an ability, it basically says \"do these actions and you win\". For instance, when fiora ults its \"hit these 4 vitals and you win\". For Bard its \"get all the chimes and you win (more chimes=more meep damage and more slow right?). For Illaoi its \"Kill the vessel and you win\". This doesn't apply to karthus as he isn't \"Hit your Q and you win\". Also note that these are mid-lategame (except fiora shes all game, sry I kinda hate her with her true dmg bs and w lol). Like early game most of these don't apply but lategame if one of these happens, the minigame then applies.\n\nedit: jsyk I'm ok with the minigames. I feel they make champs unique. I was just echoing a few posts I had seen on the boards where players were like \"I wish they would stop with the minigames. Makes more work for us\". I'm personally ok with them and was semi making a mock post while at the same time thanking you for sol lol (he's awesome). But still, screw fiora and her true dmg bs -_-","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-03-09T04:28:52.616+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Licojee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6ys2byHB,comment-id=000200000000000000000001,timestamp=2016-03-09T03:08:38.102+0000)\n>\n> Karthus Q on the other hand is not up all the time (unless the karthus casts is continually)\n\nLiterally every Karthus casts it continually.

LOL SO GOOD THO TY RIOT!\n\nTo be honest, minigames are probably here to stay. They provide levels of challenges that can make plays based off of skill, (like Juggling axes) and involving the opponent, inherently adds counterplay. (Like being able to shot a skill shot where those axes would land.) \n\nI use Draven as an example because while mini games have become a hot topic as of late, Draven is fairly old, and was probably one of the first champs to have a mini game in there kit. Riot knows that mini games can work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Valor NA","date":"2016-03-08T23:07:22.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, I like the Passive and W.
