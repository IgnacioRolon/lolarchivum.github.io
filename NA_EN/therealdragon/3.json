Since the beginning of the year the skins team has hired a few new people for each discipline: myself and another concept artist, a character artist, an effects artist, two animators, a sound engineer, an art coordinator and I'm sure some others I'm forgetting. But that doesn't begin to account for the quantity and quality of skins being produced, we are all pushing each other to excel and innovate and I'm really amazed to see everyone on the team just getting better and better.\n\nOn top of that with each passing season we, as a team, develop a better understanding of this mysterious thing called 'skins' and how we can ensure they really resonate with players. Along with that I feel like as time has passed we have earned the trust of Riot as a whole and we are generously given a lot of freedom to try crazy things like DJ Sona and Pool Party Rek'sai.","replies":[{"poster":"therealdragon","date":"2015-08-08T13:08:38.449+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're very welcome kindlejack <3 and thank YOU for making such awesome skins (even though I won't play them cause I'm broke, boo.....) and idk who came up with the idea for battleboss blitzcrank but it was genius!

Actually school houses are a normal thing in countries like England and Australia (where I'm from) so I thought that the champions would either be from rival schools or from different houses within the same school. We decided that they should all go to the one school together for cohesion but still be separated into houses that correspond with the faction the champion is from (which is why Darius and Vladimir share a colour scheme).\n\nWhen we were deciding what kind of feel we wanted for the skins we did talk about if it should be a magical academy like HP, an American-style high school or a more 'anime' feeling setting. I wanted to represent many different countries in the designs so we leant towards a more general school theme but when I finished the Vladimir design and people said it reminded them of HP, I didn't have a problem with that >:)","replies":[{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-08-09T00:02:27.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just going to say...
