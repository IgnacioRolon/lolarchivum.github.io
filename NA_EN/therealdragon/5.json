Here's why","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"When URF was first announced in the form of ARURF, I got hyped. I think quite a few people did. I jumped into games right away. I&#039;m mostly a mage player but who cares the chance of playing a mage can&#039;t be that small.\r\n\r\nMy first game I get ZAC. Ok, no biggy. We lose that one. I go again.\r\nNext game I get Vel&#039;Koz. Holy shit my second main. We win that with ease (we also had a xin I believe), and by the last 5m, its actually semi-boring.\r\nNext game I get Aurelion Sol. Holy shit my ACTUAL MAIN. We get roflstomped because all the enemy team has dashes and a xin.\r\n\r\n.....I don&#039;t think I&#039;m making my point. Yeah I got my mains and I had fun right? .....Not really actually. I only mentioned 3 games there but 80% of the time, I&#039;m getting champs I don&#039;t play. Most of those games as well are only lost because either the enemy team was hilariously OP (literally if a team has a xin, unless they&#039;re braindead and not spamming they&#039;ll win), or we had champs that didn&#039;t fit well into URF.\r\n\r\n....ok I&#039;m a terrible explainer I&#039;ll just say this outright: For me, the reason I don&#039;t like ARURF is because the chances of getting champs I actually like/play is miniscule. Literally maybe 10/100 so 10%. Then add on to that that the only reason one specific team wins is because its more OP. Like yeah spamming abilities and watching the fiora get deleted by a Hecarim is fun, but if you&#039;re not playing someone you like or not roflstomping, then this mode becomes either annoying or boring. Neither of which should be occurring.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll say this about URF, yeah you saw the same 5 champs every game, but at least both teams had fun roflstomping each other. At least before, we had control over it. Now no fun and no control? I think I&#039;ll stick with regular game mode mostly now. It was supposed to be fun....but meh.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-04T20:46:47.500+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's sum it up.\n\n\nI only get a champ i like to play rarely, and at least in regular urf people got to choose and would be less upset when losing.","replies":[{"poster":"therealdragon","date":"2017-03-04T21:22:11.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RÃ²ssy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nM4A9ur4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-04T20:46:47.500+0000)\n>\n> Let&#x27;s sum it up.\n> \n> \n> I only get a champ i like to play rarely, and at least in regular urf people got to choose and would be less upset when losing.\n\nYeah that pretty much sums it up.\n\nSmall chance to get a champ you like and its completely random who gets the more OP champs. Like how is this fun? URF yeah you had people complaining but at least with that you had a bit of control and could play who you liked. Now it's getting roflstomped on a champ you barely play. Where's the fun in that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2017-03-04T21:08:36.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think for regular aram players we're more accustomed to playing a wider pool of champions.

Personally I did use aram itself to break my bad habit of a small champion pool plus to cure my anxiety of learning new champions on the fly. Overall it worked.\n\nWhat I really find funny is if Riot ever listens and makes URF truly random with all champions unlocked. Then the whining will really begin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"franchise7676","date":"2017-03-04T21:57:15.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sheldonbunny,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nM4A9ur4,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-03-04T21:08:36.255+0000)\n>\n> I think for regular aram players we&#x27;re more accustomed to playing a wider pool of champions.

Creating an account to cherry pick champions is a phenomenon that \"aram account\" users do, as opposed to aram players who just play as is.
