This is from the fan's perspective however, Riot could have secret intentions lore-wise for people. ;D\n\nEdit edit: Also I don't really know much about some champs with all this lore revision so could some lore experts (or even some reds who designed champs) help me out here? ;D","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-03-06T06:11:24.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:201}} probably neutral good.

Just look at his Creator skin and all of his malevolent robot menace. If anyone from Zaun was Lawful Evil, it would be Viktor, making Jayce the Lawful Good.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saint Archer","date":"2015-03-09T03:06:39.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's ridiculous. alucaurd kills vampires and doesn't chow down on mofos with their children watching, not chaotic evil. and le louche pretty much destroyed himself building a righteous society, not neutral","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-06T06:15:57.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:119}} Chaotic evil. {{champion:86}} Lawful good. {{champion:115}} Chaotic good. {{champion:98}} Lawful Neutral. {{champion:64}} Neutral good. {{champion:17}} Evil Evil.","replies":[{"poster":"Yatsufus책","date":"2015-03-06T06:20:31.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thefriendlyorc,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=M0fuzaEv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-06T06:15:57.486+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:119}} Chaotic evil. {{champion:86}} Lawful good. {{champion:115}} Chaotic good. {{champion:98}} Lawful Neutral. {{champion:64}} Neutral good. {{champion:17}} Evil Evil.\n\nI like all of these, but I made Teemo True Neutral. I don't really see how any of the Bandle Yordles are anything but True Neutral except for a few like Veigar or Ziggs.
