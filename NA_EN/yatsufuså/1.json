The major difference is the pressure you are subconsiously putting on yourself and others to succeed.\n\nYou may do better in normals because you arent trying as hard and trying too hard can cause worse performance overall.

Or that you perform worse in ranked, although it looks like you are climbing out of bronze just fine.\n\nCouple things though. For one, you don't have enough games played in ranked for it to really mean much. You need to play at least 100 or so more games to really be properly placed. I dont know how many games you have in normals either but it requires a high volume of games as well. A lot of people who are bronze skill level probably are simply un ranked because they don't play ranked since there isn't as much to gain and people who aren't good at something usually aren't as competitive about it.\n\nIt sounds to me more like you are psyching yourself out. Maybe you should try not looking at ranks until after a match and evaluate how it went before you see their ranks.","replies":[{"poster":"Yatsufuså","date":"2015-10-28T20:35:40.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing..
