I bought a Mystery Skin for myself and did not get an additional reward.

The announcement that says \"send yourself a Mystery Gift and snag a randomly selected un-owned champ, skin, ward, or icon\" basically means you don't get another mystery gift but rather you can get a random un-owned content. It can be a champion,a skin,a ward, or an icon.\n> \n> I hope this information clears things up. If you have any other questions or concerns, please let me know!\n> \n> Swizzle\n> Player Support Specialist\n\nApparently \"working as intended,\" but seems a little misleading as my friends also expected an additional reward. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Cyrath","date":"2015-12-11T21:54:07.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not so much the mystery gift as much as, if you purchases a legacy skin you're supposed to get a free random skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Foot in Shoe","date":"2015-12-11T20:02:47.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasen't even expecting a free item with a self mystery gift.

Reading some other threads similar to this, apparently the way it is supposed to work is by sending a Mystery gift to a friend you unlock a Random Mystery Gift for yourself. Although, the wording on the event does not say this at all, and no comment or update has been made by Riot. I feel like there is a lot of people who are buying themselves Mystery Gifts expecting a free Random Mystery Gift, like the event says.","replies":[]}]}
