When the ping issue hits it sustains 250+ for awhile. I was wondering what the issue was and how can this be resolved? Any other time the ping is fine. And this has happened to multiple people who live my area. I used wifi and hardline and it doesn't change a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-13T06:26:44.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SAME exact problem here. been going on for months, already have TRACERTS and log info.

For your specific case, your ISP might be re-routing your connection to our server during that time period, and could be causing input delay.  As a first step to rule out possibilities, I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is running strong and able to keep a constant connection while in-game.  Let me know if you still have an issue!","replies":[]}]}
