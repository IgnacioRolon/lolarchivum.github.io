He lost his quotes (around 36). There are only Bear Stance quotes only + those not related to any stance (there are only those when you use your maxed stance for the first time). that's really annoying. I hope you can add a bugfix to this patch (I found this bug in patch 4.20, or even earlier, can't remember)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-12T20:51:59.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bubbleq! \n\nThis issue has been around for longer than we would have liked. Unfortunately, Ultiamate skins are a bit more complicated in terms of how they're hooked up, especially SGU since he has several stances. We're currently still working on a fix for this one. Sorry it's not the news you wanted, but I didn't want to leave you in the dark on this one.","replies":[]}]}
