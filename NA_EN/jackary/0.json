Not all champions necessarily had to ENTER the League of Legends to begin with, so it's possible that one day an autistic champion just entered the fight because he felt like it and wouldn't listen to anyone who told him no. He didn't have to be the strongest that his region had to offer, he just had to decide that he was gonna go in and fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Lcifer","date":"2015-03-24T04:05:51.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"either way if they where autistic there passive would have to be something like this \"Autism-- refuses to follow commands 70% of the time and returns to base every 5m regardless of summoner commands\"","replies":[{"poster":"phirestarter","date":"2015-03-24T20:13:13.802+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does this differ from the behavior of bronze players currently?
