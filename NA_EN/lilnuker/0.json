Losing lp in a 3v5 just isn&#039;t fair to the three that could play. I realize people could say that anyone could afk so they won&#039;t lose LP but if its from the very beginning, I don&#039;t see why a loss forgiven couldn&#039;t be handed to the shorthanded team and have the 2 afk&#039;ers properly punished. It just doesn&#039;t make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-08-09T15:00:53.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot claims it all evens out over time. you have an afk on your team this time, but next time the enemy has an afk and now you benefit from the enemy afk. this is their logic not mine. personally i think its a crock of shit. you shouldnt lose lp when being forced to play a 4v5 or worse","replies":[]}]}
