I was just laning against one and they were literally unable to be seen when he threw them. You could see his throwing animation, and they hit correctly, but you could not see the projectile traveling through the air. This, of course, made them incredibly hard to dodge and detect in teamfights or pokewars.\r\n\r\nTo recreate, simply play Mundo with no skin and throw cleavers, simple as that. I confirmed with a few other players that said they were having the same issue to ensure it wasn't simply on my end.","replies":[{"poster":"1st HanarSpectre","date":"2014-10-20T21:33:38.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo's cleaver have been bugged since beta anyway, they have a wonky hitbox and tend to hit when they should have missed and miss when they should've hit. They also have a tendency to be invisible whenever Mundo goes in and out of your vision. They tried fixing it a couple of time, but Mundo doesn't seem to care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-20T21:41:21.745+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey there! \n\nHave you tried repairing your client recently?
