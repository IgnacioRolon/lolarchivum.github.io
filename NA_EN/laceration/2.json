I&#x27;d rather increase build diversity than narrow it further.\n\nI love build diversity but Blue Build Ezreal (specifically the Iceborn part) is extremely annoying to play against while giving Ezreal utility that he shouldn't have in the first place due to his poke and mobility. Not to mention it gives him 65 armor, which makes it even harder for ad champions (like the other adc he's laning against though laning ends super fast now) to actually do damage to him once they manage to get on top of him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PhantomPrankster","date":"2018-04-09T17:23:31.205+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"as an ezreal main i've always wanted frostborne taken away from him.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-09T20:51:51.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iceborn...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-04-09T16:31:30.552+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I concur, Long range poke that slows is not fun to deal with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-04-09T16:40:20.608+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"While this isn't the main point, I think tanky ADCs should be a possibility, but _only_ if the gameplay they present is healthy and appropriate. Graves and Urgot, for example, deserve to be tankier than most other ranged autoattackers, because they themselves are exceptionally short-ranged. By contrast, Ezreal absolutely does not deserve to be tanky, at least not without severe tradeoffs, because he already has amazing range and mobility. When Ezreal, and Ezreal specifically, gets tanky, he becomes far more frustrating than the average marksman, because he has so many different tools to avoid getting caught that he stops feeling at all interactive. In Ezreal's case, if the issue is that he's abusing Spellblade, then it might help to nerf his base AD, and instead increase the AD ratio on his Q, or its base damage, to compensate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-04-09T15:47:08.587+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"MELEE ONLY REEEEEEEEE","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-04-09T15:51:31.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3025}}{{champion:112}}?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"princeblumpkin","date":"2018-04-10T04:02:41.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laceration,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1sOUArVP,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-04-09T10:46:28.135+0000)\n>\n> tanky adcs shouldn&amp;#039;t be a thing,\n\nI agree; nerf Death's Dance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-04-09T20:44:26.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe let's focus on actual problem that correct ADCs are?
