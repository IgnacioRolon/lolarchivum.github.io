Poke champion pre-6 in a meta where control mages start with more sustain than your poke will ever do. Severely gated by W cd in the early-game, doesn&#039;t have a passive unless you are winning lane. R snap-back ruining his late-game, his late game being ruined by the Reaping mechanic for the sake of making him a more niche pick(which btw the only ad mids we have are Zed and Talon where you turned talon into a roamer therefor made them different), passive being broken for low elo by making it easier to kill without landing Q at the same time easier for them to farm, and useless for high since at high elo understand they can out-trade a zed really hard early-game and out-push him if they get low to recall and get all their hp/pots back meaning Zed never procs his passive on his opponent early unless they messed up badly somewhere. \n\nSince Zed is clearly unfun to face in lower elo and unfun to play because of how weak he is at high elo, I think Zed could use a small update like the one you recently did to Fizz. \n\nFirst of all his passive is a lot of burst you do not see which makes it feel like dusk-blade, It may not be overpowered but It could be frustrating to play against. Why don&#039;t you change the passive to offer either his old %AD back which would tone down his snowballing and fix how awful he feels late-game, or make it move-speed while unseen based on a % of your Bonus AD, basically what this would grant depending on the numbers would be very low early-game meaning he would not take away from Talon&#039;s Identify, but late-game help him get flanks off while allowing for 6 items more easily, but the catch is good wards will slow him right down and he also wont be getting the passive in fights. I&#039;m pretty much saying Zed hasn&#039;t been a lane-bully since season 4 and shouldn&#039;t be, so rather being the best LATE game assassin would make a lot more sense as well as making him that niche pick when you want a AD midlaner but also want to scale with an adc on your team. \n\nSecondly, Okay, so he just lost a huge portion of his burst where do we move it? The answer is actually by buffing the Q ad ratio by 0.1 and the e ratio by 0.05. These are low however can easily be changed and balanced accordingly. Zed will be even more reliant on landing Q&#039;s. Early game he will have less burst at 6 without the old passive however it scales better because we want him to be that late-game assassin. \n\nThirdly, W cooldown could probably still use a buff by 4 seconds as he will now have less opportunity without the passive to W swap in early for the kill. \n\nLast and most importantly, The snap-back delay is at the very least way too high. Leblanc has 0.2 snap-back delay on her basic mobility spell which is way lower cooldown than zed&#039;s ult. Ever since the snap-back delay was added it really cutdown Zeds outplay potential for the sake of making it easier to stop his lvl6. That&#039;s fair that his lvl 6 was too hard to stop, but is his lvl 16 that hard? Late-game is grouping stage and Zed really struggles to do anything beside w e q most of the time because there&#039;s too long of a window for the enemies to KILL let alone have a big enough window to cc you. They have 0.75 sec to react to the Zed R + the amount of time you spent going in. The snap-back should scale down with each point being gone at level 16. I don&#039;t think that will be an issue and if it does i&#039;d at-least settle for 0.2 \n\nDisclaimer: I&#039;m not trying to be bias at all towards Zed, I&#039;m just acknowledging he&#039;s not balanceable in his current state. I&#039;m looking for ways to power him down early and power him up later because I get riot wants assassins to be a strong early class that fall off later, but Zed cannot be strong early or else he&#039;s broken so update his kit to be more fair for use zed players who picked up the champ because we loved how he felt outplay wise, but also more fair for his opponents who struggle against him in lane. \n\none last thing: Bortk Zed killed slower but felt nicer to play, there&#039;s also the possibility of making bortk his rush item again which means since he&#039;ll have to stay in range of your for almost the entire mark to 100-0 having snapback is pointless","replies":[{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2018-08-30T05:42:39.405+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":17,"body":"Saying that zed has a weak laning phase is ridiculous.

The core change they need to make is not to the game but to the balance team, even now they continue to add damage to the game and though it sounds mean they really need to be stopped, someone in that company has to step in and say enough is enough, because if a Meta collapse lasts to long then people stop playing, riot had already admitted player base numbers are down and we are already experiencing it. \n> \n> Once the out of control balance team is removed from the factor THEN riot can sit down and begin to repair the devastation they have caused to the game and the meta. They would have to start with damage, damage reduction across runes first then items, then followed by kits and champions. Once the damage is under control and not drowning out other stats the Meta can start to repair itself, one that happens THEN Riot can look into buffing champions who need it.\n> \n> As of right now, the last thing this game needs is more damage, even to weak unpopular character, we need to fix the meta collapse first before any big buffs should happen again.\n\nI don't think anything I said wouldn't increase his overall damage, rather just make him harder to play while at the same time giving him more tools to succeed in the elo he sucks in in the form of making his earlylevels really hard but giving him back his consistent scaling from the %AD which would nerf his snowballing since his R gives him an extra free 300gold for a kill early and also giving him back his outplay potential lategame. The Q and E buffs don't make up for the passive being gone but will make up for it later on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Å¹ÃÃ","date":"2018-08-30T08:52:46.239+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"most people here pretty much sound like silver surfers with the rito balance team, i stopped playing this game (ranked) this season because of how bad it feels to play zed, (against actual competent players, not most of the people complaining about this post obv lol). i agree not just zed needs to change, but many things about how passivity is enabled in this game, everyone would have an insanely nice winrate if they all just picked basic tanks and pressed r at level 6. lol this is the game we play now xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2018-08-30T03:40:34.851+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":8,"body":"Someone asking for assassin buffs on the boards?

At the time mained Vel'koz so the outplay potential between us both was there.\n\nNowadays however, at least pre patch 8.17 (idk if the changes really affected this in any way, haven't faced zed yet in current patch), a zed could point and click kill me in under a second (with duskblade). \nThe evidence being the vel'koz E: if vel'koz dies b4 E lands, the E animation keeps going but loses all effects, so even if it lands it deals no dmg and doesn't knock up.\nAlso indicating that the W+E+auto+dusk+ignite combo didn't need an ult proc (that activates after 3 seconds) and they generally don't land Q in low elo indicating he only needs half of his kit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Chillin","date":"2018-08-31T05:58:17.645+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a TLDR; for silver players downvoting and shitposting here.

Nerf base AD and other forms of damage that can't be dodged or are harder to dodge.\n\n- If he autos for free duskblade damage without hitting anything, he loses his passive\n- With the higher threshold, his enemies even in high elo will either have to learn to play well vs. him or just lose by constantly backing the moment they take any decent amount of damage\n- However, Zed will either farm with abilities and put them on cooldown, or with his autos and put his passive on cooldown. So unless he gives up lane priority and only last hits, plays very well and hits both the enemy and the wave with abilities, or waits for a very long time, he can't 100-0 in a single combo out of nowhere as he'll likely have something down or will have telegraphed it a LOT.
