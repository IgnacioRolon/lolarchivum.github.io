The Canadian dollar is only going to go up from here.\n\nThe current system gives 107 RP per dollar by purchasing $50 at a time. $50 USD converted to CAD makes the $50 USD purchase option worth more like 114 RP per dollar.\n\nI know there is an option to buy in USD, but due to the way a lot (all?) of credit card companies work here they take a cut when you convert currency. So we of the frozen north would appreciate it if you stopped trying to rob our dead bodies.\n\nSincerely,\nYour friend, Cyrus","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T23:00:32.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that does suck a bit, but sadly we don't have much to do with currency differences =\\ .
