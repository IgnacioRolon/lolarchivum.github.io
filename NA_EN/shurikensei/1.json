How many people does Zed have? Are there rankings in his order? Is it friendly inside the walls, like are people friends, do they laugh, enjoy regular stuff or is it strict and ordain? Is it survival of the fittest? Are there any females in his order? (Most of what we have seen from the order are male.) How do you join? Is Zed the only Master or are there other under him he trusts to teach the rest of those that join the order. Also what kind of Martial Arts does he teach, or is it his own style?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-09T18:39:59.548+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"environment?   are you asking if it's stern of funny?

Are the people of Ionia aware of the Order or rumors of them? And if so, are they scared of them?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-11T18:42:34.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people have heard rumours of them— but on the street most would assume they are navori brotherhood.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-12-12T20:54:51.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, the general public isn't aware of the coup?

Lower level students mostly learn from mid tier students, mid tier learn from high tier, high tier from Kayn and Zed personally. \n\nWell, Kayn being actually second in command is something that kind caughts me off-guard. I mean, Kayn seems rather... young. In the best case he is in my age (21 years old), but I heard from a pretty reliable source that he is only suppose to be 17, which well, is kinda questionable for a second in command?\n\n> Almost all of them had serious martial art skills before joining-- of various styles and weapons.    They are unified by acquiring shadow magic and learning to use it.  \n\nI mean, Kayn's ability ingame (before becoming SA) seems rather limited.

God, please be it. I'm more than hyped now.","replies":[{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2018-12-12T17:25:36.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I mean, Kayn's ability ingame (before becoming SA) seems rather limited.

The Brotherhood would grip this land in an iron fist. No better than Noxus…”\n\nAnd if you have heard Irelia quotes with Noxians, I think this last quote together with the assassination trial leave it clear that they arent allies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shurikensei","date":"2018-12-09T19:01:21.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the information, Zed and Kayn are one of my favorite champions in the game and in lore.
