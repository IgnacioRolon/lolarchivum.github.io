Yea, that&rsquo;s right, ranked in ARAM.  Why?  Because it takes a lot more skill to deal with the randomness, poor comps, carrying, and turning it around than picking a good comp, bans, and counter picks.  Some people want to main a few champs and get to gold or diamond, but I think it is time to bring a ranked mode to ARAM and get recognition to those players who are truly good with most or all champs.  On top of that, I&rsquo;d like to see exclusive season end rewards for those who pour their hearts into ARAM and make it their main game.","replies":[]}
