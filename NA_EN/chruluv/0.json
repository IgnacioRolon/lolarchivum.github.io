Upon entering the game my team called for a remake vote (I was ingame and then voting box popped up with 5 value) and it passed isntantly after two people hit yes (registered saying 2 allies voted yes).\r\n\r\nI'm just very frustrated that I got hit with a leave due to a connection issue and sat there helpless as I literally started walking to lane and watched it all happen. Is this an intentional build for the system? I 'm just concerned about it possibly happening again.\r\n\r\nOnly \"proof\" I have is I guess making it to the [end screen](http://imgur.com/a/yn2FT). Guess it might show me connecting in the replay as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T05:53:31.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, this is intentional. The system treats all disconnections equally because regardless of intent, your absence from the match leaves your team one player down and at a disadvantage. You can find more about the Leaverbuster system in our [**Leaverbuster FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\nMost connection issues are caused by incompatible network settings, so I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to prevent this from happening again.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
