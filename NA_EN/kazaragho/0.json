It's a hassle since I don't especially enjoy PvP.\n\nEdit:  I made sure to choose Graves again, played a few ARAMs, signed out, signed back in a minute later, and it's still saying I haven't made a choice.  I should have completed Act 1 by now but instead it says I haven't even started.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AngelOfLightUrim","date":"2015-07-24T20:16:24.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also had a problem with my account, it counts my gold however says I've gotten no assists whatsoever, which on ARAM is pretty much impossible to get non lol","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-24T21:15:42.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll need to complete one objective at a time, so if you need to get 25k gold, you'll need to do that first before you can begin tallying for the assists objective.","replies":[{"poster":"AngelOfLightUrim","date":"2015-08-05T20:47:04.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, thank you very much!
