Before it used to be 218 (Act Broadband), now its around 256-260 something. Over the span of 1 - 1.5 years the ping increased has been steadily increasing from 160 to 180 something then 200 , then 218 and now its 256-260. \r\n\r\nI checked with ISP, doesn't seems to be an issue with them.\r\n\r\nI generally play on Na server, Cuz of English speaking community. I tried other servers, but they usually converse in their own languages and when you talk in English, they start flaming. Pretty hard to play on other regional servers.  I don't want to blame the community but another reason would be, I started on NA and would prefer to stay there. Lots of my friends play on NA server as well.\r\n\r\nHopefully this message reaches to people from my region. \r\n\r\nI wanted to know, what ping you guys are getting ? Please do name your ISP as well your region in India.\r\n\r\nLike for example Airtel, etc.\r\n\r\nOr in case you believe I am the only Victim of high ping here in Bangalore. Do enlighten me. Let me know if I can shift to some other better ISP.\r\n\r\nIt seems on CMD ping I am getting 246-247, but on client its showing 256-270. I know client doesn't used ICMPL. But still it's quite unstable.\r\n\r\nFor one thing I know, I have been playing other online games as well, their Ping haven't increased in ages, one game I have been playing for 4 year's now it used to be 180 now it's somewhat around 166 or something, to be honest more like they have improved over the span of time, all of these games are hosted in America.\r\n\r\nSeems like riot has made enemy out of quite a few Internet hosting companies or I don't know how its working out to be honest, I am not pretty good when it come to networking, but I understand the basics pretty well and can troubleshoot some issues from my end.\r\n\r\nhere is my traceroute : (I am trying to hide my ping and stuff) hopefully its hidden.\r\n\r\n  9    22 ms    23 ms    27 ms  ix-ae-0-100.tcore1.MLV-Mumbai.as6453.net [180.87\r\n.38.5]\r\n 10   142 ms   139 ms   140 ms  if-ae-9-6.tcore1.WYN-Marseille.as6453.net [80.23\r\n1.217.77]\r\n 11   139 ms   141 ms   141 ms  if-ae-8-1600.tcore1.PYE-Paris.as6453.net [80.231\r\n.217.6]\r\n 12   139 ms   140 ms   150 ms  if-ae-2-2.tcore1.PVU-Paris.as6453.net [80.231.15\r\n4.17]\r\n 13   139 ms   140 ms   139 ms  ae12.mpr1.cdg11.us.zip.zayo.com [64.125.14.49]\r\n 14   260 ms   246 ms   248 ms  ae27.cs1.cdg11.fr.eth.zayo.com [64.125.29.4]\r\n 15   248 ms   267 ms   243 ms  ae0.cs1.cdg12.fr.eth.zayo.com [64.125.29.84]\r\n 16   247 ms   278 ms   247 ms  ae5.cs2.lga5.us.eth.zayo.com [64.125.29.93]\r\n 17   242 ms   243 ms   243 ms  ae27.cr2.lga5.us.zip.zayo.com [64.125.30.253]\r\n 18   244 ms   261 ms   243 ms  ae10.mpr4.lga7.us.zip.zayo.com [64.125.20.81]\r\n 19   243 ms   242 ms   243 ms  128.177.169.154.IPYX-089814-960-ZYO.zip.zayo.com\r\n [128.177.169.154]\r\n 20   250 ms   244 ms   242 ms  104.160.132.35\r\n 21   251 ms   247 ms   247 ms  ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.14]\r\n\r\n 22   252 ms   249 ms   251 ms  104.160.131.1\r\n\r\nlooks like that .zayo or paris seems to be the culprit.\r\n\r\nDo help me out if you guys can please.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T23:54:35.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely looks like your connection spikes after reaching Zayo's network.
