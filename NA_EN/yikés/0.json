This change was not for everyone, and many stuck to holding space bar/freely moving the camera.  In my opinion, this change was fantastic because it offered the choice between how you controlled the camera. \n\n                   Any way, back to the \"holding X button for an extended period of time during a fight\".  One of my friends was talking to me and was annoyed when unable to hit a champion that was standing behind a tower. I told him about the \"Target Champions Only\" hotkey, and he began using it. Later he told me that it was annoying to hold the key, and that he was considering buying a new mouse that had additional buttons to make the hotkey more easily accessible. So I thought, why not make the key a toggle so that you can switch between them without holding down the button for a whole team fight? So, I want a checkbox that allows you to make the \"Target Champions Only\" hotkey able to be a toggle button.\n\nCurrent Hotkey:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9c7PmPH.png\n\nToggle Box Proposed (Example):\nhttps://i.imgur.com/b2priIO.png\n\nHope you all like this idea!\nWill be answering questions in the comments whenever possible. \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nThanks for reading,\nYikés\nP.S. wasn't sure if this would go in Story, Art, &amp; Sound or Gameplay, since it fits in both in a way. c:\n\n(Edit: Maybe I should've put this in concepts?

I've only used the boards a couple of times, sorry!!)","replies":[{"poster":"Mafia LeBlanc","date":"2017-12-16T17:03:08.797+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2017-12-17T16:10:09.436+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel a disturbance in the river \n\nAs if a thousand Tahm Kench mains suddenly cried out in joy at once","replies":[]},{"poster":"korg023","date":"2017-12-17T12:11:03.491+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so good,i hate when i dive and hit tower by accident cause enemy is hiding behind it.","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2017-12-18T14:22:33.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=korg023,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cnRqUIoA,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-12-17T12:11:03.491+0000)\n>\n> This is so good,i hate when i dive and hit tower by accident cause enemy is hiding behind it.\n\nThe amount of times that has cost me a kill is insane.\n\nIt's extremely tilting to auto a tower/minion and lose a fight.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jos Kosmos","date":"2018-08-25T21:29:04.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is implemented now btw.","replies":[{"poster":"RalshaDenmoon","date":"2018-12-06T17:03:15.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried finding the target only champions thing.

Say there was a teamfight happening in the middle of a wave, and you were autoing without the key held down. You might accidentally auto a minion, making your damage output against the enemy champions lower. If you hold down the key, your auto attacks would consistently only hit the enemy champions.\n\nMy proposal is to make this key an optional toggle so you don't have to hold down the key, but could just turn it on before the fight, and back off after it. Let me know if you have any more questions. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wimbledofy","date":"2017-12-16T23:45:44.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This also works with attack move + target champion button?","replies":[]},{"poster":"gud jangler","date":"2017-12-16T20:13:38.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"missing a champ between minions is what noobs fail at, but when he hides perfectly behind tower or runs around it, or dragon/baron, that's where the problem happens","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SAD Gekyume","date":"2018-12-06T12:59:41.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh well seems like I'm gonna attack minions with my Q on Kai'Sa cuz im definetly not buying a new mouse","replies":[]},{"poster":"XˆAˆNˆA","date":"2018-03-26T00:01:48.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is more things Riot can do to improve the game settings/experience and TOGGLE TARGET CHAMPION ONLY is one of them. \nHeres some other ideas.\n\n1. Binding attack move to left click makes the champion move when using the mini map, unless you hold down the left shift, it interferes with other things too like when you click on the shop or leveling abilities. Its annoying to hold left shift to get pass these interferences.\n\n2. Custom smart/quick cast for champions, like the item the sets. I use smart cast on almost everything unless I play something with a very long range abilities like: Luxs R, Nocturns R, Galios R, Sions R, Ryzes R. Manny rs XD but you get the idea, having to hover over does abilities to see the range or turning of the quick cast every time you play certain champions is rather annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Soopa Troopa","date":"2018-03-24T01:36:09.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I found out about the ` Target Champions Only, I swapped TAB and ` in the hotkeys menu.\nSo when I want to view the scores / items I raise my left pinkie and hold `, it makes pressing my pinkie down on TAB while in combat a breeze as it lets my fingers stay where they always have been on QWER.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkeus","date":"2017-12-18T14:37:22.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damnit.
