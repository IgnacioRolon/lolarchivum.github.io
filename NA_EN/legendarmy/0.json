It really has a shiny light green that I really like but as you can see in the [3D model](http://media-titanium.cursecdn.com/attachments/65/975/mordekaiserkingofclubsmv.jpg), it&#039;s pretty plain and [blends a bit too much](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7ODkUQ2MIP8/VUGX3DaRhLI/AAAAAAAApHw/NUB9xiZght0/s1600/MORDEKAISERTURN.jpg) with summoner&#039;s rift.\n\nMy suggestion is to [light up the model ](http://i.imgur.com/D4VeVpH.jpg)and meets what the splash art really shows. (or alternatively darken the splash if it&#039;s too much to ask)\nThanks :) {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-22T18:25:40.233+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lighting in splash is a bit different than in game.

But that's nonsense. Every splash art should reflect reality(its ingame look). That's why Riot darkened some classical splashes, am I wrong ?
