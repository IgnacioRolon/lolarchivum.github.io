No clue why, except all I can think of is when my ISP went out one time. So I endured the 5 minute ques. I login couple days ago, stuck in Leaver Buster again with 10 minute que...No clue why, I just stick it out. Tonight, guys goes afk for not bringing SMITE, so we /remake. Next game player never loads in.../remake.\r\n\r\nWTF RIOT. Now Im in Leaver Buster Que for 20 minutes. Now I know exactly why Im in the damn Leaver Buster because Im in games that we vote on remaking, even though its not me who is afk and why the games are being remade. Thats not even the issue. The issue is your lame ass wont let me put in a support ticket for this broken shit. I try and all it does is redirect me here. I would not even be mad if it was me leaving the games. I literally sat through all the ques believing it was for the one time my ISP dropped me. Figured it was a glitch punishing me twice for the one time, but now 3rd time after I literally just watch it happen. /remake then hit \"Yes\" two games in a row, then boom the Leaver Que message pops up on my screen. Seriously. WTF. Now I know I am going to be placed in the que everytime we vote on a remake because this is exactly what happened. Check your fucking logs RIOT. You will see im not afk, in my lane killing minions when I vote /remake....man this is so seriously wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T16:21:32.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really important to work on resolving whatever is causing these leaves, otherwise your required games and timer will continue to escalate until you play consistently.
