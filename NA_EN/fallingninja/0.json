Unfortunately even with the assassin update his victims still feel rather helpless against him as his ult is too unstoppable. You can&#039;t counterplay it as an adc other than hoping bard, zilean, or the like stop it for you. Mages do have zhonyas but pressing zhonyas while he ults you isn&#039;t the best way to counterplay.\n\nThe fix I suggest is that **if the target that zed is ulting kills zed before his ult pops, his ult does not pop.** \n\n&quot;But how is Zed&#039;s ult going to kill people now?&quot;\nDo the damage and tele back after you do the proper damage and after the delay.\n\n&quot;Now its becomes more difficult to come back when behind as Zed&quot;\nThe skill area of zed revolves around the shadows and warping between them, I believe this is enough of a skill floor to allow for a nerf.\n\nThe general idea is to stay alive to assassinate someone. All the other assassins have to do it, (yes I know the new talon has a good bleed) but Zeds gameplay identity is all about the shadow play not a hailmary to go kill some kid.","replies":[{"poster":"OctoberIV","date":"2016-11-02T14:47:55.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed is already in line if anything he needs a buff.
