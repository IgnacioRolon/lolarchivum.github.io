You should expect better ping (than if you're connecting to NA from Italy) and if you make any friends in Europe, it'll be easy to team up and play.\n\nAs for which region; my instincts say EU West should be better, but I highly recommend that you create new accounts on both EU West and EU Nordic & East to test out the servers from your temporary home. This is mainly because there are many things that can lead to connection issues and you want to make sure that you're transferring to the region that'll allow you to have the best experience.\n\nOnce you've done that, compare it to playing on NA--braving the lag and all--and see if it's worth transferring to a different region. I urge you to play Custom Games or Co-op v AI games since you don't know if the lag will be highly detrimental or just a nuisance to your gameplay.\n\nGood luck and have fun in Italy!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2015-10-09T16:31:16.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome!","replies":[]}]}
