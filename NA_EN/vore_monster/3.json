I've loved his changes and see him as a fairly balanced champion as of now. Recently, Skarner has been getting a lot of attention due to the new season and his new legendary skin coming out. This brings something I fear will happen; a call of the community. \r\n\r\nPeople are going to start playing Skarner more often and eventually call for nerfs or buffs to the little bug. When they do, Riot is bound to cave into creating a virtually unplayable champion through the nerfs or create a perma-banned or over-picked champion from buffs. This is something myself, and possibly other old Skarner players, do not want to happen. I feel he is a pretty balanced champion as of now. His ability not only comes from his kit, but the player that builds and uses him. A bad Skarner will suck, and a good Skarner will dominate. This is how it should be. I don't want Riot to create a champion that feels as useless as {{champion:113}}  due to their kit or something as overwhelming as {{champion:84}}   due to their sheer power and no need for critical skill.\r\n\r\nWhen his popularity grows, what will happen to my favorite champion? Will he become impossible to play due to his pick/ban rate? Will he get nerfed to the ground?","replies":[{"poster":"AlÃ«k","date":"2014-11-24T03:14:22.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you're overreacting","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2014-12-30T18:45:07.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His W need some change's to make feel more like a unostoppable tank:\n\n60/70/80/90/100 (+ 8/9/10/11/12 % TOTAL of Skarner health) and also make's some kind of tenacity buff. some like this: While the shield persists, Skarner gains 15% of tenacity.\n\nI'l agree with the increase of the duration of his passive stun ,turn into 0.75/1/1.25 feels better, now that everyone have acces to the tenacity elixir the stun duration need some review IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IAintDarius","date":"2014-11-24T03:00:35.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Along with the devourer enchant pretty much making him sleeper OP, I think we are screwed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalzaharAnyLane","date":"2014-11-24T02:53:42.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I roflstomp with Sejuani since her passive was reworked.\n\nShe went from squishy and useless to tanky and buff.
