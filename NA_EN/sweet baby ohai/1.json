You see, certain sect have use this rainbow as their mark for \"homosexuality\" banner. I just want to remind and actually give a brief description of where the rainbow comes from, what it **actually** stands for, and why it was here in the first place.\n\nThe rainbow was a significant promise to the sons of people on this Earth. That promise was by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The promise was that he will not flood and destroy all flesh with water. \"This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.\"\n\nYou see, the reason the Lord had to judge this world was because of sin. During the days of Noah, sin was so rampant, it was said that homosexuality ran wild. Men were raping other men, and leaving them to die on the streets.\n\nAs you can see, as time pass by, history has repeated itself again. And devils and demons are working to deceive the eyes and heart of men. Now, the very thing God stood against, and his rainbow was to remind all flesh of his covenant between us and him, gays are using that rainbow covenant as their banner.\n\nThat banner doesn&#039;t belong to gays, nor does it represent homosexuality. It represents a time where the Lord had mercy and showed kindness to all flesh, even when they have sinned, judged others, acted wildly, he gave us a promise to never once again flood this Earth as he did with water.\n\nBut know this, at the end times, it won&#039;t be water he will be using. It will be fire. Have a nice day everyone!\nPeace, Love, and Joy be with you all!","replies":[]}
