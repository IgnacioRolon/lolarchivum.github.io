Then, I played another ranked game and won.  After I won that game, I saw that I wasn't in promos but actually had 98 LP.  So is this a glitch or do normals affect ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T20:45:57.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I see you as having 98 LP too.  Normal queue won't impact your series or LP.  It can contribute to a high [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) penalty, though, if you dodge a normal than a ranked.  A relog might get your current progress updated.  You're still in your series, so good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horizn","date":"2017-04-13T19:05:35.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be a visual glitch - op.gg says i have 98 lp but im also 1-1 in my promos...","replies":[]}]}
