I sent a support ticket saying what happened and looking back, I should have changed my password then, but I didn't. This morning when I tried to log on, the username/password combination was invalid and when I looked at lolprofile.net, there was an identical account to mine on the japan servers with two games played with players with asian characters in their names. I am pretty sure someone hacked my account and is trying to move it to the japan servers so I contacted Riot support for help but they haven't responded. I really don't want to lose my account and would appreciate any help or tips to recover it.\nAccount name is \"i am rocks\".","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T17:46:40.479+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing access to an account is quite frustrating, I know from personal experience.
