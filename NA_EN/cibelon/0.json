Any?\r\n\r\nWe had TWO DC&#039;s at the beginning of a game tonight.  One lost 2 waves and a level, the other was even later to reconnect.  We missed the 30-second remake window because we were focused on trying to catch up.  This is not the first time.\r\n\r\nI guess I can just sit at fountain next time and stare at chat until it comes up... heaven help me if someone says no to it.  But it seems a lot more player-friendly for the client to automatically bring up the vote box when the conditions for a remake are met.","replies":[]}
