Death timers were only just now reduced and only from 30-55 minute marks. They honestly haven't even explained what that means as there is no clear time given.\n\n2. Trundle was actually nerfed before this patch and cannot use his Q on turrets. He also was support (and was level 11 where as everyone else was at least 4 levels above him) so all of his build was armor and mr. The Graves i will give you. But 2 of the players were full Armor and Magic Resist so they don't do a lot of damage (in comparison to when you build them with AP or AD).\n\n3. I don't know what you mean by \"they were super tanky\" It is kinda obvious and i don't see where that argument comes in other than to say they can take some turret shots. Which has nothing to do with death timers.\n\n\nThe announcers even point out the death timers if you go back and watch \"look at the death timers, still 30 seconds\". The true combination is this. The Death Timers were far too long, and the turrets are far too weak now. They go down like paper. Obviously Riot is working on the Death Timers, but the fact it took this long is an indicator that they didn't think it was that big of a deal and want these games to go much faster. I personally enjoy the longer games. Personally I would like to see turrets get at least tankier. Just so you can't push through 5 turrets in less than 30 seconds (4 of which were full health). And if you go back and rewatch the game. The INHIB took longer to kill than most of the turrets.

Stop posting. No, things were fine at the beginning of season 5, a bit tank heavy but for everyone's complaints at that time no one had any idea how much worse it could get. Then the Fiora/Morde/Garen/Gangplank reworks rolled out and while some of them worked or needed tweaks the rest just continued to go downhill in a very bad way. They seriously had to revise Veigar's cage 4 times before it effectively now is roughly the same as his edgestun, just more intuitive to keep the opponent in the center. Before that rework it was blatantly obvious he was useless and they left the cage like that for weeks instead of days.\n\nLee also got a buff, a champion that is and always has been as overloaded with utility as Ekko and even with what has been taken out of his kit they still haven't addressed his overabundance of mobility and duelling potential properly for 3 straight seasons.\n\nTo argue that the balance team is 'keeping up pretty well' is to pointedly ignore some brain dead obvious screwups and some instances where actual kneejerk reversions via hotfix were in fact warranted but didn't happen for a month or didn't get the targetted nerf they eventually had to do anyway.\n\nMages were having it a little rough in S5 but were otherwise doing okay, now they are comparatively useless because they lopped off 10-15 minutes off the end of the game where mages could begin to scale past the early-mid game options against magic damage. Now they are being shoved out of their lanes by ADC's in every single lane after already contending with assassins in general and bruisers coming from top back down to mid.\n\nThere is a LOT wrong, AtheosisX is not hyperbolic after all for calling for that team's jobs given the high stress high burnout world of e-sports the game willingly developed itself into. Nobody would be complaining this loudly about a bunch of this if LCS wasn't a thing, but pretty much the entire company has set themselves up for this kind of rhetoric going from being blatantly abusive in Season 1/2 before Tencent was involved to being pretty much par for the course by now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2016-04-18T03:35:09.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Midnight,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zxk7WTwd,comment-id=0017000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-18T01:12:19.380+0000)\n>\n> Like thirty people balancing 130 champs, 200 items and countless different mechanics?\n> \n> I think they are keeping up pretty well in all but one or two areas.\n\nReally they aren't.

Better take away their entire livelihood and possibly destroy their family.\n\nExcept in this case you aren't even talking about mistakes in something as concrete as math. You're talking about in which way a game should be balanced, which is a question that has dozens of different answers.\n\nIn conclusion I want to ask you why you think that the Balance Team (and not just the small subteam that focuses on objectives such as towers and monsters, but the entire team, including those who work on mostly gold distribution mechanics,) why the ENTIRE TEAM, because you said you were not being hyperbolic, that they were incompetent and needed to be fired, why the WHOLE BALANCE TEAM should be fired.\n\nWhy should Riot fire their entire balance team?","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-04-20T13:45:54.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure you're responding to a post from a person who is not me.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Birdie","date":"2016-04-20T14:16:50.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shit sorry didn't notice the change.\n\nBut you can't say that this game isn't free to play just because the developers are making their money elsewhere (off of skins.)\n\nThat's like saying that no one is watching Youtube videos for free because the Youtuber is making money off of ads or even if they don't enable ads they are making their money off of their job.\n\nJust because something costs money to create doesn't mean it costs money to consume. \n\nWhen you buy skins yes some of that money is going towards just keeping the game alive in general, but that is not what you are paying for. You are paying for the art that you are given in exchange, what Riot does with that money afterwards is irrelevant to the original transaction.\n\nCertainly every time you buy Coca-cola they are also using some of that money to make Sprite, but that doesn't mean you're buying Sprite.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-04-20T14:58:13.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">That's like saying that no one is watching Youtube videos for free because the Youtuber is making money off of ads or even if they don't enable ads they are making their money off of their job.\n\nNo, it's like paying for Hulu Plus and you insisting that Hulu is free when I'm actually paying them money every month. \n\nIt's free for you because you do not pay money.\n\nIt's not free when people pay money.\n\nAnd it's not any more complicated than that. \n\nP.S.
