I just want to TEST things out","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-06-29T19:51:47.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not like there's really anything special there to test 90% of the time. New champions only release every now and then, same with skins sometimes, and all that stuff is live in 2 weeks after that.  Plus the Balance changes that hit there for other stuff are generally better seen on the Live server as most of the time they stay and will have their further testing and tweaks made after that. \n\nI personally have a PBE and don't do too much there when I go on. The server itself can be worse then the live servers, they lack a lot of people to play since it's a much much more condensed test setting.   Need other players to even create customs a lot of the time because the server is overloaded so you can't even play alone there.\n\nBut just like Live accounts, Sharing is a No No as it's all in the ToS of the game.  Each single person uses their account alone and cannot let anyone else use it without it being banned cause Riot doesn't want accounts to be compromised, sold, boosted, ect.
