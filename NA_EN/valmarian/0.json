No, really, it doesn&#039;t. It lets people suffer through game, after game, after game of trolls, griefers, fuckboys of all varieties whose sole purpose is to waste your time and ruin your gaming experience from the get go. Oh yes, I&#039;ve been permabanned, but why?

I am such a toxic player! After having made a list of well over 150 names of players who I&#039;ve suffered through playing with, people who inted, trolled, afk&#039;d to grief, or any and all other manner of throwing a game because &quot;omegalul silver&quot;, I&#039;ve responded to someone doing just that with the above remarks. This inbred Twitch, a legit shitstain, Inwins, was one of the worst fucking ADCs i&#039;ve seen, but proceeds to blame me for why he can&#039;t last shot any minion to save his life. So after surrendering at 15- voting to, he proceeds to openly declare that he is &quot;not playing anymore&quot; and only tries to surrender from the 10minute marker onward; aside from inting and running around afking in the base/by the inner turrets. By --I- am the toxic player, yes? I am the one whose negativity is the reason that the game went how it went. Me. The twitch did nothing wrong! No, just me. Riot has let me down for the last time and i&#039;ve made it clear that, on alternate accounts, I&#039;ll be more than happy to ensure every ranked game I play will be just as enjoyable as the 3/5ths of the ones I&#039;ve suffered through over the last 9 months of playing this piece of shit game. Riot is a great company, all, super amazing to its customers. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Farkinob","date":"2018-12-23T08:55:53.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were toxic to Twitch blaming him and possibly tilting him; saying that it's his fault that \n>Valmarian: I was s2\nValmarian: but I can't climb cause I get players like this twitch\n\nYou keep on saying \"Report twitch report twitch report twitch\" nonstop too; you can win a 4v5 easy if you're as good as you think you are.\n\nIcing on the cake is you come here and say:\n>This inbred Twitch, a legit shitstain, Inwins, was one of the worst fucking ADCs i've seen, but proceeds to blame me for why he can't last shot any minion to save his life.\n\nYou basically made the Twitch so upset (Who may have just been having a bad day/game/whatever) quit; and ruined 3 other player's game. \n\nI know I'd report you in game if we were playing ranked.

So after he proves he either can't play twitch, ADC, or the game, after failing to engage with our jungler and myself, leaving us to 3v2 when we thought he was with us, two feet away, he bitches to ff at 15. From that point on, without me saying anything other than \"Lol\", he does as I stated above. It's just funny that you'd report me for being upset that our ADC is giving up/afking/inting all game from 5-10 minutes in as opposed to him for legitimately griefing a game. FYI, my teammates were equally mad at the twitch and asked the other team to report him as well, no one said shit to me on either side because they knew what was happening and acknowledged it. :) Thanks for your input!

Riot does not care what twitch says. He could say \"your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!\" (Worst insult known to man). They only care what YOU say, how YOU handled it. It doesn't matter that twitch is a bad adc. It doesn't matter that he just bought Twitch before the match. It doesn't matter if he runs straight down midlane feeding Katarina 91 kills in a game. You can NOT be TOXIC to HIM. Even though HES being TOXIC to YOU. Kapeesh?\n\nI do have trolls on my ranked games. And guess what, I don't react to them. And I report them. And they get banned.

I'll just mute everyone, say \"Positive\" things in chat, \"Accidentally\" die 20 times, maybe afk for an \"Emergency\", and buy some items that look cool at some point in the game. No, i'm not inting, trolling, griefing, I'm going to genuinely try and make sure everyone knows im \"trying my hardest :(\".

Whatever do you mean? I'm going to play just as other people in my past games have played! It's perfectly acceptable behaviour, obviously. it's funny you mention the latter, though, since I'm only ever \"toxic\" when encountering people who are quite blatantly sabotaging a game. I've never sabotaged a game. I've never intentionally fed. I've never picked troll characters for the \"luls\", and I've never ran around afk to \"look\" like I was doing something to try and avoid that \"AFK\" report. I mean, never done the other shit either because i'm not here to waste 30-45minutes of people's time as these players are clearly playing to do. Me getting reported by the shitstains who ruin the games to begin with doesn't quite equate to \"Most players never ever want to play with ever\" 'cause I actually did well to receive honors after games and a friend request here and there because my teammates knew I was trying to coordinate and win a game that one or two other people decided would be more fun to just troll.
