{"poster":"Annunziato","date":"2016-10-21T23:49:30.235+0000","title":"Another Review of the Alpha Client","subforum":"Client Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So after fiddling around with the client for a few days and finding out what it can/can&#039;t do I&#039;ve decided to put my own review on here. I already had one but honestly it was made prematurely and I missed somethings.\r\n\r\n**Quitting the Lobby**\r\nCurrently I find quitting a pre-game lobby rather inefficient. Sometimes I&#039;ll get an invite from another friend, or other times I just don&#039;t feel like playing at a particular moment while I&#039;m browsing the shop or editing my rune pages. At the moment of posting, I have to go back into the lobby and exit it from there. Which removes me from what I&#039;m currently doing, maybe adding an &quot;X&quot; button around the Lobby button while you&#039;re browsing around the rest of the client? Just to add to that as well, it should make a notification if you&#039;re the leader of the lobby if the current leader quits.\r\n\r\n**Item Sets or an Item List**\r\nIn the legacy client, I commonly used the Item Set page, not because I make Item Sets for in-game use, but I used it a lot as a reference for when I&#039;m discussing with my friends or something of the sorts. It&#039;s a really convenient tool that&#039;s well made and suits my needs perfectly. I&#039;ll be sad to see it go, as I dislike leaving the client to a game to find out something that is honestly one of the most core parts of League. Just as another point to this, you removed item sets but you still have spells as a tab. I understand that they are something you unlock as you level up, but after you hit level 10 (which honestly doesn&#039;t take a terribly long time) the whole tab has even less use that an item tab would.\r\n\r\n**Champion Select**\r\nThis is where I find most of my issues with the new client. I&#039;ll split it up a bit.\r\n\r\nThis [_post_](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/nut5pedc-i-made-some-changes-to-the-alpha-client-pick-phase-after-watching-the-worldss-layout) basically defines visually how I think the champions should look. Riot spends a lot of time and effort into making different splash arts and skins for champions, yet whenever we select a champion we get the default icon, and _just their face_! It should display more of it, especially since you have a lot of space to work with in that area.\r\n\r\nEditing your mastery page(s) during champion select currently takes up the whole screen. In the legacy client, it&#039;s more of a pop-out so you can still see who&#039;s picking and what they&#039;re picking. To me that&#039;s very crucial, as knowing what champions my allies are going and what champions my enemies are going can severely alter how I&#039;m building my champion or even changing who I&#039;m picking entirely. Being taken away from that makes it difficult to coordinate with teammates and it&#039;s very hard to deal with.\r\n\r\nOn the previous note it&#039;s probably a known bug, but my chat windows for champ select and post game don&#039;t automatically show new chats (I have to scroll down constantly during a populated conversation), and my chat has such a high latency that it&#039;s difficult to even see messages or respond to them in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOne last thing that would be more just nice to have, is a custom filter on champions. The addition of filters has made picking certain roles so much easier (though Syndra shouldn&#039;t be under support but thats for a different thread). However let&#039;s say I have about 3-4 champions that I like to play under any given role (sometimes more), I have no way of organizing through just those because if I&#039;m mid lane, I have no way of having a filter so Zed and Ahri show up together, even though they are both very common mid champions.\r\n\r\n**Ranked Tab**\r\nThe ranked tab under &quot;Profile&quot; is currently missing a lot of the more in depth features that I used to have. Yes it lets me know who my top played champions are. It however doesn&#039;t give me any of the stats that I used to be able to pull up. I don&#039;t know my average kills/assists/deaths of that champion or my largest multi-kill is. I don&#039;t have access to any of that information anymore and while it&#039;s not really a game breaker, it&#039;s nice to see, and it sort of leads into my next point..\r\n\r\n**Lifetime Stats**\r\nOkay, maybe not _Lifetime stats_ but currently Riot has all of your match history from _SUPER_ far back, and while that gives you a lot of information, there&#039;s no way (without visiting a site like op.gg) that you can see a bunch of raw data of how you&#039;re playing and what you are averaging. If you included some of the most average stats (Games won, total k/d/a, how many total minions killed etc...) it would add a little fun facts to your gaming experience. For specifics you could always add stats in the champion tab under Collections. Just a neat feature I thought could be added.\r\n\r\nAlong with this you might be able to add what recent high-ranking players are using on that champion for runes/masteries. It&#039;ll help guide people when they&#039;re first starting out a champion.\r\n\r\n**Full-screen Mode**\r\nI like to full-screen things, more specifically, I like to make things full-screen and borderless. Why Riot hasn&#039;t done this yet I don&#039;t know, but again I take some of my ideas from Smite, where they have a full-screen client _and_ if you&#039;re tabbed out of it, it&#039;ll give you notifications when a match has been found or the game has started etc.. which is splendid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther than all of that, I&#039;m very happy with this client over the legacy client, and I am saddened by the fact I have to go there to play Doom Bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-22T01:49:26.614+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annunziato,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=QBqFm2K2,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-21T23:49:30.235+0000)\n>\n> So after fiddling around with the client for a few days and finding out what it can/can&amp;#039;t do I&amp;#039;ve decided to put my own review on here.

Not specifically custom filters, but in general more mechanics that makes it easier to find the champ you want. I don't know how, but it will happen.
