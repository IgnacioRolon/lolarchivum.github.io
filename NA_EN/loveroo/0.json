IGN: loveroo I am involved in Facebook groups about League, and we often have in-house games together. This weekend, I was playing in one of these in-houses. During the last game I played, my client was acting really buggy. My ping was fine, but my friend suggested trying to lower the graphics of the game to see if it helped. No matter what I did, nothing seemed to fix the client. It was very laggy, and sound was stuttering. I had no programs open besides League. Not even a voice comm. I never have problems playing. I decided to restart my pc. Once I tried to log back onto League, I was met with a perma-ban for scripting. Mind you, I barely can use Skype. I am probably the most technology impaired gamer you will ever meet. I play champions like Nami, Janna, and Zyra. I am in Gold 4, and pride myself on being one of the least toxic people I know of in the community. I emailed Riot, assuring them that this was a mistake. The email I got back was a very generic response saying: \n\nHey there,\n\nI'm ****** and I'm part of the Riot Support team. Our system has accurate evidence that your account was in violation of our Terms of Use due to the usage of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in the game. After I double checked your account, it doesn't look like this was a mistake.\n\nFor security purposes on our investigative methods, I will not be sharing more detailed evidence or specific details. We will not be lifting the ban on this account under any circumstances.\n\nI then messaged him back. Told him that this is clearly a mistake, and automated. That I have never done anything, let alone have the know-how to perform any violations as such. This was my next reply:\n\nHello,\n\nIn situations like this, we only take action against accounts when we are absolutely sure of our evidence. We also personally review every case like this to make sure that we haven't made any sort of error and I personally looked into this situation.\n\nI understand that this isn't the answer you're looking for but given the evidence we have, we can't justify lifting the suspension on this account.\n\nI absolutely, 100%, have NEVER EVER violated any terms of service. When I am running League, the only thing I ever have up is Facebook. Sometimes. I don't usually use voice comms. I dont know code or html. I dont evne fully understand what scripting is. I know it has to do with cheating/skill shots/dodging. I do not understand how there can be any evidence against me when I have never had an affiliation with this type of thing.\n\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-08-12T02:38:56.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking a necro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-10T21:31:09.089+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do you know or believe someone else has had access to your League account, whether you authorized it or not?\n\nDo you play on a shared computer at any point?\n\nDid you get your client files transferred from someone else rather than downloading it from the website?\n\nDo you have any cheat programs used for other games, or have any program that modified League in any way at any point (including resolution adjustments)?\n\nHas your email account registered to this account been compromised before?\n\nDo you use the same or similar login information for League as you do elsewhere?\n\nJust a few reasons that could explain an account compromised which resulted in flagging a hack/mod/exploit you were unaware of.","replies":[{"poster":"loveroo","date":"2017-04-10T21:52:25.011+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have my own pc, it is not shared.

I tried turning down my graphics as suggested by another player, and I had no other programs open. Not even my internet browser. I decided to restart my pc and see if that fixed the issue. When I got back, my account was locked and I had the email about scripting. This was absolutely, 100% a mistake.\n\nloveroo\t\nloveroo\nApr 10, 09:15 PDT\n\nThis absolutely was a mistake. I've been playing this game for years, and have never done anything to violate terms of service. I don't even have the know how to run programs or script. I can barely use my new smart tv. You mention there is proof, but refuse to share it. I'm convinced this is an automated response. When discussing with friends what the third party stuff even means, I was told it is cheating. Scripting. Using fake skins. Doing things to alter the client. I have NEVER done anything at all line this. The ban came randomly. And upping research, I found riot has been giving out false bands for this sane thing. And these false bans are also followed up with the same radome email you gave me. I am a 27 year old support main who is just trying to play the game. Riot had absolutely made a mistake, and I implore you to actually take a look at my account. You'll find nothing. 9 times out of ten I don't even use voice comms. While in game. Please, reevaluate and take a look. I've never done anything.\n\nEconetics\nEconetics (Riot Games Player Support)\nApr 9, 16:40 PDT\n\nHey there,\n\nI'm Econetics and I'm part of the Riot Support team.

I really have no idea how that could even have been a thing? I've been playing league for years, and know next to nothing about computers/modifications. I also pride myself on never being a toxic player. This was completely random, and got the pop up of the ban while i was playing custom games with a group of friends. Please help. In fact, there is an account that was harassing me that I believe to be somebody stalking me in real life. They kept asking to buy me RP and give me money, and I ignore them. They have had my facebook account deleted, and I believe they may be behind the banning of my league account. If i had access to my friends list/messages, I could tell you the username. This person has been harassing me for ten years.\n\nThis email is a service from Riot Games Player Support. Sent by Riot Games.\n\nI refuse to give up on this. I am innocent, and have done nothing wrong. Would you expect an innocent man on death row to give up? As mentioned pre...\n\nOn the boards, somebody had the idea that it might be from the guy who has been harassing me. The one I mentioned in the first email. He has hacked...\nL\nLeague of Legends Player Support\nto me\n10 minutes agoDetails\n##- Please type your reply above this line -##\nHey loveroo,\n\nJust wanted to let you know that I’ve updated your request (#29800843).
