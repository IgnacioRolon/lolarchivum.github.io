Heck, you can even ban entire Roles on 10 bans forcing people to think creatively, dodge, or force a loss.\n\nMore bans are nice, but I wouldn't want them unless there's a creative way of doing it like Dota 2 does. I say this because I know 4 of my champions are Ban-worthy and I don't have enough experience with the other 6 in case those get locked out.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-11-29T21:24:19.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now bans are set up in a state where the same champions are banned all the time. \nBecause bans are at the beginning, and because Riot refuses to provide opponent information during banning process, players are led into banning the same champions that are STATISTICALLY the strongest or most annoying. \n\nFor this to change, more information has to be given to players prior to bans. Either push some of the bans into later picking phase, OR allow important information about the other team (who is an OTP, who is the strongest player, etc) to be revealed during bans. \n\nThis is the only way to prevent the \"always the same champions banned\" effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2016-11-29T21:28:41.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I said something similar to Dota 2 which is kind of serpentines.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-11-29T21:31:24.258+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember your post. \nI apologize for not giving credit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-11-29T21:13:52.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do people really ban Garen at Plat level?
