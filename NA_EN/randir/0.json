If they've been ranked but haven't played a match in 2 years, you can't take the name or tag. I wanted to make a team over a year ago called the Bear Claw Tribe. That name isn't taken, but BCT, the tag I wanted, is. That team hasn't played a game since November of 2014. I get that Riot doesn't want the teams that play sometimes to get deleted. But they do it for usernames, why not for ranked teams? The old teams don't even really need to be deleted, just the names made available. This would be nice because I'm sure there is more than one team that has been ranked in the past but is inactive now.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-23T22:28:43.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we can't release club tag names at all :(  I definitely understand your point regarding inactivity, but it isn't something we are able to do.\n\nJust to clarify further however, are you trying to create a new club with that particular Tag since Ranked Teams don't currently exist?","replies":[{"poster":"Randir","date":"2016-07-05T20:01:27.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apologies for the incredibly late reply. I was referring to ranked teams, because you can still do 3's on them and make new ones. I was hoping for a specific tag, BCT, to go with the Bear Claw Tribe team I wanted to make with my friends. It's been inactive for around 2 years. Riot has made usernames available in the past, maybe you could do ranked team names/tags? I don't know if this is possible, but you might be able to keep their records, just make them rename the team, like with usernames?","replies":[]}]}]}
