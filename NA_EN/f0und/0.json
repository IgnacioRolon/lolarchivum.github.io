The issue started when I downloaded the patch for Azir release, with extremely rare cases of the \"attempting to reconnect\" window popped up in game beforehand, and now its every 30 seconds in every single game that I try to play. I have run a speedtest when the \"attempting to reconnect\" window popped up in game, and had a connection speed of 51 mbs down 3.2 mbs up. I have run [this](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) with the only major aberration showing my router due to its lack of firewall.\n\nMy system specs can be seen *link removed due to security concerns*. The only thing thats on the low end for LoL is my processor, but it was running League fine until the Azir 4.16 patch.\n\nIt's not a hardware problem, connection problem, or driver problem on my end. That leaves a packet routing, patch code, or server issue as the main suspects.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-18T03:53:27.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm...it is hard to really say what could be the root cause.

Two patches back, I think, League suddenly started jerking around without the FPS or ping falling significantly.
