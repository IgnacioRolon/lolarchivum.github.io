I usually get a sweeper as a mid laner, get a vision trinket as a top laner, and get a scrying orb as adc or sweeper as support, while jungling i get a sweeper too. You need wards, but you need to clear the enemy's wards too. and scrying orb is like a free summoner spell, free vision and keeping vision for a couple of seconds?
