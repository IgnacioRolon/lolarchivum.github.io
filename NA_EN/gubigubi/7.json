Maybe you have seen me feeding in one of your ranked games before! I&#039;m a Fiora main with around 680k mastery on Fiora. I read a lot of comments every time Fiora does well in a professional setting about how she is very strong and needs to be nerfed for this reason and that reason. Now I see Riot is thinking about nerfing her. But I&#039;m here to tell you how to go about nerfing Fiora in a way that will make her more fun to play against without dropping her back down to 42% win rate. Or nerfing something on her kit that wont solve long term problems. I have several options that could be looked at in order to balance her in a way that makes her more fun to play against while also keeping alot of what makes Fiora fun to play in the game.\r\n\r\nFirst off I believe a little clarity could go a long way in balancing Fiora out. And by that I mean making it more clear to the enemy when Fiora is weak and when she is strong. To achieve this I suggest adding some kind of animation, sound, or particle effect to her Q (Lunge) if she misses a target and it goes on the long cool down. This will alert opponents to when Fioras main damage and escape ability is offline for longer than its normal cool down. I also believe doing the same with her W (Riposte) could go a long way in alerting opponents on when W is on CD. I suggest like with Q giving her W some sort of particle effect or animation (like a parrying dager on her back or a blue glow to her blue steel rapier) when her W is ready to be used. I think adding these alone would be enough to make Fiora a lot more fun to play against. However if that is not enough. Then we can move onto the next level of changes.\r\n\r\nFor the next level of changes to Fiora I would target her early game weakness and late game power. I believe as a duelist/skirmier she should be able to fight at all stages of the game instead of being weak early and strong late. It doesn&#039;t feel good to crush a Fiora in lane only for her to be unbeatable in 30 minutes anyways. And like wise as the Fiora it doesn&#039;t feel good knowing that you can&#039;t fight until this magical 30 minute timer goes off and you have 2-3 items. I believe she should be fairly average early, mid, and late game.\r\n\r\nHow would this be accomplished? This is harder to do than adding clarity but I believe the first place to target this change would be in Fioras W (Riposte).\r\n\r\nThe change would look something like this.\r\n\r\nW (Riposte): Attack speed slow 50% -&gt; 30%\r\n\r\nCooldown 24-22-20-18-16 -&gt; 18 at all levels.\r\n\r\nI believe this would allow other champions to have a more fair fight against Fiora as the 50% attack speed slow is hard to overcome in a lot of 1v1 situations even when you don&#039;t have CC that can be redirected back at you. The reduced cool down would give her a smaller window of weakness in lane phase but if the clarity changes I mentioned above are implemented it would be easier for opponents to take advantage of the window even if it is a smaller one. Even without the clarity changes the reduced attack speed slow on the W would weaken the spell enough that I think the reduced CD is justified but maybe to a lesser extent of 20 at all levels.\r\n\r\nI have a lot more ideas on how to balance Fiora but most of those involve making her manaless or energy based around hitting vitals to restore energy which I don&#039;t have worked out enough to bring up. In the end I think the changes I bring up here would do a lot in making Fiora more fun to play as and against without actually changing all that much around in her kit.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nAdd particles, sounds, or animations to Q when its on the long CD. Add an animation to W(Riposte) when it is on/off cool down to better show when Fiora is weak. Reduce Fioras W(Riposte) attack speed slow from 50% to 30% and decrease the cool down from 24-22-20-18-16 to 18 at all levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the numbers of the nerfs are numbers that can be changed. If Fiora is too strong after this then maybe change it to something like W 20 seconds at all levels and nerf the attack speed slow even more or remove entirely. But this is the type of nerf/shift in power that I think will go very far in making Fiora more fun to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-06-08T23:27:00.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Reduce the attack speed slow\n\nAnd change % Max HP True damage to % Current HP True Damage.","replies":[{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2017-06-08T23:32:58.073+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think %current HP would be a good idea.
