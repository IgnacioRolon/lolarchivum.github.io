It only pops up once, I can close with X, or click Yes/No and it wont come back until i log in again. Just a nuisance not a overall porblem. The \"Issued To\" On the certificate is www.bing.com so I'm guessing it has to do with IE somehow, though i've already tried a lot with IE.","replies":[{"poster":"EliteGandalf101","date":"2016-10-21T23:13:30.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah same with me I click the X and can continue to play ?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CowsIsANoob","date":"2016-10-25T17:16:48.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump until fixed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"corgisrock22","date":"2016-10-23T01:27:56.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing has been happening to me and i actually made a post about it. Its been happening for the past week, and i was concerned it had something to do with the cyber attacks that happened this week but i ruled that out. It pops up when i log in and pops up when i log out and then it crashes league. I tried setting my clock, and that didnt help. Nothing seems to be working. Ive even tried turning off certificates because in other pots i have seen that has helped, but it didnt for me. Hopefully it can be fixed?","replies":[]}]}
