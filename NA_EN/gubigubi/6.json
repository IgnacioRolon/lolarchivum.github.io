I got 20 some odd days left. I should make it back up.\n\nFunny, I want the same thing. By God I was already there and I idiotically chose to play a bunch of games with B4s and B5s. Couldn't carry some of these dudes and dropped back into Bronze. I hit a rough patch of some really really terrible allies and fell all the way down to B3.\n\nI have no doubt that I could get back to Silver. I actually fell to Bronze before playing with lesser players and I got back after a couple weeks. But now, I don't have enough time. I'm getting far too many uncarriable allies for me to make it before the 7th of November. I should have stopped playing ranked this close to season's end after making it to Silver the second time. Now I'm probably not gonna get that Silver border. Next year for that I guess. I'm gonna keep trying for it this year though but I have serious doubts.\n\nI've learned that climbing is not about being better than your elo, it's about being better than your elo AND having the time to play many games.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2016-10-19T22:51:58.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just treat the game like it's a chess game late game.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-10-19T23:31:31.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Kog NA,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=rWE3Mv62,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-10-19T22:51:58.137+0000)\n>\n> Just treat the game like it&#x27;s a chess game late game.\n\nLate game....now there' something I haven't seen in a while. I just had a game with 1-17 jungle Vayne on my team and a bot lane that gave a double kill in 2 minutes. There's no such thing as late game with these assholes I'm getting.\n\nI'm trying to ride this shit out until I start getting normal allies. They don't have to be particularly good, just good enough not to feed and I can ride my way back to Silver by hard carrying like I did before. I'll ride it out eventually. Only question is, will it be in time to get to Silver again before Nov 7th.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2016-10-20T00:51:00.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gave up on tying to get to gold this season.
