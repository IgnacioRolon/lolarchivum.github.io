I got this laptop from last October. After about one month, my keyboard started being dead when I play leag sometimes. When this issue happened, I have to push the power button to turn off my laptop since I can't switch to my desktop to turn off my laptop when my keyboard is dead. After I restart my laptop everything works fine again. I think it happens more often when I open google chrome while playing leag. So I think my laptop is fine or it just bc leag has some conflict with  my software like google chrome on my laptop??? If u guys can't fix it I think I will restore my laptop to the initial phase. And if I still have the same problem I will just buy a new laptop then.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T23:26:23.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something I haven't personally encountered before, but let's see if we can get to the bottom of that weird keyboard deactivation. Something in your league config files might have gone screwy which could be disabling your keyboard entirely. I'd like to have you reset your config files to see if that helps first.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nLet me know how that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"High Cool","date":"2017-04-19T02:13:29.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply. I did what u told me to do but last game I just played, the problem had happened twice ,so I restarted my laptop two times on that game. Idk why it only happens when I play leag. Others games like H1Z1 ,csgo , overwatch, hearthstone or watch videos were fine and never have this keyboard problem at all but only leag. I think I might just restore my laptop then.  RIP... this is why I don't play rank that much right now so risky...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-20T21:08:11.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That must be pretty infuriating =\\. Since resetting those config files didn't help we probably need to dig much deeper to find what's causing this. Hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to get to the bottom of it!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
