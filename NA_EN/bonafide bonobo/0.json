When Warrior Princess Sivir taunts, jokes, or recalls, her boomerang blade shrinks and intersects with itself. Apparently most Sivir skins shrink during these animations, but because of the shape of the weapon with the Warrior Princess skin, it self-intersects and looks goofy. This happens always and I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s because of the way the boomerang blade is shaped while using the same rig and animations as the base skin.\r\n\r\nJoke:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/za32lnA.png\r\n\r\nRecall:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HfhPgBh.png\r\n\r\nTaunt:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VQBoEWb.png\r\n\r\nRito pls\r\nIf it&#039;s too difficult or low priority to fix I&#039;d like some closure at least","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-19T02:23:53.573+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Altheras,\n\nThanks for the report! At this time, it's something we won't be prioritizing, due to the severity of the issue from game height/speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Bonafide Bonobo","date":"2015-12-19T02:56:34.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to respond! Knowing Riot is aware of this problem and will fix it when they have time is enough for me. I understand that there are a lot of important and time-consuming things that need to get done, so I don't mind waiting around for this issue to get fixed, considering how small it is.","replies":[]}]}]}
