This has been happening ever since I downloaded alpha client and I have lost over 50 lp!!!!!! because of this. After it happens once or twice I just give up and stop playing league. I dont get many chances to play but when I do this stupid problem keeps coming up. Riot please do something about this, its really frustrating. Is there something I can do to prevent it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-11T22:46:24.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see a black screen when loading champion select, then a bad connection could be the culprit. Connection issues can cause a black screen since the client isn't able to grab the information from our servers without a stable connection. Follow the steps in our [Connections Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and that should narrow down the issue for you.\n\nFeel free to hit me back if you're still having issues!","replies":[{"poster":"Hero To Villain","date":"2017-03-12T00:47:10.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay, thanks.

I messed up by making a very, very dumb mistake by repeating a racial slur that I was called. Literally everyday the thought of my permabanned account haunts me, and I'm not even lying when I say that. I reformed myself, I bettered myself but I still can't get Riot to help me. I just feel like I invested so much into my account and losing it all devastated me, even 11 months after what has happened. If you can do something for this account, I would be forever in your debt. Please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-21T02:53:34.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Racial slurs are not something we take lightly on the Summoner's Rift. However, if you are sure you did nothing wrong to receive a ban, you can always reach out to our support agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Hero To Villain","date":"2017-03-22T02:50:06.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am totally against the use of racial slurs myself, I'm not a racist. Although, I do admit I did get into a little banter with my lee sin because he didn't find my april fools joke funny. I have reached the support team but I found no success, i dedicated so much time and money into the account. Maybe if you say something it can have a bigger impact. Also, this was the ONLY event in which I demonstrated \"toxicity\" after my 14-day ban. I had been reforming but sadly I chose to fight fire with fire instead of ignoring/muting it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
