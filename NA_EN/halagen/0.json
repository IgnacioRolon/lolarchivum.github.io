It sounds like you are opening two different clients, when in reality, it is simply a single client.  If the client opens for your kid, and is able to enter his Username information and his password, you should be opening the same client and replacing his/her username with your own.  Are you attempting to open two different clients?  At which exact point does the client not open?\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing issues!","replies":[]},{"poster":"halagen","date":"2013-09-24T02:30:30.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i figured this was going to confuse..... so when i start up my mac.... it stops at a username screen.  if i load my username and start the game from my username it runs fine.... if i logout of the game and logout of my username and my kid loads his username and tries to run the game nothing happens or everyonce in a while it says there is another instance of the loader running then never loads.  i know from past experience that if i redownoad the game in his username it will work, but it will make mine not work.  im assuming its a permission thing, we have the same problem with command and conquer, so i just stoped playing the game.  i dont understand why, i have quite a few programs loaded on me and they open on everyone else's username.   hope this helps.... i think this is going to confuse more....","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-24T18:40:06.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!  I think I have a better understanding of your issue.  I believe you are referencing the Username for different profiles on your Mac OS, and not for League of Legends specifically. \n\nTo that end, I have heard of these types of issues before where the proper permissions are not set-up on your Mac computer.
