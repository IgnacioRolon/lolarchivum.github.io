This is what I found - \n\nI compared the timings between the two skins (High Noon uses similar style particles), as well as differences in animations and particles that may cause gameplay issues, and whether these issues are a. gameplay impact/clunkiness with the skin or b. differences.\n\nThe main points I grabbed from the post were issues concerning PROJECT: Yasuo were the (Q), (E), and auto attacks. \n\n**Steel Tempest (Q)** - Times line up here in terms of animations and particles. The only difference here is that PROJECT: Yasuo's orange slash particle is a bit thicker than on the base, and upon striking an enemy target, the hit has orange squares coming off of them, as opposed to a more windy-looking impact. \n\n**Sweeping Blade (E)** - Times line up here in terms of animations and particles. Differences here are that PROJECT: Yasuo's trail when he dashes is orange, as opposed to a fases blue (base), which may cause it to appear slower because it's more prominent, but the timing is still the same. In addition, the mark left at the enemy's feet may feel a bit different due to the digital square particle that times down on the PROJECT: Yasuo, as opposed to a smoother shape on the base. \n\n**Auto attacks** - Again, timing here lines up with animation and particles. The PROJECT: Yasuo skin has one different auto attack than the base - he makes an overhead -> downward hit motion, as opposed to the three sweeping motions that the base uses, which may explain the different feel. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind when comparing the PROJECT: skin to the base is that the SFX are not only different between the two, but there is some digital processing to the skills, which may feel different, and take a bit of getting used to. \n\n**TL;DR** - The findings are that the discrepancies between the two skins are **not** due to different timings in animations and particles, but are instead due to the difference in particles (more wind-orientated versus digital) and  SFX between the two skins. The thematics differ greatly, and in addition, since High Noon uses similar particles and SFX, there is a big jump between base/High Noon and PROJECT:.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jin and Toxic ","date":"2015-09-09T01:04:56.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that clears things up.
