I can enter any queues, play any games, and lobbies work like normal.\n\n---\n\nBut for now on my main, the game is literally unplayable. I can't get into any queues, none of my friends can play with me, and I'm probably gonna decay out of diamond if this doesn't get fixed. Does anyone have a solution to this problem?","replies":[]}
