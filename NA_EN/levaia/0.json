Thanks for paying attention to some of the subtle clues hidden in Kindred. I would say, that there is a LOT of headcanon around how she/they exist in Runterra. I don't think they're non-existent, but I adore your theory that they're simply a myth or a story. We worked really hard to achieve that feel. \n\nKeep making more :)","replies":[{"poster":"Levaia","date":"2018-03-15T19:34:24.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I was hoping I wasn't stretching too far on that theory, and it looks like I didn't.

You have a really good voice for this kind of thing, and the background music is a nice touch.  There's often a lot of stuttering and \"uhs\" in this kind of video, but you've clearly prepared.  I'm a fan of it.\n\nMy only complaint is the last three words in the title.  You don't need to do the clickbait title stuff.  Your content is really good and you're easing people in, and I think there's a definite audience for video content about League Lore.  Adding the Caps Lock and the multiple punctuation marks makes it look a little unprofessional, and this has a high enough quality that I think that's a detriment.\n\nKeep up the good work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strange Plant","date":"2018-03-15T21:31:15.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was an awesome listen, I really enjoyed it.
