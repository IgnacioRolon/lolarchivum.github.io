As it happens, my roommates entered (and got runner-up, you can check it out here: http://red3141.github.io/UrfChallenge2015/ )\n\nAnyway, you&#039;ll notice it doesn&#039;t have any music.  While I&#039;m not sure what the original plan was there, one morning I woke up and thought - I can do that.  So I dusted off my old milkytracker (which I never really learned to use in the first place) and got to work.  Since the game is all about URF, I found a recording of the URF login-screen music and decided to re-create it, chip-tune style.\n\nAbout half-way through the process, I discovered they couldn&#039;t use it since that&#039;d be three people.  Too bad, I finished it anyway.\n\nSome notes:\n\nI never actually learned milkytracker before so this was my first project and a huge learning experience.  If there are things you think suck - they probably do.  I _probably_ am already aware of them, but please let me know your suggestions or criticisms.\n\nYou&#039;ll notice the lack of manatee sounds - I was too lazy to make an extra 6 sequences to add random things to it.\n\nErm, yeah.  Have fun and stuff!","replies":[{"poster":"Utora","date":"2015-05-15T23:43:27.926+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha! this is awesome! great work dude.","replies":[{"poster":"ConcernedSheep","date":"2015-05-16T02:00:18.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks!
