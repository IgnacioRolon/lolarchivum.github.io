Right. The ones who frequently miss obvious broken shit that the game has to deal with for months before Riot FINALLY fixes it after everyone yells at them for months. MONTHS.  \n\nSorry, I have literally no faith in their designers or play testers.\n\nHere is what I think: Riot entered the market at the right time to capitalize on MOBA popularity. Their success is largely based on that. The game itself is just a copy of DOTA. Its nothing original. Nothing in the game is especially creative. Mark Merrill if you read his old blogs, is an ego maniac who blames players for not understanding how hard it is to be so successful so fast. Poor guy. And its people like him that fostered the toxic douche bag work place that got them sued.  \n\nRiot makes EA look great.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Queen Of Tears","date":"2019-05-10T06:32:06.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"shhhh my post got taken down because I asked for my LP back after showing actual evidence that my support was win trading and that my adc was afk but they just took my post down","replies":[{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-05-10T06:50:04.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me guess, name-shaming the other players and/or insulting them in a way that crosses the line?","replies":[{"poster":"Queen Of Tears","date":"2019-05-10T21:29:08.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"uhm no i didnt even say the players name I litterally said that they ran it down, and told them to watch the video along with leaving a link to my op.gg so they know what game to im talking about","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-05-11T00:58:28.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you didn't put the names here, but you linked to them?
