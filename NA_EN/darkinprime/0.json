Aatrox' play patterns feel different cause his gameplay revolves around Q sweet spots and setting up opportunities to land them with his W and E.\n\nRiven is more up-tempo while Aatrox requires more calculation. Skirmisher vs Juggernaut.\n\nI don't think Riot should restrict their champion designs by denying certain mechanics from new champions or reworks just because they have been used on another champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Jericho Azariah","date":"2018-06-14T01:23:31.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes!! The thing is, they are not allowed to re-use the same design plot at all, they may use a small portion to design something more unique in it’s own way, but they can not copy and paste a entire plot design, place it on to another individual, and then slap the title “original design” on those that weren’t originally it’s owner.\n\nAnd it’s basically the same thing as to have the same kit on everyone, there is no originality, there is no diversity, it doesn’t make anything special.

We already have an ADC class who rely on one thing: auto attacking. Does this mean they are all the same? No. They have different niches while filling the same role. Same with Aatrox and Riven. They both are combo ability using melee characters who fill a different niche.\n\n\"What’s the point of playing a older variant when a new and up to date variant shows up.\"\nCause some players prefer to play a skirmisher and some want to play a juggernaut?\n\nThey are similar yes, but they are not the same.

And don't state the notion that they are different, just cause one is older vs another that is newer yet following the same template.","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2018-06-14T16:23:58.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you want to use the argument that Aatrox used to be sustained damage user and isn't that anymore, that's reasonable. But saying he's the same as Riven is not.\n\nRiven's kit doesn't support her being a juggernaut. She lacks sustain and relies on damage mitigation which is a skirmisher attribute.\n\nSustained damage melee champions are hard to pull off and are rather old design. Aatrox needed an auto range increase on his ultimate to work properly so he wouldn't get kited. I think there's few other dedicated sustained damage melee character in the game (Trynd, Olaf, Jax and Yi) who more or less all have reliable ways to close in on the enemy and stick to them. Aatrox' ability to stick to enemies was bound to his ult which made his usefulness very limited outside his ult.\n\nMaybe Riot deemed there were enough sustained melee characters in the game and wanted to take another look at a champion design with more combo focused gameplay. There was only one combo ability melee champion (Riven) but there were like 5 sustained damage melee champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Jericho Azariah","date":"2018-06-14T20:17:37.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But he fucking is!!

I know people are not going to like him because of how passionate they are about him. This was the same case 5 years ago with Karma. This is the case with so many champions that get these types of reworks. Yeah, it's not old Aatrox but at some point he was going to get changed like every other older champion in the game. The difference between a Karma VGU and Aatrox VGU is that they at least improved Aatrox and didn't change everything entirely. He at least has completed animations and a fleshed out design. It might not be the type of you work you guys wanted but at least he is a completed and cohesive champion.","replies":[]}]}
