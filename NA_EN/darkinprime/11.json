Its so FUN to watch a champion get all of his health back after he runs away from the fight for a few seconds....WHILE doing great damage and being great in team fights for his team.\r\n\r\nBut ya know, AATROX was the problem. \r\n\r\nFucking JOKE.","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-06-29T05:58:08.947+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo is on the VGU list you clown.

There's a roadmap for a reason, and a **lot** of older champions that need tuning as well. \n\nAfter Akali and Nunu, my bet is Mundo is probably going to be one of the next three precisely for the reasons you speak of.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkinPrime","date":"2018-06-29T15:35:26.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He shouldnt.
