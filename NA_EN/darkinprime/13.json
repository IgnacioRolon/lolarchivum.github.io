They either become too strong through their sustain when they are buffed, or they turn into the feast or famish when nerfed. Thatâ€™s why they changed Swain because it was quite the conquest trying to balance out the numbers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkinPrime","date":"2018-06-29T04:41:03.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Please.

I'd often heal for 300-500 every like, 2 AAs with Guinsoo's and Death's Dance. Yeah, he's gotta auto attack, but so do they...\n\nI think you're just being hostile to be hostile. When Aatrox was released, he didn't need to be fed to steamroll. He literally just ignored the existence of his enemy and freefarmed, or if they actually tried to fight them, won any trade they made with ease. There were very good reasons as to why Aatrox was nerfed into oblivion.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDevice","date":"2018-06-29T04:30:52.019+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"They've already said he's getting a rework im pretty sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2018-06-29T07:41:22.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheDevice,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4XjzHlPr,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-06-29T04:30:52.019+0000)\n>\n> They&#x27;ve already said he&#x27;s getting a rework im pretty sure.\n\nI haven't seen anything on that.
