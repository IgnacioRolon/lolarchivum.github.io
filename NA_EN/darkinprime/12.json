Are you just banking on new players and to hell with the people who build up the game (die hard players)?\r\n\r\nI think you guys have lost perspective on what is the game should be doing.  As you add complexity, balancing becomes exponentially hard. I understand that game changing a little bit here and there, small tweaks from time to time. However, it seems like champions and items are always undergoing large changes.\r\n\r\nIts not fun when everything shifts too much too fast.  Then we have to deal witn new brokenness, and wait for you to roll it back OR just make EVERYTHING else stronger.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe your company lacks leadership in the sense that, balancing is just part of the process of making money. Its and end in of itself. The point of balancing seem to be simply to change things. \r\n\r\nYou are driving away dedicated players, and trading them in for players who, at best, will be here for a few months or year, until newest flashy latest and greatest thing comes out. \r\n\r\nGood luck with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-06-24T19:46:40.241+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"The boards always look like they hate the game, it's just where people come to complain.
