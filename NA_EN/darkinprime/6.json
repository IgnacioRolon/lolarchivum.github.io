Before the MYMU, you almost never saw support brand.\n\nActually, the reason he sees more play as support is mostly because of his ult. In mid, you might not always be able to have your ult bounce on the intended target, but at bot, it will usually bounce between adc and support because they are usually grouped together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Barcid","date":"2018-08-07T04:37:50.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He very much can still go mid. It's that Brand as a champ has always suffered from two glaring flaws: he is predictable and he is unreliable.\n\nHis ult has a tendency to be... moody and just bounce to what it wants to, and seemingly every so often it changes on a whim how far the range it's willing to bounce to is. His Q is a bitch and a half to land at max range unless the target is a) moving predictably or b) directly on top of him so that it hits immediately. Believe it or not the worst place to be is faceplanted in Brand's chest during a 1v1 as that usually means he's getting off the full combo (unless you're able to instagib him).\n\nWhat bot offers Brand is two things: one he has two targets at all times, so his abilities combo much, much better. Two, Brand gets bushes, which means if the enemy doesn't get to see him cast, the enemy can't tell a combo's incoming.\n\nHonestly, even with Brand's high damage, if vision wasn't such garbage right now (for early game you only basically get a ward every 2 minutes and it only lasts a minute each) Brand would find it much harder to win lane since enemies could see what he's trying to do more often. As it is, he gets one combo off from an unwarded bush and suddenly you're dodging mortar shots under turret the rest of lane because you can't stand to try and fight him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VexingRaven","date":"2018-08-07T04:08:38.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OtterlyLost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MVlPfTEe,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-06T16:45:37.557+0000)\n>\n> I wish they&#x27;d change him and give him the tools to go mid rather than bot as a support... he only goes down there because the targets are squishier, his base damages are high, and his % health damage means he can do a lot of damage with very little gold or items. :/ he isn&#x27;t a support, not in any real sense, but people get away with calling him one because he has a single stun.

This way he has to commit to building AP to do damage and not 1/2 way with only support items. As for his passive, give it a base damage value of like 20 damage every second with a ratio that adds %-damage based on AP; there you go his passive is now weak with no AP but strong if he builds a lot.\n\nSadly, it likely Riot will just wind up nerfing him into the ground instead of a more reasonable approach.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Giga Baboon","date":"2018-08-06T20:25:31.979+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you climbed to diamond you wouldn't see brand anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-08-07T01:34:30.311+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"7% play rate is \"every other game\"?\n\nFiddle is played more bot then brand despite being nerfed recently lmao","replies":[{"poster":"DarkinPrime","date":"2018-08-07T02:35:38.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thats very high pick rate.
