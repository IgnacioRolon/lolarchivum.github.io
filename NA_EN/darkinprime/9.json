All they had to was keep his poke magic damage, reduce his healing a tad, increase his toughness, and make his ult a team fight area buff.\n\nThey easily could have worked with the old kit. Don't buy their drivel that it was unworkable. It wasnt. They lie to us because in the end, they look down on the players, which is a direct result of a toxic corporate culture started by Marc Merrill whos ego is so big he can't even see the ends of it so he probably doesn't even know he has one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2019-05-04T22:34:03.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point, it probably has to do with the nature of the drain tank.

A russian accent with slight reverb over it. He needs the deep, guttural demonic reverb.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-05-04T21:52:21.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They keep adding damage to the top lane roster rather than survivability and sustain, makes me Q _ Q","replies":[]}]}
