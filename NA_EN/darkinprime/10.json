Who benefited? \r\n\r\nSurely, his rework didn't attract new players to the game.  \"League looks lame...wait, holy shit, they reworked Aatrox I guess I will sign up\" Okay, THAT didn't  happen.\r\n\r\nSo who was it for?  The non Aatrox players were not hoping for a rework that they would like. I don't sit around hoping a champion I don't play gets reworked into something completely different so I can maybe like him.  So, how would it be for the benefit of non Aatrox players for this rework? Clearly they were content maining other champions.\r\n\r\nHow about the Aatrox mains? The ones who clamored for years demanding a rework? Well, most of them are not happy.\r\n\r\nI personally have abandoned the champion.  The insult to injury started when the ricklessabandon did that absurd mini rework, which made Aatrox's revive contingent on stacks, thus making him very easy to tower dive when behind, and adding a lot more complication to playing him.  \r\n\r\nSo, basically no one has benefited. Hes just another champion who has an abusable kit for people at high elo to cheese with.  So people are playing him. So what? That doesn't mean anyone, or the game, has benefited from this new Aatrox.\r\n\r\nSo why did Riot do it?  Well, incompetence comes to mind. They didn't have the creativity to created a balanced champion out of Aatroxs kit.  Also, bad PR.  They spun a narrative that Aatrox was toxic or unfun.\r\n\r\nYou know whats unfun? Darius ulting 4 of your teammates. Or Tryndemere lifestealing BETTER than Aatrox ever could. Or Trynadmere hitting R to win, literally. LeBlanc, who kills you before you can possibly react and then gets way with it scott free.  \r\n\r\nAatrox was the least offensive, and you could EASILY counter build to shut him down, and avoid 1v1 fights.  \r\n\r\nI'm sorry, but this was a horrible decision. A lot of you like to chime in who side on the sidelines off this--you never mained Aatrox, you have no idea what you are talking about. Don't waste my time and come on here parroting what you THINK you know about him, often from Rioters like rickles who never even played the damn champion.\r\n\r\nThis was a shit decision. If ever have the means to acquire Riot in some massive multi billion dollar transaction, everyone who had a part in this is going to get fired. I promise you, I will never forget this ass fuckery. They took away the only champion I really like to play, in the only game I liked to play, which was a reprieve from my chronic depression, PTSD and anxiety.   So, Riot can go straight to hell for 1) not actually giving a shit what Aatrox mains said 2)telling me, literally, that they listened to Aatrox mains and polled them, which is a lie. I have an account with over 10,000 ranked matches on him. They never polled me and 3)making these asinine changes for the benefit, literally of NO ONE.\r\n\r\nAll of you at Riot should be fucking ashamed of yourselves. How dare you promote game, ask players to spend countless hours playing to get good or climb, and the nullify their time spent by changing a champion into something where literally ZERO of the skill set translates over to the new kit. How fucking dare you defraud players of their time they spent on YOUR game.  \r\n\r\nAll of you who never played Aatrox should be outraged. The point of game is that the rules dont't really change to the point where the basics no longer apply.  Hockey, baseball...football, you could tweak the rules and yet the same basic mechanics are needed.   But when you completely overhaul a champions kit that you may have practiced with for years you are basically telling us that we have no job security so to speak with any main, and that OUR time is worthless if you deem it so. \r\n\r\nAgain, go to hell, everyone a Riot who had a part of this shit decisions and shit design and who helped peddle the lies. \r\n\r\nYou know who you are, and you should be ashamed of yourselves","replies":[{"poster":"Moonscourge","date":"2019-02-17T23:55:40.279+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"He was weak garbage before that had a kit that was intentionally kept weak because he would just statcheck everybody else.

Kinda funny how his old kit fits his new lore better than his current kit, seeing as how he’s supposed to use the blood/bodies of his enemies to improve himself. (Hence why almost all Darkin are supposed to be able to utilize Fleshcrafting/Blood Magic of some sort.) In fact, the whole concept of the Darkin is confusing now—the definition is quite literally Ascended who try to gain personal power, yet they refuse to see Renekton and Xerath (provided he is an Ascended) as Darkin and at the same time say that if someone saw Renekton they’d call him a Darkin (Which is just a title now). I can understand the tiny wings, I get that he’s supposed to be a colossus now, but I’d still prefer the old or somewhat bigger wings and him having an improved version of his old Q. \n\nI also get that he’s supposed to be nigh unkillable and can probably reinforce himself with magic, but why not make some of the Chitin that his old form had to make himself even harder to kill? His model, while also looking terribly pixelated, is like 90% red now, and his new splash art, despite its attempts, just doesn’t look menacing to me. Rather, it looks like I do when I view it; mildly annoyed that it exists. \n\nAside from that, some of his gameplay just doesn’t make sense. Any carried over aspects feel superbly underwhelming, with his healing being nearly unnoticeable until late game and his ult essentially being his old passive and R mixed together yet worse still. Why does the blood colossus hurt a target for max health, reduce its regen/healing/shields, and lowers cooldown with every ability use? Why can he swing his sword 3 times in less than a few seconds (Which, mind you, is supposed to be proportional to his size—colossal—but apparently is also small enough for humans to wield comfortably, and nothing in lore states it can change size other than this inconsistency). Where do the chains in the ground come from? How would a colossus be able to dash with no charge up considering its size and the fact that it is made of flesh? Even Galio, a Petricyte golem that can absorb and utilize the magic around him and is of similar size to Aatrox has to charge up before being able to dash any distance. \n\nI’m not trying to say that all of this is terrible and that Riot is horrible for making these changes. It just seems to me that all aspects of this (Story, Design, Balance) works off of bad material or the material is turned bad on its way to delivery and there’s nothing they can do about it. I think it’s commendable the ideas the story team is trying to go, but they’re focused too much on Shurima/Targon/Void aspects in too many things. I just wish the Darkin wasn’t one of them. And Aatrox’s while wanting to eliminate himself is pretty stupid based on his plans (attack everything until something kills me) seeing as how him being trapped by cosmic magic means only cosmic beings will be able to kill/free him. Why not make him decide to go covert and try to find ways to solve this problem while secretly building himself up and improving himself? Other than this, the handling of other Darkin characters/stories have been done relatively well, though they could have done a bit better at fleshing out the backstories of Varus’ shared minds (can’t remember their names). I actually quite enjoyed the color story where Misha betrayed the assembly of Darkin despite my disposition to some of its base ideas.\n\nAddendum to gameplay, the design team says that they took into consideration the Aatrox mains, but I doubt it. His whole schtick before was that of a battle manipulator and hard to kill. His new schtick is being a one-person-lock and hard to kill. Let’s see what carried over and was used. His old passive allowed him to revive every so often with bonus as and ad based on how much you hurt enemies over a moderate period of time, while his new one deals large damage and reduces healing/shielding for a bit. His old passive has essentially become his Ult but an active instead, but his new passive draws from nothing. The original implementation would have fit so well with his new theme that it’s sickening it was thrown out. His old Q let him fly into the air and knock up at most 3 champions and damage minions around the landing spot after a short delay or let him escape, while his new Q is him smashing his sword into the ground and knocking people up in a small area. While all aspects are carried over, him knocking up some people and being able to escape (with his e), the implementation is less than fine. His whole personality being angry, straight to the point, aggressive, somewhat honorable, etc and he prefers to stay back from a battle rather than charging in? Honestly, it would’ve been better if they reworked his old Q into a better ult than what it is now. His old W allowed him to either heal every 3 strikes or deal extra damage at the cost of health with the same trigger, while his new W allows him to shoot chains at a target that drags them back if they don’t escape an area. The healing was carried over as an inferior version of Death’s Dance’s passive as an attachment of his E. This is the only time chains have even been associated with his champ. Why add this? His old E allowed Aatrox (the sword) to emit 2 rays of energy towards a point, which had an admittedly weird hit box, while his new E is a very small dash with some insignificant healing attached. There wasn’t even an attempt to convert this, they drew a medium-ranged flight-to-knockup on impact and the ability to heal based on your health/deal damage based on your health into a VERY small dash and a rehash of Death’s Dance but worse. His old R improved his passive based on how many enemy champs were nearby and improved attack range, speed, and damage for a small time along with a bit of AOE damage on cast, while his new R does almost the same except is also allows him to use his old passive. I still can’t grasp the concept that he uses some sort of magic to increase his already colossal size three-fold and give him access to the ability to resurrect himself.\n\nThe balance team...exists. You can refer to the rest of the boards for you to determine your own opinion on them. All I’m gonna say is that Ohmwrecker has sat through several seasons and through multiple balance teams as the least used item, as well as that I’ve actually never seen almost all of the new items introduced in the past 2 years in any sort of use.\n\nAll in all, while the story team tried to satisfy the question of who or what the Darkin are, they didn’t do it in a way which feels organic. Even so, they do make good use of what they have without going too far or too short of the expectations they set up in a satisfying way. The design team, however, seemed to decide that they wanted to only take bits and pieces of the original Aatrox, make them worse, then add mechanics that don’t really fit his story/personality. The result is less than admirable. The art team did seem to try, but his splash art seems goofy and his model seems just...infuriatingly less detailed than his original model.","replies":[]}]}
