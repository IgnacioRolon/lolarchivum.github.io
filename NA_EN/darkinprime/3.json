They had an issue that his only form of success is him stat-checking you. He either healed enough or didn't no in between. He just jumped in and did just that. Warwick is another drain tank type of champion and they have no problems with him. Why? because his only form of success isn't \"I heal more than you can damage me\". He has other forms to achieve victory... like getting a priority target with his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-05T19:38:36.730+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why is \"Aatrox rework is bad\" so frequently followed by \"revert Aatrox\"?

His ult was a PBAoE followed by a few seconds of increased autoattack range.

His kit was pulled in too many directions. Unlike the champions I listed, whos build are very straightforward and nearly the same every match, Aatrox heals were scaling off of missing HP, but he also needed damage items and he still also needed Attack Speed.  He desperately needed all 3 of those, where as tryndamere, for example, only needs AS and damage. His ult negates his need for defenses. \n\nAnd I meant his Dive, obviously. If you actually knew fuck all about the camp and the history of his patches, there is only one thing I could have been talking about. So, since you have no idea what you are talking about, maybe try not wasting my time.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-06T19:45:16.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkinPrime,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mdU7FbBP,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2019-05-06T19:26:29.336+0000)\n>\n> haha \"skill expression\" spare me your made up terms that people use to try to sound smart.\n> \n> Furthermore, Aatrox actually had too many build choices.

He was only a stat check because Riot gave him no innate tougness or shields or resistances, so they made him rely too hard on heals. ALl they had to do was reduce his healing, give him some toughness to soak up some damage, and make his ult a team fight buff.\n\nThe issue here is Riot lied to us to justify their changes. There were a million ways to balance old Aatrox.\n\nAlso, when behind old Aatrox was not all famine, you could change the build and still be useful to the team.\n\nEverything thing Riot said as reasons to delete old Aatrox are either lies or gross incompetency.","replies":[]}]}
