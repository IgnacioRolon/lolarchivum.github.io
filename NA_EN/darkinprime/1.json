A circle that shows the range of the ability. When you actually try to use it, it seem like a much shorter range than indicated by the lines","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2019-05-14T20:45:54.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you play a champ with a big hitbox its like a panth q with more damage and a slow.","replies":[]}]}
