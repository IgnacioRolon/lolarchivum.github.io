(i.e. Kayle is suddenly polymorth in the middle of ult and does no damage).\n\nKayle's ult is supposed to be an immunity from both CC and damage, or the ultimate should be renamed a damage immunity, which does not include immunity from crowd control. \n\nI've played before where the Kayle ult successfully cancels Amumu's ult, and was told by a Kayn player that even his R doesn't work when Kayle is ulting. Hence, I don't see why there is suddenly an exception for polymorthism CC by Lulu.\n\nIs anybody else experiencing this? If so, I really hope to see this fixed, before this special case of Lulu's w successfully still working on Kayle while ult is in duration gets exploited in higher ranks.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-29T11:00:55.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Fat Yordle,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=EmIA92Am,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-06-29T10:01:39.947+0000)\n>\n> Kayle's ult is supposed to be an immunity from both CC and damage\n\nThis hasn't been the case for many years.\n\nThis is not a bug.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-06-29T10:53:58.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle's ulti grants her _invulnerability_.\n\nHow the term \"_invulnerability_\" is defined, may be slightly different to how it could be interpreted in everyday language.\n\n_Invulnerability_ in the context of League, only makes her **IMMUNE TO DAMAGE** (and different to damage reduction, invulnerability also blocks true damage entirely which otherwise can not be reduced by any other means). It does not however, grant her immunity to CC.\n\n* This is the same as how Taric's ulti which also grants _invulnerability_, does not block CC but only damage.\n\nSo yes, Lulu should be able to polymorph a Kayle during her ulti.\n\nAnd in fact if Kayle's ulti actually cancels CCs in any case, that is a bug that should be looked at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyMonkeyCZ","date":"2019-06-29T10:07:21.777+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayles ult gives invulnerability(an effect that reduces all damage taken to 0), I would need clip to believe you that you ever canceled Mumus ult(and it would be bug), that's how it works.","replies":[]}]}
