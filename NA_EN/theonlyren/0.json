But she mentions it a few times when recalling. &quot;Buhru Latachi,&quot; for instance. So I&#039;m assuming Buhru also means home, or something along those lines.\r\n&quot;Altak&quot; based on the context, I think means &quot;Behold.&quot; She only says it at the start of a few chants or when she ults. Behold is typically used at the start of most sentences.\r\n\r\nI love conlang, and I&#039;d love to have the full context and translations of Buhru&#039;s language, or, at the very least, a translation of the lines Illaoi says in game.

That's unsatisfying. And also makes it difficult for potential Fanfic writers. Buhru sounds like such a cool place and yet there's very little we know about it.\n\nI suppose it makes sense since most Bilgewatrians probably have never set foot on Buhru. But still, even the most exotic and distant languages have translations. You had to combine words from different languages to make Buhrun, right? Something that would have been impossible or otherwise very difficult if you couldn't understand the words you were using in your native tongue, right? Most other conlangs in movies and video games are translated if only for the sake of convenience. \n\nGranted, Illaoi only speaks a few lines in-game using her native tongue, so ultimately, not that big a deal, I guess? I still would've loved to know more. =/","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-04-05T03:41:40.989+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your working on some fan-fic I'm happy to give you the language rules though.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOnlyRen","date":"2017-04-05T06:20:58.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=OPkqt6tg,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-04-05T03:41:40.989+0000)\n>\n> If your working on some fan-fic I&#x27;m happy to give you the language rules though.\n\nClose enough!

(very and crudely abridged)\n\n**Buhru Language Guidelines _(not rules)_:**\nWords are built on combinations of Aztec and Ancient Greek, with additional elements of Hawaiian, Aboriginal Australian, and Latin. \n\n**Rythmn and order:**\nVowel sound are often built into consonants.  Examples.  Oro, aco, ata, umo etc..  for Compound vowels this is also true.  So Oalo,  Altua, Uocae,  \n\nMost words end in a vowel (if feminine) or a compound consonant (if masculine).   i.e.  tl, chtl, ect…  C is an exception to this and may end a masculine word.\n\nFull words are usually  (not always) three syllabi.   Iccia.  \" Eye’Sse’a.\"\n\nTwo syllables words do not usually exist alone and have a, three letter word adjacent to them or merged into them.   i.e   Kaiya-oto.     Kai’Yah  Oto.     Two letter words are adverbs or adjectives.   (like Japanese use of –san)\n\nThe language is broken into three syllable words, two syllable words, and five syllable words.   Typically a single thought takes about twelve syllables.  \n“Kaiya-oto iccia, ohomoc-ata uotaca.”\n\nPunctuation:  Never use an apostrophe ‘.  For longer words use a – if needed.   \n\n**Vowels:**\n“Ao” does not exist.  Use “Oa” instead   \n“Ea” does not exist.  Use “Ae” or “æ” instead. \n“E” letter does not exist. Replace with “AE” or ii    (Sean = Siian)\n“X” sound does not exist.  \n“Er” sound does not exist. \n“Ir” sound does not exist.\n“Ou” do not exist. Replace with “ua” or “u”      (out = uat  \nOO does not exist, except at the end of feminine words.  (boot = Buot / ) (Llatoo )\n“AI” sound very rare.  Do not use this sound most times.\n“AS” does not exist and is not used.\n“Y” is only used at the beginning of a word for the “eye” I sound. \n\n**Consonants:**\n“K” is replaced by C\n“M” is only used next to vowels and is never the beginning or end of a word.\n“S” is replaced by C.  The S sound does not exist. \n“T” is never alone.  Add another consonant.  Tl, Tl, Tc, t… \n“Th” sound does not exist.     Do not use this sound.\n“H” is never used alone.  (hr , htl etc..)\n“U” can be used as vowel or as consonant for V\n“L” is never alone  (The “L” sound is always long.  IF using L  Add another consonant  \nLl, tl, lw, lc, ul, etc..)\n“Sh” does not exist and is not used.\n“V” letter does not exist. For sound replace with U. \nBe aware and avoid direct use of of Tl, Tc, cll,  Chtl, Ythl, etc…\n\nSome Random words:\nXaiv\nYurochtl\nOqul\nIlluora\nIlluka\nIwtia\nIctae\nGuyra\nKaiya\nIoelu\nAtha\nOctala\nQo-a xoas\nXoas\nQo-a Yegu\nSa’eu\nTua\nQo-uto\nIbuhr\nVae-a\nPoao\nOpochtli\nColotl\nYaotl\nCoatl\nOtomoc\nTlaco\nNlaepin\nXoco\nRava Ocllo\nYutu\nCuri\nBauhro Laidahcii\n1.\tBradhuc Ladcii\n2.\tBru-ahcci Lahdi\n3.\tBurahdatc Lacbi\n4.\tBuahdacci\n5.\tBuara Dalii\n6.\tCtamacihtol\n7.\tAltoc\n8.\tAlthabo\n9.\tAbulaccanii\n10.\tUcanu\n11.\tChodatc \n12.\tBuzulduac\n13.\tYuotldii Lahyi\n14.\tArzintli Qaoc\n15.\tLcaoc\n16.\tAocarzintli\n17.\tOpochtli\n18.\tOalhauchtli\n19.\tQoachitli\n20.\tYulutl\n21.\tUbrucii\n22.\tQoasotl\n23.\tOzoac\n24.\tUqioc\n25.\tOhlaoc\n26.\tUlioc\n27.\tYaotl     (enemy)   Modify to Yaotli\n28.\tArzintli    (water sacred)\n29.\tQaoc Cuatl\n30.\tQtocaotl\n31.\tOwaimoc\n32.\tUwan Yaowc   (Oo’wan Shaos)\n33.\tIllaoi  \n34.\tIlluka\n35.\tGuhra Ctaoc  (Gow’ rah  Shaos)\n36.\tXaoc Guhra\n37.\tKaiha\n38.\tIoilu\n39.\tAta\n40.\tSa-iu\n41.\tTua\n42.\tOto\n43.\tOmu\n44.\tVaia\n45.\tUpali\n46.\tOpochtli\n47.\tQalotl\n48.\tCuatl\n49.\tCaolz\n50.\tOzomoc\n51.\tTlaco\n52.\tTaepl\n53.\tZocua\n54.\tRava Ucllo\n55.\tYutu\n56.\tCuri\n57.\tOctulu\n58.\tGhiara\n59.\tNura\n60.\tTlatha\n61.\tYuralha\n62.\t Tjorrah\n63.\t Yllacta\n64.\tTuamaz","replies":[{"poster":"JacobusSimon","date":"2017-04-06T20:10:53.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I understand this. Got a few questions.\n\nIs \"Eye’Sse’a\" meant as a pronunciation guide of \"Iccia\"? If so, why does it include \"s\" if that sound doesn't exist?\n\nAlso, which sound are you referring to when you say that \"“X” sound does not exist?\" \"X\" can mean two different things in English orthography (/ks/, as in \"fix\", or /z/ as in \"xylophone\"). And neither of those involve vowels, so why is it in that section? I'm particularly confused since the letter shows up in example word #36.\n\nWhat are the bracketed bits after numbers 32 and 35? I'm inclined to say they're meant to indicate pronunciation, but one of them starts with \"oo\", which is stated to be impossible. This also raises the question of what sound \"u\" is actually supposed to make, as it shows up all over the place.\n\nWhat sound does \"q\" represent? It's usually a /k/ in English, but since \"K\" is supposed to be replaced with \"c\", I wanted to make sure.\n\nNumber 62 includes the letter \"j\". Which sound does that indicate?
