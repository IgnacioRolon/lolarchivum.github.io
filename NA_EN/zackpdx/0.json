The only issue is that I have to wait literally MINUTES for the results page to appear after a game. By the time I get into the results screen, everyone has already left lobby and i can't talk to anyone how the game went. I believe it's because of all the animations, etc. I have low-specs mode on, but it still literally takes 3-4 minutes to load the results page and it is beyond frustrating. Any tips on how I can shorten that??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-19T22:25:28.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This might be because you have [Close client during game](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) enabled in your client options.  This will result in relaunching the client after the game ends, which may take a little longer than already having it up.  Disabling the option should help with speeding things up!","replies":[{"poster":"zackpdx","date":"2017-04-20T07:23:50.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works!
