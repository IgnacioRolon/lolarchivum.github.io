From what I've gathered from a rather unhelpful reddit thread is:\r\n\r\nThere's the LCS (NA/EU), LCK (Korea?), LJL (Japan) and LPL (China). Teams in the current regional competition brackets have gotten there after qualifying in a Challenger Series. Each win gives them a point which helps in their regional standing. If a team goes into a losing streak, they are relegated and eventually after forced into a \"relegation match\" with another low-standing team.\r\n\r\nTeams cannot enter regional competition brackets after the Challenger Series completes. The Challenger Series completes before Preseason matches begin. Anyone can create a team, but only teams in the Challenger League can complete in the Challenger Series.\r\n\r\nTournaments like IEM do not count toward a team's standing. Teams qualify for such side-tournaments by the amount of wins they have in their regional competitions. \r\n\r\nIs this all correct?\r\n\r\nOther questions:\r\n1. What is a split?\r\n2. What are the ramifications to be relegated? What happens to the team that loses the relegation match?\r\n3. Does each region enter worlds with the same number of teams?\r\n4. The LJL was just created. Can they compete in Worlds?\r\n5. Am I correct in my understanding of regional team placing with each win counting as a point and a loss not counting at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-03-18T00:13:55.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll throw what little I know in, hope it helps:\n\n1) What is a split?\n\n* a split is a part of the competitive season, usually consists of X number of weeks. For example, NA has a spring split, some kind of inventational, a summer split, then worlds\n\n2) What are the ramifications to be relegated? What happens to the team that loses the relegation match?\n\n* relegation means that a team drops out of the lcs and has to fight the up and coming teams if they want back in.\n\n3) Does each region enter worlds with the same number of teams?\n\n* No. How the number of teams sent to worlds has changed from year to year, but in general: NA, CH, KR, and EU generally have 2-3 teams while other sections of the world get from 0-2 depending on how they perform in the international wild card tournament.\n\n4) The LJL was just created. Can they compete in Worlds?\n\n* Yes and no. They have a chance to compete. Due to how young they are, and the small pool of prospective teams, they are to compete in the international wild card tournament to gain entry into worlds.\n\n5) Am I correct in my understanding of regional team placing with each win counting as a point and a loss not counting at all?\n\n* I unfortunately don't know enough to answer this question. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-18T13:57:49.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"5) Am I correct in my understanding of regional team placing with each win counting as a point and a loss not counting at all?\n\nLPL (China):  Does best of 2 series. 2:0 wins = 3 points 1:1 = 1 point for each team 0:2 loss = 0 points\n\nLCK(Korea): do best of 3 series, but they add in a point system for MVP. Other than that they do not have a point system. They used to have a point system prior to the conversion of Champions from their previous (Best of 5 format) to the LCK (Riot schedule system).\n\nLMS(Tawain) GPL(Remaining SEA teams) LJL(Japan) CBLOL(BR) VCS(Vietnam): are all teams valid for the wild card slot depending on their performance in the Wild Card Tournament held before worlds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OhOkYea","date":"2015-03-18T00:11:16.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It works like this:\n\nVow celibacy\nGet pro\nFuck cosplay hos with herpes\nHope you win lots of money or you be working at mcdonalds in your late 20s","replies":[{"poster":"61MpFf0Njt","date":"2015-03-18T00:26:05.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha.

A split is pretty much a season\n2. (I only know LCS rules) 10th place is replaced by 1st challanger team, 8th and 9th battle 2nd and 3rd in a best of 5 for their spot\n3. NO. NA, EU, KOREA, CHINA each have 3 teams. Southeast asia gets 2. Then the rest of the regions battle in another tournament to get in worlds\n4. Maybe? They are probably one of the teams that will battle the other regions (Brazil, turkey, Russia, Oceania, idk what else)\n5. Depends on region.
