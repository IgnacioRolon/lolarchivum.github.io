Gets past 33% starts 2/2 and gets to about 40% when it finishes downloading and then gets to about 45% applied patches (not applying) and freezes. Sometimes it gets to more but I leave it overnight and when I check it it has disappeared. Try running it and rads error comes up or unspecified error and it won't even open. I have to restart several times to fix then goes back to 33%. I always run as admin my laptop is new tried 3 internet sources reinstalled 50 times get the occasional bug splat but it never downloads. Just eventually disappears. If u need logs plz tell me which ones.
