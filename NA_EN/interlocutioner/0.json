I'm a big fan of your work on reworks and have a few questions:\n\n- This isn't meant to be a statement on the quality of the story (you did a great job on Pantheon) but why was the decision made to move away from Celestial Pantheon? I know quite a few people felt the 2016 take was unsatisfying and incomplete, and it certainly adds a quasi-Kratos archetype to League but I'd like to hear your thoughts on why the call was ultimately made to not explore the Celestial Pantheon instead? We have precious little insight on the mindset and motivations of Targon and Pantheon, out of all Aspects, was the one who never relinquished control and who could offer some insight  into celestial affairs with some nuance and who was himself extremely underdeveloped due to how much focus his previous bio placed on Atreus.\n\n- Is Atreus' certainty regarding the evil of the \"gods\" something you'd like to challenge in the future? \n\n- What can you share about the implications of replacing/rebuilding War? What consequences are there to a human potentially becoming a Celestial? The way I've been interpreting it celestiality comes at a price, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on what that could mean for Atreus, champion of humanity, as he gradually becomes or is connected to something  other than humanity. Is that something Riot intends to explore?\n\n- How do you imagine Pantheon would feel about beings like Ornn, Nasus or Morgana? Entities who, in spite of their power, have seemingly retreated for so long, even as people suffer without them. Or about ASol? Who is himself a victim of Targon's games?\n\n- Any tidbits/cryptic hints you can give us about how Swain tricked the demon? \n\n- How was the process of writing Nunu like? He really does capture that feeling of childhood wonder, how did you go about \"identifying\" what makes something feel like \"childhood\"? \n\nFor snippets, I'd love something about Swain and the demon (how they communicated before the deal or communicate now after it, how he copes with the power he now has)  or about Pantheon versus Aatrox. \n\nThank you for doing this. Hope your current projects fare well.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2019-10-15T22:17:15.129+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"We moved away from the Celestial because we found something compelling about the man who was burned away. It was really that simple. Sunny (Kindlejack on the boards) described how Atreus always stood up, and I asked myself... what if a man stood up from a blow that killed a god? What would that mean? Riot Scruffy also really wanted to know why Pantheon fought. What's behind the \"one man army\" fantasy that gameplay was working on?\n\nI ended up writing a story sketch (really rough, meant-to-inspire-but-not-be-shippable flash fiction) examining this question. Having Atreus be interrogated by a vision of Pylas, demanding to know why he fought. Every answer he gives is revealed to be a fallacy, an excuse, and is torn away. Until (bear with me, this is bad and you're not supposed to see it):\n\n> “I fight because I have no choice,” Atreus said, his fury rising. “Because I am mortal! All of us here on this mountain, we either fight or we wither away! Every time I’ve failed, every time I’ve struggled, it’s only reminded me that I can’t stop. That my battle is nothing compared to that of the grass and the wind. There is… no struggle for a god,” Atreus suddenly realized. “So what did I think I would do with your power? How did I think I could have it, and still be me? I wasted my strength, there on the mountain...”\n> \n> “Finally, you speak the truth,” Pylas laughed in the voice of thousands, bringing forth a gush of blood onto his chin. “Now tell me, mortal who must fight. Why do we? Why do the Aspects?”\n> \n> But before Atreus could answer, the golden light in Pylas’s eyes faded. And as they once again closed… Atreus finally opened his. \n> \n> The first thing he saw were the stars, shining weakly through the thin air and clouds, dimmer than they had ever been. As if a constellation were now missing.\n> \n> It wasn’t until he felt a twist in his shoulder that Atreus looked down and finally realized, it was not a spear piercing through a god’s chest, spilling blood that could blot out the stars—but a demon blade through his. \n\nAtreus's certainty will definitely be challenged in the future. Leona wasn't necessarily wrong when she advised against fighting the barbarians, preferring to defend. Atreus is determined, in part, because of guilt. Because he knows he got Pylas killed.\n\nFor replacing/rebuilding War, yes! We're already exploring that, and there are many potential answers if you dig deep. The constellation starting to reappear. How Atreus can only access the powers through strength of will, how the weapon must ignite from what is within him. These are all clues, things you can interpret and spelling it all out would ruin the fun.  {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} Seriously, my favorite narrative moment in video games was figuring out the KOTOR twist a few planets in. \n\nRe Ornn etc., how Atreus feels about the powerful is directly tied to what they do with that power, and why they seek it.\n\nOne tidbit I can give about Swain is that no one has correctly guessed what the darkness is that he sees yet.\n\nFor Nunu, I drew directly from my own past, more than any other character. Nunu's relationship with his mother and Lissandra. His loneliness. What imagination means for him. What really unlocked it all for me was when I wrote the final Nunu story sketch. I made it the same way I made books in elementary school. \n\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Nunu_Willump_Storybook_j0jryyctjtph7kvk7swr.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-10-15T20:09:36.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for doing this!

Everest. Like, a volume right from the middle of the story, in a box of graphic novels on sale. What impressed me more than anything was the depiction of how... there's never a moment of silence or rest that high on a mountain. Scenes that otherwise looked peaceful and still would be betrayed by the sound of the wind, and by how desperately the people climbing the mountain had to fight to survive. That feeling became this line.\n\nA pitch example. I actually like to be very open at the beginning of the champion development process, and create \"thumbnails.\" One paragraph lore/archetype summaries that capture some of the things the team has been talking about, but take them further. \n\nThis is a good example, one from Nunu. Because you might be able to see that while we didn't go with the pitch, many elements carried forward. Being from a tribe that roams the Freljord, having a power that Lissandra wants, etc. (For Nunu &amp; Willump, I pitched ten thumbnails total, for what it's worth!)\n\n> Pitch 5  - The Circus that Saved the World\n> \n> Nunu and Willump belong to a troupe of performers that roams the Freljord in tinker carts, putting on shows in exchange for trinkets. (Think the circus, and Willump is the star “fierce animal who’s not really fierce” act.) After learning the truth about the troupe from his parents (they are gathering up relics to keep Lissandra from acquiring them, and summoning the Watchers), it isn’t long before the Frostguard arrives, and many are killed. Nunu and Willump escape the attack, stealing a shard of true ice from Lissandra that Nunu uses to make infinite snowballs. In Lissandra’s hands, it’s a far deadlier weapon, and she’ll do anything to get it back, along with everything else Nunu “stole.”\n> \n> Future: Eluding Lissandra long enough to find Ashe\n\nThat might be a good segue into a discussion about our process. Riot does things differently from a lot of other companies. The designer, concept artist, and writer are all there from the beginning, brainstorming and trying to inspire each other. This is called DNA, because... Design, Narrative, and Art. Also, the whole deoxyribonucleotide thing. \n\nTypically, we'll start with some high level goals from Reav3 (and increasingly, a gameplay hook that's already proven promising, to avoid painful pivots later; if gameplay doesn't work, nothing does). With or without a gameplay hook, these might be as simple as, lighthearted female top laner. Or, sci-fi aesthetic, high agency marksman. From there, everyone starts pitching ideas back and forth, the more the better so we can discuss and get a broad view before narrowing down. This is called the \"DISCOVERY\" phase of DNA. For narrative, this is typically when you brainstorm different backstories, themes, story arcs, and maybe explore them in story sketch form to see what inspires others.\n\nOnce we have the general gameplay (what we call \"pattern lock,\" we know what the champ wants to do to win, but not every ability), concept, and narrative in place, we start \"IDEATION,\" really honing in on specifics. Going as deep as we can on one idea. For narrative, this means starting to write VO and finalize the character's personality, understand how that ties into gameplay and the broader themes in place, and communicating with other team members as they start to animate, explore VFX, etc.\n\nFrom there, we'll enter pre-production (focusing on answering any in-game questions have arisen), and then production (just making the thing).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pale Mask","date":"2019-10-15T22:43:31.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.

I've known Pantheon as the proud Stanpar warrior who joined the league because he got offended that there was an institute of war that did not think of him or his people. Now after all these years we finally again have a Pantheon who is a mortal man who will greet battle like an old friend. \nThe divine Pantheon, aspect of war and so on was a completely cool idea that I really enjoyed. The issue that I feel comes from something like the god Pantheon is that there is no place for character growth or ability to relate to him. He was cool and badass simply for the sake of being badass. With the new Pantheon you reintroduced the human warrior that many of us league veterans will remember. But now he is a combination of the first and second iteration, combining humanity with godly powers. It is a wonderful narrative of a man who resents the gods but uses their powers. He is not truly just a human and I love the potential inner struggles and conflicts he has with himself. These are wonderful sources of character growth, something Pantheon direly needed in my opinion. I am happy that Pantheon is more than a jacked angry dude with a spear now. Hes finally a compelling and intricate character while still remaining faithful to his very roots. \n\nThe only issue I have with the rework is the lack of sunshine in this bread loving warriors life. \nI think its obvious what I am getting at.

From friends to being estranged and now to enemies, its the only story development that saddened me as Pantheons contempt seems to be mostly directed at Leona (and Aatrox) if voice lines are to be believed. \n\nI can't really see why Pantheon would despise her so much. Is it not her duty to protect the people of the mountain as leader of the Solari? In Leonas short story she defended the mountain against invaders, in Pantheons lore story he defended the mountain which was besieged by Aatrox. They both clearly work towards the same goal with overlapping motives, the protection of their people. I understand that Pantheon has a great aversion towards the gods after what was done to him and is angered that Leona did nothing against the barbarians, only to later find out that Aatrox was the real threat all along. Yet in his one line towards her he insists that she is stronger than she knows without aspect and armor. Id really want to know what their exact relationship is now and how it could evolve. Would he help her for the good of Targons people? He aided the Ra'Horak, which are under her command. Where does he draw the line? Would he help her soldiers but not Leona herself if she needed his help just because she is an aspect? \n\nDo you think that expanding their story is something we could expect in the future? With Pantheons lore now updated is there any chance for progression in their story and/or relationship? Targon is such a interesting place and id love to see its two oldest champions interact more and hopefully grow past their misunderstandings.The amount of fan art for the two of them leads me to believe that I am not the only one who liked those two teaming up. What better way to defend the people of Targon then by joining forces? \n\nCongratulations and all the best to 10 years League of Legends!

He'd probably  be more open now when it comes to Leona. That line is meant to show he doesn't hate her for who she is, he is frustrated because he sees who he thinks she could be. Who she might _already be_. \n\nSometimes we're blinded by our prejudices, and our pasts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2019-10-15T21:39:36.256+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How strong would you say Pantheon is compared to the other Aspects?\n\nI’ve always imagined the Aspects would look like the fights in Fate/Apocrypha.

But I can give you my perspective as a member of Champions team.\n\nRedoing lore is hard, and redoing the redoing of lore even harder. Pantheon is the first champ I worked on who already had a post-Summoners reboot, and I personally made it my mission not to change anything I didn't have to, otherwise... what's real? I hope the things that some people didn't like right away ended up becoming meaningful parts of a bigger story.\n\nIn other words, it's starting to get really hard to make changes, and so it's important to make the right ones at the right time. I love updating lore when we do VGUs because it's a chance to take a step back and ask, \"who is this character really? Why do I want to be them for 30+ minutes at  a time?\"\n\nShyvana has come really, really close to getting a VGU, on Reav3's last poll.

They talk condescendingly and sarcastic to each other. The ultimate \"thing\" was she'd change the map to a Dark Star theme like the DS event. \nWhat do you think about that? Or is that not really in the Narrative realm? \n\nSyndra, what exactly is her threat level and overall power level? Is she the most powerful in Ionia?
