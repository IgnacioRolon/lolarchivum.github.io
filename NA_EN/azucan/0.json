Now however, whenever I try to run League I get a strange error.  Every time I try to run league I get an error that says \"Another instance of this launcher is running.  Do you want to terminate it?\"    Even if there isn't another version of the launcher running.     The League icon will flicker and then nothing will happen, no matter how long I wait.   If I look at my background processes I see 2-3 instances of the LoL patcher running both of which are consuming 0 resources.     \n\nAt first I thought it was a permissions error - but I get the same error even if I disable Windows Defender.\n\nIf I run the program as administrator and I get the same results.   \n\nMy system is running Windows 10.  \n\nI've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times, but it doesn't help.\n\nAny ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-14T02:40:39.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you said that you can see 2-3 instances of LoL running in your task manager, but you don't actually have LoL open at the moment, it sounds like some of the files are still running from when you did have league open. While it doesn't look like League is running, those processes in the background might still be stopping the client from launching. \n\nLet's try closing out those extra league processes so that you'll be able to launch a fresh copy of League. Let me know if that doesn't help!","replies":[{"poster":"Azucan","date":"2017-04-14T23:07:20.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't seem to be the issue.   If I restart my computer (so I know for a fact that nothing lol related is running), then try to run lol I get the 3 instances of LoL patcher and 1 instance of Riot Client Patcher.     None of them are doing anything and they don't actually seem to open anything or give me anything to interact with.   No error code, nothing.    \n\nIf I try closing out any one of those league processes they all close.  If I try to boot up LoL again then I get the same error. \n\nI've run LoL for years without any problems but this error has been driving me crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"Azucan","date":"2017-04-14T23:49:02.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I figured it out.
