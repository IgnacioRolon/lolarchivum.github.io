This makes orbwalking require significantly less APM than if one were to use A-click only.\n-----------------------------------\n\nHere is the full editing procedure for those unfamiliar with the process:\n\n1. Log into your account. This will sync the PersistedSettings.json file from the server. Delete that file. (Located under the Config folder of your LoL installation.)\n2. Edit the input.ini file entries as we proposed.\n3. Open a custom game. The settings should now be usable and synced to the server. A new PersistedSettings.json file is created.\n------------------------\nSetup in the video:\n\nUnder input.ini:\n[GameEvents]\nevtPlayerMoveClick=[Button 2],[Shift][Button 2] \nevtPlayerAttackMove=[Button 2]\n\n(this way you can use Shift+MB2 to cancel the Attack Radius)\n\nUnder Game.cfg:\n[HUD]\nMinimapMoveSelf=0\n----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT: Spam clicking is not necessary at all. The Range Indicator stays on even if I only click once. Right clicking does not issue any command other than movement. Attack Move is only confirmed when you left click.**","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-10-20T09:32:38.705+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":12,"body":"I need something like this except for Diana ult range.

That's always been their policy when it comes to this stuff. Edit your config files outside of the client, use custom skins, switch your voice files over to the japanese ones (several rioters actually posted in reddit threads about this saying 'neato, i'm gonna go do that too!), whatever. They won't be putting engineers to work to make sure these things don't break every patch but you can feel free as long as they work - they just won't fix it if it breaks and if you enter a support ticket they'll say 'sorry can't help you, try repairing your client'.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-10-20T19:51:48.612+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"This isn't a cosmetic change. \n\nIts giving players additional information by automating an action, both of which are against ToS.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2016-10-20T19:53:31.040+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WoonStruck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TyoBElNR,comment-id=000400000000000300010000,timestamp=2016-10-20T19:51:48.612+0000)\n>\n> This isn&#x27;t a cosmetic change. \n> \n> Its giving players additional information by automating an action, both of which are against ToS.\n\nNo it's not.
