The best thing you can do is get the enemies to focus you or bait them when you're lower, but make sure you have enough stuff (abilities, Summoner spells, Potions), to survive. Having said that, a 0 killscore is expected of supports, and while 13 deaths is generally quite a lot, at the end of the day what matters is if your death helped somehow. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb on higher levels, acceptable would be anything in the 4-8 deaths range especially since your ADC was so dominant (18/3/8 if I see correctly).\n\nWhen your ADC gets 2-3 kills that means you don't have to risk your neck as much any more, so your deaths should mainly come from these first kills, if at all.\n\nA lot of support players get a bit eager to help their team get kills, but your deaths actually matter more than the kills you enable, so your first goal should be to keep deaths at their lowest possible.\n\nYou also bought 0 pink wards. You should always make sure to have a pink on the map (hidden in bushes) as ANY role, but especially as support.\n\nThere was a video on YT I watched quite a while ago called \"why your deaths matter\" that explains why you should AIM for dying as little as possible quite well if you're interested. \n\nKeep it up, you'll improve :)","replies":[{"poster":"Master9875","date":"2014-11-07T17:28:09.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hello,\n> \n> To nitpick, it was 1/13/8, but based on your level and your zero experience of being a support, no, I'd say you don't suck.

However, what do you do in a situation where the enemy team is focusing your carries like crazy? Mid game was a total slaughterhouse in bot lane.

A link to a guide or you just typing it in would be helpful!","replies":[{"poster":"Maester Seymour","date":"2014-11-08T08:59:34.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of details which I can't cover in one post, but the basics are:\n\n1) Ward safely\n\n Don't facecheck bushes to ward them cos that will get you killed. A LOT. Either do it over a wall, or do it when you see 2-3 enemies elsewhere on the map. And always be ready to run\n\n2) Buy a sightstone as soon as possible\n\nObvious, but just in case you haven't seen it, there is an item in the shop that provides you with wards, and refills each time you go back to base. It builds off of Ruby Crystal (400HP item), and gives you a fair amount of health as well. This item is a must on any support, very cost efficient, very useful.\n\n3) Ward \"multiple entrance\" paths.\n\nThe best wards are placed where there are multiple entrances to access your lane or the map in general. Botlane tribush for example is basically a three point entrance and warding that can prevent jungler ganks very successfully, provided you look at the map (You should make a habit of checking minimap every 5ish sec, cannot stress this enough for ALL roles). Another one is the small brush near dragon, which is also a great spot for a pink ward. \n\n4) Lane brush warding can be just as important\nIf you have a Leona as an enemy support for example, you need to ward the brush she is in otherwise your risk her jumping you and landing her CC before you can react. It's always a good idea to ward the bushes on the lane, but only if you feel threatened by whoever goes in there. In higher level s that can also prevent jungler ganks, as smart junglers will come behind the lane when your minions are pushed up and you cant see them, then go into the bushes from behind.\n\nHere's a good guide that explains Map Control through warding:\n\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Master9875","date":"2014-11-08T19:57:27.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok guys!

You poke when able and have your stun up very often to create lane pressure. (Because going in for an engage is going to result in you dropping your stun on somebody and landing your full combo with your ADC lane partner also following up.)\n\nDo note that this only really works well with ADC's that have strong burst combos or very long range poke and can take immediate advantage of the short stun time to auto-win trades.\n\nShe was more popular back at the start of the season really.

In other words, use champions whom are not required to start the fight, or enter the fray of the fight itself, Nami (if you can land her bubbles), Annie, Lulu, Morgana, are all good ones.\n\nOnce you got a good handle, it becomes easier to learn how to play 'carry' supports, Blitz, Thresh, Zyra, Leona, and Braum all come to mind. The critical part of learning these champions is recognizing when is best time to initiate, (Braum's ult, Thresh and Blitz's hook, Zyra's AoE denial, Leona's AoE stun.). If you initiate poorly, your team is going to pay dearly. \n\nI will also warn you, ignore what many of people who are critical of you are going to say. Many people claim support is useless when the reality is far from the truth, but a good support can have a huge impact on winning the game, and vice versa, can cause a game to be lost. Focus on communicating with ADC, and don't worry about negativity from other people, the job of a support is a pretty thankless one in most cases. \n\nSo yeah, just practice, and welcome to the world of supports :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2014-11-07T20:40:06.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play a lot of support, but here's how I measure my success when I have to fill as support:\n\nIn the laning phase, if I have more kills than my ADC, and they were kills I could have given to my ADC, or I accidentally take it with a DoT or something, then I'm doing my job wrong. It's okay to take kill if you know your ADC can't get it. If I have less deaths than my ADC, and I could have protected my ADC in a way that they would not have died, then I am not doing my job. If you could not do anything to protect your ADC, then it would be acceptable for your ADC to die. Also, you should have more assists than your ADC.\n\nIn the mid to late game, do the same thing, but apply it to the entire enemy team.\n\nThroughout the game, make sure you ward as much of the map as your ward slots allow. If you don't have wards out on the map, then you are likely doing a bad job, although if you got super ahead in the game and bought an item that wasn't sightstone, then it would still be reasonable to have less ward coverage.\n\nHowever, support mains can probably provide better advice on what a good support score is better than I can, so take my advice with a grain of salt, unless commented otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master9875","date":"2014-11-07T17:44:22.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump??","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-11-07T17:02:35.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports can have a wide range of acceptable scores,  and your performance (early game at least) will largely depend on your adc.\n\nA support's job is to protect the adc and set up kills for them. Some are better at the former (soraka) while others are better at the latter (blitz) and others yet Excel at both (thresh). \n\nA good score for a support would typically be something like 1/2/20. You want to participate in a lot of kills,  but typically you want your teammates to get kills and you get assists (they need the gold more). You'll accidentally take some kills though,  or in some cases you'll need to secure a kill the adc can't get. In general,  you're better off securing EVERY kill,  a good carry will get the kill anyways and it's never worth the chance they escape. There is no such thing as kill stealing,  kill gold + assist gold > kill gold only,  even if some goes to the support.\n\nYou want few deaths. Supports will and should sacrifice themselves to save the adc or any carry,  but these are calculated decisions. You shouldn't sacrifice yourself for a tristana who has her jump up in 0.5 seconds. Basically,  a sacrifice is only worth it if the move definitely saves them and they were going to die without the move. \n\nIn general,  a support should have the best KDA via having very few deaths and many assists. Obviously this is easier said than done. I'm solo queue,  your success will fluctuate a lot based on the adc you're with. Just keep practicing and try to notice your good plays and your mistakes rather than just looking at a KDA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master9875","date":"2014-11-07T17:01:31.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the probs was that me and trist were being focused by the enemy team really bad.

Ideally you want to have at least double the amount of kills/assists as you do deaths.  Like 1/5/10 would be a pretty good score, then 2/5/18 or something would be very good.  Like, you had a good number of assists and kills for a support, but any time you have deaths in the double digits (in any role) is a bad situation.  You have to have a pretty obscene number of kills/assists to ever justify having 10+ deaths, IMO, if there ever is a justification for that.
