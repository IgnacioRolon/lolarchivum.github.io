I'm probably biased towards this gamemode because of the sheer number of games i've put in it, and i wouldn't have played it that much if i didn't enjoyed it so keep that in mind. But i think it's our opinion as ARAM Mains that should be voiced, because until now i've read only opinions from people who hated ARAM, it's random comps and most of all those so called \"ARAM ACCOUNTS\" with 10-20 S-Tier champ unlocked.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, i do play almost exclusively ARAM, does it make me one of your \"ARAM ACCOUNTS\" ? i own 105 champions as of now out of the almost 150 champs in the game. And i feel that Riot's addition of 3 free champion rotation should have been a pain in the asses of those accounts i hear so often about, but if you want to get rid of these, the solution is easy : unlock every champions for everyone in the ARAM Queue, it was done for ARURF so it is possible in theory. Anyway i felt that what is giving people too much good champions are Rerolls, the Reroll Bench who provides a way for people to reroll for their teammate, which is in my humble opinion the reason why people used to see \"OP\" Champs in almost everygame. Another thing to take into account is the sheer number of people who dodge the queue when they're not satisfied with their champ but i digress.\r\n\r\nSo instead of taking care of this problem once and for all, we're given a lot of experimental changes this patch, and i'm here to give my honest feedback on it, and i encourage everyone of you to do so too.\r\n\r\n- First of all, BANS : from a quick look at these boards, there are a lot of people arguing against Bans in ARAM because they are perceived against the spirit of this game mode, but also a lot of people who are happy to ban champions they think OP in ARAM. I do think it is contrary to what we all think of when we think of ARAM, not to mention we have to wait 30 more seconds every time someone dodges of the queue. I have seen bans evolve from Poke champs to Tank and Assassin champions over the course of the event, if anything else they are a good indicator of what people perceive as the op champions here. Big nod to all those people who ban \"None\" to voice their opinion on them.\r\n\r\n- Specific Champion Changes : This i think is the most polarizing changes of the patch, It could be used as a way to force a 50% win rate on everychamp in the game mode, but i see two problems with it.\r\nFirst of all if those are to stay, it will require permanent attention from Riot and will have to be balanced on a patch-to-patch basis, if you guys are thinking about forgetting ARAM for another year, please don't keep those changes live. \r\nSecond, for some champion it totally miss the mark, for example \"Veigar : +5% damage taken\", because everyone complaining about Veigar in ARAM were always complaining about his tankyness. Some champions have received very harsh nerfs (needed or not, is not my place to say) but others have been totally ignored, like Master Yi for example who already was a sleeper op champ in ARAM.\r\nSo if you wanna do this, you better do it correctly, i predict it will take a lot of work to keep it updated, and from what i gathers i don't think Riot wants to devote that much to balancing Aram.\r\n\r\n- 900 Unit Poke Barrier : i do think 900 is pretty random, Blitz Q is affected by it, but i've read somewhere else that Zyra's plants weren't. it feels a bit wonky, and right now Poke champs have been nerfed a lot, probably a bit too much with this mechanism and Specific champion changes in my opinion. luckily it doesn't affect ultimates.\r\n\r\n- Speed of minions spawn after 15;00 : i don't really understand why making every ARAM end after 20 min is a goal in  the first place, most of them do already anyways since last year changes, it's been feeling more and more like a coinflip, and comebacks are getting rare, but they seldom happens, it seems to me like you guys don't want people to turtle in and have a chance in \"late game\". It is somewhat an ok change to me, although most waveclear champions have been nerfed already.\r\n\r\n- Specific rune and item balance for ARAM : Yes, Yes a thousand time yes. Presence of Mind and Triumph were the first offenders in this category, they were ultimately busted for a game mode that see so much teamfight, I Abused it, so did everyone else and it was kinda gross.\r\nNerfing Warmogs is alright, with nerfed poke tanks don't need all that regen anymore, they were always a great asset to win the game, and it's gonna be even truer now.\r\n\r\n- \"New\" Items : Mariner's Vengeance is fine to me, it's a way to get around the guardian angel ban in Aram and still provide an item with a similar goal to AD-based champs.\r\nGhostwalkers : sigh... last year it was already a pain in the ass to have this item on the map, from enemy assassins wiping your backline almost unnoticed, to your teammates charging alone to their death because they can walk through walls it doesn't promote healthy gameplay to me, especially since they are a glorified better version of Kayn's E. i feel bad for him. Either make the user of those boots more visible when into walls and where they're gonna exit it, ot get rid of it entirely.\r\n\r\n- Turret destruction : This is pretty outrageous to me, not only turret were already extremely weak in ARAM compared to the number of people fighting around it, but now they get destroyed even quicker ? I know you guys want to shorten ARAM Games, but this is too much, you can now lose both turret and one inhib from an Ace at 7-8 minutes, that's just too much, BTW i think turret plating was a good idea for SR, i would have liked something similar in Aram rather than just Paper turrets. Have you seen a demolish proc on these ?\r\n\r\ni think that's everything, as i sad before i invite everyone to chime in, in particular ARAM Mains, we don't want Riot to cater to those who ain't gonna play the game mode once the missions are finished. I'm worried about this because i have seen a great deal of difference in the player base since the event launch, from toxic people to people straight inting and ruining the games for everyone else because \"it's ARAM\".\r\nAram mains care about Aram, let's get our voices heard.\r\n\r\ni Apologize in advance if there are some spelling errors in my wall of text, English is not my mother tongue, please bear with me\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-poppy}}","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-04-07T18:41:57.057+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"8k arams here, now keep in mind I have only played about a dozen arams since the even launched and most of them today and yesterday but after so much grind in the mode I think I can judge most of the stuff that was introduced.\n\nThe minion and turret changes to speed the game up are just a big fat middle finger in the face of any serious ARAM main. They make the mode very unfun for people that want to have fun and very exploitable for tryhards. None was complaining that arams were not ending quickly enough, definitely not aram-mains.\n\nI think bans are necessary if they aren't going to unlock all champs for all people,  casual aramers might not realise how big of an issue Aram-only accounts are but as soon as you start playing game in game out with only those accounts it's just a pain, especially if you come up against a 4-5 man premade with only op champs 3-4 times in a row. Either allow everyone to limit their champ pool OR unlock all champs for everyone, no other way to keep it fair.\n\nThe items are meh, not much to talk about, I like the AD thing that doesn't let u die for 4 sec but guarantees the death after (there are very easy ways to play around it, just run away they will die auto lol) Ghostwalkers are a must imo, to enable assassins access to the backline without having to spend an entire summoner spell for it. I wish they had introduced some more items from Blitz but that's very subjective.\n\nRune tuning was a godsent although some runes were left untouched.\n\nthe 900 distance damage reduction is absurd simply because they already introduced champ-specific nerfs/buffs and introducing both together makes it very difficult to discern which should be tweaked and how (I think we all agree the changes are not fine tuned to perfection). But if they remove the champ specific tunings (see below) I would like to keep this nerf but not at 900, maybe at 1100 or 1200.\n\nWarmogs change was ok but I think there is a better way to go about it. (tanks are very very very powerful in the hands of a diamond main or above in aram but I don't think riot care about us that play the mode and don't give a fuck about SR)\n\nI think the champ specific nerfs/buffs are a bit bullshit, I don't think Riot will put the effort to update these every patch so I would rather they just ditch them. But if they are seriously gonna keep them, PLEASE riot judge with high aram MMR games and not with casuals that don't even have 2k games.","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2019-04-07T19:41:52.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I think giving everyone access to a limited random champion pool would be great.

The bench did seem to introduce more op champs, but it also made champ select much less painful imo. I don’t like how bans extend the time of champ select (especially when so many people doge the last second) but I wouldn’t mind too much if it stayed.\n\nPoke barrier depends solely on how far away the champ is I’m pretty sure. I have  definitely seen it activate when attacked by Zyra’s pant and she was far away. I’m not sure it should exist though. It’s nearly invisible, not intuitive, and mode specific.\n\nI personally really like the champ balance. As long as they check in on aram every month or so it’ll be fine and requires very little time investment from Riot. The balance changes made each patch usually do not change a champ’s aram win rate to a significant margin. It would unlikely ever be worse than the S champs having 70% winrates.\n\nI agree ghost walkers should be more visible to lessen the gap between those who tunnel and don’t notice its users and those who will always spot its users. Kayn’s E is better though. Much lower cooldown, longer duration, heal, can be used in combat, and doesn’t silence. Fun fact/sad bug: Sion can’t ult through walls with ghostwalkers despite the description “ignore terrain collision.”\n\nPersonally I’d like to see bounties nerfed or removed, increase gold gain a bit in compensation.

Nid's spear is still going to make you lose half your life.  That is the problem with how they did it.  It applies the same % to all champs, but does not have an equal impact.  Some champs are still doing huge poke while others are very much less effective.  I find consistent harassers were hit much harder than the occasional hitters.  If you don't get the kill, often the champs are getting healed quickly.  So an occasional Nid spear is still deadly because of how much it chunks in 1 shot.  I played Nid and honestly didn't feel much difference.  On the other side, I played Karthus and with his nerfs, it took me about 20 min game to do the same damage I was doing in a 12-15min game.\n\nThe long range poke barrier should just be removed, and do specific adjustments to the champs that are too oppressive.","replies":[{"poster":"You Are Cute XD","date":"2019-04-08T14:52:11.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, nidalee doesn't feel much different because she got a damage buff as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2019-04-07T19:32:05.167+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ARAM only accounts name is just a problem with there being no suitable acronym for those lux, ziggs etc accounts.

Big nod to all those people who ban \"None\" to voice their opinion on them.\n\nDon't care too much about bans but in the current form of ARAM I'm glad they have them. What I would prefer is individual champion pools for every player, so that currently top tier meta champs could more reliably be countered without needing to ban them(if you hate for example Sona, you throw champions into your champion pool that are good against Sona). It would make the game mode a lot more complex though for the average player, but many ARAM lovers would attend to their champion pool so it should be fine. \n\nIn case you don't know what a champion pool is, it would be like a rune page so it could be edited by players outside of the game. They could put in and take out champions they do or don't want to get randomly generated for themselves. This could allow them to abolish the bench and rerolling since all the champions are approved by the players. If players wanted to get more organized, they could have teams where some players draft only certain kinds of champions into their champion pool so that a team would be more well-rounded. Riot could tweak the pool minimum count as necessary to prevent whatever they would consider an abusive level of control.\n\n\n> Specific Champion Changes : This i think is the most polarizing changes of the patch, It could be used as a way to force a 50% win rate on everychamp in the game mode, but i see two problems with it.\n> First of all if those are to stay, it will require permanent attention from Riot and will have to be balanced on a patch-to-patch basis, if you guys are thinking about forgetting ARAM for another year, please don't keep those changes live.\n> Second, for some champion it totally miss the mark, for example \"Veigar : +5% damage taken\", because everyone complaining about Veigar in ARAM were always complaining about his tankyness.

Cutting his durability down discourages him from building defensive items and makes him less of an issue in that regard. Is that fair? Probably not, but that's the change they made to him. I'm more concerned with something like Maokai not getting his CC cooldowns touched but instead he gets damage numbers changed as if that was what made him strong but it wasn't. I like a lot of the buffs and nerfs but I feel like they show a lot of bias with these first changes but I guess that's understandable.\n\n> 900 Unit Poke Barrier : i do think 900 is pretty random, Blitz Q is affected by it, but i've read somewhere else that Zyra's plants weren't. it feels a bit wonky, and right now Poke champs have been nerfed a lot, probably a bit too much with this mechanism and Specific champion changes in my opinion. luckily it doesn't affect ultimates.\n\nZyra's plants can be summoned a fair distance away from her and the plants can attack another fair distance away, so I would assume it would work with her plants. Her E plants actually have a much shorter attack range than her Q plants FTR. I wouldn't mind if this was a permanent part of the game mode but they could decide to tie it into a rune(I mention ARAM-specific runes later), although I feel like they wouldn't trust players to take it...or I don't know if there would ever be something that felt better than this that people would want to take if it were a rune.\n\n\n> Speed of minions spawn after 15;00 : i don't really understand why making every ARAM end after 20 min is a goal in the first place, most of them do already anyways since last year changes, it's been feeling more and more like a coinflip, and comebacks are getting rare, but they seldom happens, it seems to me like you guys don't want people to turtle in and have a chance in \"late game\". It is somewhat an ok change to me, although most waveclear champions have been nerfed already.\n\nI'm okay with this although it takes a little bit of getting used to since it can be more difficult than in the past to finish an item build.\n\n> Specific rune and item balance for ARAM : Yes, Yes a thousand time yes. Presence of Mind and Triumph were the first offenders in this category, they were ultimately busted for a game mode that see so much teamfight, I Abused it, so did everyone else and it was kinda gross.\n> Nerfing Warmogs is alright, with nerfed poke tanks don't need all that regen anymore, they were always a great asset to win the game, and it's gonna be even truer now.\n\nThis is okay, but I'd prefer them to draw up a completely new set of runes for the mode and do that for TT as well. This change alone doing as I suggested would allow them to completely throw away the decision to try to balance every champion through the map's aura. I don't think people want to have to remember 150 or so champion auras, which they might have to if they keep going forward with this decision.\n\nFor example, instead of giving a bunch of jumping champions(Aatrox, Nocturne, Quinn, Warwick, etc) permanent reduction to all the damage they take, you can make a rune that gives them defenses during and after they make a jump. There's already a rune that gives champions lethality and magic penetration after they make a jump, so it's not a stretch to make completely new runes.\n\n> \"New\" Items : Mariner's Vengeance is fine to me, it's a way to get around the guardian angel ban in Aram and still provide an item with a similar goal to AD-based champs.\n> Ghostwalkers : sigh... last year it was already a pain in the ass to have this item on the map, from enemy assassins wiping your backline almost unnoticed, to your teammates charging alone to their death because they can walk through walls it doesn't promote healthy gameplay to me, especially since they are a glorified better version of Kayn's E. i feel bad for him. Either make the user of those boots more visible when into walls and where they're gonna exit it, ot get rid of it entirely.\n\nNot a strong opinion on these items really. Don't like or dislike them at the moment.\n\n> Turret destruction : This is pretty outrageous to me, not only turret were already extremely weak in ARAM compared to the number of people fighting around it, but now they get destroyed even quicker ? I know you guys want to shorten ARAM Games, but this is too much, you can now lose both turret and one inhib from an Ace at 7-8 minutes, that's just too much, BTW i think turret plating was a good idea for SR, i would have liked something similar in Aram rather than just Paper turrets. Have you seen a demolish proc on these ?\n\nTurrets being easier to kill is great, they've been a problem for too long. Players should be discouraged from defending only, and encouraged to go on the offense and keep the enemy away from their base. They should have to make turrets easier to kill, but if that's one thing that helps with the situation, I'm all for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2019-04-10T09:16:26.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot really wants to force the game to end at a certain point I'd much prefer the Nexus Death Match thing Nexus Blitz used where the nexus gets up and fights the other nexus. The current Nexus turrets can barely even be considered as existing at all right now. Their damage could be doubled, HP tripled, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people wouldn't even notice for a while if it wasn't in the patch notes. Also I love ARAM games where you struggle for a while, reach your late game potential, and make the triumphant come back. But I've also seen how a lot of players refuse to even try if the early game is too tough, and others who do stuff like queue up with literally only 20 minutes to play and go afk if it isn't over by then. Personally I'd rather ditch those players and keep the potential for comebacks.\n\nI really don't like Mariner's Vengeance because it's just way too strong on certain champions that are already a big pain to deal with (mostly slayers). I agree that the mode really needs some specific rune and item balance, but I think Presence of Mind in particular was slightly over nerfed.\n\nI agree that the champion specific buffs/nerfs are out of wack and should probably be abandoned completely because Riot won't keep up with them.

Mostly people seemed to get that you should hit it, though at times I saw people hit each other instead of it even though they had no hope of killing the enemy player in time for that to be worthwhile. But people had to learn how fast it dies to make those kinds of calls, so I assume most of them just didn't have enough experience with it to make those calls well yet.\n\nDefinitely agree that a few deaths just before it happens felt pretty rough, but that's another thing that people could (at least theoretically) learn to play around somewhat. Might be a bit harder with the lack of ability to recall, heal up, and shop one last time at the fountain though...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Urgash","date":"2019-04-11T02:39:33.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cosnirak,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YYb1RIl6,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2019-04-10T09:16:26.643+0000)\n\n> I agree that the champion specific buffs/nerfs are out of wack and should probably be abandoned completely because Riot won't keep up with them.

Otherwise it would reward mains who luckily got their best champs (or begged for it) more than generalists players with more/all champs unlocked. And it would also have a significant impact on dodgers too, the more OTP are incentivized to play the mode, the more angry people who didn't get their main will dodge at the first occasion.\n\nThanks for bringing this argument into the discussion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChampStatus344","date":"2019-04-10T00:53:38.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hardly ever comment on these boards but as someone who mainly plays ARAM without a so-called \"ARAM account\" I felt compelled to throw my 2 cents in. (edit for transparency: about 90 champs and 1500 ARAM games)\n\nRegarding bans, I know this is an unpopular opinion but I actually like the bans, especially considering that you aren't required to ban anyone. For me personally, even if he isn't the strongest champ in ARAM, I permaban Teemo because I don't want my team to be forced to buy extra consumables just to deal with him. I understand that it technically runs counterintuitive to the spirit of the mode, but I don't think it destroys the purpose on a game-by-game basis. Every champ can't be banned in every game, so there is still randomness in each match.\n\nI agree with almost everything else OP said... Increase visibility for the boots, continue to balance specific champ changes every patch, turrets are too weak, get rid of poke barrier.\nOnly other thing I would add is that I actually do like the increased minion speed. IMHO ARAM should feel like a fast-paced alternative to SR and the faster minions add more pressure to those later game situations, so I don't mind the change at all.\n\nThat's it. 😁\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"The23rdGamer","date":"2019-04-08T21:19:06.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with everything said here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ackelope","date":"2019-04-08T05:51:15.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i find that turrets being weaker actually tends to increase how swingy most of my arams are. comebacks are easy when you can get one pick or one good fight, and take 2 objectives in the time it takes for the enemy to respawn. if you can't get one pick or one good fight, chances are you got unlucky and have an awful teamcomp for the gamemode/for the enemy's team, and would probably lose regardless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinspunch","date":"2019-04-09T00:11:17.595+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Bans arent fun in ARAM.
