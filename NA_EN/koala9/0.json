Everything is great except league is the only game I play that won&#039;t run natively and punishes people for using programs like wine to get around a lack of support. I&#039;ve tried everything that I can think of to get league to work for my system like installing it as a snap or installing league through wine or trying vbox. Nothing works. I understand that it is riots game to do with what they please but id rather not be stuck with *shudder* dota2 seeing as they have native linux support. I guess why I&#039;m posting this is because I&#039;m hoping enough rioters seeing us Linux people complain and make a client for us :)","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-30T00:41:40.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1% more money isn't worth double the work.","replies":[{"poster":"koala9","date":"2019-01-03T08:10:02.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'all keep saying this, but allot of people would switch if more major games like league worked so if that was the case it wouldn't be a \"1%\" like you're saying it would be at least 5 xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-12-30T00:51:02.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The *client* is the easier part for Riot to get working, as they rebuilt it based on web standard languages.\nThe *game* is the part where Riot says \"no thank you\".
