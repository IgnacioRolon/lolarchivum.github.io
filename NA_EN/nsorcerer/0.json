I've done everything I've seen to fix this issue, such as running the application as admin, deleting certain files, uninstalling and changing the compatibility. I've already looked at the thread that gives solutions and none of them are catering to my problem. When I launch league it comes up with the logo and nothing happens after that, is there anyone who has encountered this problem and knows a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T21:39:37.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the steps you've taken so far to troubleshoot this!
