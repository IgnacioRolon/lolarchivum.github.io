Getting Guardian Angel is very cheap so if you can cs fine you should get this with no problem and you will be fine for trading.\n\nIf your a first timer I recommend starting with the typical tank masteries. Stick to the normal ad runes.\n\nIf you feel brave and confident in your Kled skills you can go use Battle of Fevor mastery, My Kled Runes are 5mr, 5amr, 8 AD, 20 scaling ad at level 18, 1% Crit rune.\n\nYou will struggle a bit at pre 6 in alot of games, Some champions will just escape with flash or natural moves to escape your first blood.\n\nTricks you can do with Kled: Your ultimate if it targets a close enemy it will follow them anywhere on the map no matter how far they Flash/Blink/Jump/Teleport so its similar to vi's ultimate.\n\nIf Kled marks a mobile champion with his E he can cast it again to that champion who is over a wall.\n\nIf Kled lands his Q on Fizz or Xayah they will still take damage and get cc'd during Fizz E or Xayah's R.\n\nWhen you have two or three items Kled should be able to solo Herald on his own but you need to know when to dash through the herald during its attack frames so you can hit the back eye.\n\nI've also done this trick with Gnar. \n\nGood luck buddy and I'll shower you with tacos if you become a kled main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheFallenShaw","date":"2017-05-14T23:42:02.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I suggest looking at youtubers like Huzzygames and Neace who do unranked to diamond.
