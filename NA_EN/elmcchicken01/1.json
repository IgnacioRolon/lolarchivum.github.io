If you need it for earlier some reason you can also get {{item:3157}} next instead of {{item:3285}} (don't forget to build it later though.)\nThen you can build in any order you want for the last for items, which are {{item:3089}} and {{item:3135}}, I usually build {{item:3089}} then {{item:3135}} but if they have a lot of MR you can get {{item:3135}} .\n\nAs you can see, it's the staple Vel'Koz build but unlike mid it uses {{item:2301}} instead of {{item:3151}} . Late game though, should you desire it, you can sell the {{item:2301}} to buy {{item:3151}} .\n\nThe full build would look like this: {{item:2301}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} and obviouslly once you finish all your items you want a {{item:2139}} up at all times (if you have the money for it.)\n\nYou can also use {{item:3116}} which I sometimes replace {{item:3157}}  with.\n\nAlso, don't forget to buy and use control wards!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-29T23:46:31.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has crazy support carry potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-04-29T23:36:12.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is still good, and he will probably get a bit more play once the mid-season hits and tanks start to be more common since he has true damage. Right now though he is still good but some match ups are a bit to rough for him. I'm not really a Vel'koz main but he is my 2nd best Mid laner which I have him at Rank 6 with almost 60k Mastery points I think.\n\nAs for the build, I'd do something like {{item:3165}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3020}} That is my general build but if the enemy team has to many tanks then I'll some times swap out {{item:3285}}  for {{item:3151}}","replies":[]}]}
