The problem is that any adjustments only occur about twice a year at best. To put this into perspective, aside from updates carrying over from SR, the last time TT/Dom got changes before the TT mini-rework in 5.11 was  item/jungle changes in 4.21 back in December 2014. The last champion changes at all were in August 2014 with 4.15. The community at large doesn't really support alternate maps because Riot doesn't really support alternate maps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neeko B0t","date":"2015-10-13T19:27:55.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THEY SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE I LOVE TO PLAY {{champion:31}} SO 1","replies":[{"poster":"ElMcChicken01","date":"2015-10-18T01:16:25.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love to play as {{champion:31}} too.
