{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2017-05-02T22:40:51.309+0000","title":"ARAM Changes for 7.10","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":46,"down_votes":16,"body":"7.10 ARAM Followup Changes\n\nHere&rsquo;s a quick summary of where we&rsquo;re at post-7.8 ARAM changes, and while it&rsquo;s possible stuff in 7.9 will cause some major changes that will need to be responded to, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at and why. You&#039;ll start seeing these changes trickle out to PBE soon. \n\nThe Good\nGames in general are resolving slightly faster but more importantly stalled out games are actually ending and resolving. We&rsquo;re seeing more back and forth and games are more action packed than before. While fun is subjective people in general seem to be enjoying the changes. Overall, we&rsquo;re pretty happy with how games are shaking out but we&rsquo;re still looking to make some changes in 7.10 to improve things. \n\nThe Less Good\nEven though &quot;Stomps&quot; do not appear to have increased, on a champion balance side with some exceptions (such as Sona who dropped last patch), many champions who were strong in ARAM got a bit stronger and many that were weaker got a bit weaker We&#039;re not aiming for anything near perfect balance for ARAM, and we won&rsquo;t be doing champion specific balance for ARAM, but there are some small changes here we think can go a long way in bridging some of this gap. \n\nSo without further adieu, based off of feedback from the last round of changes and the results above, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at for 7.10 \n\nSuper Minions\nRespawn/Timing - We like the strong pushes but we&rsquo;re easing up on the respawn time of inhibitors to match the old number of waves. Minion waves dropped to 25 seconds from 30 seconds, so we&rsquo;re dropping the inhibitor respawn times to 250 from 300 to match. This means they&rsquo;ll still be strong but you&rsquo;ll have a few less to deal with overall\nShifting Armor &lt;-&gt; MR - Overall the minions are durable and we like that but the SR Armor / MR tuning isn&rsquo;t quite ideal for ARAM so we&rsquo;re shifting some of their Armor into MR to even out their killability a bit between carry types \nOut of Combat Movespeed \nThis has successful in helping waves catch up with pushes and allowing them to keep up with champions, but had a few wonky unintended edge-cases such as super dodgy champions when it&#039;s meant to be a transit buff. As a result once a Super Minion enters combat this Out of Combat MS aura will be disabled for the remainder of its' lifespan. \n\nCannon Minions\nThe very first wave will not have a Cannon Minion to start things off in a more neutral state\nWe&rsquo;re looking at alternating the Cannon Waves (Wave 2 - Blue Gets a Cannon, Wave 3 - Red, etc) \nThe Goal here is to give to offset wave strength between waves to give teams with less wave clear a better chance to push out their lane and vary up the flow a little bit early on. \nDue to their being a small Blue side advantage still on ARAM we&rsquo;re looking at starting with Blue Side getting the first Cannon Minion so that the small experience advantage goes to Red Side. \n\nMelee Champions\nIt&rsquo;s a little inelegant but we&rsquo;re looking at increasing early survivability of Melee champions with a flat MR boost (currently looking at +10). It&rsquo;s unsurprising that Melee Champion struggle early in ARAM and they tend to get beaten up by primarily magic damage casters who on a map/mode with access to a lot more spellcasts in a narrow corridor tend to do well. This should soften up some of that early harass, with the buff being less meaniningful later as it becomes less needed later in the game. \n\nGold Flow\nWe feel general gold flow is a bit low and many champions need that extra income to really turn on and start functioning so we&rsquo;re kicking up the passive gold generation a bit. Expect a small increase in both the minion sharing gold and the ambient gold. We&#039;re roughly targeting &quot;half an item&quot; for the average game in terms of increase. \n\nSnowball \nWe like that other Summoner Spells are being seen with increasing frequency in ARAM but we feel that Snowball isn&#039;t carrying its' weight in the early game so we&#039;re buffing base damage a bit. This will obviously be most noticeable very early game.\nSnowball and Dash Damage\n25-100 &gt;&gt; 40-115 True Damage \n\nGuardian&rsquo;s Line\nFeedback has been pretty consistent that the Guardian&rsquo;s line is a little bit weak. We generally agree though to different extents on the different items. As a result we&rsquo;re doing a small +50 Health Buff across the board and an additional small buff to the Hammer and Horn (+5 AD,and +50 Additional Health respectively). \n\nAnyhoot, that&#039;s the quick &quot;where we&#039;re at&quot; for ARAM in 7.10. It won&#039;t be the end of the updates (we&#039;re looking at potentially doing a followup later this year) but we are going to ease off the gas after this patch for a while. We&#039;re additionally discussing some meta layer options, such as how rerolls, dodging, and champion pool options, work, etc but any changes in that space will not be included in this patch. Thanks for all the feedback and support from the last changes. Whether or not you agreed with all the changes in 7.8, the response has been really helpful is assessing and planning for this update. \n\nFist Bump, \n- FeralPony","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-05-02T23:19:37.830+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":4,"body":"Any plans on soing somethiing about the ARAM-only accounts?

Stuff that's unique to ARAM we're totally on board for changing though (the starting items, health relics, the global buff etc)\n\nI'm a 2600-2900 player, and at that mmr what I've noticed is that people tend to utilize their range advantage, almost always resulting in early-game lane control. What I think would help the format immensely would be to give a big significant buff to champions while they're around an allied turret (a similar, but buffed version of the mstery Siegemaster). \n\nThat way, pushed in champions, specifically melees against ranged, have a chance to conserve their hp while waiting for lvl 6 or their ultimates to come back on cooldown to fight.\n\nThe turret itself won't be any tankier so games would not be delayed that much, but people won't feel as helpless when they lose laning.

The ones who are mobile, can stick to a target, or engage a 5v5 fight are perfectly fine in ARAM. Sure, they might get poked out a bit to start, but in most cases they more than make up for it once they get an item or two. My Irelia, Garen, Wukong, Olaf, Rengar or Hecarim dont need any defensive buffs to get rolling. Neither do the Ammumus, Sejuanis, Malphites, or Nautliuses. It also poses some problems with melee champions who are strong from the getgo - Alistar, Kat, Blitz, Talon, and to a lesser extent Maokai, Rumble, Nautilus, and Jarvan. Or Kayle, who is a melee-but-not-really. \n\nThis change also doesnt really do anything for the problem champions - Aatrox, Udyr, or Shyvana (and maybe Lee, Tryn, Kled and Yasuo). It might help you take a little bit more poke, but 10 MR only allows them to tank maybe one or two more spells while they are sitting under their tower unable to poke, engage, or clear waves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-05-02T22:49:35.614+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds pretty promising FeralPony, I like the idea of a flat MR buff but will you do case by case changes if there are outliers?","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2017-05-02T22:55:58.217+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlikely, but it would all depend on the specifics.

With the new ARAM changes that doesn't happen as often. I think the main problem they have is sustaining health through lifesteal. Minions are rarely saved for lifesteal or you are zoned so you get poked down and are unable to contribute to fights.\n \nMy Idea is to add some type of vultures that show up around where the minions are dying and land on the wall of the bridge. After Champion deaths they could show up in larger numbers.  They can only be attacked by range champions and after 3 hits they fly off. Grants lifesteal, but no gold(so mages won't go after them, unless for fun) and adds to the environment.
