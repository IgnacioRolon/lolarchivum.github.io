I love this game and unfortunately I have Tourette syndrome which is nervous system disorder involving repetitive movements or unwanted sounds. I unfortunate swear alot because of this even though I am a christian child of god. I feel bad for what I&#039;ve done my parents are taking me to therapy for my ill behavior. I also have a gambling addiction, which made me spend over 1000 dollars in this game. Addiction runs in my genes. My parents recently put me on a medicine that makes me docile and calm. I am very sorry riot I will do whatever it takes to regain trust and honor in the League of Legends Community. ~ cheesycheese6","replies":[{"poster":"CooL Ice Tea","date":"2017-10-10T05:51:14.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> have Tourette syndrome\n\nthat doesn't make you write things -_- I know someone in my friends family which is having a real problem with that illness and i saw much stuff on the tv how these people explained there lifes and how to get along.
