For future reference (or if you still can't find them) you can see all your skins on the page for that champion in your Collection tab!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/ccd3201f9aae8ed5b0f461b30b7a26a5.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"OiLeroy76","date":"2017-05-03T11:14:41.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you broporo...\n\nThe issues on this game is just getting too real for me.. sigh,, rather just find another game to play!! too much dramas with Riot.","replies":[]}]}]}
