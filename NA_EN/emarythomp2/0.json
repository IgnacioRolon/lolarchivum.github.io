Basically on the Mac, everytime I open the client and start my first match prior to opening the client the in-game mouse has a double click bug where everything is double click. I disconnect because reconnecting fixes the issue but the match is always remade so I’m tired of that. I’ve seen threads in 2013 with this bug still not fixed for Mac users and it concerns me. There is nothing messing with the client or Mac I close all of my apps and stuff and the bug still happens. All I ask is for a simple permanent fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T20:57:10.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like your config settings keep getting refreshed to the same weird double-click settings. Let's try forcing a manual reset to see if that stops this from happening anymore. \n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to your League Installation \n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
