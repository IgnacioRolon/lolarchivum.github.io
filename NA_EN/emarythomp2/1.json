(Mini Kai'sai rant too)","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do I need to go on any further? Hire some challenger players, master players, MAYBE even diamond 1-2 players. People who know how to fully play the game with solid mechanics. (Not saying they all do but im sure that can easily be tested). \r\n\r\nLike do these latest patches just feel absurd and lackluster to anyone else????? Is there anyone else out there that thinks riot doesn&#039;t really know what their doing? \r\n\r\nHire players who know the mechanics and small details of the game. People who play the game all the time and know what needs to be fixed or tweaked and what not.\r\n\r\nDo you want to know why so many people hate the balance team and design team? Because they&#039;re doing stuff like nerfing Yorick when he was already in a pretty meh spot. They&#039;re doing stuff like creating an adc named kaisai with:\r\n\r\n- Stealth (Not camouflage. Actual stealth like vayne ult +q or shaco&#039;s q)\r\n\r\n- A shield\r\n\r\n- A dash\r\n\r\n- Movement speed buff\r\n\r\n- Physical damage\r\n\r\n- magic damage\r\n\r\n- Damage over time\r\n\r\n- Burst damage\r\n\r\n- % max health damage\r\n\r\n- a &#039;x&#039; number of hits passive\r\n\r\n- an attack speed buff\r\n\r\n- an aoe attack\r\n\r\n^^^^^^ LIKE WHAT IS THIS???? WHY DOES SHE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM EVERY ADC???? When has she ever been a low pick? What team comp does she not fall into? Why is she the only champ that has everything everyone in her roll basically has/wants? \r\n\r\n&quot;Oh but she has less attack range.&quot; That hasn&#039;t stopped her at all. Literally.\r\n\r\nSorry for the mini rant but I&#039;m just saying the design team and balance team really need to have a reality check on whats best for the game.","replies":[]}
