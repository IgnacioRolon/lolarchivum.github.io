I mean seriously it's not fair to the other 4 people in the game to lose lp because one dude decided that he didn't feel like playing the game anymore because he went 0/14. Reducing lp loss by at least half would be a step in the right direction. To make sure lp reduction isn't abused somehow you can change leaver buster to go into an hour long (for ranked at least) if a player afks in a lot of their games. I don't see why we have to lose full lp for something completely out of our control and hopefully, lp reduction will be implemented soon.","replies":[]}
