What confuses me about this champion is from what I&#039;ve read, people in the past have encouraged riot to nerf this champion due to her being too strong  throughout the jungle/game. But as of now she has become the most useless jungler to a point where she is placed LAST as a jungle pick.\r\n\r\nI feel like this champion is not in need for a buff because it would only bring her back to square one. But to have some sort of kit rework where she is able to do TWO specific roles ONLY. This champion should be a Jungler AND a mid laner. Of course, one or two skills will be kept such as her R and Q but I feel as if her W and E are the ones that are in need of work, including her passive when she&#039;s in human form.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s something about this champion that makes everyone clueless on what can be done for her so that she&#039;ll be in a balanced state but I fear that the majority of the people here will disagree on a kit rework due to the tragedy of {{champion:69}} , {{champion:38}} , {{champion:45}} \r\n\r\nI can predict that most of you will not want a kit rework but It all depends on WHO will be in charge of the kit rework. I&#039;ve seen a thread that had a fair Idea of how her Q can be changed but it&#039;s not enough for Elise to become a balanced pick.\r\n\r\n\r\n**TLDR; Buffing Elise will only bring her back to her OP self and would be a LCS uproar, kit reworking could be a solution to where Elise can become suitable as a jungler and a mid laner who can sustain as a fighter and heavily kill as a mage.\r\n**","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-04-07T16:25:28.948+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not make her cocoon hit multiple targets in a small area?

Also, we're not just talking about percentage damage. Elise has more damaging tools than her Qs, so there are other places to buff her damage.\n\nI don't mean to be rude but I don't think you really understand her problems. Making Cocoon more powerful isn't what you need to do to reward her for hitting it. What you need to do to make it more rewarding is make it so she actually has follow up to landing a Cocoon.

My theory was she'd be an amazing splitpusher, but it never even got to that stage of the game.

I *did* get a little lucky with my teams, though; I wouldn't say Elise is one of those \"OP\" champions in urf (a reddit thread a few days ago had her urf winrate among the lowest, like 38% or something), definitely powerful though, as is everyone in urf, but especially if you're good with her combos. She *does* reach a point when you can just pop someone really fast if you're good with her combo, and her stun is ridiculously useful since being CC'd for even a little bit means death in this game mode (secured a lot of kills and saved a lot of teammates with this), not to mention your rappel is just as good or better than Vlad pool in some ways (you're just untargetable, I think, not invulnerable, but it's more difficult to read your movements as long as there are enemy units around. Plus I think AP Elise does more burst than Vlad, and has more range and CC)\n\nIt really depends on how good you are at Elise, imo; she has two ways of denying enemies (both her E's), good AoE damage if you max W first and build AP (not to mention it's homing and checks brush, lol), a ton of burst between her Qs and human W, and shreds through towers with her spiderform W. I'd say if you're really good about managing your Es, and especially if you have a Zhonya's, you're pretty much invincible vs a single target, maybe more. I'm not the greatest Elise by any means, but I have some translatable experience on Nidalee (form change + poke -> all-ins, etc), as well as a bit of experience on Elise (not enough to be a good Elise, but enough to be competent), so I'm able to handle myself at least as well (or better than) these first-time band-wagon Zeds or whatever, lol (not to mention nobody expects AP Elise's burst, lol).\n\nMostly though, she's just fun for me at least; Nidalee isn't as fun in URF for me, I feel like you lose a lot of the interesting dynamics of playing Nidalee and just become that caricature you see everyone complain about, lol. In Urf at least, imo, AP Elise has just as much damage as Nidalee, but is more reliable (W is AoE homing, Qs are targeted), and she has a ton of utility with her Es.\n\nAnyways, as long as Riot is pushing AP bruiser/fighter champions into jungle (Nidalee, Gragas), I'd love to see them support this type of playstyle for more champions (Elise, Diana, Evelynn are obvious candidates, but Teemo would be cool too I think).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"tofutime","date":"2015-04-07T14:21:23.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to decide what they want her to be. If they want her to be a tank/jungler, she needs more CC. She has a skillshot stun that can only hit 1 person and.. that's it. She's largely ignored in teamfights unless she's doing some form of damage.\n\nIf they want her to be an assassin/mid like they originally designed her for then she needs less utility. It's not bad giving her a skillshot stun (like xerath) but then her mobility needs to be nerfed. I would put rappel on a much higher cooldown. Then I would amp up her damaging spells and now you have a bursty midlaner.

I personally would argue that she was never a viable support and would never be a viable mid/top again without reverting the various nerfs to Neurotoxin, so she's pretty much a dedicated jungler at this stage and I'm pretty sure you can buff her without changing that as long as you don't buff the range/mana on Neurotoxin or increase her base damages (good lord, don't increase her base damages).\n\nMy opinion Elise is that she needs some tweaks, but not what I'd call a proper rework. Just some number tweaking. I used to want to nerf her base damages further but increase her scaling to compensate but lately I've actually came to think that her damage is fine, and worth building AP for (who doesn't want to do 26% current health with one spell at 600 AP, or take advantage of the 80% AP ratio on Human W?). The problem is that they nerfed Elise's ability to survive a fight by removing her free spider form tankiness and while I think that was a good idea, I feel they should have compensated her for it. Removing the spider form tankiness effectively made it too dangerous for her to ever go in and forced her to build tanky even more than she would have before. The result? She can't take advantage of her damage at all because the bases were rightfully slashed. They made it so Elise had to build tanky but then made it that she couldn't do anything if she did. She has been left without a job to do.\n\nMy idea for a buff? Increase the AP ratio on Skittering Frenzy's heal. Every fighter needs something to help them survive and Frenzy is Elise's tool, but it's just not strong enough to support her consistently spending time in the middle of a fight. If the ratio was increased from 4% to 6%, I think she'd be a lot more willing to go in, but she'd have to build AP to take advantage of it, so it doesn't bring back any of Elise's old problems.\n\ntl;dr: We can buff Elise, but we have to make sure it's in a way that isn't just giving her free stats. Elise as a champion will be a lot more healthy when she actually has to invest into damage to take advantage of her kit and imo buffing her Skittering Frenzy heal is the way to do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-07T18:54:59.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Elise needs a rework.
