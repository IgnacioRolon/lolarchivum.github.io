First off I want to let everyone know before you judge about my opinion please look at this thread: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/wxOJOf8l-riot-read-my-first-time-experience-of-cassiopeia-as-of-today\n\nThis is just my opinion so don&rsquo;t bash on me :(\n\nIt would be nice if they made her similar to Syndra where her Q and E can inflict damage while the W remains to be the utility except it would be better if her W will expand faster and little more bigger. Her ult bothers me a lot because her slow should scale up to 90% if the enemy have their backs turned, I just don&rsquo;t get why Kass&rsquo;s E can scale up to 90% but not her ult.\n\nHer Mana is very bad, all her skills scale up so much mana cost and it just forces Cassiopeia to mandatory get Tear and not RoA or Athenes. Like if I want to get magic resist or be tanky I can&rsquo;t because Cassiopeia&rsquo;s mana cost won&rsquo;t let me.\n\nHer Passive is not really unique in my opinion because I feel like you want her to be the type of champion to spam her abilities as much as possible, if anything she needs a new passive where her poison becomes even more deadly? Idk lol\n\nOh! and her AA to be improved because I feel like she's throwing green strips of bacon lol\n\nThat is my answer to your question. \n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/7d6566f481c563987375b4652f2ecc1d/tumblr_msnt0nWZeU1sar26wo1_500.png\n\n**But personally I would just want Cassiopeia to get a Fiora rework, where her kit is entirely changed and her Visuals to be improved because her current classic model doesn&rsquo;t fully justify as her splash art. If they were to rework Cassiopeia I would want the theme to be Deadly, Poisonous, and Frightful. **\n\n**A utility that brings, an AoE Fear, Slow, and bonus movement speed. Snakes are fast, aggressive and fearful.  Along with a skin that is black and red where it would make people cringe because it&rsquo;s haunting to look at (; I just love snakes to be the kind of frightful, deadly type. But believe it or not, snakes do indeed dash, they also &quot;fling&quot; where they launch themselves to you and then go back to their original place. Maybe something like that can be brought to her new kit ? idk.**","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2015-12-14T18:31:04.945+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But...

I mean it's logical that when you break something, you fix it right away. People don't just let broken things be on the floor for months or years, they fix their mistakes right away. It's not hard to create a concept for this particular champion, she is similar to Medusa and is part of the snake family, I don't see what's hard to gather ideas from.\n\nI literally just set up a theme they can focus on doing for her, not only that, they should ALSO listen to the Cassiopeia's mains suggestion rather than ignoring and doing their own thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2015-12-14T18:43:38.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=4NoxiousHours,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WlTMllq9,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-12-14T18:36:26.773+0000)\n>\n> The obvious thing here is that Riot should delay what they plan on working on in 2017 and begin reworking Cassiopeia.

Her rework took the thing most people liked least and put all of her power into it; Im pretty sure Stashu only liked shooting fangs and re-made cass how HE wanted her and not with her playerbase in mind.\nOne thing i wish from a cass rework at this point is reversion of the purple cloud nerfs and making her fang thingy a toggle that costs mana per attack that gives flat MS. i think it would be fun and give rise to ASP cass builds that focus on ludin/firecannon procs while chasing.

I feel like Riot will keep updating Cassiopeia almost every patch with numbers and that's not how it will be fixed at all.\n\nWhat's sad to see also is that they are giving Sona A LOT of attention which I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH but it's really weird for Riot to fix Sona and not Cassiopeia when they both got the same treatment.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2015-12-15T03:29:26.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=4NoxiousHours,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WlTMllq9,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-14T18:54:37.345+0000)\n>\n> Idk when I see Cass I just see the words \"Fiora Rework Her\" because really, number changing will only make her good for a certain amount of weeks and when Riot changes something that has to do with Mages, Cassiopeia is back to square one.

I feel like we have enough arrows as it is right now.\n\nCassiopeia can go many ways to her Rework, but I'd prefer her to be a mixture of DoT/Assassin because snakes pray on the enemy and strike very hard.
