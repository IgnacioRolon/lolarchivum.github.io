Remember, when Yasuo, Zed, Lee Sin, Thresh and Fizz exist, any champ can have a buff.\n\nHer movement speed is ridiculously low. Probably the most unfair stat in the game, coupled with her extreme squishiness. +10 movement speed for the sexy plant lady.\n \nHer passive is useless until she dies, and on top of that it has a delay to be ready, and a delay after firing. By the time it is ready, the target has got away and in out of range. \n\nHer plant AI should prioritise nearby champions all the time and attack them as soon as they are in range, or maybe add some AI control. It is very common to take the kill when the adc would benefit more, but at the same time the plants like to ignore champs, especially the vine lashers. \n\nHer E and passive are punishing to miss. Thresh hook, blitz grab, Morgana bind possess crazy hitboxes. \n\nThe three buffs above are in ascending in importance, meaning movement speed is most important. The passive needs to be made fair for Zyra players. The AI is optional so it's not a huge issue.\n\nZyra is definitely a good champ. \nIf you don't think she is viable, then you clearly just spam champions like Zed and Yasuo.\nIt is incredibly boring seeing the same champions every single game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-01-01T19:23:36.645+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Stupidity is louder than intelligence.\n\n\"Genius is knowing to stay silent as others demonstrate their ignorance.\"\n- Eric Lau","replies":[]}]}
