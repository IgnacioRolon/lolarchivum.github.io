It&#039;s a simple question and I&#039;ll add why I&#039;m asking.\n\nWhat did you major and what is a day at your job like? \n\n[Reason for asking: I am a current college student who is struggling on deciding what I want to major in. I&#039;ve done my research on specific majors but they don&#039;t really answer what I&#039;m specifically wanting to know. So by asking someone who has experience, it will help me give an idea and possible solution to my struggle.]","replies":[]}
