This has been said and repeated time after time again but for some reason, It&#039;s getting to a point where it&#039;s flat out annoying. \r\n\r\nOk, we get it {{champion:136}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:163}} AND MORE have yet to have another skin since their release. \r\n\r\nThat is a bothersome fact, however, what I find more bothersome is {{champion:56}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:77}} champions like these are &quot;THAT&quot; kind of champion who once they get a skin, they don&#039;t get to see another in years. \r\n\r\nThen you have these players who enjoy using a defensive claim by saying &quot;Those champions have a lot of skins already, they aren&#039;t important at the moment.&quot; NO. That is not true, they are just as important because if you compare to the current skin designs in terms of model and splash art, it&#039;s a huge difference. Having something NEW/recent is better than playing with something OLD. \r\n\r\nLately, I have been seeing {{champion:222}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:81}} strongly being chosen for profit measures and other aspects of business goals. Is this truly what League Of Legends is going to be about for the coming years? Where a certain pool of champions are always going to be the spotlight of the year while the others are just handed a skin and to never see another in years?\r\n\r\nI understand the fact that there&#039;s so many champions to a point where not all or more than half can get a skin every year, but to get a skin and not have another for 2 years straight is just absurd.  \r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s more absurd is how people can say that 750RP skins is SOMETHING like if it&#039;s as special as 975RP+ skins. It&#039;s not the same feeling of excitement at all. Looks is one thing but having particles and all type of other things included is better.","replies":[]}
