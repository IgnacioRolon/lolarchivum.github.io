B/C of the similarities with mechas/platforms, NGE was reference source that came handy. In actuality a lot of the Mecha skin line is inspired by stuff like NGE/Pacific Rim/Transformers so you'll definitely see a bit everything around.\n\nThe main driving force, however, was more of my desire to draw connections in the animations (such as this respawn) to the skin's story. Sion initially had a respawn animation where he'd comet from the sky in the compact-box form, meteor crater into the ground, and slowly unfold to get ready for the rift. It was cool and all, but didn't make sense to me b/c Sion didn't really come from the sky; we was built by yordle scientists and heavily kept in secret, most likely underground. Thus, the elevator platform exists to help create that connection. Another example would be DTTristana's spawn animation which directly references her skin splash where they're both looking at the sky, looking for adventure and ready to learn new things about the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2016-03-24T18:40:40.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Ohmu,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pwoFhN7E,comment-id=00010000000000010000,timestamp=2016-03-24T18:30:56.704+0000)\n>\n> @TerraRising\n> \n> Mostly yes; the spawn animation is semi-inspired by NGE. after brainstorming how Sion would exit in the recall we ended up with a pretty awesome platform to work with.
