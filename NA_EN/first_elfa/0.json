It was all fun untill Karthus {{champion:30}}  on the enemy team got the &quot;ascended&quot; buff. He scuicided in the middle of the map when Xerath {{champion:101}} was killed and somehow got the buff even though he was in his &quot;afterlife form&quot;. It happened a lot of times, but nearing 3/4 Victory for the enemy team he got it again. In the same way. Suddenly he was impossible to kill. I mean like.. his hp bar didn&#039;t drop. at all. 5v1 and he won. without losing 1 single hp.","replies":[{"poster":"themrrival","date":"2017-05-20T03:04:09.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey First Elfa!\n\nThanks for the report on this.

Basically, if you manage to be in the after-death ability (like say, Karthus passive) and be in the center of the circle after ascendant Xerath dies and drops that ascendant spark, you'll still get to ascend. AFAIK, it was a feature instead of a bug, and that's how I've been treating it.","replies":[{"poster":"themrrival","date":"2017-05-20T03:54:11.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=D2Vincent,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=uGrQzxEQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-05-20T03:39:57.187+0000)\n>\n> Thought I&#x27;d mention something about this :P\n> \n> This &quot;Bug&quot; regarding Karthus (and to an extent, any other champ with an after death passive) has been in here every time Ascension has showed up in RGM queue.

Once you do get it though, you should still be able to take damage and be killed. That's the part we are looking into.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
