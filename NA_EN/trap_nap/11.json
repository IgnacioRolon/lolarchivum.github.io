I&#039;ll choose the best impersonation and give that person who did so a prize. Also the quotes must be from the champion and not made up ones, basically the things they say in game.\n\nYou may not win two $25 prizes but the $10 one you can win even if you received a higher prize.\n\nI&#039;ll end the contest and choose the winners for each prize on Saturday at a time where I can be active and on here. \n\nAlso if you don&#039;t know what vocaroo is, it&#039;s a recording site that let&#039;s you record whatever and share it with people.\n\nhttp://vocaroo.com/\n\nProof that I&#039;m for real~\n\nhttp://puu.sh/mf3oE/e92079c25c.jpg","replies":[]}
