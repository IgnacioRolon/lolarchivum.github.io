I'll be shooting people and see their health bars going down but everyone in the game is standing still, then suddenly all the audio comes in at once and tons of minions die at once, etc. I've tried playing in different resolutions and playing with the settings but I can't seem to find a solution. I don't experience this in any other game I own, just league. Anyone here know what I can do?\n\nWindows 10\nCrosshair VI Hero\n16GB DDR4 RAM\nGTX 1080Ti \nSamsung UHD monitor with freesync\nNative resolution 2160p","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T00:13:46.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooo that sounds a lot like packet loss tbh. Let's run a quick test to see how your connection looks after it leaves your network since packet loss happens along the route your ISP sends it but before it ever reaches our servers. Grab the network logs from a game where that freeze frame happened, and let our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it. Post a screenshot of what it spits out back here so I can take a look!","replies":[{"poster":"Six66Pounder","date":"2017-10-16T02:17:49.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://preview.ibb.co/gCBRWR/Screen.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T02:22:05.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeaaaaa looks like a good deal of packet loss there. We can go ahead and try updating a couple network settings: port forwarding and DNS options to be specific. Follow those steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and test them in a custom/practice game and let me know if that helps whatsoever.\n\nIf not, try giving your ISP a quick call and giving them that data to let them know something might not be functioning properly on their end.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
