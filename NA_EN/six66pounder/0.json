I would be absolutely 110% willing to pay $20 for a soundtrack CD. Also, can you tell us the composers and artists involved in the music? I&#039;d love to look into these people and discover some of their other work!\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2016-03-27T01:35:26.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Six66Pounder,\n\nMost of the music can be found on our [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends).
