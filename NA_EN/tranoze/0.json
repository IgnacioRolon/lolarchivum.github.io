Yes, it sound and feel strong, but answer me, can you, or the champion you are dealing with, live longer than 5 secs in this meta?

The longer the fight goes, your damage goes up by 10% already, and you also have a passive burn on top of that to help melt through tankier people. The flat pen on  {{item:3165}} is nice against people with low MR or just their base MR stat's, but against people stacking lot's of health or such, it isn't a lot of MP at all.\n\nIm speaking mostly from the perspective of {{champion:34}} , since i have the most experience on her, but {{item:3151}} is sssooo nice on her since it basically just straight up increases the damage you deal with your blizzard, and you're already a great teamfight champ as it is.  just my thoughts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-18T06:54:50.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or.\n\nYou could just buy both items?\n\nInstead of having to choose?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-18T03:50:54.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is really no way to do this math on paper that reflects reality, because both passives on {{item:3151}} cannot be reduced to a percentage or any quantifiable value.\n\nThere are definitely cases where it would be better, but not a lot.
