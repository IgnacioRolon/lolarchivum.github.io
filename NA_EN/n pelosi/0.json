Juggernauts should be able to replace them because they trade range for tankiness, while bringing the same amount of damage (cough darius) while having like them little utility (actually that&#x27;s a lie because adc have too much utility right now)\n\nIt's not a problem because the champions designed for the role \"bot\" are being picked for the role \"bot\" every game. The same way that the champions designed for the role \"top\" or \"Jungle\" or \"mid\" or \"support\" are picked for those respective roles every game.\n\nThere are some select champions that are viable in 2, 3, or even 4 roles. Those champions are special cases. The vast majority of ADCs are NOT viable junglers (and the ones that are don't play ADC very often at all), yet the vast number of top laners are. Yet no one complains that it's a \"top\" meta because we see top lane champions every game and some games even see them in the jungle. Seeing bot lane champions every game and sometimes seeing them in mid or top is NOT a problem. \n\nThe problem isn't that it's an \"ADC meta\", no less than there's a \"top meta\". If you must say there's a \"diversity\" problem, then the problem is that there are only about 18 marksmen. To which the solution would be to make a lot more marksmen, ~40 like the number of champions designed for other roles. Good luck with that - people would have your head.\n\nIn summary, ADC is a role. Marksmen is the champion type. Marksmen do a better job at ADC than any other champion, yet there are so few marksmen in the game. The perceived problem is due to the lack of marksmen.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-11-15T22:01:21.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well actually it would be interesting to see what would happen if all the Marksmen were banned/removed and see what champions would replace them since almost any champion can be played as an ADC as long as they are ranged since a lot of the power of ADC's comes from their items.\nSo maybe it would be something like Kayle, Jayce ADC?.... or maybe something like Lulu or Ahri (utility/safety)... or maybe you would run something else then an ADC?

(I don&#x27;t think so but I guess it is possible)\n\nIt wouldn't be that interesting. You'd see AD ahri, ad leblanc, ad tf, Jayce,  Kennen, ad lulu, ad annie, etc...\n\n\nI.e. any champion with a ranged auto attack,  can build ad and thus succeed. Having mobility or cc in their kit would help since they won't have aa resets or steroids. \n\nMarksmen are in every game for a good reason - they're MUCH better at taking towers than anyone else while an enemy team is defending. Sure,  tryndamere or Yasuo can take towers just as fast or faster,  but they're much easier to jump on if they try.  Sustained damage like cassio may work for Baron but not for towers. \n\nMordekaiser worked because he can use dragon ghost to siege. \nAzir could work because he can do okay with nashors. Same with teemo or kayle. There are alternatives but why bother when there are champions designed to do that job better? \n\nAnd it's fine - some players want a consistent spot to play. Support diversity still adds variability. I think it would be worse if we made a rock-paper-scissors bot Lane like we seem to have top and mid with assassins,  tanks,  mages,  fighters,  etc... adc is much less susceptible to counterpicking and leaves a role that's more about skill and synergy with the support than it is about getting a good Lane matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-11-16T01:31:40.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking towers and sustained damage, while major assets of a Marksman champion, are not actually the reason they are in every game.\n\nRather, the reason lies in the fact that Summoner's Rift has 5 players, but only four resource streams. Temporal and spatial constraints make an even distribution of these resources impossible, meaning that two players have to share a resource stream for a large part of a match.\nResources come in two varieties: gold and experience. Gold is the resource that is more controllable in its flow to champions, as last-hitting awards the killer with the whole gold. XP, on the other hand, is shared between all nearby players.\nThis set-up makes it so that ideally, one of the champions in the shared resource stream gets all possible gold, while sharing the XP. The best champions for such a set-up are ones that give up the least of their power by sharing XP.\nIn essence, these champions are ranged, auto-attack based champions. Melees in general are bad XP sharers, as they need the defensive stats they get from leveling - usually, three to four defensive stats are tripled to quadrupled between levels 1 and 18. Meanwhile, ability-focused champions want the XP for base damage increases, utility increases and cooldown decreases - and sometimes, even the AD/AP conversion ratios benefit from ranking up an ability!\nRanged AA-based champions can afford to not level as quickly, as their main safety tool, their range, does usually not scale with champion level. For most of them, at least one of their abilities is a one-point wonder that is effective enough at rank 1, instead of a main damage tool - an example is Lucian, for whom ranking W and E does not majorly increase the damage. Also, for almost all Marksman, a BF Sword is about the same amount of AD they'd get from leveling up 17 levels.\n\nThis lowered impact of sharing XP is why there is always a Marksman botlane in League. No other class is less impacted by sharing XP in their overall efficiency.\nThe other sustained damage dealers, Juggernauts and Skirmishers, as well as some mages, are all more reliant on XP - Skirmishers are melee and often possess three damage dealing/rank scaling abilities (i.e. Riven with damage Q, damage W and defense E). Juggernauts are melee, possess some of the highest base stat scalings in the game (meaning they NEED these levels) and often feature three rank scaling abilities. Sustained damage mages are still ability-focused.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-11-15T21:10:09.325+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was the Mordekaiser meta - We play Mordekaiser and ADC","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2016-11-15T21:04:44.525+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When every season their dmg becomes more easily available, as well as adding AD to every item, it becomes a huge problem.\nIt was almost in every game back in S3 ADC would get a defensive item to survive longer.\n\nNow, ADC's can just 3 hit anyone except a tank and survive no problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Garlic Butter","date":"2016-11-16T09:42:38.069+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*except Vayne who still 3 hits tanks (and is the problem).\nEXCEPT that marks men's ONLY two jobs are to Kill Tanks(or the front line) and take out turrets/boss monster objectives.
