I was right on all points with one marked exception:\r\n- they halved the knockup duration on his e so now he is utterly dependent on his ult to disrupt teamfights. Funny, because I don&#039;t want to ult even when its up.\r\n\r\nBut this post isn&#039;t about that. This post is about the beautiful brain child changes to his q:\r\nPreviously his q was a basic short range poke with some slow. It was fine, it was reliable. You shoot it and move on with your life. It was the ability you levelled last for some added value.\r\nNow, his q is single target, it casts slower, and to get your fancy little &quot;boop&quot; (which barely even matches the aoe dmg of the original) you not only have to get into range to auto a second person (fyi there MUST be a second target) you have to sit there and watch the quarter second cast animation. And, worst of all you have to AUTO. because zac is known for autoing.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll give you a hint, previously I didn&#039;t even auto post 6 on zac because the opportunity cost was too high. The champions FUNDAMENTAL mechanic is to kite and farm his blobs. His blobs represent both sustain AND damage. But I&#039;m being hard on Riot. His q now gives him the ability to slightly displace enemies.\r\n\r\nI will never play the champion again, nor will anybody else, because they&#039;ve completely broken the champions core mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"PeepingPeafowl","date":"2017-05-04T03:40:44.359+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm sure you're just over reac- \n[OH MY GOD](http://lolalytics.com/champion/Zac/)","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-05-04T04:44:28.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a senile idiot, so please explain if we're looking at win rate or pick rate here.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2017-05-04T06:43:40.929+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick rate spiked and win rate plummeted.

I'm not paid by them, nor am I any sort of fanboy.  If anything, I think they should have adopted this direction earlier. I'm also making a point to make note of flaws. Sure, you can argue a rework is bad/worse/etc. but have good metrics to do it. Day one win-rates on a champion who was fairly easy (I speak as someone with a mastery six Zac and tons of games on him) to something that is WAY harder to play and also far more specific.\n\nMore importantly, you can still like the overall direction (More specialized characters) but dislike the changes made overall (Malzahar). Zac I feel is in a position where the IDEAS are good but the implementation might be lacking. Then again, this isn't new for Riot: They grossly overestimate the power on some things and nerf the shit out of it to compensate. \n\nBesides, I prefer taking the opposite stance. Even if it's not popular to take it. What's gained when the overall discussion amounts to \"I HATE THIS\" \"I HATE IT TOO\" \"YEAH FUCK IT LET'S MOVE ON\".
