If you hit x amount of games in a ranked season, you should get x refunds back. This means more people would maybe grind that last month of the season to hit 1k games or 500 games to get 3/2 refunds. It would look something like this..\n\nAt 1,000 Ranked matches : 3 refunds\nAt 500 Ranked matches : 2 refunds\nAt 250 Ranked matches : 1 refund\n\nFor Normals players\n\nAt 2,000 Normal matches : 3 refunds\nAt 1,000 Normal matches : 2 refunds\nAt 500 Normal matches : 1 refund\n\nAt 1,500 Normal Wins : 3 refunds\nAt 750 Normal Wins : 2 refunds\nAt 375 Normal Wins : 1 refund\n\nThese values would be PER SEASON, and would not accumulate over a longer period of time. Some people refuse to play Ranked, but love playing League and could accumulate thousands of Normal matches. I myself have played 681 Ranked matches this season as I post this, and will continue to rise as the season comes to an end. But I have seen people will well over 1,000 matches this season on my journey through Ranked, and believe that this system makes it so that regardless of skill level or rank, you will be guaranteed some sort of reward. If you play the game a lot, you should get rewards too, and for casual players who despise ranked, they would feel like they have something to work towards as well.\n\nThe pay off for Riot is the fact that you have people dedicating time and playing League of Legends just so they can reuse RP they felt they wasted when they were new (or drunk, it happens). I know I bought Dragonslayer Pantheon when I was new because I thought I liked Pantheon. But as I developed into my particular role throughout my first season, I really didn't see myself using that champion or skin at all. And if I could get my 1350 RP back, I would use it towards either Mystery Gifts for friends or buying a skin for a champion I actually play. This system could only work if you could not refund gifted skins, as it would be a broken mechanic in the system. Getting an 1820RP skin for 490RP then refunding it would make it absurdly flawed and abused, so any skin received as a gift would under no circumstances be able to be refunded. \n\nLet me know what you think of this.","replies":[{"poster":"AbyssionKnight","date":"2015-09-01T20:24:34.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue I have with this is that you're punishing people who don't play the game a lot. For example, I know lots of people who have played this game since season 1 who don't even have 2k wins total. These people are dedicated players of this game who have been supporting Riot since early on, yet in your system they aren't rewarded for their loyalty at all, simply because they can't afford to invest thousands of hours a year into the game. \n\nI think a more reasonable approach would be to make refunds based on the amount of purchases you've made. So if for example every 40k IP worth of content you purchase you get a new refund, then regardless of how much you play, you'll get the same amount of refunds as anyone else who has invested as much RP or IP into the game as you have.  \n\nRiot still makes profits, they encourage more purchases, and still drain IP and RP out of the economy, while making players feel like they're being rewarded for their loyalty. \n\nThere are probably some flaws to this system, but on a basic level I think it's at least superior to a per games played model in terms of player equality.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Amygdala","date":"2015-09-02T05:11:04.855+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Having a refund is a courtesy from their part, they don't even have to do that.
