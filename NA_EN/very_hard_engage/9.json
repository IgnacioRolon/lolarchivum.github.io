Lowering MR by a few points doesn't account for the loss of 20-26 pen. It's just a pure nerf. If Riot did manage to keep pen mages at the status quo through base stats, that ends up being a buff to AP-scaling mages that would have otherwise had to chew through higher base MR.

This should come as no surprise.\n\nYou're forgetting everyone got -9/-12 but there's no AD/AP quints or stacking runes anymore or anything like that. You won't be able to load up on +20 AD at level one, is what I'm getting at.\n\nThe balance for the rune system happens in two hands where I see it, one is to give everyone access to simpler and more pronounced effects, the other is to pull the game away from behind-the-scenes numbers like Runes-- now I know Lucian took Looter (random example), I'm not poring over his stats and trying to piece together where his runes/masteries fall.\n\nThe _real_ crime is that they didn't announce it by saying 'We're about to Rune League of Legends. Forever.'","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2017-09-25T23:36:36.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not particularly worried, already got two possible WW pages Nailed down.\n\n{{champion:19}} I call page option one [the good boy who never dies page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8400-8437?build=30020146) and option two [Zoomy zoom super fast your still dead page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8100-8124?build=11210124)\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fullmetallic","date":"2017-09-26T16:27:20.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Karn Bishop,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yhoEMlXG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-25T23:36:36.841+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m not particularly worried, already got two possible WW pages Nailed down.\n> \n> {{champion:19}} I call page option one [the good boy who never dies page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8400-8437?build=30020146) and option two [Zoomy zoom super fast your still dead page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8100-8124?build=11210124)\n> \n> {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}\n\nThose are the best names","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pacattack25","date":"2017-09-27T02:23:32.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Karn Bishop,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yhoEMlXG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-25T23:36:36.841+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m not particularly worried, already got two possible WW pages Nailed down.\n> \n> {{champion:19}} I call page option one [the good boy who never dies page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8400-8437?build=30020146) and option two [Zoomy zoom super fast your still dead page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8100-8124?build=11210124)\n> \n> {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}\n\nI call this one the 'Ez ult on a 20 second CD' http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8300-8351?build=40020223","replies":[{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2017-09-27T04:20:04.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn that might actually be annoying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tolinar","date":"2017-09-26T06:46:20.831+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No GP5, no EXP quints\n\nAs a support main I got no more booster.\nJust the tempting option to be more broke than usual with debt\n\nFeels batman","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2017-09-26T04:43:45.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually green seems pretty solid in its own way.
