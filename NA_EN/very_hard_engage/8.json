Four buffs and two gromps is 6 CS. Are you two saying a jungler who did the first one should have the same experience and/or gold as a jungler who did the second one?\n\nAlso, Skarner is extremely close to leveling and we have no idea how close Shaco is.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-10-03T16:49:02.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"im saying a jungler who does the full path should be higher in level than the jungler who only does buffs. \n\neven assuming shaco never does wraiths/golems and only does solo camps the whole game...\n hes able to stay on par in exp to a jungler who does take the time to do a full clear.","replies":[{"poster":"TiltoverEnforcer","date":"2017-10-03T18:37:11.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrestKnight,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RUB0J9bx,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2017-10-03T16:49:02.708+0000)\n>\n> im saying a jungler who does the full path should be higher in level than the jungler who only does buffs. \n> \n> even assuming shaco never does wraiths/golems and only does solo camps the whole game...\n>  hes able to stay on par in exp to a jungler who does take the time to do a full clear.\n\nShaco (as a result of his KDA) has likely been ganking a lot more than the Skarner. Being near enemy minion deaths grants you experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-10-03T18:40:22.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrestKnight,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RUB0J9bx,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2017-10-03T16:49:02.708+0000)\n>\n> im saying a jungler who does the full path should be higher in level than the jungler who only does buffs. \n> \n> even assuming shaco never does wraiths/golems and only does solo camps the whole game...\n>  hes able to stay on par in exp to a jungler who does take the time to do a full clear.\n\nHow many camps did he steal? How many lane minions did he kill? How many lane minions did Skarner kill? How many lane minions did Shaco get experience from without killing? Skarner? And as you pointed out, he had a kill an assist over Skarner.\n\nThere are a lot of factors. Just CS and KDA is not enough to determine anything. But yes, catch-up experience is too high across the board.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-10-03T16:31:14.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shaco has half the farm as skarner, but is the same level. \n\nshaco doesn't even have to clear his own jungle to stay on par in exp as anyone else. \n\nin terms of 1 kill and 1 assist over skarner, do you honestly equate that much exp as is 6~9 camps are worth?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best princess EU","date":"2017-10-03T18:52:18.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fervor of battle on velkoz","replies":[]},{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2017-10-03T18:42:49.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, Vel is taking CS and feeding","replies":[]}]}
