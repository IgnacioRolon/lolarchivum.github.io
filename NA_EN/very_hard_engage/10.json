I would not consider this a huge buff, and more as a minor tweak. The dmg is literaly lower when you do not use the ult for 3 seconds with enemies inside. Overall I would consider this a nerv with the e changes. (Having one sec less on its cd means nothing if you can't use it right after it is up again. )","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2016-11-18T17:40:23.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you could actually land the stun...","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-11-18T17:41:57.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which i've always encouraged, but being reasonable... its too difficult a skill shot to rely upon, not that it cant be done, but it just shouldn't gate the rest of her kit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sanctimonious","date":"2016-11-18T17:41:07.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wait.
