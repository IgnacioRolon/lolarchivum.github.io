It all started one game in League where everything was running smoothly as usual until the screen just frooze in the middle of a game and a constant, painfull sound came out of my speakers. I couldn't do anything and had to shut down the computer. Then I started it up again and same thing would happen again. After that I stopped playing for a couple of weeks and focused on school, but then when I tried it again I couldn't even start a game. That is where I am today. A message pops up where it says: \"An unknown DirectX error has occurred and League of Legends cannot start. Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer.\"\r\n\r\nEverytime I leave champ select this pops up. What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"pachiporomari","date":"2018-01-03T18:53:56.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand why you would be so worrisome.
