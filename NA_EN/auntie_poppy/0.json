His name is Bard. Let's talk about Bard. He has one the most unique kits in the game. Health packs, a massive tunnel, and best of all a huge AoE zhonyas, the first ability to be able to CC dragon, baron, AND towers. This champ just has an awesome kit! Now here is the problem. It simply does not translate into the game. With a current win rate of 32%, something has to be wrong.\r\n\r\nAs an adc main, I personally feel the insane struggle of having to lane with this champion. Before you move on, downvote, or whatever else give me a chance to explain.\r\n\r\nThe main aspect of Bard is that he roams. Problem #1. When laning bot, lane pressure is a huge part. Without pressure, cs drops, poke drops, and your tower health drops. There are a few main ways of losing pressure. This includes getting Blitz hooked, staying too far back, or roaming. Roaming is a huge and easy way to lose pressure and just throw lane. This is what Bard perfectly provides. There is nothing better than trying to lane 2v1. Sure the health relics are nice, but they barely heal at all. The tunnel is almost as useless as the health relics when it comes to these games. Yes it can setup some amazing plays and yes it can be used to turn fights around, but that is simply not how it translates. Finally the ult. I don't think much needs to be said here. Lots of trolls loving ulting teammates or saving enemies or this or that. The possibilities are endless. However, it is so unreliable and can be so detrimental to your team that it can turn a won teamfight into an enemy cace and nexus clear.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons and more that I don't have the heart to go into, I feel Bard needs to be removed from the game, or very drastically changed. The roaming makes bot lane very unpleasant for the adc since they get super-zoned in a 2v1 lane, the health relics are a joke, the tunnel is never used right, and the ultimate is used more to troll teammates than to win fights. Anytime Bard is chosen, you can be sure the adc will struggle more than with any other support while Bard runs around collecting chimes being totally useless to all lanes. Please Riot. I know you're arrogant but please admit to this mistake and rectify it, for the love of all us summoners.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nBlackFro5t","replies":[{"poster":"mjack33","date":"2015-03-15T05:40:49.575+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/1TrJoExo-tips-to-playing-bard\n\n^^ I started this thread like a day ago?

Really really bad.  You neglected the \"don't do anything option\", so I had to ask for a buff to a balanced champion.  I'm hoping that's what you wanted.","replies":[{"poster":"Auntie Poppy","date":"2015-03-15T06:08:04.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I neglected the \"don't do anything option\" because i don't feel that to be an option.

Or a champ that you can't just stupidly grief with.  In fact, this isn't even the first champ to let you negatively affect your allies.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-15T07:09:34.077+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many champions can grief, however there's never been one who can actually CC his own teammates. We saw the old Tryndamere bug before where he could kill his own allies and it was abused beyond belief, though mostly on Teemos, so it wasn't all bad.... However, Bard gives people the option to purposely troll and act like they're not actually doing anything but being bad. You can't be banned for being bad and it's not hard to fake being bad when your only mistake has to be pressing R on your allies by 'accident'.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2015-03-15T05:35:50.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes a roaming support done right, kinda how they where in s1. HEY BOT LANE, all the other lanes take care of themselves fine so why are you mentally retarded when it comes to staying alive?\n\nAll the other lanes can do it, and the value of having roamer is huge because the enemy is constantly on edge because they don't know how safe they are; this is why we also have a jungler. Its not like bard leaves bot lane helpless he can drop a health station for you and go ward to collect chimes and gank other lanes. That versatility makes him fun and unique something I do not want to lose simply cause you're uncomfortable with a champion who isn't a meta-sheep support that babysits you 24/7 in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-03-15T05:42:23.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the other lanes are facing one champ unless someone comes to gank.

Its basically like if they designed a champion specifically for counterjungling but the issue with both roaming and counterjungling is that they're opportunistic strategies that don't always come up. \n\nIf Bard is going to be a roaming support then they need to either make it so he doesn't pop like a balloon or ramp his damage way waaaaaaay up.
