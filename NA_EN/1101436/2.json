Anytime I'd drop Equinox on Anivia, or she'd step into the pool... It wouldn't cancel/shut Glacial Storm off. Is this working as intended? Because it kind of bothers me that Malzahar's and Cho's silence will cancel her ult but Equinox will not.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-03T03:19:25.605+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that's not intended.

There seems to be a bug where Katarina can restart her ultimate inside Equinox when getting a reset on her abilities (I've also occasionally seen her Shunpo out of Equinox, I'm guessing this is related to resets as well).\n\nI've read some theories from the bug threads where this has been reported about this having to do with Equinox being handled as a reapplying silence dot every 0.x sec and getting a reset in between these allows a cast inside Equinox. Don't know myself but I saw it happen in just about every game of Hexakill last fall when I played Soraka.","replies":[{"poster":"FuryofThornsRedo","date":"2015-04-14T16:50:18.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, my statistics with {{champion:16}} and the Record Times for heals then go for seconds when up against Graves{{champion:104}}, Zyra {{champion:143}}, and Cassiopeia {{champion:69}} .
