It does put your finished item in the lowest spot that u had any ingredient of that item in.\n\nMake sure u drag drop your items into the spots you want to use when you buy them.  I notice sometimes this doesn't work right moving in one direction and you have to drag drop the other way. \n\nFor example, it doesn't move your 2 spot to the 5, move your 5 to the 2","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"test account","date":"2015-03-19T22:21:02.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My mouse has number keys on the side.
