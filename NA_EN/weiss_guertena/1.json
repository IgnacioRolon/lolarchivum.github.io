I was ready to give the benefit of doubt, like making two separate models would be too much work or something... and then I saw the PBE spotlight for Tyrant Swain, which retained the transformation.\r\n\r\nSo, what are you basically saying to Swain players is: &quot;Hey guys, do you want to keep that highly iconic and badass transformation for your character? That will be 10 bucks!&quot; That&#039;s just beyond lame. His transformation is something that should be on every skin by default.","replies":[{"poster":"SirButtplug","date":"2018-01-24T21:50:41.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Not only is it lame but I wonder if it is illegal. For those that already own soon to be classic skins they are literally being taken away. What rights do we as consumers have to prevent this dishonorable business practice?","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-01-24T21:54:07.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not dishonorable business practice AT ALL because Riot clearly states in the Terms of Use that they can change and alter their own content at will, plus it also says that players who buy points and content don't actually own the content, you just own access to it. You accept this proposal every time you hit \"I accept\" when a new patch drops, so if you're acting indignant now, try reading the legal document before blindly agreeing to it.","replies":[{"poster":"SirButtplug","date":"2018-01-24T21:58:40.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn something new everyday .

Swain turning into a giant bird was a bit too goofy, and it still looks really goofy in Tyrant.
