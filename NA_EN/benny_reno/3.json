It shifts between the temperaments of Paul McCartney - sunny, positive - and John Lennon - sceptical, negative. Here's the chorus: I've got to admit it's getting better (Better) A little better all the time (It can't get no worse).","url":"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/02/happiness-conspiracy-against-optimism-and-cult-positive-thinking","image":"http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/images/satiric-illustrations-john-holcroft-1.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can we please please please please please pleeeeeease stop punishing players so much because they're not super nice and friendly and tend to be pessimistic? Because players who just outright refuse to communicate when their in game actions are anything but helping the team out are the real issue and this doesn't really get addressed at all.\n\nThere's no way to challenge it. You're essentially doubly punished for ending up with these kinda people, say anything get reported, can't go afk, you'll get reported. Tribunal as it is, truly bullies people into conforming to a certain way of thinking and it doesn't reward you for playing well, it has the very real chance of rewarding you if you ruin other people's game experience but you're super nice and pleasant as you prance about.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, not the nicest person in the world, but I always do my best to play well and by that I mean I am absolutely a team player, but being nice and friendly doesn't do anything to stop people whose agenda is to ruin your gameplay experience. \n\nAlso thinking happy thoughts doesn't actually do anything except confirmation bias.\n\nLong story short, this game needs to get entirely away from this idea that someone calling you out in chat or something is a worse problem than the person who keeps doing things that ultimately hurts the team.\n\nExample, had a game earlier as AP Nasus, versus Teemo top. Had no issue whatsoever handling that situation. Until our jungler put me behind not once but twice by not even announcing he was coming at all, and literally just coming out of nowhere to ks me when I had it covered. \n\nBy end game I had amassed 20 kills, which was more than anyone else, but here's the problem. Because I complained at all about the fact that Skarner ks'd me, and it was very intentional and not at all a situation where the kill was getting away, the entire team decided to ignore me.\n\nMeanwhile said jungler later on kept farming jungle and other business when we had super minions in the base, and he refused to help. But that's not really a reportable feature. Sure maybe you can get banned for refusing to communicate. But it's a low chance of ever happening.\n\nBut anyways guess who was the only player by the end of the game who could kill everyone on their team? Me. Except the team did everything they could to make my experience even more miserable, and ended up causing us a loss when we were ahead ten kills +.\n\nThis is common in league. Always has been. These same people abuse tribunal. and we all know it. So why isn't everyone being honest about it? Four negative attitude reports because the team I ended up in were horrible people, but since they don't even use in game chat they can basically get away with whatever they want.\n\nSomething has to give. Being nice and cheerful doesn't lead to winning more games overall, what it leads to is having to conform to this communities standards. Which are, do whatever you want in game so long as you never complain about anything.\n\nI'm not suggesting get rid of tribunal, but I am certainly suggesting that the really horrible trouble makers in this game simply don't use chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-08-26T02:35:17.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Benny Reno,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Z3ZEMqj6,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-26T01:53:43.439+0000)\n>\n> Can we please please please please please pleeeeeease stop punishing players so much because they&#039;re not super nice and friendly and tend to be pessimistic? \n\nThey already don't.

This is done *specifically* to prevent the kind of abuse you're worried about here.","replies":[]}]}
