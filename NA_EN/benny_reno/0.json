This is how you accomplish this.\r\n\r\n Know how to Position. It's so simple an idiot to do it. Your job as support is to use every means necessary to keep the adc alive and able to do damage. If enemy team is being super aggressive, playing passive will only work if you're support understands where to position here's a graphic to help you understand this in one context. Get with it seriously. No we don't want your op Cass support that sits behind","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2014-10-20T05:38:45.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just some general support tips:\n\n1) Waste all of your mana as quickly as possible within the first couple of levels, so that when your marksman gets dove on and dies, it's not your fault cause you're oom.\n2) Don't buy wards, they're just Riot's way of trying to trick supports into wasting their money. Don't worry, because everyone has a free ward.\n3) Always chase down kills even if it means certain death; after all, if you die it doesn't matter, cause you're just the support.\n4) If your lane is getting ganked, flash and run away as fast as you can - they'll most likely focus your ADC, and you don't want to give them 2 kills instead of only one.\n5) If you have a large damage ability, try and save it until right before one of your lane opponents are about to die, to ensure the kill.\n6) Always build pure damage; \"dead\" is the single best CC in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2014-10-20T05:20:58.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I do that many in my division (Silver) don't seem to grasp, is when we're ganked or in a fight with no hope of escape, I'll get their attention and basically suicide in a different direction from my team (particularly away from my carry) so they have a far better chance of getting out while the enemy is greedy and spends a few more precious seconds going the wrong way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Benny Reno","date":"2014-10-21T05:22:16.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about that it's about general laning tips. People need to learn how their champ best works with other champs and not just play some built in strategy that never changes. You gotta think ahead. You're not helping the adc by robbing them of farm and making them a prime target for enemy cc. Never put a squishy in a situation where they can't at least escape, the point is to keep the enemy cc'd as long as possible or locked in dealing with you or anyone else on the team for that matter while your team mates designed for damage do their thing safely. \n\nIt works both ways though, plenty of dumb carries, adc needs to know where to position too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2014-10-20T05:21:42.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't summon the support circlejerk.\n\nYou don't want to do that.","replies":[]}]}
