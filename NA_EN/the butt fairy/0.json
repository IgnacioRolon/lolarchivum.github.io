It was ubiquitous upon release from the crazy stats and cost efficiency for such a powerful active on low cooldown, then they basically gutted it with several consecutive nerfs and I almost NEVER see anyone purchase this item anymore.  I think the new catalyst passive made things even worse as the champions who tend to want to buy the item don&#039;t really want that passive more than the old one.\r\n\r\nDoes Riot have any plans to look at this item at all?  The only thing I can think is if maybe instead of a health/mana item, it had resists instead along with the active, maybe we&#039;d start seeing it on some top/jungle champs.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-11-04T16:43:24.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Olaf is literally the only one I've seen actually buy it.\n\nReplace Catalyst with Kindlegem + Cloth Armor.

I really cannot remember seeing it.  I get that it's good for that but man that is one champ and one specific scenario.  They definitely don't want it to be like it was on release when you'd have at least 2 per team and it was ridiculous because it was cheap and gave a TON of health.

If they don't like the idea just remove the item or something but if it's going to be there it deserves to have a use.  It's not about wanting something like it, it's about the item itself needs to be good or even situational.
