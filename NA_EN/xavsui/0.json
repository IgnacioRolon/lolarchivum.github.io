Can we get a permanent ban on anyone that uses this term? Why insult someone over down syndrome, it shows your lack of compassion,intelligence, and understanding of the disorder. I have a cousin who plays league with me and has down syndrome, I would hate to see the day he has a bad game or doesn't do so well and gets called down and insulted using that word, make him feel like garbage, and hes such a happy guy, can people just think before they speak? I can take the worst of punishment, but not all can, and some people actually play this game that have some illnesses the ignorant part of this community so happily makes fun of. Can we censor the word or something? like don't everyone have a friend or family member or know someone with down syndrome, they can't help it, think it makes anyone cool or bigger just calling someone out on it even if they don't have it and you're just trash talking, its really pathetic...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T02:41:15.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's absolutely not cool, and shouldn't be allowed to be said in our game. Nobody should ever be attacked for something they cannot control, much less something like down syndrome. If you *EVER* see players using terms like this negatively, or if you're upset in their usage at all, please please please report them in post-game and feel free to screenshot and submit a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or post that screenshot here showing what they were saying. It's best to trust in the report system as usual, but if you feel it's not doing its job then you're welcome to use other avenues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xavsui","date":"2018-01-18T14:36:41.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't post anywhere but here for some reason, or i would i apologies. But yea, my friend got chat bans for calling someone stupid ingame, 3rd game I seen this player whos called me and my team and his own team autists, down syndrome, retarded, etc. 9x reported him all games, 3rd game still no chat ban, just confuses me, I have him muted but I just feel bad at this point for anyone who has to play with him","replies":[]},{"poster":"FnckU","date":"2018-01-17T17:09:07.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to LOL. I'll give a tip, just mute and report.  Don't even try to argue back. My main account got perma banned because i was standing up for myself.  It's like the school expelled the victim, and let the bully walk get away free of charge. Sounds dumb right? Well that sh*t happened to my account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyah Supp","date":"2018-01-17T14:38:00.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldnt you post that in Player Behavior? \n\nOther than that, ye it sucks how people treat each other in US and EU. After all a game is supposed to be fun, right? Truth is, people are dcks to each other, especially when they can hide behind their keyboards. Best thing you can do is report them and let Riot do the punishing. That being said i dont think censoring is the right way. People want to be mean and they will be mean. Even if they are usually nice people, everybody has a bad day sometimes and honestly insults are just words, maybe it would help you and your cousin to pull it together because, spoiler alert, in the real world you will have to deal with this kind of sht face to face at some point. People should stop being offended about everything. You are not special, you wont get sht handed to you and life sometimes scks. Make the best out of it and maybe use this experience to toughen up for the real world.","replies":[]}]}
