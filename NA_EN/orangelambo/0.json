I login today and it's grayed out, and when hovering over it it says I must own 16 champions. I never owned 16 champions before and I was able to play. Is this a glitch?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T17:30:48.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you have Teemo on your account, who is currently disabled per our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.  While disabled, your champion pool will go down by 1.  I don't have any info or eta on when Teemo will be re-enabled, but you can also unlock another champion in the meantime.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"OrangeLambo","date":"2017-01-17T17:44:49.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still doesn't make sense because I only have a total of 6 owned champions... including Teemo. And Teemo has been disabled for a few days now and I have been playing draft mode after his ban. Really strange how I was playing with that mode if that was a prior rule, but it was completely unlocked for me, you can check my match history.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T17:59:01.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have 10 champions available through the[ Free Champion Rotation](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation/new-free-champion-rotation-akali-lucian-viktor-and-more) which is included as part of your roster.
