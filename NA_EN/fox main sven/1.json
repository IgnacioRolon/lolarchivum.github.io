The penalty treats everyone equally because it can cause a negative experience for other players even if it's not intentional.  If your game is crashing or  giving you bugsplat errors, then you may have a hardware or software issue improperly rendering game files.  My recommendation would be to run through [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) guide, which include steps as simple as updating your graphics driver or running a repair. \n\n Hopefully, this will get your issue resolved but if it persists please let me know along with any additional information such as error messages you may be receiving.","replies":[{"poster":"BlâckLotus","date":"2016-07-19T22:17:01.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why cant we have a pause feature?if someone leaves we can pause the game.\n(its not realy rational giving fb then leaving the game because you have to restart your pc)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-18T12:54:07.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repair the game by clicking the question mark icon to the top right of the patcher.
