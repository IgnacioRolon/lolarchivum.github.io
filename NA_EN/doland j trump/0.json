During this \"stutter\" my ping and fps are fine ( fps on the low end) but fine. 80+ fps and 38ms ping. The minions champions and abilities all appear to be moving in slow motion or at .5 speed. Ive tried reinstalling the game, reinstalling my gpu driver, rolling back my gpu driver, safe running windows, repairing the game, and finally restarting my router. The game is currently unplayable for me and I would really love some help figuring this out. pls rito halp","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T17:24:47.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like this might be packet loss.
