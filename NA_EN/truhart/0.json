I play vs AI almost exclusively because of the hatred exhibited if you make the smallest mistake in a PVP game. But now the BOT games are horrible too. 90% of the games I play are with 2 players that play 2 champs each. They actually focus on one champ, and use the other two &quot;BOT&quot; champs for healing themselves and to deny RED or BLUE on the side of the map my lane is located. If I get a good start they send one of their &quot;BOT&quot; champs to steal my farm or intentional feed my lane, or to keep the enemy champs under their turret if I am playing a melee champ. It&#039;s obvious they practice and have perfected the art of ruining the game for the 3rd human player in the game with them.\r\nAnd how do they get away with using that program that auto-attacks any enemy in range that can be killed with one attack??? That is why they make so many accounts - so in the RARE chance they get caught and banned, just play another account. I report and report... \r\nRIOT please have company people play some games incognito to experience what I have described in this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-01-15T15:10:19.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're allowed to quit. That may sound like I'm being a douche, but I'm really just giving it to you straight. League may not be for you.\n\nBots, in my humble opinion, is not a satisfactory game mode. The enemies fail to scale past a relatively low skill level, so you're stuck playing the game on easy mode. I can see by your match history that you're capable of annihilating bots and getting high KDAs against them, so I can't imagine that being fun for much longer. Plus, as you've noted, the mode is infested with scripted allies, since Riot can't ban them faster than they're created. \n\nThe desirable League experience is competition versus other players. You either stomach it alone or find friends to buddy up with. I respect your hesitancy to play alone, and sympathize with the difficulty of finding friends to pair off with. I would humbly suggest that, if you truly do want to continue playing League, you either learn to play solo or recruit friends.","replies":[{"poster":"SavageConcordia","date":"2018-01-15T21:48:26.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an addendum to the finding a buddy to play with: there is a whole section on the boards for players looking for teams (https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). Maybe make a post over there to see if there is anyone who is around your skill level and wanting to duo up. That being said, I have been playing league for a long time and almost exclusively solo the whole time. It can be an enjoyable experience if you can take the trolls with a grain of salt.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2018-01-15T21:00:02.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additionally, the people in bots are of all skill levels. There doesn't really seem to be an mmr. I've played bots with diamonds walking their freshly level 2 friends through the experience, and let me tell you. Those level 2's are just as bad or worse than any bots. So it's harder for Riot to pick out the real botted accounts in anything but pvp.\n\nI can respect that you're nervous about going into PVP. I was for a really long time. I played bots all the way to level 30 exclusively on my first climb out, to be honest. The prospect of facing others and having them laugh at my skill level was daunting. But in the end, I did it, loved it, and I'm still here three years later. I can't even imagine taking a bot game anymore, even to learn a new champ I'd take them first time in normals because you'll never learn anything but the super basics from bots.\n\nTake comfort in knowing that Riot's matchmaking will do it's best to match you with other players who have never been in PVP matches too.  Use /mute all at the game so that you don't have to hear other people's shitty opinions if you think that they will tilt you. Hit up Player Recruitment if you're afraid to go alone. Lots of options out there for ya mate. Good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Butt Î¡lug","date":"2018-01-15T14:16:38.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah bots are everywhere in coop vs AI, but don't play that game mode.\n\nJust play normals draft, normals draft are made to practice champions/builds/strategies you don't need to be in try-hard mode, you need to get self control and simply don't care about what others might say to you, mute them if it'll help !\nIf you want you can search for people to duo with too, you might find some nice players in a normal game and add them or search in the forums/discord/any community.\n\nBut stop playing vs AI you must win every game i imagine it must be sooo boring, this mode is only useful if you want to practice a champion for the first time, and now that we have the practice tool i'd even say this mode is useless once you've reached level 3 !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Vi Earth","date":"2018-01-15T10:32:10.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont play with my friends because they arnt good. i enjoy winning if i play with them i dont win. so i choose to play alone because i can focus on on improving and climbing and its more enjoyable for me that way.","replies":[]}]}
