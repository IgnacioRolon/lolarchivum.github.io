So I decided to reinstall, I removed it through windows control panel and made sure the league of legends file was deleted(C:\\Riot Games\\League of legends). I downloaded the installer and it did it's thing, but after launching the client it keeps the watermark[](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/158404053821423616/242838603850448896/unknown.png) there and I assume its downloading the rest of the patcher/client but it just stays for awhile and then adventually disappears. To rule out some of the basic things I'm 100% sure I don't have a firewall running on my computer and I've tried running the file as both admin and non-admin, neither working out.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid pasting in a full log file I searched from the bottom to see where it ran into issues, if needed I can still paste the whole thing.\r\n\r\n000001.822|   OKAY|
