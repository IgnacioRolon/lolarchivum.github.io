Everything was normal until I disconnected from the game. I checked my connection to see if it was on my end, but all my other apps were running smoothly. Upon re-opening League, I was not given an option to reconnect to the game. I was presented with the normal client and was even able to queue up for a new game. I even created and entered a practice mode game to see if it would work- and it did. I opened op.gg to see if my ranked game was ongoing, and the website said that it was. Now I'm waiting to see if I lose any LP once the game is over.\n\nEDIT: The game is not showing up on my match history.

The game you were in must have hit some really awkward interaction and completely crashed when it kicked you all out. Since the game wasn't able to be recovered, you aren't able to reconnect or even see it in match history. \n\nNo worries, everyone who was in that game will **NOT** receive any penalties, since the match never even completed and you were all forced out. You're free to start up a new game whenever you're ready!","replies":[{"poster":"ARTlSAN","date":"2017-06-30T03:48:43.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your reply!","replies":[]}]}]}
