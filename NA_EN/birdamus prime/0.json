Far as I am aware, she is the only champion left that has the super fun of trying to predict where a minions health will be many seconds in the future due to wind up on her aa, and the travel time of the projectile.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I&#039;m not asking for a rework, Riot is really bad at reworks, they inevitably end up being &quot;nerfs&quot; in the guise of a &quot;rework&quot; (Poor Veigar, deleted from the game).  Also, fix some of her bugs while you are at it, like spell vamp not working on her pool.  The pool not doing anything with Luden&#039;s echo(If the ticks from tibbers can charge it up, I think it&#039;s only reasonable that anivia&#039;s pool do the same).  Her Q randomly disappearing if it goes through another &quot;effect&quot; like Lux&#039;s orb (this is my best guess what causes it.
