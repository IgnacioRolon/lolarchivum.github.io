If your settings are not saving then your config may corrupt.  A config reset should fix that:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"BilbroSwaggins91","date":"2017-07-26T20:18:42.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not that it isnt saving, the rebind window that pops up doesnt even register the left click, lets me bind it to shift+left click but not left click on its own\nshould also say that i can bind and save settings fine \nalso it seems that nothing can be bound to left click only","replies":[{"poster":"LightSword","date":"2017-07-26T20:36:48.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a specific check box to do this.
