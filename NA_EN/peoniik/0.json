Even though you might have been trying to express those feelings in a nicer way, calling your own teammates \"retards\" isn't quite the best example of good sportsmanship or teamwork.

I apologized to them after but they were stubborn and they were toxic even before  I was which made me toxic. I tried getting unbanned with a ticked but they said that calling someone dumb is never ok. The account that got banned was KarambitNight and i was wondering if you yourself could take a look at the account and see if getting just the slightest bit angry deserved this ban. I learned my lesson and spend a lot of money on this account. you can could you please look.
