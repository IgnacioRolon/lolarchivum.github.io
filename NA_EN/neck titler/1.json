You shouldn't be able to go game to game spamming surrender as soon as possible. Overall this not only ruins the games the person is going into but also provides no real opportunity for that summoner to actually learn anything. Yes you will learn even playing while losing. It has become to a minority a feature used to troll, and should be punished equally as such.\n\nI also am not a fan of letting people que into a ranked game with their friends unless they are 5 deep. Being the odd man out is a terrible experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-25T11:29:30.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"fix your game riot\" when everything said is from the players control.\n\nHmm...","replies":[]}]}
