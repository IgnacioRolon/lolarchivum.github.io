My world champion pick had not locked?? I remember vividly selecting SKT T1 to be the champion and even had people watching me make the pick, so why it is showing up as not being picked is my concern. Did I possibly accidentally unselect it, or did the system goof up?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T17:56:11.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a possibility that your pick em's were created on another account, or that you were logged in at the time of checking your points.  >.<  Hopefully, you were just logged onto the wrong account and everything is okay.
