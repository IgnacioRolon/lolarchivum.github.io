I started playing a month ago I think.\r\n\r\nThe person on my team killed no minions, and just ran at the other team tower to die 39 times, (0/39/1, 0 cs)\r\nThis is troubling, and of course we lose, but more shockingly the person on the other team is yelling NO %%%%%%S NO %%%%%%S in the chat box to our team all game. This slur is his name as well.\r\n\r\nEither scenerio seperately is not enjoyable. But together I must question if this is the general temperature of the persons that play this game. If so I will remove myself. Please do answer. I play many games, but I do not often see this level of grief on both sides of teams at once.\r\n\r\nAnother question is it took me long to reach level 16 summoner. Does a person with a name such as this not worry for wasting his own time should his account go? Or does no one enforce penalty so there is nothing to worry about? I am confused somewhat that this person seems brazen to name themselves such a slur or in the other case force a team loss with an intentional pointshave to 0/39/1. \r\n\r\nStrange.","replies":[]}
