With this I get big delays in what im doing so I'll press an ability..........there we go and its really annoying as it really messes up gameplay for me. Moving is a right pain with having to wait for me to turn takes a second or two but I mean sometimes its alright and then bam 3000ms. Yes I had this. Its just not going anywhere. Anyone else got this recently?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T17:13:40.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big spikes in latency are typically a result of your connection to the server being unstable. This could be caused by routing issues to the server or by problematic local network settings that just don't play well with League.
