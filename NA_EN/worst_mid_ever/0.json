Despite this, for some reason it died almost instantly after release, and when I queue for a normal I still get people &quot;calling&quot; a role and then trolling or afking if someone else locks it. Is there some technical error with the matchmaking? The last time I played I was only getting matched with silvers, despite my normal MMR matching me with mostly plats and diamonds, that was last season though.","replies":[{"poster":"Renaille","date":"2015-04-10T08:29:54.204+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"Team builder isn't unpopular.
