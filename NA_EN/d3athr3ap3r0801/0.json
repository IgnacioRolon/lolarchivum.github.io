As many can understand playing on EU west servers means a ping of 200 - 250ms. \r\nAs read before Riot said there is not enough players in SA to launch a server when in fact is the reason for that is because of the server issues. \r\nI know quite a few players that stopped playing just because of the fact there is no SA server. \r\nBut OK. Down to the main question. \r\nIs there anyway for Riot to launch a trial server for South Africa to see what their \"Population\" does concerning South Africa. Whether it grows or falls [In the 3 month trial period]. And even if we can help to set up a trial server (Buy a server for trial in SA). How much would it cost to for us to help launch the trial and whether it is even possible or not.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T02:30:48.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's something they've thought about, but there are a lot of factors that go into getting new servers made. Sometimes it might not be needed due to how few players would benefit, but most times it all comes down to actually finding a physical location suitable for housing the servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D3ATHR3AP3R0801","date":"2017-12-19T10:19:53.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of factors yes I know. But still South Africa ain't as everyone see on television... We do have the infrastructure to host. Alot of other games have dedicated SA servers. So finding the ideal place to host is noo problem at all... Durban Cape Town Johannesburg (some of our most advanced cities) already hosts tons of servers... And the amount of players that would benefit... Why does everyone go to Population??? SA as a @#$@ load of gamers. Just give us a chance... Host a trial server. if it fails it fails we tried but if it works well shame on em for not doing it sooner... A lot of people i know (Friends of friends etc.) playes only SA server games for the ping... Im just saying they will never know if they dont try it... maybe it fails maybe they get suprised. the population might not be what they want if you look at the SA population but will it be there moneys worth???? I definately think so","replies":[]}]}
