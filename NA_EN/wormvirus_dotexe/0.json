For some reason these past 2 days i have been DC'ing inside champ select.  Sometimes i can get back from the dc in enough time to pick a champ other times i get kicked and lose LP or a series cause of it.  I have allowed exceptions for league through my firewall and im connected via ethernet.  During these dcs the internet still works. Just not league and it only seems to happen in champ select.  Is there a fix for this or am i SOL","replies":[{"poster":"xReazu","date":"2017-12-02T15:39:07.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get a different response than the same bullshit riot always posts? I checked my connection, it's 96/100, should be ok right? NO. Every time i got to champ select, there is litterally not one champ select where i don't dc atleast 2 times. It causes me to dodge, lose lp, lose promo's and so on. Please look into this issue instead of posting the same response on every post.\nKind regards\n~ xReazu","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T20:31:13.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be other network settings or issues along your route to the server that are causing these disconnections.
