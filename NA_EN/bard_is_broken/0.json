Anivia has one of the simplest kits in the game, and it's still absolutely unique and interesting.  As well-designed as Velkoz is, I don't think his design is really very unique aside from his ult.  I don't hold that against him - not everything needs to be super novel.  He's a poke/control mage that does those jobs well and has healthy counterplay and interaction. His kit's also not super complicated, so I'd guess the OP approves of his design.\n\nLikewise, moving ahead, it's not hard to make another poke mage when Velkoz is the recent standard.  Maybe you take the focus off of comboing and instead place it on area denial, which is a strength many poke mages have, but not so much Velkoz.  Maybe you focus the next one on displacement and disengage rather than damage.  The problem I have with the champions I listed in the other post is that their strengths are all over the place.  ADC releases have been mobility crept to hell, so what's Riot going to have to do if they want to release a low-mobility ADC?  Give them utility?  Well, if Kalista already has a 2s knockup ult that can save her allies and engage for her team, on top of scouting and a slow, that utility becomes harder and harder to provide.  Same for the others' kits and their roles.\n\nAt the end of the day, I feel a lot more confident in Riot developing new diverse champs when they don't load kits to be good at everything.  It's easier to make a diverse group of specialists rather than a diverse group of swiss army knife champs.  Riot did a good job of this in the past, which isn't surprising considering where the game came from, but they moved away from it.

I don't see why everyone hates on it.\n\nHere's my problem with complexity in LoL: it doesn't exist. The only difference between Annie and Azir is the learning curve. Annie takes 10 games to master while Azir takes maybe 30 or 40. These are arbitrary numbers obviously. The only difference between them in terms of gameplay is the amount of time investment required. If it was an issue of complexity then Azir would be more prone to make mistakes, but that really isn't the case, a good Azir will not make many (if any) mistakes just like a good Annie won't either. Azir just takes longer to learn the proper button mashing sequence, that's it. \n\nBut here's the kicker, Azir's kit is much more loaded than Annie's because of his fabricated complexity. Azir is one of the most broken champions in the game despite receiving massive nerfs shortly after his release. The reason for this is because his kit can just do too much. He was given that huge kit because of his perceived difficulty to play. Difficulty, in this game at least, does not exist though. It is a game of patterns, combinations, and reflexes, and any champion can be made to be easy by simply playing said champion several times and learning the proper patterns of play, combinations of abilities, and reflexes in given situations. \n\nNow, do I mind a \"complex\" champion? No. Do I want every single new champion forever to be \"complex?\" Hell no. I don't always have 100 hours to waste learning a new champion. Sometimes I'd like to master one in a 20 or so hour investment, but I don't get to do that anymore with the way Riot is designing champions now. The time it takes to travel a learning curve combined with the fact that \"complex\" really means \"overloaded\" in this game is why I generally prefer simplicity.\n\nYou can also create new mechanics that are simple - Bard's passage thing is pretty easy to learn and use, I would classify that as \"simple.\" We will probably just disagree - I do, however, respect your opinion.

The learning curve for them is different, and that is just one of several differences. My greater point was that complexity in this game, as in mechanics and gameplay, doesn't actually exist. Complexity would suggest that some champions in this game are hard to play, to which none are. I was simply stating that what people perceive as \"complexity\" in this game is really just the variance in time required to learn the gameplay patterns and mechanical combinations for a particular champion.\n\nWhen we say \"every champion is easy to pick up but some are harder to master,\" that pretty much confirms that complexity is a myth. What people are really asking for is champions with a high ceiling cap, but this can be done without trying to make champions difficult by giving them overloaded kits. I have learned the hard way in the last couple of weeks that Veigar is a difficult champion to play well. Not because he's complex, but because he trades high damage potential for high vulnerability. His strengths are significant and also significantly offset by his weaknesses. I like that about him though. His kit is simple, but difficult to master, and that's what I would like to see more of. I, personally, do not want to see more Ekkos with 20 different powers compressed into 4 abilities (an exaggeration I know).\n\nOnce we understand that complexity in this game is a lie, and understand what players _really _ want from champion design, then we can proceed to making truly fun and alluring content. What we want are strong champions with significant downsides. Champions that can counter well and be countered well. Some may also want champions that can do everything meaningful in the game within their 4 ability power set, I am not one of those people.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2015-07-01T17:29:50.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But if you look at the reworks, most of them are kept quite simple and straightforward.

I tend to play champs that are \"difficult\" or just branded so, just generally off meta. I have to concur that complexity is a bit fabricated. But only on the face value of a champion.

Take for example my three favorite champions. {{champion:34}} {{champion:28}} and {{champion:17}} I find these champions complex while others see them as pretty simple. The reason being is there deployment. I can take Eve and build her as sustain, burst, AA reliant, or tanky. Same with Teemo. These champions are complex in there reliability and playstyle. Now take a look at Anivia. She has had the same kit pretty much since beta and in my opinion she is the most complex of ANY champion. She has the lowest health of any champ yet you can turn her into the beefiest tank in the game if you slap a GA, sunfire, warmogs, and RoA on her. Taking a look at the other side of the spectrum, with soulstealer and full ap, a sinlge Q E combo every semi squishy is dead. Seiging, sustaining, tanking, supporting, hypercarry, or split pusher, she can pretty much do it all. If that's not complex I don't know what is.

Ekko is very complicated, I'd say Gnar is pretty complicated although not to the same extent. And when I say simple/complicated, I mean champs whose kits are complicated, not someone like Zed or maybe Vayne who requires mechanical precision to do well. I don't think Tahm is that bad though.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-06-30T19:26:57.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar isn't that complicated.

Gnar has a lot of basically hidden stats, not to mention that he basically has 2 skill sets. Gnar's passive gives him different stats based on which form he's in, both q's slow but by different amounts (one depends on what rank your ult is), its cooldown is reduced, q and e also both apply his w (but only in mini form), 3 stacks on his w in mini form speeds him up, mega form stuns, he has a potential double leap on his e when in mini form, and in mini form it actually grants him attack speed, and then while his mega form ult is very simple, his mini ult passive gives different stats to q.\n\nGnar's kit is pretty complicated, you have to admit.","replies":[{"poster":"jeffpunkh","date":"2015-07-01T12:41:21.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not complicated its just stuffed.

There's a reason Runes cost so much IP and there's a reason why \"snowball\" is a term used quite frequently.
