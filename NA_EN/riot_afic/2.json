{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-05T16:37:22.928+0000","title":"If your game is freezing at ~5-10 minutes, look here","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all, we recently began to address an issue where players had there game freezing 5-10 minutes into the game as seen on [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/1yUAdeKV-in-game-freezing?comment=004500000002) thread.  We addressed the main source of this issue, but there are still some edge cases that could result in this problem occurring even after our initial fix.  \n\nIf you are still encountering this problem, following these steps will really help us out in tracking down the root cause.\n\n1.  When the issue occurs(IMPORTANT THAT IT IS WHEN IT OCCURS), open up task manager (ctrl + alt + del, and then select task manager)\n2.  Right click the process that says ‘League of Legends (TM) Client’ and click ‘Create dump file’.  This will take a few moments.\n3.  Copy the link and navigate to the folder.  For me it looks like this: \n\tC:\\Users\\acohen\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\League of Legends.DMP\n\tI would want to go to C:\\Users\\acohen\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ in windows explorer\n\n4.  Go to https://www.filemail.com/ select ‘Send as link’ (next to send as email towards the middle), and click the Add Files button.  Navigate to the DMP file from above, and then click ‘Send’.  You will be prompted with another window, where you click ‘Send’ again.  (This will take a little while).\n5.  You will be provided with a link, which will lead us to the file you just uploaded.  Copy/paste that link in this thread.\n\n\nI'll be paying attention to this thread and updating it as we better understand the problem.  Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for bearing with us.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkPastels","date":"2018-11-19T22:32:11.571+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi, I'm having this issue but I'm unable to get to my task manager to create a dump file because when it freezes, I can't alt tab out completely.

I did notice you have quite a few things running with league (DiscordHook - overlay from Discord injected into the game, Razer Cortex - FPS monitor/tracker from Razer injected into the game, AVG anti-virus library), so it might be worth disabling them 1 at a time to see if that improves the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"DJVinylKnight","date":"2018-06-05T23:49:43.468+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I sort of face palmed at the idea of my Discord Overlay causing the issue since I've had it on for so long at this point. When I turned it off, the next game I was in I didn't run into the issue until the end (Was a short twenty odd or so minute game.) I closed my Razer Cortex fully (Which is supposed to help not cause problems ironically) and played another and saw none of my issues pop up. The only thing I didn't disable was my AVG, but mainly because I already have League whitelisted because of a prior problem way back so I don't see AVG causing too big of a fuss.\n\nTotally fixed? I can't say for certain with just two games with those changes but to be frank if in the long run the problem becomes less frequent then it can be then I'm pleased.\n\nStill can't thank you enough for all the help and attention to this problem!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-05T23:54:05.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem!

So I don't see anything for a while.\nWhen I press B, it takes some time to recall too (like 2 seconds).\nWhen I use the arrows to navigate it takes time too. So I only use the mouse.\nEven when I am typing a message in chat, it will start to appear after a long time, and it will appear too slow, (like 1 letter per second).\nSo the only thing I can do during this time, is moving arround with the mouse and farm with auto attacks, cause doing something else like casting an ability or a spell, will probably get me killed due to the time it requires.\nThis happens approximately at 8 minute (or sooner) and it lasts approximately 5 minutes, and then everything works fine.\nI have been experiencing this problem the last 2 months.
