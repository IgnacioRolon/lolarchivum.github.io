When there is a problem that occurs within the Client,  a patching related issues, or anything that involves gameplay (stuns not working, unintended interactions between abilities, vision issues, etc.) post it here following these guidelines.  \n\n**How to Submit a Bug**\n\n1. In the title, briefly describe the bug and tag it as either [GAMEPLAY], [CLIENT], or [CRASH]\n2. In the body of the post, include a more in-depth description of the bug you are encountering.\n3. Follow up the description of the bug with numbered step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the issue.\n4. Include how frequently you can get the issue to occur and any video or screenshots of the bug that might help clarify it.\n\nYou can find a good example of a bug submission [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/21gfV9sM-example-of-a-good-bug-submission)\n\n**Why is this helpful to us and good for you?**\n\nAs a player, I get just as frustrated as anyone else when a bug causes me to lose a teamfight, or even miss a minion kill.  Getting this information allows us to more quickly identify why things are broken and will expedite the process so it doesn’t happen anymore.  The most useful information you can provide is how you got the bug to happen, and how frequently you can reproduce the issue (or how often it uncontrollably happens to you).  Myself and other Rioters will be constantly looking at these boards, communicating about issues you see, and most importantly taking these problems to the correct people so that they can get fixed!\n\n**Please do not report a bug in this discussion.**","replies":[{"poster":"Baitsa Dasuto","date":"2014-09-22T23:35:07.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a particular Vi bug which I noticed about 2-3 weeks ago, though I don't know if it's still an issue and I've forgotten a few details on how to trigger it, though I still remember most of how it went - should I report it ASAP, or should I try to reproduce it first in a custom game?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Velocity","date":"2014-09-22T23:43:50.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Shierunsensei!\n\nFirst of all, thanks for taking a look at the Bug Report forums and bringing this issue up.\n\nNow, on to your question.
