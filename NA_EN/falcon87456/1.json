Here's pictures of what I currently get every time I've tried to access them: http://imgur.com/a/Rsld8. I'm really frustrated at this point, as I've tried firefox, chrome, and edge on my laptop and my desktop, along with using my phone. I've tried both my mobile connection and my school wifi. I've also fully cleared all cookies and caches on each device and then tried it again. I'm extremely frustrated, as the match history page would actually be valuable to me as I play on a team and could use the info, and the PBE signup is something I'd like to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T21:45:47.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, the Blitzcrank error on the PBE page is something I've seen when the issue is with network routing. Can you try using a VPN (virtual private network) such as [Cyberghost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com) or [Hotspot Shield](https://www.hotspotshield.com/) while trying to connect to these pages and let me know if anything changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Falcon87456","date":"2016-09-27T04:47:44.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cyberghost worked! thanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Falcon87456","date":"2016-09-27T04:30:08.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try CyberGhost.
