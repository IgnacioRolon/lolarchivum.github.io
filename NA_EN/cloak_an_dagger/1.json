Why is the mere existence of one archetype of champions preventing another from having any meaningful item diversity? Would you even agree with this statement? I think this question has been brought up before and the general consensus seems to be that it would be easily abusable by Bruisers. \n\nThe only pseudo ad caster item was {{item:3071}} and it gets built now by Bruisers much earlier and more often than AD casters like Zed or Talon. I think the recent shifting of stats makes it less desirable since it has less flat AD and more flat health. The cool-down reduction is so juicy, but the new build path and health is a major turn-off. You sacrifice too much damage early to buy this item except situationally and usually as a 5th or 6th buy.\n\nAll (or most of) the AD casters have very pre-determined item choices that typically prioritize armor penetration (flat and %) and actives on items\n{{item:3142}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3074}} \nin order for them to be relevant throughout the game.

Historically, AD casters when strong have just stacked armor penetration, and the result is that building armor against them is totally ineffective unless you're going to invest in several tank items. If a squishy wants to take the edge off of an assassin's kill combo, they have absolutely no way to do that, especially since health is a lot less effective against AD burst since they can always finish you with autoattacks.\n\nIn contrast, picking up a negatron cloak against a leblanc has a noticeable effect. It actually helps you survive against her, and if she doesn't kill you she doesn't have the ability to just easily finish you with basic attacks. \n\nBasically, could you *please* not make this new AD Caster item give armor penetration, unless you intend on making all the different armor penetration items unique?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloak an Dagger","date":"2015-08-12T11:29:34.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r9LxEb8y,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-12T04:03:37.508+0000)\n>\n> If you ask me, the AD caster/assassin guys could probably use an optimized version of Ghostblade (or other Brutalizer upgrade), and maybe one or two more items specifically for them.
