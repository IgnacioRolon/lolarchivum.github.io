I'm more than happy to give players second chances if they are genuine about improving their behaviors. If people know what they did wrong and want to actually change, I want to empower that. Players that create negative experiences for thousands of players then wait until the final permanent ban tier to barely clean up... Sad panda Lyte.\"\r\n\r\nand I sent you a message on Twitter and it said \r\n\r\n\"I want to ask for a favor for you and see if you can help me. and for helping me I can either help you or make a deal with you in any way concerning my LoL Account. I will admit a few things for instance until recently I was one TOXIC M**** F***** and I realized how toxic I was when your system permanently banned my account. Now I will admit that before my account was permanently banned I did not think or notice how toxic I was being. The Moment that my League of Legends Account got permanently banned I feel sad, depressed, and very empty inside without my account. I never knew or understood how precious my League of Legends account was to me until I lost it. Now I want to make things right and fix/make amends for where I have made wrong. I am willing to do whatever it takes to get my League of Legends Account Back from your system, but do know this I see how your system works and it has in fact changed me, because on my alternate account I have not been cursing I have not been even talking much in game and I have been doing much better and I understand now how you system works in a way. Anyways I am sending you this Message, because I want my League of Legends Account back and was wondering if I vow to never be toxic again or do anything that can prove I have changed for the better would you be willing to undo the ban my banned account? I am willing to do whatever it takes to get the part of my life that I have now lost and this Account I spent over $7,000.00 on and I hope you can understand that this account is not precious to me because of how much I spent on it, but its about all the memories I have had with my account and how long I had it. Please Hear My Plea and undo the ban my account. and I will never ever be toxic again. I will literally do whatever it takes to get my league of legends account back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLyte I want you to read this, because I put my heart and soul into this message to convince you to undo my perma banned account and you never even read my message and I want you to read this and see if it is not from my heart and soul in this message, because I lost 6 years of my life on my account and I really wish you would give me another chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-05-18T19:52:09.140+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"Unfortunately permanent bans are permanent.\n\nI do appreciate the message though, and the fact that you are doing better.
