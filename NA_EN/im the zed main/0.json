It's possible to curse without it being an issue, and also to abuse a player without cursing.\n\nIf you want to discuss your punishment here, I suggest posting your reform card(s) so we can go over what you did that was unacceptable and what you could've done better. If you want to appeal your ban to Riot you need to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Im The Zed Main","date":"2016-05-26T23:34:37.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"I didnt do jack shit that was unacceptable.
