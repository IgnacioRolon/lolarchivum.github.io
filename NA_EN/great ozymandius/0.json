Because they are so squishy, the other team will target them.  They make excellent bait.  Hide behind your ADC&#039;s and wait until the other team blows all their cooldowns on your adc.  Then engage.  \n\n2) Some champions are very effective at cleaning up after a fight.  Take malphite, for example.  His ultimate does like 300 damage (!) and has a very long range.  So you can guarantee that that pesky support doesn&#039;t leave the fight alive after everything is said and done.  Also, his ult is a very strong escape tool, so if it looks like your team is taking a lot of damage, just ult away from the fight (Dyrus was my inspiration in this regard).  \n\n3) The team with more damage wins.  So you want to build as much damage as possible, especially on supports.  Don&#039;t buy an early sightstone.  In fact, don&#039;t buy one at all.  You might need to take some of your carry&#039;s farm for you to rush that Deathcap.  \n\n4) In laning phase, whoever&#039;s wave is most pushed is basically winning.  Push your wave as hard as you can from the very start of laning phase.  Use all skills off cooldown until you are out of mana. For example, you can tell a good nasus from a bad nasus based on how pushed his lane is.  Is he at the other player&#039;s tower?  That is diamond material.  \n\n5) Relatedly, if you are jungle, you might need to help your laners push their waves.  Often times, top laners will be stuck with the minion wave just in front of their tower, which basically means that they are stuck losing the lane.  I&#039;ve helped many a Nasus by hitting enough of those minions so that the wave pushes back to winning territory.  \n\n6) People need constructive criticism to get better.  Is Nasus still farming minions at 10 minutes when he should be grouping?  Tell him he is an idiot.  He will thank you later.  Also, use that question mark ping on top of whoever is being an idiot and do so as often as possible.  He will concentrate better if he knows his team is paying attention to him.  \n\n7) Black cleaver shreds armor, so all physical damage dealers do more damage to the target.  This is why it is often a good idea to have full ad team comps -- you can make better use of that armor shred.  \n\n\nI&#039;ll post more advice once I get promoted to Bronze 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-07-31T23:56:30.031+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck.

He will have a harder time more than likely ranking up. It's kinda like Diamond mains like idk, Redmercy for example? Huzzygames? These diamond mains who never been masters before. So chances are, the guy in plat 2 is going to stay in plat.\n\nSo if I wanted, I can get to Plat 5.

I decided to put time into rank, and get of bronze with nearly a 70% win rate on Skarner lol.. It's easy, so is Silver, and Gold.

The point though is 1 or 2 isn't as bad as 5. I play on my roommates old account (he quit) and he quit a couple years ago and I carried him out of b5-s5 in a week or so, without losing more then a handful of games. I'm only gold, I could perhaps be plat if I put the time into it, lately been playing Xbox so I'm not keeping up on my skills.

You should be able to get out of Bronze by playing games. I think it took nearly 100 games for me to get out of bronze, but I started at Bronze 4 tho. (I heard that the silver playerbase is actually the biggest majority of players. New accounts give you silver MMR, so a lot of people tend to end up in silver).\n\nAs for the whole \"I beat Diamonds' yeah, I've also been embarrassed by them but a lot of it comes down to  champion selection with this champ vs that champ, and in my opinion, I think a lot of games are won just by the champion selection.\n\nI switched to the jungle role personally, just easier to get out of elos with cause you can dictate the lanes and stuff.\n\nSome people have religiously said that if you want to get to a high elo, play support... LOL, but hey if it works, it works. For me, the Jungle thing is working. If I find it working less, I'll go back, watch some tapes and replays and figure out what I am doing wrong. I usually watch several of my replays throughout the weeks.\n\nSo it's weird someone points out my rank which is lower, cause my rank can be higher, but can their \"high\" rank progress? probably not cause a lot of well known diamond players have never been masters before like redmercy, huzzygames, a lot of youtubers.  Me? I just not playing enough at the moment but as you can see, took about 2 weeks playing during the night to get silver which wasn't hard.\n\nSo kinda laughable at people calling out a low rank compared to a high rank person who probably has reached their peak in performance.
