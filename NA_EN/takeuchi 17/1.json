I'm coming from a mid/top main perspective into the support role which is why i'd like some advice/tips on how to make a more aggressive/threatening support thresh that an opposing team would think twice to rush in on solo.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-06T20:52:49.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically in my experience there are 2 different fields of view on Thresh. The one I use is CDR focused, basically using the low CD CC of Thresh to be effective. Now there are also \"tank\" thresh. The core differences are because of playstyle. Personally I want to peel for my carry or move them to safety with lantern in team fights.\n\nThresh Random tips:\n\n- Flail on click to cast, lets you control the direction much more effectively.\n\n- If an ally is going to check a bush, stay behind to Dark Passage them.\n\n-  Relic Shield at start, swap to Talisman of Ascension. ToA is better gold gen late game, especially in soloQ where you can't be guaranteed to be let proc your shields stacks. Since most supports get Locket as well the double shield may be less effective than the speed boost (either for just you to run/engage or for the entire team).\n\n- Always try to Flail into Death Sentence. Flail will let you re-position minions giving you the ability to land a hook, as well as you want the longer/more disruptive CC last. This is mostly for psychological in that the longer the CC when already taking damage you will get them to back off more (fear of further damage). This is underrated but actually important in lane. If the just ONE of the bot lane is thinking \"Oh sh*t run!\" you can win the trade harder than normal.\n\n- Don't throw Dark Passage at peoples feet, try to lead them (it is hard sometimes to guess if your ally will continue a path or change)\n\n- Gank bluffs with Dark Passage. You can constantly bluff that the JG is bot throughout the game, the enemy bot lane will either back up or risk the Jg actually being there. Do it often enough and they will relax when you throw it when the JG is actually there","replies":[{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-03-06T20:57:31.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny thing is i've actually used dark passage for ganks haha its really nifty, probably my favorite ability on him. I'll definitely try flailing to reposition minions more, i like that psychological approach ty","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-06T21:13:49.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL is 90% psychological. Especially in soloQ, over my 3 accounts I think my lowest Thresh win rate is 65%. I mostly win lane off of understanding the fact without voice communication if you make one second guess the trade or fight you win.\n\nAs far as Flail on smart cast or click (guy below uses on smart cast) it is really preference. For me it helps me predict the minion wave movements as well as the champion and how they will likely dash after the Flail. This burns their escape as well as chains CC.\n\nPost Edit 2: Flash can also be used with Dark Passage to bring allies even further. A really great thing to keep in mind is Death Sentence into Dark Passage (behind to an ally) into second activation of Death Sentence. For an example of this watch this. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVIj1t5duP8","replies":[{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-03-09T15:43:20.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow that video just blew my mind. if i could start landing plays like that then damn lol. thank you","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GnomeDigest","date":"2015-03-06T20:29:58.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random things that have helped me as I practice thresh.\n\n-Use lantern to scout danger bushes you want to ward\n\n-I have found putting flay on smart cast has made it much more reliable for me.\n\n-Keep in mind the box is great for clogging up choke points. For example if we are doing dragon/baron and enemy team is coming through their jungle I might preemptively box their entrance to the river. Often that alone is enough to secure a safe dragon and get away. I feel sometimes thresh's feel they have to save the box for the middle of an actual fight. In my example above for example that would be a little to late and risk the dragon and/or a bad fight.\n\n-I think relic shield is a much better starting gold item for thresh than coin. You are much better at winning trades and taking damage for your adc early with it. I am just to squishy with coin early as I want to win the lane, not just survive it. If I know I will want talisman eventually I just dont upgrade relic and eventually sell it for talisman.\n\n-Practice flash-flaying. This is another reason I like having flay on smartcast because it just makes the move easier. A good flash-flay sets you up for a follow hook that is basically guaranteed unless they burn their flash. I will trade a supp flash for their carries flash any day.","replies":[{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-03-06T20:34:33.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll have to try the flash flay i like that idea. hopefully i dont botch it too bad lol. trying flay on smart cast might be something ill have to try after i get more used to it, I'm still fairly choppy with flay. and what situation would you say you would trade the relic for the talisman, would it only be if your lane is ahead and off to a good start?","replies":[{"poster":"GnomeDigest","date":"2015-03-06T20:44:46.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was fairly choppy with flay which is why I tried it smartcast and to me it seems easier.  Maybe the same will happen for you.\n\nFor me trading for talisman has to do with what the team comp needs. If we have champs that need speed boosts to engage well like Olaf, I would consider swapping. Especially if we lack other strong engage.\n\nIf we lack disengage and/or enemy team has engage that talisman could counter I might swap. Especially vs a gnar/nasus or the type where whlie they are ulted (or mega) you are better off kiting them out then talisman can be essential.\n\nIf enemy has lots of hard cc and/or burst then FotM is much better at making an impact as it can be the difference between your carry being taken out instantly or surviving to be a factor in a fight.\n\nIts all about reading the team comps and seeing which active benefits your team more. The personal stats of the item only matter imo during the laning phase where trading is big. Later game that one gives you health vs another giving you more CDR or mana regen is largely irrelevant.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-03-06T20:16:21.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen some Thresh's build a Shiv for poke as their single offensive item, haven't done it personally, but makes for a surprising opener when you hook their carry jump into them and their team gets a face full of Shiv when they come to help.  Personally if I'm that far ahead I build a SunFire as AOE damage always helps a Thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rth2","date":"2015-03-06T20:01:48.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanky thresh with utility (mikaels) is fine. Remember, thresh is not really strong in his solo play. Thresh is strong due to his utility. If the enemy tries to solo you and you are tanky, you can run. If they chase you, there is always the option to flay them for a slow, toss the lantern and hook the enemy as a teammate grabs your lantern. Turn their greed into your trap.\n\nThresh is about his utility. He has a knockback, 2 slows, his chain, and his lantern which provides both a shield and mobility. He also has good poke with his empowered attack and just having a ranged attack in the first place.\n\nFor item builds, lots of high profile players play thresh. You can always look up teams and their builds and find an explanation as to why these players build these items. But for you to really unlock thresh you will have to get really proficient with his kit and his playmaking potential. (Not his hook a person and go 1v5 potential, mind you) but his playmaking. His ability to catch people out, save people, and turn otherwise good engages from the enemy into bad engages with his disruption and CC.\n\nHope that was at least a little helpful! Learn the kit, but with thresh you will need your team to win the game! It's not the same as a support annie who gets ahead and can go nuke/cc mage and do half of the work by herself!","replies":[{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-03-06T20:10:16.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gotcha i guess that makes much more sense to maintain the build where I have it. this is my first heavy utility champion so I guess i it makes more sense to learn better team plays versus a better individual build. thank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-03-06T19:53:35.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support icon for Thresh is a conversation for the ages.  Personally I go coin with him as looking at match history the coin netted more gold in the long run than {{item:3302}} and he doesn't benefit from the execute as he's technically ranged.  \n\nLook at my Leona Rune / Mastery pages as I run those on Thresh also.  Remember landing smart hooks is better than missing hooks.  I can't count the number of times a Thresh on my team has hooked their tank and it's an awful thing to behold.  Last night we had a decent Thresh, but one team fight he ended up hooking Malphite and we got wombo'd hard by Malph / Leo and had to fall back.  \n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"rth2","date":"2015-03-06T21:06:43.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points. I also have a couple things to add.\n\n{{item:3069}}  vs {{item:3401}}\nThresh has an auto attack enhancer. Not having the execute on targon doesn't matter as long as you can competently last hit. So don't let that deter you (if you can't last hit well with thresh, practice and secure last hits with your damage boost).\n\nIf you are split between these two you can always look at team comps. Ascension gives a burst of movespeed. Good for kiting, engaging, disengaging, especially in a team comp with a sivir or something like that. However, if you are against a hard engage comp or the enemy has an assassin like zed/fizz you can take Mountain plus {{item:3222}} . Mountain gives them a good shield based on your max health (which also detonates for damage on enemies btw) and Mikael's helps replenish their hp / shrug off CC. Both very strong against a diving comp or a comp with a pesky assassin.\n\nOnce again, playing support think utility especially in mid-late game as opposed to pure gold gain early game and try to make the call that will help win the game.\n\nAlso, on the topic of hooks. Remember that your hook is also a zoning tool. When you can hook somebody they have to be careful. When you miss a hook the enemy has a window of time to mess with you. This is a less punishing window with Thresh since he has flay and auto attacks, but the hook being on cooldown takes a lot of pressure out of the lane. Sometimes just holding your hook and zoning with it is enough to start turning a lane in your favor and forcing the enemy into a spot where you can hook them more easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2015-03-06T20:03:33.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok i see how that can help early but what about in a situation when i'm ahead mid/late game and say Ive got coin maxed, randuins maxed and my team is doing really well. would there be an item other than mikaels or locket that i could build that would may be dish out some damage and maintain my tankiness?
