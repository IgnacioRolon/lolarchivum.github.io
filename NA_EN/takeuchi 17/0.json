Like what if I didnt want that (I totally do, but I don't play ori so just stuck with buying the kha skin). I'm just curious as to the thought process \r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T04:14:02.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We wanted players who bought the entire bundle to be able to get a little extra, which is why we decided to include the extra Corruptant Icon. It's a little weird to see that icon only has a cost of 1RP, but essentially it's just a little extra something. I would say a \"freebie\" but the store would straight up have a nuclear meltdown if the item didn't have a price on it at all xD!","replies":[{"poster":"Takeuchi 17","date":"2017-05-05T04:24:37.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very weird indeed, I kinda wish there were two additional bundles for each champ instead, so I didnt have to choose between an icon or a ward skin since I didnt buy the bundle; but beggars cant be choosers lol. awesome skin though, can't wait to get my jungle on this season now","replies":[]}]}]}
