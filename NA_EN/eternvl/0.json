Heimer suffers in this meta and suffers from many champions that counter and scale way better. Like honestly, take champions like Zyra and Azir and think to yourself &quot;Why would I pick Heimer over these two?&quot;. Heimer does no damage to tanks. Turrets are easily taken out, even when you spread them out. His cooldowns are long and if you miss them, you are just a cannon minion. His passive is so useless mid-late game and seems randomly placed on Heimer. Immobile and easy to gank with a smart jungler that carries a smite for his turret. Hell, Heisondong, who is a Heimer main that was challenger/masters, hates playing Heimer in the past 2 seasons because people have been countering him so hard and knowing how to play against Heimers. Why this champ did not receive changes for the low scopes in the mage update confuses me.","replies":[{"poster":"ChrisFishy","date":"2016-07-05T19:18:46.256+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately for you, nobody here likes Heimer.

There are champions that have easy kits, but they are difficult to play perfectly (Master Yi, Annie, Akali, Evelynn). What defines most of these kits is raw power. If their raw power gets changed directly or indirectly, they can easily become overbearing or too weak.\n\nWhile I want to agree with you that he is very difficult, he actually isn't. It's just his raw power got much weaker by the itemisation changes (Hexdrinker, Spirit Visage, Locket as a must in every game etc), some meta picks just counter or ignore him. He is also very risky to play, with no real reward if his enemies know how to play against him. \n\nHe seems a high skill champion because he is weak. He has a difficult time winning against experienced players, and even when he snowballs, he either stomps extremely hard that any other champion could do his job better or he will just get outscaled as the game goes on.","replies":[{"poster":"Coperos","date":"2016-07-06T15:36:15.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, sorry man, but you underestimate the factors behind turret placement, the difficulty of landing his stun, on top of knowing what Ult to use and when.
