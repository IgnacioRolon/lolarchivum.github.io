Stole my cs, First tower bonus, and multiple kills (start of the match), flammed the F#$% out of me along with the whole team because i was &quot;feeding&quot; even tho it was because I was like 50+ cs behind and I couldn&#039;t do anything to stop the garen from stealing my cs... like what youd expect from a adc that is 50+ cs behind I left lane to farm others so i could get back in the late game at least but garen kept following me around and just last hitting everything. After getting trolled for 20 minutes i couldnt take it anymore (the flame from my whole team and garen repeatedly trolling me throughout the match) I flammed the F@#$ out my team as they deserved it. Now i have a f@#$ing chat restriction!!!!!! This is the most BS I&#039;ve ever had to deal with it&#039;s rediculous. If you go thru the actual full chat of the game not just my msgs you&#039;ll notice the other teams bot lane saying &quot;no s@#$ he is flamming the garen the garen is trolling like crazy if i was him i would have left the game in the first 10 minutes&quot; plus my team flamming me all game. Still my whole team probably reported me causing me to get a BS chat restriction.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-03T18:09:22.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you flamed the fu@k out of your team\n\n\nchat restriction \n\nsimple","replies":[{"poster":"CrewdFrost","date":"2016-11-03T19:14:54.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok agreed but my teammates flammed me and what do they get?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-03T19:18:23.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"report them... \n\nbut the mistake you made was flaming and verbally abusing back... if you just not said anything you couldnt of been punished at all\n\nhence why i think the majority of the toxicity in the game can be solved with removing chat from the game","replies":[{"poster":"CrewdFrost","date":"2016-11-03T19:22:24.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"ahhahahahahah like that would work right, when have you ever gotten someone punished when you were the only on to report them you know that would not have changed anything.

You have to be the last one that reported them in the game that got them banned (or maybe its the first one?) and even then I don't think it always sends it out. Just because you didn't get the message doesn't mean that he didn't get punished.\n\nEither way, it is not your place to worry about whether or not someone got punished, you need to focus on your own problems and improving on them. I would suggest muting people when they start showing themselves as a negative influence on you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-03T20:38:03.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just fyi i played since end of season 2 and never have had a chat restriction just dont chat at all \n\ndont use it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-11-03T18:20:11.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrewdFrost,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=z0nH5ZXT,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-03T18:06:38.561+0000)\n>\n>I flammed the F@#$ out my team\n\nThat's why you got punished. Regardless of what the others are doing you are judged for your behavior alone. If you had just muted and reported them rather than retaliated against them then chances are that you wouldn't have been punished. Post your entire unedited reform card here if you're truly looking for a discussion as to why you got punished.","replies":[{"poster":"CrewdFrost","date":"2016-11-03T19:15:15.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"ok agreed but my teammates flammed me and what do they get?","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-11-03T19:39:18.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrewdFrost,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=z0nH5ZXT,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-11-03T19:15:15.729+0000)\n>\n> ok agreed but my teammates flammed me and what do they get?\n\nIf you reported them and they have a history of doing that then they will be punished just like you were.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-11-03T19:49:50.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why didn't you just mute the Garen?
