There are some RP left there that aren't enough for a skin... So i decided to gift an emote to my main account. I noticed you could send RP, Skins, Champions, Ward skins, Profile Icons and Mystery champions, skins etc. The only thing you can purchase in the game that was not included were emotes. Is there a reason that we cant gift  emotes  or it just isn't  available yet(with emotes being new to the game)?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T03:13:21.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because they're still so new is all!","replies":[]}]}
