I play in the mid ellos with my friends and we need someone else to jungle when our main is out. Which 2 champions would be good to learn that are not to hard to get used to in the jungle and aren&#039;t completely useless. I have previously played Amumu and Nunu in the jungle. I also like shyvanna top but I am not sure how she would do in the jungle.
