However, as of recently the moment it gets in to the login screen I get an error saying the patch failed to apply/download and that I have to close my client or it does the patch again on a smaller tab, which then closes and the league client doesn't pop back up. This started yesterday. It says on the popup at the login screen that league needs to download a required update however the download never works even though it finishes each time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-24T00:20:01.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens if you try loading the legacy client instead?  \n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nAre you able to patch then?","replies":[{"poster":"YumScrumptious96","date":"2016-11-24T00:40:32.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legacy client also had issues.
