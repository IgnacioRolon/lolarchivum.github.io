Please contact Player Support for further information at support.riotgames.com. I searched it up on the boards and found that several other users also have their accounts marked inactive. Some people who replied said that they were toxic, afk, bad behavior, etc. but I have been none of those. And when I try to apply for a new account, it won't let me because the website automatically prompts me to download the pbe client as I already have an account (the inactive one). My account was created after 2013 so it's not that either.. what should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T03:34:25.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and was unable to find a PBE account linked to this account. It's very likely your old PBE account was part of the old system of accounts that were unlinked and deactivated.\n\nFeel free to write in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you have any other concerns around this.","replies":[]}]}
