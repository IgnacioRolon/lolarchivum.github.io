I am not really a toxic person, but in fact a team player.. From time to time I do tend to troll in rare and very rare cases such as this one.. I have been chat restricted twice with both of them being 10 games each.. I never had been suspended ever. Instead they considered this to be insanely offensive and decided to permanently banned my account?? I was not aware that this was going to happen to my account. I never knew a game will take such desperate measures to get someone banned.. I wasn&#039;t even being extremely toxic or racist.. I think this punishment is extremely harsh overall. Why didn&#039;t they suspend my account to 14 days as most people mentioned when I was reading other Banned accounts on the forums.. I&#039;m not a league of legends veterans and have only played a few months. I honestly wish I can get my account back. I will probably never ever troll in this game ever again. Knowing that my account will ever cease to exist. Also the guys I was facing with, were also having a good time talking shit back to me. While making me look like an idiot.. I didn&#039;t mind it at all.. I honestly thought we were all having fun on a NORMAL game.. I know those few games make me look like an asshole, but clearly the people who actually know me.. Know me as a very nice person. Is it possible to get my account back.. This is extremely harsh punishment.. I instantly got permanently banned.. Obviously, I will learn from now on to mute anyone and never chat in an aggressive or provoking manner. I never meant anything that I said in those chats.. I was never expecting someone to take what I said seriously to the point where I hurt them emotionally.. In fact I was getting trolled back.. Which was fine by me in those games. I don&#039;t know how to contact the support desk. Can anyone give me a link so I can try to get my account back.. I obviously know now, that you have to take this game very seriously and ignore everyone else.  That&#039;s all I have to say.. \r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t understand why I got instantly PERMANENT BANNED. A suspension would had been more logical. I didn&#039;t get any warning emails as others got. I was only chat restricted twice with a 10 game restriction.. Then after that I got permanently banned?? How is that fair? can anyone explain please?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-01-23T21:36:24.201+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"Repeated use of racial/homophobic slurs is one of those offenses that can result in skipping punishment tiers.

You don't get to claim you're being oppressed when you can safely walk any street in the country and not worry about getting gay-bashed because you're holding hands with your boyfriend, or shot on the street because you're a black man taking out his wallet, or held by the authorities in an airport because you are Muslim and forgot to take the bottle of shampoo out of your luggage.
