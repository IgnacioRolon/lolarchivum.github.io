I've played League since early season 1, I had above average honor before my brother was in the hospital after his heart stopped. I played when I was far too stressed, and should have just avoided it entirely. I've been playing on a smurf since my ban, I've reached D2 again, and have a favorable honor level(Not toxic! lol). If someone such as Tyler1 can become reformed, surely someone like myself who had a single account banned while I've played since season I can!","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-09-28T08:47:02.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, you can reform\nBut you will never get your account back, just like Tyler1 never got his accounts back","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-28T01:11:42.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are now in the same situation as Tyler1, whom you keep mentioning: none of his permabanned accounts have been unbanned, but Riot allows him to play the game on smurf accounts on which he has behaved himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Dzsungel","date":"2019-09-28T01:13:23.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TKL17PAY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-28T01:11:42.511+0000)\n>\n> You are now in the same situation as Tyler1, whom you keep mentioning: none of his permabanned accounts have been unbanned, but Riot allows him to play the game on smurf accounts on which he has behaved himself.\n\nTyler1 had many, many accounts permabanned.
