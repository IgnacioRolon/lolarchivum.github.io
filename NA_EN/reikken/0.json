These will transfer over to different game modes as well.  For example, if you dodge a normal then dodge a ranked, then you would receive the escalated penalty.  More details on this is also available in our[ queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) guide.

That list is only giving 15-30 minute penalties for unranked modes. but...\n\nYesterday, I dodged a game of Nemesis Draft (closed the client) and then logged back in about half an hour later to find no remaining pentalty. And then I dodged another game and logged back in about an hour later to find I still had over an hour left. How does that work out?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T20:09:45.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nemesis Mode is a little bit different, because dodging can be abused if you don't get a champion you want.  A second offense dodge during Nemesis can result in a 2-hour lower priority queue.  This information is also available in our[ Nemesis Draft ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204191960-Nemesis-Draft-Mode-FAQ#h2q2)guide.  I looked into your case and see that you dodged two nemesis games in an hour's time.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2016-08-20T20:11:25.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I see, thanks.
