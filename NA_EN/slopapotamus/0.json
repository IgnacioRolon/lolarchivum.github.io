At the same exact time someone from the other team typed in \"133\" in all chat. I unplugged and plugged it back in and didn't work i had to restart my computer. Its only happened a few times with other keyboards and only while playing League. Pretty sure someone on that other team was responsible. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-05T22:42:47.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think there's any way for someone to type something in chat and have your keyboard disabled, but it sounds like something major is going wrong with your keyboard config settings. Let's reset those in a specific way to make sure they get fully reset and test it in a custom game.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
