Out of the last 4 only one of them has a good sample size and it's completely understandable why he'd lose, cause it's pantheon. His lowest winrates are against top rammus and xin zhao which aren't really picked that much top lane so it doesn't count(only 100 games each). \n\nAll of his other match ups(45) place him well above 50% winrate in top lane. In 12 of his match ups he has over a 55% winrate against them, meaning he apparently counter's 12 champions, and that's not even counting 24 other champions that he has above a 51% winrate against. Yasuo is a late game monster, he shouldn't be winning against so many champions so easily, especially against, say Yorick with a 65% winrate, why? Simple, yorick is better early to mid game, so how is yasuo a late game scaler, beating yorick with a 65% winrate over 500 games. \n\nThe short answer, yasuo's laning phase is actually extremely oppressive and makes surviving with him easy, his passive coupled with his windwall and his ability to hold his CC while also dash endlessly in a minion wave make him very hard to lane against even for people that should be beating him in lane. \n\nKeep in mind this is all in platinum and above and he has about a 12-15% playrate. Meaning there is PLENTY of data on him now.","replies":[{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2017-05-18T14:41:00.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, I mostly agree with what you said, but in Yorrik's case I think its a matter of Yasuo's kit really hard-countering Yorrik. He can easily kill off the ghouls with Q, or dash through them, dash out of the wall thing Yorrik does, force engages when Yorrik has no graves out, and windwall the mark thing Yorrik throws to get his ghouls to jump. (I really need to go look up the names on these abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-05-18T15:06:33.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the main thing is his ability to outrun Yorick, his windwall hurts his E, his shield hurts his Q he can cancel yoricks auto attack by dashing everywhere, yoricks ghouls don't matter much since yorick himself is very powerful without them but he has so many tools to avoid damage in lane that it border's on Gangplanks level of safety which means yorick has a very hard time doing his job.\n\nThis isn't just for yorick though, most champions simply don't have the tools necessary to keep up with yasuo in lane, yasuo is overloaded in that aspect during the laning phase. This is further proven by the champions that he has lower winrates with being Camille, Renekton, Pantheon, Fiora and Riven as the most noteable.
