I fed, my jungler, support, adc fed, everyone in my team fed, it happens sometimes.\r\n\r\nAt about 10 minutes my team agreed to surrender, thus I wrote in /all &quot;Open Mid&quot;. Few minutes later, seeing the enemy team not pushing mid, I remembered them in all chat that the mid was opened, following by an answer of their ADC &quot;You&#039;re reported&quot;, explaining later that it was because I was giving up.

You can't expect the enemy team to read your mind and know your intentions, they report based on what they witnessed and that's always the right thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-07-26T19:08:23.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can sympathize with you, but I can also sympathize with the enemy.\n\nThe bottom line is that a premature surrender takes away the feeling of having legitimately earned a victory. If you combine that with forcing the enemy to endure the timewasting and boring task of finishing off an undefended base, I'd say they have a point to be somewhat pissed.\n\nBut like most stuff that is mostly just unsportsmanlike (\"gg ez\" and the likes) and not truly meant to harass or attack others, I think it should at most contribute to a punishment in combination with other offenses, and never constitute one on its own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-07-26T13:15:32.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yes, you deserved to be reported.\n\nJust like some people don't like the result of the US election, *everyone* has to abide by it.
