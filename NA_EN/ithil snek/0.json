This species lives in the Sai desert, if we assume that the desert&#039;s name was given by Shurimans, we can logically say that the Xer&#039;sais and Rek&#039;sai were given their names by Shuriman as well. This said, there is 3 shuriman words we know: &quot;Xer&quot;, &quot;Rek&quot; and &quot;Sai&quot;. Considering that Rek&#039;sai is the Queen of the Xer&#039;sai, we can assume that &quot;Rek&quot; means queen.\nThis said, we can find out that &quot;Xer&quot; is not only in Xer&#039;sai but also on Xerath. Taking in consideration that Rek is the **queen** of the Xers and that Xerath was a slave, we can imagine that Xer means &quot;Servant&quot; or something similar.\nThen, we can find out even more things, Rek&#039;sai and each voidborn champions/creatures we know have a namethat loos like this: xxx&#039;xxx(x), which mean that &quot;cho&quot;, &quot;gath&quot;, &quot;vel&quot;, &quot;koz&quot;, &quot;kha&quot;, &quot;zix&quot;, (and each part of a voidborn monster&#039;s name)  may be a shuriman word.\nThen again if we split Azir&#039;s and Sivir&#039;s names like we did with Xerath to theoretically find the meaning of the word &quot;xer&quot;, we have the words, &quot;az&quot;, siv&quot; and &quot;ir&quot;. Note that in the Shurima story &quot;[Bloodline](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/story)&quot;, the hierophant that claims to be one of Azir&#039;s scion (chapter 6) is called Azrahir, we can split the name to get &quot;azrah&quot; and &quot;ir&quot; again. We can guess that &quot;ir&quot; is a word used to say if someone belongs to the royal family of Shurima.\n\nThis is so far what I have found but, honestly if Riot is planning to make these languages complete enough to be spoken like Tolkien&#039;s Elvish, it would be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-05-10T15:57:10.126+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another fictional language to look into (and another WAAARGHBobo creation, I believe) is the language of the Buhru people (Illaoi).
