The only solution that I have thought of is creating new accounts and starting new, but when leveling becomes hard. Do I just make ANOTHER account just to get more champs that I don't own?

If you keep playing on the same account you'll start getting better rewards from higher levels and milestone levels, and can eventually have everything unlocked in one place. \n\nWe're definitely looking through and gathering this feedback on the new system though!
