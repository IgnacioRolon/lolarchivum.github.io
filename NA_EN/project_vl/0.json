I am asking because i'm trying to put together a super cool cosplay for bullet angel kai'sa and would love some voicelines for kai'sa. thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-05-09T04:59:35.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's intentional. For one, Bullet Angel Kai'Sa is an Epic-tier skin (1350), and they only rarely have unique quotes compared to the base; they largely will only have voice filtering effects.\n\nOn top of that, Bullet Angel Kai'Sa (and Kai'Sa in general) were released before Gun Goddess Miss Fortune, so even with the latter skin planned, if Kai'Sa was going to have quotes for her, they would've had them in with the release.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-05-10T18:55:21.950+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is half true.

That got the community so hype.\n\nIt's easier with VGU champs because you don't have to spoil anything like Aatrox taunting Akalis shroud or Irelia teasing Akalis new attitude before she was relaunched.\n\nWith new champs unless they're already linked to others in the lore harder to do for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2019-05-10T23:31:36.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was gonna say, base Kai'Sa has interaction lines with Miss Fortune, regardless of either's skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Demon","date":"2019-05-10T23:06:11.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carnival Knights,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=iTn5LnJ9,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-05-10T18:55:21.950+0000)\n>\n> This is half true.
