(International players account for the popularity). Yet, when it is prime time for NA, PUBG/Fortnite  is number one. It&#039;s just weird.. With all the complaints and my friend&#039;s list completely empty now, maybe League is really starting to stagnate and decline in NA. I would love Riot to post their numbers again.","replies":[]}
