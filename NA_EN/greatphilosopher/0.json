{"poster":"GreatPhilosopher","date":"2017-09-24T23:52:09.841+0000","title":"I can barely connect to the game anymore...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are times when I will frequently disconnect from games, and the next 1 or 2 days it starts working properly. Initially I thought my connection was bad, but my connection to League is inconsistent and chooses to work or fail at random. I looked around for threads hoping someone else had the same problem, and tried downloading the repair tool a couple months ago, but it didn't detect any problem from what I could see, and I don't know specifically what the problem with my connection is, so I finally decided to just make a description of what I'm experiencing when I lag or can't connect:\r\n\r\n-Sometimes I disconnect before entering the game (Stuck on loading screen)\r\n\r\n-Sometimes I enter the game after 5-7 minutes have passed (Most of the time, it's before or after minions spawn)\r\n\r\n-As for when I'm able to access the game, when I have high ping, I see my champion and all the other champions moving around the screen randomly.\r\n\r\n-I also lose the ability to move or act, and sometimes find myself dying to an enemy near the middle of the map when I think I'm sitting at base.\r\n\r\n-When it's not as bad, I move slowly and can't react very well to enemy abilities and ganks.\r\n\r\nI play Custom games often to test my connection to avoid penalties, but even when I can access a custom game, I still disconnect from matchmade games afterwards.\r\nIf I knew what I could do to fix my connection to League, I would. I even gave up on trying to play Ranked so I don't ruin the experience for my team.\r\nIf anyone has a solution, I'd be happy to hear it, regardless of how long it takes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T04:32:26.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those last few points sound like your ISP might be having some issues with packet loss while sending your connection to our servers.

That 50% packet loss spike is most likely the reason of your problems. Packet loss happens after your connection leaves your home network, but before it ever reaches our servers, so it's hard for us to do much on our end. Most of the time it's caused by a damaged or improperly working node that your ISP uses, so I'd first suggest hitting them up with this data to see what might be going on. If they're not helping much, feel free to hit me back up!","replies":[{"poster":"GreatPhilosopher","date":"2017-09-27T06:25:42.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the problem is likely on my end then.
