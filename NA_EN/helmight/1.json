It&#039;s absolutely fantastic, from the particle effects to the animations to the voice work. However, I just have one slight suggestion for the skin: increase the frequency at which Yi says his VO lines while in Highlander.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve heard the VO on the LoL Wikia and it&#039;s really great, not to mention being one of the main draws for the skin. However, since Yi spends so little time in his ult, you&#039;re lucky if you hear him say even one line. Lowering the VO cooldown for when Yi&#039;s in Highlander would be a cool addition for the skin that actually lets players appreciate the second voiceover. \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T18:30:29.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Helmight,\n\nI talked to the audio bro who worked on PROJECT: Yi and the frequency of those VO lines playing when he's in Highlander is already set to 100%, so we're unable to increase it.

When you're buying items, for example, if your champion has item buying VO, it may only be set to 40% of the time so it doesn't get annoying. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Yuri By Mail","date":"2015-11-16T20:21:27.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always wondered why they WOULDN'T say their buying lines 100% of the time.\n\nThat's honestly part of the reason I picked up Sion last season.\n\nIf I get your attention, can I also ask why, when champions get skins with new voiceovers (like Aether Wing Kayle) that the base champion doesn't get...something, to give them more then ~15-20 lines?
