Unfortunately I can&#039;t seem to find the sheet music anywhere. Has it been released, and/or do you plan on releasing it to the general public?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-08T23:53:19.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, not sure if we can at the moment, would certainly be cool if we could though. Bouncing this on to Praeco (one of our composers) to see if he can offer a few thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"QueenAqua","date":"2015-04-09T03:45:57.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like some for Violin if at all possible in the event you do release the sheet music. It would be so sweet to be able to play the music of a game I'm passionate about.\n\n(Also would appreciate sheet music for DJ Sona's music if possible. Not being demanding or anything, just asking when i have the chance to.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2015-04-09T03:09:15.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Meddler, means a lot. I figured if  you guys hadn't released the music that you didn't intend to, but I remembered that you had given us the sheet music for Summoner's Call a few years back and took a chance. If you guys can't for whatever reason, that's alright.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"spottedstar1123","date":"2015-04-13T01:00:53.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this guy's working on a transcription: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/sound-music/Ksamu3Bt-tidecaller-transcription","replies":[]}]}
