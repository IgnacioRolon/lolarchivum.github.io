I'll be judging all of the entries and choosing winners tomorrow! Thanks again to everyone who participated :)**\n**\nEDIT 2: The winners have been selected! Big congratulations to SyndrHulk as the top upvoted winner and wwholesumm as the judge's choice winner! Thanks again to everyone for participating :)**\n\nA few years back, Bioluminescence ran a fanfiction competition focused on the new PROJECT skin releases. I thought that was an amazing idea and figured why not do another one for the new PROJECT releases? So here we are with the PROJECT: Reckoning fanfic competition!\n\n**The Challenge:**\nAs you might expect, this is a competition about telling the story of PROJECT: Reckoning. Check out the trailer for more details about the event: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg6lffteZ-w\n\nYour challenge is to tell a story about one of the new PROJECT units (Irelia, Akali, Jinx, Pyke, or Warwick) and why it seeks revenge on the company that created it. Bonus points if this incorporates anything about their canon backstory (Irelia's hatred of Noxus, Akali's rebellion against the Kinkou, etc.). \n**\nRules: **\n  1. ** 500 word count limit.** As much as I love PROJECT fanfiction, I have a limit as to how much I can read through. \n  2. **There will be two winners**. One will be based on total upvotes, while the other will be based on my personal favorite. Make sure to upvote your favs!\n  3.  **The deadline is 11:59pm PST, July 31st.** Make sure to have your entry in (and within the word count) by then!\n  4. **There will be prizes!** Both of the winners will receive the PROJECT skin of their choice (or 1350 RP, if they don't want any of the skins) for having the best entry! I will be adding the winners in order to gift them after the contest concludes. Note that this only includes NA Summoners - sorry guys, I only have an account on the NA servers :/ \n\nGood luck to all entrants!","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2019-07-17T18:01:22.695+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh my goodness, [that brings me back](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/aOV8UEy9-fan-fic-micro-competition-project-fiction) :D\n\nGood luck to everyone, and beware corrupted code!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SyndrHulk","date":"2019-07-20T07:44:08.364+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Gnnnnzzz://khhhrrrrr://**\n \nFirst he felt hunger.

They do not ponder emotions, or look for meaning in anything. They are given objectives and expected to complete it in timely manners, with the sharpest precision. Practicality is what’s expected of them, and they deliver on what they were built to do. \n\nBut dancing is not practical. It’s frivolous, a waste of precious time and stamina, self-indulgent. Its frowned upon and sneered at among PROJECTs, for deviating from the standards they were supposed to follow, for being an imperfect machine. Every movement she makes, every motion of the dance she follows, feels like rebellion.\n\nBut Irelia embraces it, because it’s all she has left. Of everything they have taken from her, the memories of the dances, of a semblance of home, family, and comfort, they’re all she remembers now.\n\nShe had tried to regain her humanity, grabbing and holding on to all she had remaining and refusing to give it up. She had lashed out, with pain and fury in her metal heart, an intense feeling that ached for the losses she couldn’t remember. She had killed, turned their own weapons against them, spilled red and black, almost tore her way out of their steel buildings. And when they finally caught her, PROJECT threw her away to die in the wastes outside their walls.\n\nWith the spirit she refused to let PROJECT take away from her, she made a name for herself, and despite her reluctance, she became their legend, their figure of hope and strength. Their leader. And she found a strange new comfort in them, persevering through dangers together. Almost like a family.\n\nWhenever Irelia was alone and safe, she danced. She recited all the movements she could remember, searching and piecing them together from the depths of her scattered brain, artificially wiped of the person she once was and then filled with the wires and chips that connected her to her cybernetic blades. Once they had hacked her spirit to weaponize her for their own gain, but now she used what they did to her own benefit.\n\nThen the Outcasts arrived, people like her that were stripped of their souls, and then discarded. They were angry, vengeful, sometimes glitching in general insanity. They wanted to take down the one who abandoned them, and they wanted her to join them.\n\nYes, she was angry, and she too craved revenge. But what made her accept their offer was a piece of overarching fear in the back of her mind, an uncomfortable, unbearable emotion she hadn’t felt before and wanted to get rid of. The fear that she will lose anything that mattered to her. Her new family, her emotions, her own life. Her dances.\n\nIrelia hears a wolf’s howl, sees PROJECT’s logo, thinks about what they have already taken from her and how they used her. And she knows she needs to stop them.\n\nShe needs to stop them, before they come to finish what they started, to destroy everything she has.\n\n(499 words total, checked in a word document)","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2019-07-24T07:23:04.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our first entry for Irelia, and boy is it a doozy.

Sorry souls. The inner parts of his arm belong to another discarded wreck.

Pyke still needs to find another.\n\nHe remembers a woman _(a human)_ asking for a second chance. Volunteering to escape her life. She’d escaped her life alright.

Not nervous—_anticipating._ The city is so far below. He’ll be king of the world. \n\nThat gets a grim chuckle out of him as he picks his way across the wastelands. _King of the world._ Was that him? With so many different pieces it’s hard to tell anymore. \n\nThe only thing that _all _ of him has in common is _PROJECT._ Even the simple thought stirs up jittering memories. Can see a machine grinning at him, waiting to dismantle—take him apart and swallow him with metal teeth. The glare of lights, hum of an engine, chattering _suits_ hiding behind their charts and goggles. \nAll the clamoring recollections threaten to drown him—\n\n> “Easy money,” the recruiter tells him. “A once in a lifetime sort of opportunity.”\n> \n> Pyke _(a human)_ likes cash.

He clicks the end of the pen with his thumb.  \n    \n_Extreme fortitude._ Pyke has that at least. He dives through the cloudy ocean of memories, brain buzzing with cold satisfaction. That was _him._ He knows for certain. That recollection belongs to him and no one else. Further proof of the lies and betrayal. \n\n_A study,_ they’d said.\n\n_A once in a lifetime opportunity. _\n\nHe’s several lifetimes now, mismatched pieces put together with a single goal.\n\nThey took him apart?

Jinx remembered so little with clarity, she remembered some of the kids, she remembered how tough it was to get by, how the gang worked like rats under Central as if it was a game. Yet their faces, their voices were lost, not in that whimsical dream like remembrance, lost instead in a torrent of memories and voices that where not her own.\n\nThe girl wanted the memories of what happened, of the slip up that got her caught by those Project bots... was her friend trying to help her, or was it her fault, she couldn't focus long enough to get so much as a byte of the memory. Even the torment, the torture as Project grafted, tore, replaced, and implanted part after part into the girl. A 'Stress Test', she remembered that, to see how much one could take before fragmentation took hold. And when it was all said and done, she was tossed away like refuge.\n\nWhat was left of the girl was arguably little more than a fragmented mess. Hysterical laughter, spouts of yelling, screaming for everyone to just, shut up, even in the silent nights. It could be argued if what was left of the girl could even feel the torment, her own thoughts drowned out by the fragmentation, let alone her memories, her sense of self. Hardly even able to function. Unable to feel anger, to desire revenge, she just wanted silence, and it drove whatever was left to madness beyond even fragmentation.\n\nYet in her fits of yelling, of pleading for silence, one day she had relief, for the briefest of moments. The explosion was bright, colorful, and loud enough to silence the voices, even for that brief millisecond. More so, the cause of the detonated bot was willing to grace Jinx with more of that peaceful bliss. His face blank of expression, of a face at all, yet he made a simple promise, a promise enough to earn her loyalty. Meaningless revenge, and more explosions and destruction than she could ask for, hours upon hours of sweet, sweet quiet. \n\nHe even had a list, a list of just what, and who, needed to be blown up, and the fragmented, crazed soul that resided in that body was more excited to help tick off every name, as long as each one left through a bigger, and bigger explosion.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2019-07-24T07:26:26.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yet in her fits of yelling, of pleading for silence, one day she had relief, for the briefest of moments.

Augments blew sparks and the angry red code again, machine and biology both flared in blistering, stunning pain as Pyke's cyber ghost became flesh and machine in front of her. \n\nAs she fell to the ground, a red X all her optic hardware allowed her to see, she whispered. \"What did they do to you...?\"\n\n\"Heh.

However, the potency of the creation was immense, Pyke was able to have it's own memories and state of willpower, similar to that of a human's, only greater. Out of fear, the organization shut down the project, however the very creation they made retaliated with murderous intent. The organization managed to subdue their own mistake, and trapped Pyke in a containment unit, similar to that of a snake. The project organization continued it's operation on ridding the entity, by wiping its memory. However, the memory could not fully wipe, it only left fragments in its mind of who it once was. They thrown Pyke outside the main city, into a desolate wasteland where many parts of previous inventions were scrapped. Pyke awoke, with his mentality broken, his memories faded, and his complete body disassembled, only left with his head, torso and a right arm. Over years, Pyke began to build his new body out of various parts of the scrapped projects left in the wastelands, creating a new complete body. In addition, by taking apart and redesigning weaponry used by PROJECT: Sentry's, he made his own weapon, two in fact. The weapons were able to take form of various types such as a spear, dagger, or a bladed whip. As years gone by, the project organization created its finest experiments, which was the time when projects yi, zed, and so forth existed. Pyke one day, found new Project creations where he remained, that of being abandoned. Filling with hatred, malevolence and a dire will of redemption, he banded up what was left alive in the wastelands, and marched toward the city, where the project organization is left. He will soon breach the project organization, to destroy every inch of progress they have come across. However, few pictures fill his mind, that every project alongside him share, that being pedals of a cherry blossom tree, towering over them. He is determined to grant redemption to not only himself, but the other abandoned projects left to die by the organization, in search of relief of pain and abandonment, and to find the rest of his memories, to search for who he was.\n\nThis ties to pyke's original lore, similar to how the fishermen cut his line, and left him to die to the monsters he hunted. Project pyke's was similar, the project organization abandoned its experiment, and left pyke to die out in the wastelands full of scrap metal, even  if he was their closest invention at the time. And pyke responds in both stories the same way, with the dire feeling of revenge for those who left him to die.\n\nEdit: I checked the word count myself in a document, it fits in the range.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2019-07-21T06:00:26.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I headcanon that PROJECT Pyke was one of the first experiments as well, so I'm certainly happy to see someone else shares that opinion here :P Pyke rebuilding himself from scratch is a nice touch, and it certainly explains his ragtag appearance in the trailer.

He endured endless torture, having his limbs cut off to be replaced with technology. After the experiments ended he was malformed, turned into one of project's creations. However, unlike his project brethren he was left with his memories, whether that be through corrupted code or intentional no one will ever know, one day in a battle against the project rebellion he realized, why should I fight for the people that tortured me endlessly turning me into a monster. He took all his hatred of the corporation that he once loved and killed every robot in the surrounding area, project and rebellion alike. He wandered the city killing all who he deemed under project's corrupt and evil reign. He came across the project rebellion rejecting them and killing many along with it, the project police whom he slaughtered, citizens found him only to get a harpoon through their cheeks. He wandered the city looking for trouble and one day he found some worth his while. A Project vigilante approached him, Project Jhin readied his gun to kill the reject as Pyke leapt out at him, the fight continued for minutes each trading blows until Jhin fired his gun into Pyke's eye. With a roar he ran away to lick his wounds. As he healed he saw news about other project rejects, a bounty posted for each and every one of them. He realized that he didn't have to fight project alone, if he could only find a way to recruit them. He wandered the city noticing other vigilante's hunting him down, he even saw the likes of Katarina and Zed trying their best to find him. One day he came across another reject lying among the trash heap dead, it was Vayne's work, she would pay. He realized that the rejects would never win, not unless he could give a blow so fatal to project, that they could do nothing but come across them. He remembered where they created him and decided that is where he'd strike. He stood among the rubble of the building, alone among the destruction, he couldn't help but realize the irony, he came there a man, and they created the weapon of their downfall. He  would later find all the rejects, Jinx, Warwick, Irelia, Akali, all people project corrupted. He would let them serve their turn, they would take down project and afterwards, when project has been destroyed once and for all, he would end them, and then finally, himself.\n\nI checked it in google docs and it is under the required 500 words. THis is similar to Pyke's lore in the sense he is hunting down anyone he deems under the corporation's corruption, citizen and robot alike, and he doesn't necessarily work with the other rejects willingly, more so out of need.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2019-07-21T05:58:16.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely a unique take on Pyke's character - I enjoyed seeing his transformation from PROJECT lackey, to unhinged killer, to finally the leader of the rebellion. That Pyke sees his own death as necessary by the end of it all added a surprising emotional weight to the piece that I wasn't expecting, but certainly enjoyed - kudos!","replies":[]}]}]}
