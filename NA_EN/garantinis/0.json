There's a chance, that this could be due to corrupted game files. For example, Baron starts spawning at 20 min, which could be having an effect on your FPS. I'd like to have you go through our [FPS Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)) to see if we can narrow down the underlying issue.\n\nHit me back up and let me know how this helps out!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Karma Goat","date":"2017-03-17T21:12:22.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a computer guru by any means, but if it's a time window thing, I would suggest checking on the Vid card temperature.
