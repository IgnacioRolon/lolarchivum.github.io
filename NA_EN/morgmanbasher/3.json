She just makes laning hard with having only 1 body to attack, needing to focus the ADC while other ardent champs you can dive/kill them first. I know as a support main myself, I generally focus the ardent supports first, then the ADC unless the ADC can not be ignored or is out of position, but I can not do that with this champ.\n\nPlease riot for the love of baby Jesus do not buff this champ and let people learn her first for like a month, then decide. \n\nI'd say the strongest counter I found so far is {{champion:89}} and just hard diving the ADC\n\nOne character Yuumi is extremely strong against is {{champion:63}} who literally can't get his double bounces without minions and even then yuumi can w to her ADC when brand ult is coming to her and make it disappear if she plays it right...all the while in lane can can harass hard and shield/heal her ADC through the brand poke.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2019-05-20T01:41:09.270+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"Little bit late considering they already hotfixed her but basically:\n\n* New champion released.\n* It's unique and difficult to play\n* Hotfixes\n* People still think it's bad (**You are Here**)\n* Riot buffs it more.\n* Pro scene finally has champ enabled.

Yuumi has less HP than a wet paper bag because of her mechanics, which is fine and understandable, but you also ignore the fact that while you're attached, the person you're with is a much jucier target. That's one of the challenges of Yuumi is making your lane partner the only target. Since you don't make them more durable, only add damage (and your abilities of course), yuumi still needs sufficient power of her own, since if your attached partner dies, you're basically guaranteed to be dead too.\n\nFurther, she's basically useless on her own since her Q is all she has to attack with and it only goes in a straight line w hen you're not attached to someone. So it's not like she's suddenly going to be getting picked mid if they increase her ratios any further.\n\nAlso: potentially having access to more ability power isn't a reason to have lower ratios. Veigar scales infinitely and yet his ratios aren't radically different from other mages. Soulstealer is a high risk / reward item and her ability to use it relatively safely is  somewhat offset by the fact that she sometimes misses assists even while attached because buffing your attached partner's damage or protecting them with your shield doesn't produce an assist.\n\nI would be more accepting of the current values if Q had a small AoE. Currently it's very frustrating when half the time when you try to hit an enemy champion you end up slamming it into a nearby minion, and you have a similar problem particularly with melee carries who are often near minions making it harder for you to Q without hitting one of them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-05-21T16:02:51.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yuumi might be part of revolution bringing melees bot.
