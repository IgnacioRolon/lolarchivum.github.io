An amazing riven player simply has more options than an amazing darius player, and so she can adapt far more than he can. She can counter his entire kit through well timed low CD dashes, high burst, and shielding to negate bleed stacks, etc. She can escape him when the fight is bad, but he can't escape her when the fight goes south. Totally fair.\n\nyou haven't ever played true lane dictators if you think riven has the say of what happens in lane","replies":[{"poster":"Lazy Grandpa","date":"2019-08-08T15:41:03.973+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"tell me which champions are true lane dictators according to you","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Minimac2000","date":"2019-08-10T05:47:51.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ðownright Darius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zXmlcoZE,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2019-08-08T13:44:20.416+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:92}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:266}} The only outplay as Darius is hoping they don't have the braincells to dash in when he winds up Q or that he can straight up statstick them like Yasuo.\n\nI've actually found statsticking aatrox quite effective as darius, especially nowthat he lost his potential revive","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2019-08-11T10:55:33.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In both RIven and Aatrox if you get the first kill (usually via jgl presence), you can statstick them from then onwards, unless they pull even or ahead.
