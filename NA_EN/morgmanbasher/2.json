I saw people in GOLD do that shit... granted I'm sure they were MMR boosted, because no one would ordinarily do that.  When you ask them about it they either tell you to \"stfu\" or \"I need movement speed, duh\".  \n\n- Rushing Rabadons first or second.  You see this and you know you're dealing with someone that just doesn't grasp the concept of the game.  Even in ARAM, when I see a mana champ start needlessly large rod I just laugh.  \n\n- Building Shiv/Phantom Dancer before ANY damage item on an ADC.  Now, I know that there are people that like a Shiv start on Vayne, personally I don't get it.  I can understand the people that build B.F. Sword and then Shiv, but flat out building phantom dancer or Shiv or BOTH before damage just makes me cringe every time.  \n\nThere are other things I see low MMR players do that are head-scratching, but those are the biggest three.  \n\nHonorable mentions though... \n\n- Falling behind top lane, but still building damage as opposed to building defensively.  Again, there are exceptions to every rule, but in general... TopLane101 - if you're behind, play and build defensively.  Granted, that was advice you would give before Season 7, now the advice is, \"just try not to feed\", because if you give up a kill in top lane, the lane is over and you've lost your tower.  \n\n- Not building sightstone on supports/not using wards/buying control wards on other laners.  This isn't just limited to low Elo play though, but I used to see far too many supports in Bronze and Silver that literally refused to buy sightstone or even a support item.  Not to mention the other solo laners (including the adc) that wouldn't ward or buy control wards.
