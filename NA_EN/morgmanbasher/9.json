In the lane phase it's not very strong, not unlocked yet, and minions are abundant to help split the damage. For her lane phase snap-burst potential to reach Vayne levels she needs to land her W - which is skill and should be rewarded in lane phase - or have a heavy lockdown support (Leona, Alistar) who sets her up heavily.

There was absolutely no metric that Zoe was factually out of line in besides ban rate. That was ALL.\n\nDid you just conveniently skip the part where I lay out the reason why Zoe's kit is such a design disaster?\n\nMy post only had 2 paragraphs, how do you miss out 1 of them entirely?\n\nOr you did actually read it, but just don't consider the clear as day explanation as valid.\n\n* Zoe's Q is a superior version of old Nid's Q, which means she had all of the design problems of old Nid and more. So that already is a big deal. I mean, why would something that got a champ reworked for, somehow end up in a more borked iteration on a new champ?\n* Zoe's W is extreme RNG, which is something Riot has declared countless times that they're against out of sheer principles alone. So had they actually bothered checking her kit prior to release, Zoe literally wouldn't even come out of the door. This is not counting the obvious fact having so much power designated into RNG with extreme bipolar potential outcomes is just asking for trouble (and this is even why Riot has an agenda against RNG in the first place; though they for some reason still think their extreme fetish for crits is fine, but that's for another day).\n* Zoe's E is extremely overloaded, or at least \"was\". I'll just quickly list its attributes for you to just have a look at the sheer amount of BS it has and used to have. **When Zoe was just released E has (notice \"just released\")**: A strong CC that lasts 4 seconds in total, 2 second slow that transition to 2 second stun (which the slow used to have 70% slow when maxed, so it was almost **2 second root plus 2 second stun**); the next attack on the sleep target amplifies the damage taken up to a maximum of **DOUBLE DAMAGE**; E-ball's **range is DOUBLED** when passing through terrains; if you complete miss it, dw, it will then **turn into a trap** that applies the effect to the enemy walking through it that lasts **FOUR SECONDS** with width so wide it can deny 3/4 of the lane and completely block off jungle routines which can make chasing and escaping from Zoe completely impossible in many situations without burning flash; hitting the spell also **REFUNDS THE CD up to 30% max**, when the spell's CD is already only at 16-14 seconds (which means even with just the older Morello that still gave CDR of 20%, and Zoe only having 1 point in E, hitting an enemy means her next E is just 16-16x0.3=11.2 seconds away, WITH THIS KIND OF POWER BUDGET. If Zoe has max level with max CDR of let's say 40%, let's not go 45% cap, landing a E means its CD is 14-14x0.7= **4.2 seconds CD**. FOUR POINT TWO SECONDS CD FOR THIS INSANELY OVERLOADED SPELL).... Oh and I nearly forgot, it also **used to be the case her sleep can not be cleansed**, and Riot defended that it's conscious design choice and blah blah, yeah, until they they realised how cocking stupid it is on top of the design horseshit that already is Zoe's E so they made it so that you can now properly cleanse it (together with a bunch of things they end up nerfing into the ground or outright removing from Zoe's E because it's just way too god damn overloaded). Fuck Zoe's E, utterly disgusting.\n\nThe real miracle is how Zoe even managed to get released with a kit this baffling.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2018-03-16T11:07:59.445+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I'll add to her E to make it even more disgusting is that the double damage from her E is also true damage which can be applied by any spell (ofc up to a certain amount of damage though but still).

What a ridiculous system and place.\n\nI never said she was statistically overpowered (I even talked about how Ryze and Azir didn't really have obvious stats problems too, but it doesn't meant they did/do not have issues),  I said she has a ton of \"design\" problems. And to support my claims, I both went onto briefs and details on why her design is, imo and as per explanation, clearly problematic.\n\nThe only thing that is said which is assignable with the notion of suggesting her to be statistically overpowered is that I said her release number was also high, which is quite true given she was capable of actual literal 1shots that kills opponent from full HP to 0 with just Q and reposition from R alone and had been tried in pro scene. But my main point had always been about her design.","replies":[{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2018-03-17T09:38:46.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She killed a damn ezreal who was behind and two levels under her with no mr aside from maybe a qss (cant even remember) \n\npeople act like that's an issue an adc that fed would've killed him in a similar amount of time with auto attacks that couldn't miss. \n\nIf they aren't statistically overpowered at all and nothing is factually overpowered they shouldn't be nerfed, especially not  gutted like zoe was.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-03-17T09:54:48.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vgamedude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vWsciifH,comment-id=000400000000000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-03-17T09:38:46.867+0000)\n>\n> She killed a damn ezreal who was behind and two levels under her with no mr aside from maybe a qss (cant even remember) \n> \n> people act like that&#x27;s an issue an adc that fed would&#x27;ve killed him in a similar amount of time with auto attacks that couldn&#x27;t miss. \n> \n> If they aren&#x27;t statistically overpowered at all and nothing is factually overpowered they shouldn&#x27;t be nerfed, especially not  gutted like zoe was.\n\nNobody said adcs critting 1000+ per hit at he speed of 2 per second is okay, similarly having 1 ability almost ALONE that it itself is capable of doing 1500+ or so damage in the case when that Ezreal died is clearly a problem.\n\nBut that 1 shot is minor, I never banked my argument on it but rather her very obvious and tried-and-true design issues.\n\nAlso, yes, design issues should be addressed, why shouldn't they be?

Why was Azir gutted so hard, why was Kalista gutted and tweaked, why was LB reworked, why was Ryze reworked like 4 times?

The debate answer was a \"NO\" mostly on the basis that a spammable spell should not be attached with a great reward, and Nid was reworked, so why should Zoe repeat the exact same issue that was already resolved, and more extreme at it because Zoe's Q can be redirected? How does that even make any sense?\n\nAnd that's just 1 spell, she has 3 in the level of being this fundamentally busted in her system, which you constantly ignore is the main deal of her shit, where given if any champ is reworked because of 1 high level broken aspect in their kit it would mean Zoe is already qualified to warrant 3 reworks right after just coming out; obviously that can be labelled as being \"Broken\" and needs fix. Ofc the balance team went after her this hard, her design should have never be released, at least CLEARLY not in the kind of design logic and presentation she possess.","replies":[{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2018-03-17T10:44:08.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can go on and on telling me about her spells that I already know of what they do and you're just wasting breath.
