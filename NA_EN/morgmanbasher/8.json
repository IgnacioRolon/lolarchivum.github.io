That'd mean, to have staggered the activation, you'd have seen it in EUW tomorrow at the earliest. I mean, sure, to appease those who have no clue how things work, they could've postponed it and activated it tomorrow during your daytime hours instead of activating it immediately when infrastructure was ready. I don't see how that benefits you in any way, however.\n\nSo why is it on in NA and not in EUW then ?\nYour logic is flawed.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreaktastic","date":"2019-06-26T17:04:56.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you don't understand what I posted, which is totally understandable (posting with opinionated rants/jabs from a position of pure ignorance, however, is not), I will break it down for you.\n\nBeing ready on NA and not on EUW confirms my post. There was no second patch for NA, meaning it was a dark deploy and we were all just waiting on infrastructure. One deployment pushed the code to clients. From there, clients were waiting for infrastructure.\n\nIf infrastructure was not being prepared in parallel to OCE/Japan/NA infrastructure, each region would've had TFT weeks apart, not hours. Read up on extremely basic infrastructure -- to support millions of simultaneous players takes incredible amounts of hours of planning, architecting, and setup. \n\nAll EUW is waiting for at this point is for the infrastructure to be ready, which was likely already prepared/setup quite some time ago. The hours of waiting is likely due to testing and final approvals.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gazda1415","date":"2019-06-26T19:05:19.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is just stupid.\nTFT is up for NA, which means, ppl who cant wait for this new game mode, simply log on NA, and play there.\nWhat actualy made NA servers overheated.\nI dont understand logic behind RIOT.","replies":[]}]}
