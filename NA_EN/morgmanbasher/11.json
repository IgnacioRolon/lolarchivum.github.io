I don&#039;t care if someone is low ELO really, but it&#039;s funny how quick they are to attack you because they think they still know Garen when they actually don&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathcapShaco","date":"2016-09-13T08:52:43.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Welcome to youtube/twitch chat where everyone is bronze and bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Thyme","date":"2016-09-13T08:50:53.343+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Low ELO always gets upset when you talk about their wafiu's no matter how bad they are","replies":[{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2016-09-13T11:05:48.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wouldnt garen be husbandu or are we talking about something else","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2016-09-13T11:44:28.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"husbando, actually. they usually can't say the du sound(unless it's through pronouncing ru/lu because some words just sound a bit off), it would be more like dzu.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-09-13T10:43:46.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got griefed back into bronze and even I know to level Q.\n\nI don't even play Garen much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-13T10:31:21.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's because the only follow builds and skill ranks because they don't have any idea about it, like when sneaky went runaans vayne and got a solo penta but everyone was shit talking the build before it.
