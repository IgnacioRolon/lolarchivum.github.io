Your fear also counts as a spell when procing electrocute even though it&#039;s a non-damaging spell allowing you to use it easily.\n\nI prefer fiddle as a laner....top, mid and support but his jungle can still work.\nCore items for me are generally:\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3020}} \nIf I am top lane and know the guy I am laning against is going to rush straight MR, get a {{item:3135}} first item.\nFirst back goals generally are {{item:3108}} {{item:1001}}....early sorc boots are great too since everyone generally has low MR.\nIf there is a skillshot you need to avoid like {{champion:53}} {{champion:25}} etc, go {{item:3102}} \nIf you are playing against champs with no gap closers that you want to slow for your team so they get kited like {{champion:75}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:86}}  be sure to pick up a {{item:3116}} which of course works well with your {{item:3151}} \nIf you feel slows won&#039;t help and you already have your core {{item:3151}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3157}} and they aren't stacking MR, think about a {{item:3285}} or {{item:3089}} \n\nMax e first unless you find yourself being chased down and fighting a lot, then max drain first but always start e. Normally max e, then q, then drain with maybe 2 early points into drain if I feel I need it. Be sure to brush cheese and make the enemy laner terrifed to walk into lane...if he&#039;s not questioning his life choices when walking forward when you aren&#039;t even there, you aren&#039;t doing it right.\n\nRunes I use:\nDomination - Electrocute, cheap shot, eyeball collection ( can use zombie ward though), Relentless Hunter (can use Ingenius hunter)\nSorcery - Manaflow band, Scorch...standard stuff.\n\nTrust me, the character is a lot better than his winrate. He may not be OP, but he&#039;s not nearly as bad as people think he is. I just feel they are using the wrong mastery when going aery and comet.","replies":[{"poster":"Ender L","date":"2017-12-14T00:21:00.490+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cool post!

YOu have to bait any CC he has or time the drain to get CC but leaving you with the hp to live until you can Drain Crows them.  Now doing this Fear will most likely be used offensively.  That means knowing who is Mia and who has TP up.  With fiddles weak hp and slow run speed if you commit you have to commit.  Anything that is half-way ends in death.\n\nWhen it comes to Items you have to juggle mana, hp/resist, AP and Pen.  You need a different build depending on what the make-up and match up is.  This leads to one of the issues.  There isn't a lot of great runes or items items for him.  (besides {{item:3116}} {{item:3157}} )  These items are \"needed\" to deal max damage.  {{item:3116}} to get more drain ticks in and to escape by using crows to slow.  {{item:3157}} to get max damage on ult before you are zerged.\n\ninteresting thing is I have been buying {{item:3157}} less and less.  Because besides getting 2 secs of your ult off its a wasted item.  The armor doesn't really make any difference with AD.  Due to CD on spells living 4 secs instead of 5 doesn't really save me.  I go more {{item:3027}} for AD and {{item:3001}}  for AP.  People say getting {{item:3136}} and {{item:3020}} are good but that is only 33 MR pen.  If they have more than 82  MR then {{item:3135}} would have been better.  Often times I find I get {{item:3020}} {{item:3136}} then they turn around and counter all that gold spend with {{item:1033}} for 450 gold.  That only leaves me with 7 MR pen.  Which is not a lot.\n\nNow for the poke it sucks if they get sustain.  Because it becomes worthless.  But if they don't its op and you can push them out of the lane.  Problem comes in because his Crows also push him to the tower.  This means he is really really far up and so easy to gank.  He run like a fat kid toward sports.  Its a stuggle and looks ever awkward.\n\nFiddle issues are he takes a lot of micro managing for his easy kit.  You have to predict the enemies game plan to win.  If you build to win the lane you have mana issues.  If you build for mana you have damage issues.  Everything is a big trade off with him.  A lot of the times to you have pull of a couple of attacks and baits to make him work.  If you mess one of those up you die or waste everything.  Sure his ult is strong but good vision and game play can stop 70% of it.  Next none of the \"new\" runes really scream fiddle.  Dark harvest is strong supporting because it help get the tower and gives surprise burst with melee attacks.  \n\nMy problem is I have to put a lot more skills and perfect game play to = someone just playing another Meta champ 2 or 3 times.  Needs one or two different items that screams fiddle.  A rune for Dot damage AP.  People think fiddle it toxic because they don't know how to play against him.  Like why are you standing next to the wall I can ult over while trying taking a turrent.  Bro you just saw me and I disappear at 70% hp..... NO I DIDN'T BACK.  or standing in my drain rather than one step back and then attack.  Getting no sustain in lane when you are laning against him..... CROWS is his only farm spell attack him after his uses it.  He will back or use lvl 1 drain.  People can get fiddle to have 1/3 there CS but they fill the MUST kill him to win lane.  Its kind of funny.  \n\nBut he is outclassed by other champs.  But my skill on fiddle I can compete.  That doesn't mean he isn't on the weaker side.\n\nEdit \n{{item:3165}} and {{item:3102}} are great items for AP and fiddle NEEDS CD.  However, every time I get these I die too quickly to do anything.  Fiddle NEEDS HP.  this is at gold plat level.  Sure I would love to play high AP control fiddle but I can't win games like that above gold.  I still have to carry 1 or 2 idiots that fed someone.  Maybe its because Burst/poke is too high but you need the HP more imo.","replies":[{"poster":"MorgManBasher","date":"2017-12-13T21:55:43.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, if that's what works for you with your items but I personally prefer AP/CDR and do fine with it and Plat/Diamond.\nAs for pushing the lane I generally roam a decent amount and push waves with my auto attacks so I don't get shoved into tower if I am solo laning.\n\nI feel {{item:3027}} takes way too long to scale for my preferences. I tried {{item:3379}} before, it seems okay but I didn't like the damage drop off waiting for damage items.\n\nBut I agree he's on the weaker side, just not as bad off as people think he is.

And my only struggle with him is finding use for the Dragin. His drain is outdated and only useful in the jungle even then the drain is mostly for sustain as the damage is quite slow. Using it during a fight brings more risks than reward. He heals very very slowly, the damage is very slow the enemy can outheal you if they have sustain. If all else can kill you if they're wounded they'll probably get away so it's better to chase them and auto attack them hoping for crow to come off CD.
