Turning that dash into a net gain for your team, either through the form of an objective, or a clean ace that results in the gain of an objective is how you win games, and snowball doesn't help you accomplish that. 9 times out of 10, when you snowball someone you a) die because you are now outnumbered and out of position far away from your team b) dive a turret as a team and die to said turret.

Snowball is not going to fix all of a champion's problems: traditionally weak picks like Evelynn, Elise, and Udyr struggle because they're bad in 5v5 teamfights, or else they have kits that just aren't suited to the mode, like Rek'Sai or Bard. It would take a change of a titanic scale to shake up the very top and bottom of the list: certain champion archetypes are going to dominate in ARAM, and others will do poorly. But Mark/Dash had a huge impact on low-range engagers and mages like Maokai, Galio, Kennen, Vladimir, and so on.

I remember looking at win rates now and then before taking over one year break from the game, I only came back earlier this year.\n\nThe only champions that benefited from snowball are champions without innate dash to begin with, but with actual killing power, so when they finally dash in with snowball, stuff happens. IE= R magnet: Talon, Fiddlesticks, Galio, Kennen, Alistar, Karthus.. and half of these are still very mediocre today, simply because dashing in, now and then is not enough to win games. You need the individual strengths I described above.\n\nMaokai has always been strong, and Sion, snowball happened around the time he got his rework so I can't really tell, but it's most likely the same as Maokai, press R > stick in > be forever annoying and kill stuff. These 2 champions are only strong because they counter the current meta dominated by ranged champions.
