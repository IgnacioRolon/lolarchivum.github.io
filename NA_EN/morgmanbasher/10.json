Amumu is commonly regarded as an extremely easy to play champion - he&#x27;s being picked by autofilled junglers and that brings down his win rate.\n> \n> So, please explain to me how he&#x27;s been &quot;weak for so long&quot;.\n> \n> The last 3 seasons in a row, I believe the &quot;season summary&quot; or whatever it&#x27;s called said that Amumu had the highest win rate across the whole season in the jungle role. \n> \n> Amumu is a strong solo queue champion. He always has been. He&#x27;s now been weak (ish, really a relative term. Lots of champions are still weaker and have been for basically forever) for less than 6 months and that&#x27;s &quot;bottom tier for so long&quot;?\n\nTry playing him in a non-garbage can elo and ask anyone diamond+ how good amumu is as they laugh at your question.\nHe's been in the trashcan for a long time for anyone not in a shit MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2018-03-20T12:16:48.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MorgManBasher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yweEEiiL,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2018-03-18T22:57:38.237+0000)\n>\n> Try playing him in a non-garbage can elo and ask anyone diamond+ how good amumu is as they laugh at your question.\n> He&#x27;s been in the trashcan for a long time for anyone not in a shit MMR.\n\nHighest season-end rank ever is Diamond 5, 0LP? With lots of Duo play in solo queue? Didn't even play last season?\n\nThe stats are all platinum plus, Diamond 5 isn't very different from platinum - many could argue it's worse since it's full of boosted animals.\n\nAnyways, your point is still completely stupid anyways. Let's assume that every challenger/master/D1 player agrees with you: Amumu is a garbage champion in their elo. So what? It's ONE of 140 champions that can't be buffed to be viable for the top 0.5% of players in the game, because it'll pubstomp the other 99.5%. Just as Ryze, Azir, and company can't be viable in lower elo, some champions can't be viable in higher elo. So the answer to your question still remains as my first post - he overperforms in plat+ (and is even stronger lower down) and thus can't be buffed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SephAgro","date":"2018-03-18T17:00:43.290+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want them to change his theme.
