Invisibility hides you from anything but true sight. True sight is Tower, Kai'sa W, (this patch) Karma W, Morg R, Leblanc Chain. Shaco's invis works the same as this, pink wards DO NOT REVEAL SHACO. Invisibility and camouflage are different.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minimac2000","date":"2019-07-19T16:26:26.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Barso55,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=cTQ2eIXn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-19T12:56:05.250+0000)\n>\n> well they big nerfed her shroud giving some counterplay with pink wards or vision trinket.
