People always leave before 1 minute but the remake doesn't do anything because they \"loaded in\". Also why is inting only punishable if they outright say they're inting and not if they keep running into the enemy team and go 0-8? I got both of these in my ranked match that got me demoted 2 afks and 1 inter to be precise. And before that I got 1 person inting but since he kept saying he wasn't inting it doesn't count even though he was playing melee kennen and not even autoing. Before that one I got an afk but he left 10 seconds in so that didn't count either. All three of these counted towards my demotion but none of it is punishable by your standards and I think that's outright stupid. The only action that's actually punished in this game is being mean which matters the least in every match.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T22:26:06.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remake isn't exclusive to not loading in, but also if you are idle for a specific amount of time once the match starts.

He was gone for 120 since he left at 1 minute  and it still wasn't allowed so that's a load of bs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fmafia","date":"2017-09-06T19:17:06.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All good.
