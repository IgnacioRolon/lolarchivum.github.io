I post on here a lot and I post mean shit because when I used to post serious questions they were never answered the mods would just  be like \"oh man that's rough\" so I just want to know how often you guys actually do absolutely anything other than take posts down because they hurt people's feelings?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T03:39:15.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Help & Support (as well as the Discord Support channel) is mainly used for technical troubleshooting or issues with accounts and such. Asking questions like \"why do silver players suck\" only serves to belittle other players for no purpose. \n\nIf you're having problems with matchmaking, it could likely be the system trying to place you where your skills would be most appropriately matched with others around your level. We're open to talking about these things, but posts serving to put others down *will* likely be removed from this board. You're more than welcome to pose these questions to the community in General Discussion or Gameplay as long as they are respectful of others.","replies":[{"poster":"Fmafia","date":"2018-01-31T13:13:21.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually happy I got a response this time. Ranked just seems much worse this season since I just get loss streaks, and I'd love to say it's my fault but that's hard to do when I go positive every match and do either close to top dmg or top dmg and my support has a 1-26-1 k/d/a. I know there's things that I can be doing to p[lay even better but I'm not saying I'm challenger I just know I'm better than the elo I was placed in.","replies":[]}]}]}
