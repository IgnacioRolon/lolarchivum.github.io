Make sure you're not in any ranked teams, and review the [Transfer FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751924-Account-Transfer-FAQ) to confirm what will or will not be transferred along with you.  If this is in reference to another account, try using a previous username you've had if you've been on NA with that account in the past.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
