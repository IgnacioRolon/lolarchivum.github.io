I've lost every game I've played against a Yorick because there's legit no counterplay that i can possibly think of, you build armor, he still out trades you, built Grievous wounds, he still wins the fight; Why is riot not doing anything about him? Maybe just nerf him a touch, so he's able to be counterplayed and the such?","replies":[{"poster":"Corded reformed","date":"2019-09-06T17:37:48.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pick jax, outscale, your Q counters his W, your E counters his E and passive and Q if i remember correctly (i might be wrong i play this game quite rarely now)","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-09-06T17:55:09.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corded reformed,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Nlz9VNTb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-06T17:37:48.445+0000)\n>\n> pick jax, outscale, your Q counters his W, your E counters his E and passive and Q if i remember correctly (i might be wrong i play this game quite rarely now)\n\nCorrect on all accounts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crispy0Snake","date":"2019-09-06T21:49:48.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plat+ Yorick is 51.7%. While it's still good, it's problably because of the map pressure he creates even when behind.
