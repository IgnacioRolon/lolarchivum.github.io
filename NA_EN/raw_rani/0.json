I have been recently 2 week banned for arguing with my team in one game after not typing at all for 30 games. As you can see below, the best thing in League is to just NEVER TYPE. Community is toxic and so is their support. The ban system is terrible, the real trolls did not get banned. I got banned instead of the soft inters. It is my day off of work and I can't even play League the game that I supported by spending 100's of dollars in it.\n\n\n\nHere is Riot Response after I open a support ticket:\n\n> From checking the logs, the following were some of the flags that led to the ban:\n> -Arguing with your team\n> -Asking for reports\n> \n> These negative behaviors are unsportsmanlike and are not tolerated in the League Chat. For that reason, the 2 Week Ban is warranted and cannot be lifted.\n\n\n\nI advised Riot that I have had good behavior for over 30 games in a row by not typing at all. Their response again:\n\n> 30+ Games isn't enough games to de-escalate down the penalty ladder as from experience it takes hundreds of games.\n\n\n\nGAME CHAT LOG:\n> \n> In Game:\n> \n> Raw Rani: INVADE\n> \n> Raw Rani: reporting ashe\n> \n> Raw Rani: yup thaats ur adc\n> \n> Raw Rani: LOL braum watching supp roam\n> \n> Raw Rani: how am i toxic???\n> \n> Raw Rani: srry braumn ashe watching\n> \n> Raw Rani: GJ ashe i died there for u\n> \n> Raw Rani: Keep watching\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: Report ashe toxic, called me a bad word and wont follow up on ganks\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: she soft inting\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: Np vel anything for you :)\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: jsut report this toxic ashe plz\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: Soft inting and toxic\n> \n> Raw Rani: HAHAHA u were afk furing an invade and u gonna say amurfing is hard\n> \n> Raw Rani: gj\n> \n> Raw Rani: not unlucky im aggro and no one want to follow up\n> \n> Raw Rani: how u gonna report me, YHour gonna get banned when they see how toxic u guys r\n> \n> Raw Rani: You guys typed f bombs to me and other bad words\n> \n> Raw Rani: your toxic\n> \n> Raw Rani: what kind of smurf blames me for loss\n> \n> Raw Rani: Your not smurf\n> \n> Raw Rani: YOU WERE AFK AT START WHEN WE INVADE\n> \n> Raw Rani: THATS NOT UNLUCKY\n> \n> Raw Rani: k so not unlukcy\n> \n> Raw Rani: You control that\n> \n> Raw Rani: no i just correcting u\n> \n> Raw Rani: im reporting u, u admit you are sharing acc to boost lmao\n> \n> Raw Rani: gj breaking ToS\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: Plz report mid and adc they so toxic\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: Blaming me, im just bad\n> \n> [All]Raw Rani: Riot will see chat\n\nReform Card:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/thzZ7ID","replies":[{"poster":"Punctual","date":"2018-11-06T02:14:24.122+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you are an adult and you act like this, you should be ashamed of yourself tbh.

Telling you to only type \"GJ\" or mute all to prevent being banned would just be incorrect, as telling someone \"gj\" every time they make a mistake is hardly improving your behavior.
