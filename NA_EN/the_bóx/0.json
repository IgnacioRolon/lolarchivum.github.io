Then you have to stay on or you get the loop again even if you run the admin file.\nAnother option someone mentioned is to unplug your router after you get the first popup, restart and then when you get the login screen, plug it back in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadyGecko","date":"2017-08-12T17:53:38.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a hero!
