Every person that we encounter is going to carry a different set of circumstances with them into the game, and therefore is going to have a different level of tolerance for frustration. If you end up in a game with an abusive player, don't lower yourself to their level. Instead, politely ask them to calm down.And remember, even if you're having a bad game, quitting or going AFK just ruins the game for the rest of the players. If someone's really starting to bother you, the mute and ignore commands are always there to resolve the situation.\n\nAnd remember, while nobody likes being insulted, it pays to take a moment to consider the circumstances. Remember that this is a competitive game, and, more often than not, the other player is just venting their frustration. Try not to take it personally. Everyone has a breaking point and everyone rages sometimes.
