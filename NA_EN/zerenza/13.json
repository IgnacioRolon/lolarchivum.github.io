She&#039;s still viable but just because she isn&#039;t good in high ELO or LCS doesn&#039;t mean she needs a buff(to those saying she&#039;s bad at high ELO, a lot of champions are.). What lux needed was an update in the mage rework, she&#039;s a light mage but honestly only two MAYBE three abilties of her&#039;s actually make sense with her design. Like many demacian champions, she&#039;s outdated not a lot but enough to warrant looking at for a mini rework. Instead of flat number buff, cooldown changes and other things. Maybe just add more tools to her kit to make her seem less linear/one dimensional and offer more to a team, it should be noted that number&#039;s buffs made her broken in LCS not to long ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-22T01:03:08.827+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"If lux builds full cdr, her ult will have a lower cd than it does in urf.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-03-22T02:11:38.745+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless they disable this buff in URF, she can have a 5 second cooldown on her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-03-22T17:09:21.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if she gets the reset .... who am I kidding, she will.","replies":[]},{"poster":"a Wild Niko","date":"2017-05-08T06:35:40.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lowest I can get it is 30 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-03-22T12:27:10.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol it won't hit anyone in urf.

I personally never felt a big difference between High Silver players and Low-Gold players, so I assumed Gold isn't that much more advanced than the average.\n\nI understand my mistake, but it is clear that Lux is underperforming in Gold+ (outside of Euw, she has 46% Winrate with decent Playrate) and doing well in Bronze/Silver. If there is no way she can be buffed to reward experienced players without making her a 54% Winrate and 20% Pickrate (because most of the playerbase will abuse her, especially in lower tiers), then I don't really see what they can do other than rework her.\n\nHer current buff on the PBE rewards her for using her Ultimate to execute people. This will only help when A) I snipe an enemy champion or B) I land my Q on a squishy champion after I bought a few items. The first situation is a risky one, the opponent being able to dodge/move out of my Ultimate, while the second one implies using my best defensive for a Proactive play, which again is High Risk/High Reward.
