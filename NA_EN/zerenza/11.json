If both appeared at the same time and both tried to auto attack you it's a lot better at what it was intended to do while also still not being a broken ability by any means. \n\nThis is the main change i'd make, other idea's are as follow's.\n\nNeeko's clone will cast Neeko's E in the direction of an enemy at the end of it's duration. If neeko's clone was Disguised the clone will break it's disguise the same way Neeko would, Clone Neeko's E deals no damage but will still apply the Snare.\n\nThis was an ability the Reworked Leblance had before her Revert, her R+R did this but was a bit more complicated, i think it fits Neeko pretty well but might be too strong and a little unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"lunarcana","date":"2020-02-17T03:59:08.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly i like how u can easily use it to block abilities","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2020-02-17T04:34:11.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does have a .5 second Invulnerability on the clone, which is part of what makes it so easy to tell which is which but it prevents her from being able to pull a Yasuo and press the ability in reaction to stuff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bardmageddon","date":"2020-02-17T18:58:16.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you activate her W, you should be able to control the clone (similar to {{champion:35}} or{{champion:7}} )","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrokenRayquaza","date":"2020-02-17T03:37:38.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean neekos w is by far her most useful tool in her kit.

The W itself becomes more and more useless the further in the ladder you go and while that's fine it's primarily because it's so easy to tell which one is the real neeko in comparison to Leblance's Clone or Shaco's Clone. \n\nSimply allowing it to auto attack would vastly increase it's effectiveness as a diversion, again she doesn't necessarily need it but it would be a welcomed addition. That's the only change by the way, it would work completely the same otherwise.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2020-02-17T01:39:19.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neeko is very bad, her shield also takes way too long on her ult","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2020-02-17T01:42:55.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally as a person who mains Neeko, she's not too bad the meta doesn't favor her much but i never feel like i just didn't have a chance to do anything or that there's nothing i can do.
