Like, 90% of the time when a fight breaks out, it&#039;s a 4v5 because i killed the mage or the ADC, or the support, or both so it&#039;s a 3v5 but like, it never turns out that way. What usually happens is my team focuses the Udyr, Gnar, Ornn, Braum or any other tank and just gets melted by whatever other carries they have and this frustrates me to no end because i&#039;m not good in teamfights, instead i like to make teamfights 4v5&#039;s or 3v5s so my team can easily take care of it but i feel like a lot of people don&#039;t know what this is.\r\n\r\n&quot;Order of Threat&quot; basically, in a fight you should focus the people with the most threat level in order, now this changes a lot if you have a Heal Bot Sup or something but most of the time it goes like this, atleast to me.\r\n\r\nADC-MAGE-FIGHTER-SUP-TANK\r\n\r\nSometimes like this\r\n\r\nMAGE-ADC-FIGHTER/JUGGERNAUT-SUP-TANK\r\n\r\nAnd Very Infrequently like this\r\n\r\nFIGHTER-ADC-MAGE-SUP-TANK\r\n\r\nLastly as i said above it can go like this.\r\n\r\nSUP-ADC-MAGE-TANK\r\n\r\nLike,  do i have something wrong, is there an instant in which focusing the tank is the best option? I understand focusing fighter&#039;s or diver&#039;s down but full tanks? I just don&#039;t get it, all your doing is wasting your ammunition so the damage dealer&#039;s can wreck you.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-16T18:18:53.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR there is absolutely no actual rule aside from focusing whatever is a threat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-05-16T21:28:24.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I play shyvanna I just ult on the back line and try to kill anybody that tries to fight me. Which is usually the adc, then from there I go after who is closest and lowest.\n\nWell with most of my champs I just try to kill the back line or disrupt them so my team can deal with their tanks, fighters or assassins. \n\nI would say try and figure out who has the most impact on the game, if it is the apc or adc then go for them first. If it a soraka supp then maybe go for them next. Usually at that point the enemy team would be falling back to their turrets or just running away from your team.","replies":[]}]}
