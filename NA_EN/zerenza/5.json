So clearly he can be beaten.\n\nOn another note, I've had lots of success with kled vs nasus. With kled you can fight nasus pretty easily until around 15 minutes. Just ward up to avoid ganks and be aggressive.\n\nAnd on the flip side, when playing as nasus, I know jax/illaoi/renekton are also very good against him. And there's plenty more champs that have the advantage against him. He has more losing matchups than winning ones (according to winrate, your choice whether you take stock in winrates or not).","replies":[{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2018-01-26T20:34:12.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That’s actually really wierd.

Also with more abilities aggroing minions freezes are that sustainable unless your passive in which you kinda can’t be.

I forget the exact amount but even 10% Lifesteal with his Q+Sheen, even if you bully him he can pretty quickly get himself back up and since Sheen is cheap, gives mana, and cooldown and empowers Q, it takes no time at all before pushing him out of lane alone, or even with occasional ganks. I think I had like an 80% win rate with him last season because of how easy it is","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChizPizaZane","date":"2018-01-27T02:38:41.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have to admit that Nasus is pretty bullshit but there are some champion that can deny him from CS and shit on him early such as:\n\n{{champion:420}}  The reason she tears Nasus a new asshole is because of the fact that she is a lane bully and can easily deny cs by constant poke form her Q and E, and if he tries to 1v1 just E him as soon as he gets close then pop ult and BOOM easy kill.\n\n{{champion:19}} I know this may seem weird but hear me out, Naturally when you are against a poke champion you're supposed to out-poke them, not only do you have insane poke as WW, You also have Insane lifesteal. Yeah I know that WW's lane CS'ing is pretty shit but if you poke Nasus enough early game you can continuously kill him and deny him a lot of CS\n\nI hope I helped even a little","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2018-01-27T00:17:27.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I used to play Lissandra in top lane, I felt an instant urge to just go afk the moment I saw I was up against Nasus. There was literally NOTHING I could do to stop him from powerfarming and becoming a lategame monster.\nThat's what I hate about the infinite stacking mechanics of Veigar and Nasus. Other champions who also have those have it pretty well balanced. You don't feel overwhelmed and powerless after Bard, Thresh, Sion, or even Kindred get some stacks. (With Cho'Gath it really depends, because his stacking is the most situational, I guess, but I would place him among Veigar and Susan). But when Nasus gets a ton of stacks you feel like the game is basically over.\nIt seems the only way to beat Nasus is either to pick a hardcounter or beg the jungler to camp you 24/7.","replies":[{"poster":"Lios Ashenblade","date":"2018-01-27T00:36:00.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our mid fed a tank veigar like 6 kills TANK VEIGAR...who was still hitting hard as fuck","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2018-01-26T19:45:38.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is too strong atm, with bruisers who used to counter him being in a weak spot, and Riot buffed his early game a ton with the change to ult, giving him health, defensive stats and reduced Q CD.  They also got rid of some of his counter-play which was to build armor against him so that his Q damage didnt hurt as much, but since E now shreds % armor he can deal damage to everyone.\n\nI love Nasus but Riot has taken away his real weaknesses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Feathermane","date":"2018-01-26T17:53:48.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just how Riot does scaling champions.
