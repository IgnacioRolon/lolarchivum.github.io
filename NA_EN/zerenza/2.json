I want to get Zed with hextech crafting but he's 675 and i only have 608 :( i would also take a champion mastery token so i can get a champion, disenchant and have enough but either or i just don't want to have to play 20+ games for 1000 IP.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T17:04:39.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't able to provide essences beyond what's already provided in game.  You're so close though, just keep at it!  With enough IP or even finding a mastery chest by earning an S, you could stumble on some more blue essences by chance.  Don't forget that per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, you can still get an S with champions you own to get chests.  As long as you have keys you might get lucky.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
