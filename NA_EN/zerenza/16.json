But has Neeko or Nidalee met Qiyanna? If not, what would they think of her upon meeting her? \r\n\r\nThe lore puts them pretty close to eachother in Kumungu Jungle, so i assume either Neeko and Nidalee didn't want to mess with Ixtal or they did and something interesting happened as a result. \r\n\r\nSide Note: We know Neeko met Ezreal at one point, did Ezreal ever find Ixtal?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2019-06-10T20:04:41.326+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the question is, if Qiyana ever met Neeko did she even know she met Neeko?","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2019-06-10T21:55:17.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Qiyana saw herself and just sat there admiring herself instead of wondering if it was someone else, cannon now, thanks Reav3! lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-06-11T19:46:03.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everyone has met Neeko.\n\nCanon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Groove Crusader","date":"2019-06-10T21:22:21.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder since the new lore says that Ixtal joined Shurima and contributed some of the first Ascended, is Aatrox's accent from the region?

Qiyana is royalty, and is damned and determined to become the queen of the Ixtal people, so I don't think she's going to be in the habit of developing relationships with people who she'd consider beneath her, or at least those who don't inflate her ego any more than it is. Also, given that Nidalee's grasp of the elements is extremely limited, Qiyana would have no reason to want to know her, as she wouldn't see Nidalee as someone to help her on her path. Neeko would equally be uninteresting to her, as again, she's not useful to Qiyana's ambitions.\n\nThey could have encountered each other in passing, but I'd not bank on any deep investment beyond \"Look how great I am, kneel before your future queen.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-06-10T09:26:53.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For now it looks like Kumungu is a part of or region in Ixtal. \nEzreal has been to Ixtali territory, as seen in his field notes on the map as well as his color story. However that does not mean he found Ixaocan.\n\nFor anyone meeting, I doubt it. We have nothing about Qiyana except for her biography, and the jungle is big. Like, Amazonas levels of big.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2019-06-10T19:23:14.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In their official World Map, it's right under Piltover/Zaun to the right of Shurima and to the left of Bilgewater. The jungle isn't THAT large, i'd say half the size of the Amazon if we assume Shurima is about 3x's the size of the jungle(like the map suggests)\n\nThat's why i feel as though Qiyana could have met them, I mean Neeko was able to meet Ezreal and Nidalee(and stay with her for a long time.) also Nidalee could be from Ixtal herself, since it now lists Rengar, Nidalee and a few other's as being from the Ixtal Region.","replies":[]}]}]}
