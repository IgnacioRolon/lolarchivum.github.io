She isn't a tank, she isn't a fighter, she's an assassin, she is squishier than an ADC for most of the game and dies really easily when she's camped or alone.(by this i mean she only brings damage to teamfights, just like an ADC which means she needs someone to tank for her, and CC for her. If she doesn't have that, she's the same as telling your squishy jinx to go 1v5, regardless of how fed she is, she'll probably die) \n2. She isn't meant to engage for you, not on a 5v5 teamfight, it's not her job, she'll just die and do nothing, then you'll flame her for feeding or split pushing when you haven't been trying to help her. She's a teamfight assassin, if she doesn't have a team, she's nothing.\n3. For the love of all that is holy, pick someone with engage, anyone, katarina cannot engage for you, she can't keep going in alone because she'll keep feeding, you need to engage for her so she can finish the fight quickly. \n\n~Your neighborhood Katarina main who can't win a game right now because no one wants to engage.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-20T22:51:21.328+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"i should alter my pick because you want to play X\"\n\nno thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Weissritter","date":"2017-03-21T00:09:15.404+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"See I am okay with this logic until I get a full team of useless carries with no cc lol","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-03-21T01:25:28.120+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.

ENEMY team picked Fizz. That makes far more sense. So you have Soraka as utility. That's it. You need a bit more than that. However, you've got everything else down. I'd like to mention that Raka's E is hard CC, as well (interrupts all channels, has a silence, AoE, damage, and snare).\n\nAnd Ahri's basically an assassin, just like LeBlanc. Even if she's a _primary_ mage, she's still basically an assassin. Just an assassin that tends to suck against assassins.\n\nWell. A lack of CC wouldn't have been your primary issue. Singed and Raka both have hard and soft CC, Ahri has hard, Mundo has soft. Their team only had Janna with hard CC, Kog has soft, Grave's smokescreen is just an annoyance, Fizz _might_ have a slow (I honestly just avoid almost everything of his, so I don't find out), and Yi has no CC at all. Your team had more CC, and had actual tanks. All you had to do was lock Fizz down, use exhaust on Yi, slow and kill Kog, kill Yi, Fizz (if he's not already dead), Janna, then Graves. Against that team, one Thornmail would have saved you from 3 of them easily.\n\nAnd Ahri wouldn't have been stopped by anyone, since they would have had no tank, so she should have been able to carry the game.\n\nThen again, I'm only bronze, so maybe I'm missing something. But it seems, to me, that would have worked. But I also had no idea about any of the scores. So maybe I'm wrong. But you didn't need to CC their entire team at once, only the biggest threat at the time.\n\n\nIf the Ahri had stayed back, harassing with Q, until Fizz dove in (in which case, she should delete him), then focused on Kog (or Yi, depending on if he's already ulted or not), then systematically eliminated everyone. Graves would have been her biggest problem after their burst (Yi and Fizz, specifically. Yes, I count Yi as burst. He's like an auto-attacking assassin, basically) died, assuming nobody on their team was fed, since Graves would have been most of their tank (except for maybe a lifesteal-heavy Yi, if you count that), but Singed and Lucian would have been enough for him.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-03-21T19:41:03.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's assuming equal gold. My Mundo tower dove the Fizz at level 3. when Fizz had E and summoners up. Yes, Mundo died. And then was useless all game.\n\nMeanwhile the Yi was hyperfed. The CC was an issue because we had to pick between Yi, Fizz, or Kog to lockdown and kill. Fizz was the worst choice, he was awful, but he's still Fizz and can throw heat seeking sharks. So that left Yi or Kog and we could only kill one reliably, while the other destroyed everyone. It didn't help that Mundo, Soraka and Singed fed their asses off, whereas Lucian and I were the only saving grace, but we still can't win against a fed Yi and Kog with just the two of us, let alone a Fizz thrown in the mix.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JuhnChan","date":"2017-03-21T06:41:26.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top {{champion:23}}  6/5/0\nJungle {{champion:11}}   1/11/1\nMid {{champion:7}}  2/7/3\nADC {{champion:222}}  2/9/5\nSupport {{champion:63}}  8/8/0\n\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-03-21T06:25:05.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See i only adjust my pick when i'm top, if i'm mid fuck that a team usually has two carries, or should but ya know, meta.
