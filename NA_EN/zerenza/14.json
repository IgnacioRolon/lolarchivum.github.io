Even her matchups are way more frustrating for diana since she can't do much pre-6 while other mid laners can way easier, and even at 6 other mids still have a powerspike that counters hers. \n\nIMO she needs a rek'sai/kindred level update. She has needed it for awhile, I think she was a decent pick in season 6 jungle when runic echoes was hype, but since then I haven't really seen a diana unless they were a diana main and even I don't find motivation to play her in most matchups dispite personally liking the champion.

Meaning that Diana is a generalist but not a very good one, and she probably could use a small update. Though i'm not sure exactly what they would change about her, if they turned her into a Fighter and turned Moonfall into the high damage ultimate it was during her creation process then maybe that would help considering we don't really have an AP fighter. Though AP Fighter's have a hard time existing due to lack of itemization geared towards them. \n\nAnd yes it's mostly mains that are playing her, her 45% winrate in platinum and above is along side a 1% playrate which is most likely by mains.","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-05-19T19:44:11.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO a change they could try,\n\nIs if diana's hits her Q, it resets her ult cooldown rather than her ult reseting if she recently ulted somebody hit by Q (marked). This would give diana players more options such as ulting for an easier Q to followup ganks or actually be able to commit to her own roams once she's there (you miss Q while roaming you might as well go back mid). Diana isn't like ahri or ekko where they can still continue a fight if they miss one part of their kit, if diana misses her most vital part its very devestating, and even if she does land it, is that the one you follow up with?\n\nAdditionally they could buff the shield ratios on her W to make her survive diving into fights (which would make her tankier than ahri, differing her playstyle from both being one shots, to diana being a mid laner all-in diver while ahri is a ranged mage assassin.). Buffing W ratios would double up as a revival to jungle diana who struggles in the new jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-05-19T21:56:19.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order to buff her shield they would have to reduce damage because if not she'd be similar to tank ekko and fizz, slipper and deals lots of damage while being really tanky. \n\nThough i do think it's worth trying to reset her ult with her Q instead of the other way around, her Q cooldown is pretty high(i believe 8 seconds max rank?) and having that reset her R would allow for buffs considering it would be an overall nerf to her stick ability as an assassin.

What I think would help most would be adjusting her W shield to scale less with AP, but also some with bonus health. This would reward more fighter style builds with additional tankyness without making assassin builds overly oppressive (i.e. they don't get too much free tankyness). Other than this, the best thing that would help her would be for riot to actually make some proper AP fighter items, Rylai's is too slot inefficient imo, and could use more health (and high gold cost to justify it). I would be quite happy  to see a 400-500 hp, 70 AP Rylai's. 70 AP or maybe even nerfed to 60 AP would keep most mages from abusing it, or at the very least give it a meaningful opportunity cost compared to things like Luden's Echo and such. I've also noticed that most of the items Diana likes don't have CDR, so that creates a big problem for her because she really needs CDR to be good. I've taken to building a more splitpush/dueling oriented buildpath on her partly to fix that. It's {{item:3115}}+{{item:3006}}+{{item:3100}}, in case you were wondering, often I get {{item:3157}} later on too, so that's actually 40% CDR, but there's little room for tank stats with a build like that, and if you do get some tankyness, you are giving up things like {{item:3089}} and/or {{item:3135}} because you simply don't have the slots for them. Diana does miss the old {{item:3001}} passive, but otherwise the new {{item:3102}} is quite a good AP/MR item for her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2017-05-20T13:34:38.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana just flat out needs a kit update. She has the kit of a diver, but because people insist on trying to play her like an assassin, Riot's tried to appease everybody by balancing her for both roles, which has only made her bad at both of them. She was reliant on Abyssal Scepter because it's one of the few items that gave her the combination of damage and tankiness that her current mess of a kit requires to function, and Banshee's Veil doesn't give as much damage since it lacks the damage oriented aura so it's not as effective on her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rengooo","date":"2017-05-20T12:40:27.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What she needs is the rework they have talked about :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"aqours fanboy","date":"2017-05-20T09:17:13.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love some kind of buff (maybe in the mana department) but overall I don't think she's in a shit place, the meta just currently isn't the best for her.
