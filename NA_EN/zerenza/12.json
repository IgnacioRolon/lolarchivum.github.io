This is 33% effective for area of effect damage. (same passive as Hextech Gunblade)\n\nUnique Passive - Cleave: Basic attacks deal 5 (+10% AD)(+20%) Magic damage in a line behind the target (450 range) [procs as quickly as titanics](Cannot stack on-hit damage with Spellblade, Wit's End or Nashor's Tooth.)\n\nUnique Active - Crescent: The next basic attack is enhanced, causing it to fire a bolt behind the target, that explodes upon reaching max range or hitting the next target dealing 10(+2*level)(+20% AD)(+25% AP).

Another one is probably Alistar and Blitzcrank, i think thresh has AP scalings too but i'm fairly sure this item wouldn't break them in a solo lane.

I did it on purpose. \n\nEdit five: Removed the Mana and added health regeneration(against my will.) Added fizz, cause i forgot you buddy.\n\nEdit six: Added the AD back in and gave it a bit more so it's more gold efficient, changed the passive and actives to be different from Titanic Hydra and Ravenous Hydra.\n\nEdit Seven: Removed the health regen.

Both {{item:3145}} and {{item:1026}} give a total of 80 AP, yet this item drops 5 out of nowhere. You're dropping this item's statistical gold efficiency in a bid to make it balanced around its passive, but GOOD final items are typically (at least) 100% gold efficient through stats alone.\n\nAn easy comparison is {{item:3146}}, which grants 40 AD, 80 AP, 15% lifesteal and 15% spellvamp (in terms of raw stats). It builds out of {{item:3144}} and {{item:3145}}, which give only 25 AD with 15% lifesteal and 40 AP, respectively. Gunblade is effectively 121% Gold efficient when looked at through these raw stats only, and that's ignoring the fact that the item actually ADDS more AD to its repertoire when finished.\n\n{{item:3074}} is only about 95% Gold efficient in raw stats alone, but its persistent AoE passive and active easily put it over the top in gold efficiency overall. Not to mention the fact that lifesteal applies to the AoE damage (albeit at half effectiveness), meaning that gold efficiency isn't an issue from the get-go.\n\n{{item:3748}} is a unique case, being less than 80% gold efficient in raw stats alone. In fact, it's missing exactly 775 gold to be considered 100 gold efficient. Since its passive has a persistent on-hit component separate from its conical damage component, the on-hit damage would only need to make up for 775 gold in stats to make Titanic Hydra worth building in gold value alone. When calculating that the equivocal gold value of 1 on-hit damage is 25 gold (based on Recurve Bow value), one can calculate that the on-hit portion of Titanic needs to only deal 31 extra damage on-hit to be 100% gold efficient with the conical passive or active damage. With a base on-hit portion of 5, that means you need 2600+ health to make Titanic Hydra gold efficient on your champion. Since Titanic Hydra is gated to precisely be a tank item, and since the item comes with 450 Health already, you need about 2100 health (base health + runes + masteries + items) to make this item gold efficient in raw stats (a full build).\n\nArguing strictly in terms of gold efficiency for your item, the raw stats would need to add up to 3600 gold.\n\n75 AP = 1631.25 Gold\n100% HP Regen = 300 Gold\n10% Lifesteal = 375 Gold\n10% Spell Vamp = 275 Gold (formerly gold value)\n\nA grand total of 2581.25 Gold in stats, or 71.7% gold efficient. The scaling single-target on-hit portion of this item's cleave (the 10% AP scaling) would have to be dealing over 1000 Gold in damage to make this item break even as a stat stick alone. That would require approximately 400 AP on your champion, or effectively a near full build, just like Titanic.\n\nConsidering how massively expensive it is, and how you want this item to be a VIABLE option for melee AP champions, you'd quite frankly need more in terms of raw stats just to make this worth it. I'm more inclined to build Hextech Gunblade with Nashor's Tooth at this point, simply because both those items individually, and in combination, provide A LOT more value per gold spent than this would with Nashor's Tooth. Consider that melee AP champions do not necessarily have the option of building every single 100 AP item available (and even then, Rylai's is dropping to 75 AP), meaning, more often than not, AP melees won't consistently reach this threshold like tanks and bruisers would with Ravenous Hydra.\n\nSome fundamental changes I would look into for making this item fall more in line with expected gold value (and making it more attractive overall):\n\n - Give this item Tiamat's AD. There's no reason to remove a measly 700 Gold's worth of stats that won't significantly benefit hybrid champions any more than Gunblade does.\n - Either make this item give 80 AP outright or dump Blasting Wand and replace it with Amplifying Tome. There's no reason this item should lose BOTH AD and AP for its passives. Adjust AP values if you decide to go Amplifying route.\n - Don't try mixing up the Hydra abilities up. The reason Titanic has a conical damage effect in both its active and passive is for cohesion and simplicity, vice versa for Ravenous. We don't need to see an item that does both conical damage and player-centered active damage for no inherent reason. Having its passive and active more reflect Ravenous Hydra's design seems much for fitting for a pure damage-scaling Hydra item","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-11-29T08:51:22.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Uhmmm 2100 HP, isn't a full build, it's Kog's base hp at lvl18","replies":[{"poster":"101100111000","date":"2016-11-29T09:38:41.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it really necessary to get anal about my wording when I was proving a point?

Although the spell vamp is what they were trying to get away from.\n\nI can't see a few of these champs, like {{champion:55}} or any of the JGs that you mentioned, using it. Giving this to Ekko is just begging for Takko to come back.\n\nAlso give it a cool concept name, like Ferocious Hydra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-28T19:15:16.805+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ekko's Q is great for waveclearing.  It generally takes ~2 casts to clear the entire wave, which can be easily sustained with two Doran's Rings.  Diana's Q, W and passive also provide great waveclear.\n\nCho'gath's waveclear is fine.  His Q and W are both AoE with high base damage and his E provides waveclear for no mana cost.\n\nMalphite and Maokai generally rush Sunfire Cape and have an AoE ability good for waveclearing (Malphite's E and W, Maokai's Q).\n\nEvelynn's Q lets her clear waves pretty quickly when positioned properly.\n-----------------\nQuite frankly, you seem to be missing that not being able to clear waves from a distance is an intended limitation for some champions' kits.\n\nAlso, you are outright removing the AD and health regeneration provided by Tiamat when you upgrade it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JC DarkOmen","date":"2016-11-30T01:35:59.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The AP version of Tiamat is called Luden's Echo","replies":[]}]}
