If i were to try and cast my Q, he would zigzag in the same direction, every single time. I could understand simply Zigzaging while a Xerath is casting Q, but to do it so perfectly in line with the Hitbox is obviously a script.\n\nI think it's funny because Xerath(the most scripted on champ) is the easiest champ to find scripter's on. Holding down his Q and watching someone move like that, right in line with your mouse and the hitbox of your Q is so funny.

That information probably isn't even sent to the server, that would just be useless information that the server would have to process and that would take up bandwidth. Mouse clicks are, since those have the potential to cause an action to happen, but just where your mouse is at any given time isn't.\n\nHumans are creatures of habit. It makes sense that someone would perform the same actions over and over until something happens to cause him to think that it was harmful to his survival or objective. Almost everyone has small habits like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-12-26T03:03:07.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYC-i7OHG5I","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-26T17:51:08.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it never moved away from his mouse before he pressed any buttons, which is what you seem to be claiming someone did in your post.\n\nThere are parts in that where Redmercy was hovering his mouse over the scripter's character and it didn't move at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
