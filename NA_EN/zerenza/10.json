The reason for this is the universal hatred for his Kit. It kind of sucks cause i have a friend who's a yasuo main and he can't play him after buying the new skin because he's banned, constantly. \n\nRiot, this is where you come in, sometimes a champion is really unfun to play against, with 10 bans implemented these champions will become unplayable. Regardless of whether the champion is Meta or not, this means as the creator's of the champions, you should fix what's making people hate them or at the very least alleviate it. \n\nI know some don't want Yasuo to be changed but at this point it's the only way he'll become playable again.\n\nEdit: I have some ideas on how to do this, but i'm not a yasuo main so i don't want to suggest any changes to the champion.
