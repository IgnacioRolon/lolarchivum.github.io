It&#039;s pretty simple.\n\nThis champion is busted, riot meddler once said(Paraphrasing) that garen&#039;s kit is to strong, his kit is oppressive and if at any point he becomes a strong pick in high ELO it means that something is horribly wrong. For this reason and several other&#039;s i&#039;m about to go over, garen is kept in a constantly weak state. If you don&#039;t know what about why his kit is so strong then continue reading further.\n\nPassive:\n\nHis passive gives him increased healing in lane, massively increased healing, if he doesn&#039;t take damage for a short time he heals for up to 1% of his maximum health every half second. if he has this 1% healing at level one he&#039;d be incredibly hard to play against, dominating lane by outsustaining his opponent. Luckily he only get&#039;s to 1% later in the game, this is a consequence of how powerful a tool this is for him.\n\nQ:\n\nWhat dingus thought it was a good idea to put a silence on a 4 second cooldown ability that deal&#039;s bonus damage, gives increased movement speed and  a soft cleanse effect. This ability is overloaded, the silence last&#039;s ages, it deals incredible damage and makes it so your opponent in many cases litterally just can&#039;t fight back. This is one of the main reason&#039;s he&#039;s nerfed so badly, it&#039;s hard to balance a juggernaut who can yolo dive a back line, half health the squishy and then kill them cause they literally can&#039;t fight back. \n\nR:\n\nThis ability is absolutely insane, this ability has a rather useless passive in &quot;villain&quot; basically all of garen&#039;s abilities deal TRUE DAMAGE to his villain and his villain does reduced damage to him. The reason i call this ability pointless is due to the fact garen can&#039;t pick who is the villain, it&#039;s based on who&#039;s had the most kills, which is thematically pretty cool but in terms of gameplay it makes him either really useless or absurdly strong. \n\nHis active ability on this is a targeted execute....that has 175 base damage at level 6 and scales off of...*cough*....*COUGH* 28% of the target&#039;s missing health! Dafuq?! WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS OKAY?! Juggernaut&#039;s should NEVER have execute abilities that are this absurd, at least darius can&#039;t one shot you with it he has to stack his passive up first, atleast you can do something about this, but remember when i said garen can yolo dive and kill most squishies? This ability is why, all you have to do is Q a squishy maybe use your E for a bit of extra damage, and you&#039;ll basically kill them from half health will no counterplay involved, and all you had to do was click on them. The worst part about this is, if that enemy is marked as a villain, this shit deals true damage. WHAT?! TRUE DAMAGE TARGETED EXECUTE ON A 40 FUCKING SECOND COOLDOWN? No wonder riot keeps this guy nerfed. \n\nFor those that dont know this means that at level six if you have 1000 total health and are down to about 300-400 health, your very likely going to die to this ability. Once he reaches higher level it scales off of 50% and has a base damage of over 500, meaning if you have 1600-2000(Many ADC\"s have around this much late game)  health and are down to half, this ability will one shot you every, single, time. \n\n\nConclusion: Look, honestly i like the idea behind garen, but the problem is it was executed(haha) poorly, a juggernaut shouldn&#039;t have the tools garen does, and because he has these tools he&#039;s kept in a constantly subpar state to prevent from balance issues. I really want to see garen mini-reworked or fully reworked, unlike many i think riot&#039;s rework&#039;s(for the most part) have been pretty onpoint lately and i think that garen has a good shot at being really fucking cool but right now he&#039;s just not.\n\nNote: Garen&#039;s E and W i feel are perfectly fine, the rest of his kit though causes major balance issues and prevent&#039;s him from ever seeing the light of day outside of an auto filled bronze top laner.","replies":[{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2017-05-20T16:58:21.831+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"The whole idea of point and click true damage that scales with missing Hp is completely stupid\nHe can shred armor with one E, and it will be from his E and Black cleaver\nIt is almost like if his ULT did physical damage he would become broken\nBut I am sick of 1700 true damage being dealt to me when I am under 1/2 hp, while Garen has 1 AD item","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2017-05-21T03:59:37.760+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">But I am sick of 1700 true damage being dealt to me when I am under 1/2 hp,\n\n525 +40% missing health\n\nSo you were missing 2937.5 health?\n\nThat's means you had 5875 health in that example... are you a Mundo main or something?","replies":[{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2017-05-21T14:18:16.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, I am not sure how it did 1700 true damage, but I definitely was not playing a someone too tanky","replies":[{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2017-05-21T16:02:31.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the problem, Both are correct, It's just that death recap is dumb, That's all.","replies":[{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2017-05-21T16:11:30.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was not the death recap, I saw it deal the damage, and I had like 1/3 hp","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2017-05-21T18:08:13.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who were you playing?

He definitely has his issues, one of the biggest I feel is that he's TOO simple. Garen is a very straight-forward and easy champion, which by itself isn't a bad thing. It gives new players a simple champion to play, but in turn he loses the access to certain tools many other champions have. Garen is only mostly good at killing one target, but he doesn't even get to choose who that target is. Maybe it's the fed ADC who can shred him fairly easily, or maybe the support who accidentally took a kill.\n\nGaren just doesn't have a lot of depth or options, and hopefully a mini-update could be very beneficial for him. I feel like being the juggernaut assassin should stay his niche, but I feel being an anti-magic/mage juggernaut would be much more fitting to his lore and identity (He wears magic-absorbing armour from Demacia). This sorta shows in his current kit through his silence, but that's the only true anti-mage tool he has.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-05-20T17:20:03.822+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"He shouldn't have a silence at all, the idea of \"Juggernaut/ Assassin\" is extremely bad for design. By design a juggernaut is supposed to be a damage dealing psuedo tank, they go into the team and wreak havoc on them. An assassins job is to kill a single key target, if you combine those your left with, well, garen. Garen's ability to yolo dive a back line and one shot an ADC is unmatched and that's exactly why he's kept so weak, fizz and ekko tank builds are basically garen, high damage, hard to kill, hard to get away from. It's just not good gameplay and causes his basic design to be extremely oppressive. \n\nHe should simply be a juggernaut, all juggernauts can kill squishies but none of them can do it with ease unless their fed. In my opinion the perfect Juggernaut is Illaoi, sure she's a pain to lane against and she can feel broken but her entire kit is full of counterplay, dodge, run away, CC. She even tells you to do exactly that but people still complain because they just don't, a juggernaut should punish player's severely for making mistakes, but not make it impossible for them to do anything at all, like garen does with his silence. \n\nEdit: Not to mention, Garen should punish his enemies for making mistakes, it makes sense being the \"Might of Demacia\" that he punishes player's like a true keeper of justice and law in demacia.","replies":[{"poster":"NovaDisk","date":"2017-05-21T07:22:37.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now, Garen's not a Juggernaut.\n\nA Juggernaut is an extremely immobile, fairly tanky champion that can wipe out your entire squad if you ignore them or fail to kite them.

Darius and Illaoi are both excellent examples of Juggernauts.\n\nGaren is a diver, much more similar to Renekton.\n\nGaren and Renekton are both durable, semi-mobile champions whose goal is to dash in and 100-0 a vulnerable target, then serve as a frontline after they've finished their job.\n\nThe only difference is Renekton is better at it, with better mobility, a true stun, and stronger 1s burst.  Garen can CONDITIONALLY have better burst, if the target he is trying to kill is already low, or is the villain.\n\nI think people need to get the idea out of their heads that Garen is a Juggernaut, because he's not.

Boom, he can't use it until he's level 11 if you do that little.  Bonus points go to DoT abilities, especially when paired with liandry's or DFT which will keep it down for much longer, and need far less application.  Swain, Darius, Morde and Teemo are very good at doing this top lane, coincidentally, Morde is Garen's worst match up, Teemo is within the worst five, and Darius is in the worst 10-- by winrate according to LeagueofGraphs\n\nHit him once every 7 seconds 11-15 and once every 5 seconds after that-- granted, lategame is where it shines, and its basically a free Warmog's Heart, though, admittedly not quite as strong.\n\n\nQ, If he uses the ability, you want to avoid or mitigate his next attack or wait five seconds.  Additionally, when it is on cooldown, Garen has no recourse to any CC, not even a slow so kiting becomes very effective.  Wait for his sword to flash when he tries to engage, and unload your CC after that to easily peel Garen away from yourself or teammates. \n\nW, Same tricks that apply to any similar such ability, try and bait it out, or wait it out (usually maxed last so it only lasts 2 seconds until lv. 8, and stays at 3 seconds until lv. 14) Doesn't give it's full passive component until Garen has reached 125 cs as well, so he won't have as much resists if you can keep him from farming early on.  All of his counters are able to bully his lack of range in lane to keep him low on CS.  If you have some solid harass or can just poke from a bit beyond, oh, 220 range, you can keep him from full accessing his resists for quite a while.  \n\nE, This has some built in counterplay.  For starters, it only does full damage if he's hitting a single target, despite being a PBAoE ability.  Secondly, it only shreds your armor after you've been hit for 4 hits, so dashes, blinks, knock backs, dispositions, or flash will all save you from the shred and the majority of it's damage.  Additionally, you can stun, knock-up, suppress, or otherwise CC him, then simply walk out of its 220 range and have your armor emerge unscathed.  Also, if he is moving into or through a target, including minions, he's slowed by 20% during Judgment, so kiting him into summons, monsters or even minions is an effective tactic for disengaging from a Garen. \n\nR, Well, for starters lets address the Villain mechanic.  This is about the only place where the \"Counterplay being not close to a champion isn't healthy counterplay\" comment actually applies.  The villain mechanic is dumb, and should never have been added.  If you are the villain you will take extra %hax hp true damage when fighting Garen and all you can do to avoid this (other than counterplay to simply avoid taking damage from Garen in general) is well. . . to wait for it to recalculate the villain, or for someone else to become more villainous due to a kill streak, or to die to Garen. \n\nAs far as the active goes, the main counterplay is to disengage when you're getting low.  However, beyond that, if you're an AD champ, buy a hexdrinker and you'll completely nullify his ult unless you're the villain.  Yes, the MR is not effective for any of the rest of the damage he does, but the passive shield is enough to block his rank 1 ult unless you were so low he could have killed you with an auto attack, and the shield has a lower cooldown.  Maw is an even better counter to his ult, of course.  Now, there are also some general tactics to avoiding obvious executes (let's be honest, you know when a Garen ult is coming) for one, you can use burst heals or shields either as the target themself, or an ally.  Defensive abilities can also be useful here, but, if the target is the villain, damage reduction will not apply and only health gains, heals, or shields will matter.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2017-05-21T04:15:08.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think that he borders much closely into the territory of needing a vgu personally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-05-21T03:01:40.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't they remove the reduced damage part from his R passive?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lynxonyx","date":"2017-05-21T05:23:41.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:27}}  *shrug*","replies":[]},{"poster":"JESUSSAYSNO","date":"2017-05-21T08:54:07.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly, his ult is the only stupid part about his kit. It feels super unfun to play against. \n\nThere's those games where you pop the fuck off, and are constantly villain. It feels super bullshit that the enemy team has a spell literally designed to shut down the strongest player on the enemy team. At rank 3 it can easily be above 1k true damage and a well placed Garen ult will just end the game on a point click by removing a fed carry from a fight. It's especially a problem for ADCS, sustain mages like Vlad (my main) and Swain, and just about any champ that has a fluxuating health pool in a fight, that relies on lifesteal or some form of on kit healing to survive fights. Because all of a sudden, because of the Garen pick, you're no longer safe at the 50% you can safely float at against every other champion. \n\nLike I can be rocking a teamfight, doing tons of damage, kiting Garen even, he doesnt need to touch me with Q or E once, and piggybacking off of other champ's damage, he does 1.2k true damage at a decent range. \n\nIt just feels bullshit when it happens. I don't think Garen is strong, I don't really find him problematic to play against generally, but he can do some bullshit. Kill range for you if you're the villian is stupid high, considering how tanky he builds. But lets be real, that's his only strength as is. \n\nI do think a rework would be good. I don't see how they can balance him when he has such a linear kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-05-20T17:02:10.416+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":">.
