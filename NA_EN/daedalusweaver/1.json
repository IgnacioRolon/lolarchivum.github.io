I'm not asking for a personal appeal here, nor am I asking you to bend the rules for ME, I just think it'd be a useful community feature to have logs for this kind of thing and have a way to talk these issues out instead of having a catch-all blacklist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaedalusWeaver","date":"2017-01-27T10:01:10.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My Drivers are always updated and my PC is always in pristine condition, this didn't start happening until season 7. \nYou said to let you know if I had any questions and have yet to respond in 28 days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaedalusWeaver","date":"2017-01-12T07:53:09.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or not because this thread has been abandoned.
