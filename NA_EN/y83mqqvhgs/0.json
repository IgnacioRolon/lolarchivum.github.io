I can't open a ticket because not knowing what region it was sent to means that I don't have enough information to open a ticket (for some reason).  So I can't access my account and I can't open a ticket.  How do I get my account back?\n\nAlso I feel like Riot should have a customer service number for things like this\n\nEdit: The email address and passwords were also changed so I can't get anything back","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T21:27:46.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we can help with this!
