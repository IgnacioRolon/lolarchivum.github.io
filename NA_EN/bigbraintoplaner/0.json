Then, minions and other champions would not take damage. For example, if I would be playing Poppy{{champion:78}}  top, I would Q on top of a Yasuo{{champion:157}} , he would take the damage, but no animation would show up. The creeps would also just pile up in lane, and sometimes not even move. I would have to wait in fountain till it stops or I would have to ult+f4. I also have issues with the league client. When logging in, I don't get game invites until I click \"play\" to reconnect myself  to the server. This has been happening for around 4 months. I have tried everything but getting new internet, which I really don't want to or need too. I will capture footage and screenshots if anyone is interested.  This happens on a regular basis.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-17T05:59:14.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're experiencing are common symptoms of *Packet Loss*, which occurs if there are problems between you and the servers.
