I'm having this problem for hours and still i can't solve it. I played Ascension(mode), the game ended and the stats screen came but it was all dark and the only think i could see was \"Skip waiting for stats\". Of course i skipped it. I wanted to start another game. I clicked on  Summoner's Rift ---> Normal ---> Solo. Unfortunately the error came \" You will not be allowed to join the queue because you are currently assigned to an existing game.\". I tried to fix it with uninstalling the game and didn't happen anything. I would be really happy if someone helps me with this problem. Thank you :) !","replies":[{"poster":"KDSL109","date":"2016-10-01T15:30:17.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waufid","date":"2016-10-01T15:17:47.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's working now !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T22:44:02.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still experiencing this issue?  It seems that some players were having what we call a ghost game, which happens when the match can't tell our servers that it ended.  Looking over things, everything looks okay now but let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Wanna Fu My GF","date":"2016-09-30T17:38:50.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem, i have ,,reconnect screen\" for about 3 hours {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
