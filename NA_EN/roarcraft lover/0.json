Riot announced Ao Shin way too early, and AFAIK, he's been canceled until further notice. Too many difficulties making good gameplay for him, given his huge size.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-05T00:35:43.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not his size, but an issue of animation. His serpentine body is hard to get right and Riot's tech isn't currently up to the task of creating the complex animations of such a creature.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-11-05T00:39:32.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still trying to get an answer as to how Ao Shin's animation is so much more complex than {{champion:69}} or {{champion:161}}","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-05T00:46:43.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass has the advantage of slithering on a flat plane. Vel'Koz  has wiggling/flowing tentacles affixed to a single point. Having a free-floating serpent would be more difficult than either of those.\n\nAlso, ever taken a really close look at their animations? They're alright, but nothing terribly outstanding.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2015-11-05T03:52:03.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ao Shin was never canceled and Riot said he would have to be pushed back since he was planned to be released this year.\n\nI repeat, he WAS NOT CANCELED, just delayed.\n\nConsidering he is a big dragon that probably has a lot of effects, it'd take a lot of work. Just like how Zac didn't get a skin for so long because of the way his model is.\n\nStill waiting on that suit for him btw rito","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2015-11-05T03:40:24.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last I heard it was 2026","replies":[]},{"poster":"SulkingKING","date":"2015-11-05T00:26:49.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's been replaced with Benson, the Firey Dragon.\nThis was leaked by Gweedo in an old TL;DR this year.","replies":[]}]}
