The 3 sentence champion bios suck and the fact that older champions lores have been chapped from interesting stories to brief synopses is sort of sad. There&#039;s been no web comics, no graphic novels, novels, ect. I feel like with how popular League is and how popular these forms of entertainment are becoming (DC and Marvel are doing well), I don&#039;t see why this hasn&#039;t been explored. \r\n\r\nI feel like a lot of players personally become invested with some of the characters and would like to see more of them outside of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sambers","date":"2016-10-17T21:58:22.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Who has time to read fictional histories in a video game, shm....","replies":[{"poster":"Star Guardían","date":"2016-10-17T23:48:42.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a hobby.
