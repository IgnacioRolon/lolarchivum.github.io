Don't worry, we can get you caught up and playing with your friends!  This black screen usually happens if your network is having a problem reaching the game server.  Your connection might otherwise seem okay but you can still have problems getting to specific services, like in this case.  I recommend running through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and make sure there's nothing blocking your way to us.

I have windows 10, so whenever I tab out from the black screen, it shows my desktop and taskbar and stuff right?
