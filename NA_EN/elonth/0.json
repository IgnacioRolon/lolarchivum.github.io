(something dota does that i think would be a good idea). [](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1712726246/36677357?tab=overview) \n\nif anyone has any suggestions in how i could possible recreate this bug or how i could be more helpful please leave a comment.\n\nEdit: the link didn't go through here it is http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1712726246/36677357?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-01-30T08:02:02.375+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Elonth, this is a bug we are looking to fix, but I honestly can not provide a time frame to when.

Sure, he's loads of fun in ARAM, but I'd rather not have a chance to play him than roll him and be unable to play the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elonth","date":"2015-02-01T07:11:42.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks i just wanted to make sure you found out if you hadn't already. is it with any hero? or just sion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-02-02T21:11:23.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"should be sion specific.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"graveroberth","date":"2015-03-27T02:09:40.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=tRfDx0PgNho can any riotter if this is a known bug?","replies":[]}]}
