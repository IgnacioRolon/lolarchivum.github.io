I wanted to play some of this kind of ranked before heading to Summoner's Rift. While playing however, I keep getting the Network Warning sign pop up and it kicks me off League. I have received warnings for leaving games because League doesn't think I have an internet connection. I can normally get back in but my issue is that my internet is fine. I can actually still be listening to my YouTube videos in the background so I know my internet isn't off. So my question is if anyone can help me fix that. I'm also wondering why Riot doesn't just make it wait a couple more seconds so they game doesn't start without someone. I've tried looking at older posts about this stuff but nothing solid really comes on on why this is happening or how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-22T20:34:22.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS settings. Run through those steps really quickly and try testing it in a custom or practice game first. Those two steps can help your network get a smoother and cleaner connection to our servers, but let me know if it doesn't help too much.","replies":[]}]}
