I have so many lags. First when I enter it lags, and when some one chats me it is really slow. Also, I was in ranked game, and it was my turn to choose a champion, but there was a hug lag, and I could not see a single champion, so I had to dodge from the beginning. I hope those lags should be fixed soon. And I am using my MacBook pro which was bought like a week ago. So this should not be my computer's problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T04:32:36.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some pretty big issues getting a stable connection with our servers if you're having those types of problems every step of the way.
