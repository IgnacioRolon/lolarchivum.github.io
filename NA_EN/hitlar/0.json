Is there a leaver buster appeal system because seriously it sucks because 100% of the time i leave on accident whether its something stupid or if its my connection. If there's no appeal system, can LOL seriously stop making lame updates and start focusing on their leaverbuster system and give it appeal options as well as have it recognize that you've left the whole game or at least over 10 minutes of it so they can penalize the intentional leavers? It's kind of a shitty situation being stuck on 20 minute waits for no reason because im only gone for like 2 minutes just to reboot my game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T23:57:55.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of your intent, a disconnection negatively impacts *everyone* in the match.

When it's unintentional like a cord trip or a prolonged connection issue which lasts at least 5 minutes because it only takes 3 to reset a router and 2 to reconnect to a game or 3 minutes to reboot you computer/laptop and 2 to reconnect to a game. Players aren't cold hearted beings where they won't understand what happens so long as you explain it. Half of the time it's because my client fails and I'm not even aware that I disconnected right in the loading screen. And it ends up where there's a remake the second i connect. Talk about that, it happened to me just now, so I'd glady enjoy it if you possibly could remove my unneeded leaver buster for no reason because there is clearly no appeal system or of any sort a way for your system to diffrenciate an intentional quittwr or a 5 minute unintentional bad moment. The leaver buster system gives as much of a negative impact to players as an intentional quitter. At least give the leaver buster some intelligence or extend the time of the afk warnings because you dont give players a chance to reconnect with such a short time. Not everyone has high speed rogers Wifi.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T20:34:51.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I mentioned before, I'm unable to modify your leaverbuster penalties in *any capacity*.
