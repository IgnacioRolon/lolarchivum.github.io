Literally trapped in a game , cant go afk ( negative behavior ) , begging him to stop and play does not work , cant mute it. Just my little #PlzRito . \n\nPS this chatlogs are deffo not permaban worthy , this guy was reported purely because of his in game performance or how others thought he did. You know it , i know it. He actually shown he wants to communicate with his teammates and find a way to be on the same page , guess you need to write it down as negative behaviour. Only thing he did which can be taken as negative is he typed smbds score. Still without context we cant know if he was actually toxic or he was proving a point.

When a player continues to behave in that way, moderation escalates up a tier.\n\nFirst is a 10 game chat restriction; strike one.  Then is a 25 game chat restriction, strike two. After that, a 2 week ban which is strike three. As it goes in baseball *\"Strike three; your out.\"*\n\nAt this point, the player has reached \"Ban\" status.  Now they can keep playing the game, as much as they want, but they are not allowed to continue to act they way that they have been.  If the player acts so that they violate the agreement again, when any one of their multiple violations that got them to the first tier and the multiple that got them to the second and so on, are grounds to terminate the agreement, the agreement and the associated account will be terminated.\n---\nOn to your case:\nNo, your chat that isn't \"bad\", relatively speaking.  I probably wouldn't have reported you because I don't even notice chat that often.  But none of that is relevant.\n\nIt doesn't even really matter what you did type in this one particular game at this point.  I'll stress again: if you violate an agreement, the agreement is terminated.  Due to many, repeated violations of your agreement, you reached a point where moderation stops overlooking it and considers following through and terminating the account.\n\nYou were free to play as much you wanted with no effect on you but once again you violated the agreement.  It doesn't matter what you wrote, you were using the  chat system not to coordinate with other player like it is supposed to be used for but abusing it to pick arguments with other.  I'm supposing this was also the reason for the other punishments and when you demonstrated that you will continue to do this, moderation followed through with their part of the agreement and terminated the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2016-12-15T20:12:13.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you got perms banned on multiple other accounts you should have learned your lesson then.
