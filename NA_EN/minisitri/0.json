What should happen is a chat suspension for 14 days and not a certain amount of games, it doesn't help if someone just plays the games and has the chat back, they don't learn anything from it. You can get suspended or banned whenever you talk back to a troll or just joke around because people just troll report. The report system is fine itself but whenever it comes to chat suspensions it should stay to that area and not take your ability to use your account away. Please listen to this and try to spread this around so Rito can fix the system!!","replies":[]}
