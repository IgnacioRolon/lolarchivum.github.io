Don't care about server stability, care about having 110 ping while the west coast has 20 ping. Some of us are competitive, and this is just an unfair playing field. Why use the word migration when you've been talking about centralizing the server only to move it a block? I imagine moving the servers is expensive, so, I doubt you will be doing it twice. \r\n\r\nBye, bye now.","replies":[{"poster":"g07h4xf00","date":"2014-10-07T16:12:14.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito is the only game company that doesn't realize that having an east/west server split is a good idea. \n\nAlso 110 ping is a minimum when I play on the east coast it randomly spikes to 250 which is ass","replies":[{"poster":"Raekian","date":"2014-10-07T18:42:39.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"East/west split or follow through with moving to Chicago. The entire server stability migration thing they are doing now is honestly a slap in the face. As soon as I get my invite to HoTS Beta I'm out. I'm actually a real big fan of LoL and the competitive scene; I just honestly get tired playing champions where the delay is extremely noticeable. One death is enough to snowball a game out of your favor, and a lot of times it's entirely reaction speed. Why should the enemy laner have 2x the time to activate an ability?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HipsterVegeta","date":"2014-10-07T16:14:26.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you that we need an East Coast server. We shouldn't be expanding to every single other country before even having our own working well. People are moving from NA to South American server because it allows for 20 ping. Some days I wonder how well I would do with 20 ping haha.","replies":[]}]}
