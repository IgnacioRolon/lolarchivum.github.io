I&#039;ve tried to ignore it and play on like most people do by muting and reporting, but it&#039;s really starting to become wayyy too much. Every game I&#039;ve had for the past 2 weeks, ranked and normal, have been full of trolls, rude teammates, and an insulting opposing team.  It&#039;s gotten to the point where I&#039;m becoming too afraid to queue unless I&#039;m playing with friends. I main support (switching occasionally) and recently everyone has been calling bot lane &quot;useless&quot; and blaming them completely on the team&#039;s defeat . I understand that yes people make mistakes and have their bad days, but when the rest of your team blames you for the opposing team constantly invading  and being unable to stop it, what else can you do but blame yourself? I&#039;ve tried to focus on my own gameplay thinking that maybe it&#039;s just me, but no matter how many heals, shields, and slows  I manage to pop, the fingers are always pointed. No communication is being made what so ever and when there is it&#039;s nothing positive unless we&#039;re winning. Many times have I had junglers focusing on other lanes besides the one that actually needs extra help from a roaming laner. Many times have I seen a mid laner not ping the missing opposing roamer skipping their way into bot or top lane. I feel like the sportsmanship in League has been horribly declining on a daily basis. I understand that yes it&#039;s a game, it&#039;s on the internet it&#039;s not real life, but it&#039;s starting to make the game feel unplayable. I&#039;ve gotten to the point where after almost every match I have to step away from my laptop because the game just wasn&#039;t fun anymore and I don&#039;t want to tilt more than I already have from hearing such constant negative feedback my from both my own team and the taunting enemy team. I know this sounds like a rant or a whine, but I&#039;m truly asking for help and advice on the matter. I was thinking of just taking a break for awhile but I know it won&#039;t change the toxicity of the community by doing so, I&#039;m still trying to power through it all because I honestly enjoy playing League.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2016-09-23T04:53:38.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there friend. I think you're on the right path with stepping away from the computer for a bit after a heated exchange with a teammate or opponent. It's good to take frequent breaks, especially if you're like some of the hardcore players that play for hours at a time. Go outside if you can and get some fresh air, maybe go for a walk or down a glass of water. These are all things I do to try to keep my head in the right place.\n\nThe first step to improvement is self-care. Look after yourself and make sure you get all the things you need. As a gamer, I know it can be difficult sometimes. We tend to lose track of time pretty easily and can skip meals without even noticing that we're hungry. But, you need to be more firm with yourself and make sure that you get all the things you need. I promise your attitude will improve if you cover all of your needs before you hop into a game.\n\nGood luck out there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-09-23T16:48:38.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couple of suggestions I can give you:\n\n1: Play with friends. It'll help lessen the likelihood of playing with a troll/toxic player, and can make the game pretty fun when you do crazy ideas with your friends. A buddy of mine and I like doing Thresh Blitz bot and it's always a bunch of fun. \n\n2: Take breaks every now and then. Remember that League is just a game, and that you don't need to play it every waking hour. Go on walks, play other games, or just watch some videos in between games. It's always great to take breaks from the game, no matter how long! I myself even took a two month break from the game, and it definitely helped boost my interest back in it. \n\n3: Learn to shrug off the negativity. I know some people word this a little harshly, but it is true to not pay attention to those in the game and in life that are negative. Just shrug off their comments and play for yourself. Don't let their negativity get to you, just have fun and play for yourself. Even when someone calls me some of the meanest shit in the game, I mostly just laugh at it and shrug it off. Words will never hurt you, so don't let them ruin the game or your life really :)\n\n4: Have fun! Don't forget the game is meant to be played to have fun. Like all entertainment mediums, it's meant for fun and enjoyment, so don't forget that! You can obviously be competitive and want to win, but you can also do that while having fun!\n\n\nI hope the advice helps. I wish you luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2016-09-23T04:52:37.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Get thicker skin.","replies":[{"poster":"medderz","date":"2016-09-23T09:33:42.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sort of agree with this guy. That stuff just doesn't bother me. This is is a competitive game people are gonna get upset when they lose especially if its someone who is extremely competitive. When I see it happen it literally just makes me want to carry harder and play better. If I make a mistake and teammates yell at me, I fix myself. I played sports in high school and college so I am used to someone being in my face criticizing and most of the time screaming. I guess its different for people who experienced stuff like that, but yeah it just does not bother me. Because really your teammates are only upset because they want to win. Sorry you are having issues buddy. Hope it all works out for you.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2016-09-23T14:43:38.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If people stopped focusing so much on \"toxicity\" In the community they could more easily get out the bots, cheaters, int feeders, scripters, and boosters. I don't even find toxicity a problem.

Find the first good thing that happens for your team and say \"nice X\".\n\nAdc dodged a skillshot? Nice juke! Jungle invaded and got enemy wraith? Nice invade! Top laner out csing their opponent? Nice cs top laner!\n\nTeammate dives and dies without killing them? Nice try, you will get them next time.\n\nWatching for things like that will also help map awareness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BloodBath5674","date":"2016-09-23T04:17:45.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to my profile and read my guide for a step by step guide on how not too be toxic its sure too help i understand how you feel but its not impossible to change i did and you enjoy the game even more {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wisteriå","date":"2016-09-23T04:27:54.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
