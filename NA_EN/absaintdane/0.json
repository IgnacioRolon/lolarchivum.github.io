Schoolwork has built up a lot now so I decided to end the season at that and carry on next season. If I achieved Plat around those dates, will I decay to Gold 1 before end of season if I haven't played ranked since then?\r\n\r\nIf yes, and I were to play one and lose, will I demote? (I haven't yet played any in Plat 5, still at 0 LP)\r\n\r\nOp.gg says I need to play more to have an accurate MMR, so that worried me a bit..\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-25T15:51:22.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll have 28 days from last ranked match in Platinum until you start decaying.  Our[ ranked play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) offers more info, but you should also have a game shield after a recent promotion so it might not be worth risking a decay.","replies":[]}]}
