Well today it actually managed to reach 89% (After 4 hours), then guess what happened? Unspecified error has occured, please retry. I clicked the retry and it went back to \"33% scanning files\".\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nAre you freaking serious right now?\r\n\r\nHow impossible is it to download this game?\r\n\r\nCan someone help please?
