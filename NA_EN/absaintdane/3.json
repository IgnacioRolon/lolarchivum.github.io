Im connected via Ethernet. I tried to download league and this is what happened. I sped through the download in minutes then it took me literally 4 hours to get from 33 % applying patches to 64 % applying patches. Now it's been on 64% applying patches for another hour. I have to go home soon. What a waste. Really ridiculous how long this takes.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T21:40:27.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last 66% of patching really relies on a great connection to the patching service. While your network connection at your university may be fast to a lot of sites, it may not have the most optimal connection to our patching servers. If you still have patching issues on your University Network, I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as it touches on the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if your issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
