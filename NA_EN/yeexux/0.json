Used to be 120+ now it's between 2 and 40. It's the \"stuttering\" that makes it unplayable.\nDoesn't matter if i use high or low settings, full screen or windowed. Followed the fps guide. did a re-install. The problem does not exist when i play with the practice tool. There 120 fps no problem.. play ARAM, 16fps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T00:11:27.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"You might have missed a driver update somewhere after the patch so make sure that you've checked all the steps in that [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) if you haven't yet.
