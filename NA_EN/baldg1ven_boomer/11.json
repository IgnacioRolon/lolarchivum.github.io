Year after year supports and their items have received more nerfs than any QoL or buffs. Every year there seems to be some kind of issue with support items and solo laners abusing them and at this point I'd rather you overhaul the entire thing than look for more nerfs.\n\nWith recent changes to Spellthiefs and Coin these are massively the most horrendous changes that could have ever went live. You're literally tying a support to an ally, what's even the point of playing a self sufficient AP support anymore when you can't even proc the tribute damage alone. That's not even the worst of your problems, what happens if your ADC is constantly dying in lane and you don't have an ally around to farm gold?\n\nThe first changes for removal of sight stone and incorporating the 500g was already bad enough as I had a couple of games where I can't even interact with my lane and have to wait almost nearly 20 mins just to complete my freaking item.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/7ADcpoZ\n\nBut now if you're in a shitty lane match up where you can't poke or you'll die or your getting camped you make literally 0 gold. \n\nJust overhaul the items already and start new they've been balancing nightmares for a long time now.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-12T17:24:54.113+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Nerfing that top strategy is pretty easy,\nGive people with support items half EXP if the minions die to anything but a champion.

Plus, your argument is like claiming that Smite somehow nerfs the Jungle role - they made Smite flexible by having the items you build determine how it changes, so I don't see why something like that couldn't be applied to Exhaust. Eye of the Aspect could make Exhaust work on Large and Epic Monsters, Eye of the Watchers could increase the slow strength of Exhaust, Eye of the Ascended could give you a speed boost when you use Exhaust, really, the possibilities are pretty endless as to how these items could modify Exhaust.\n\nAlso, your analogy of tying Heal to the Precision tree doesn't work. Runes aren't items, and to date, there is no correlation between summoner spells and runes aside from Unsealed Spellbook.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-14T23:57:40.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference with smite is that pre jungle items junglers were still picking smite 100% of the time.\n\nThat percentage is not even close with exhaust and supports. it's not even 95% to say that we can ignore the rest (5% is still a huge chunk)\n\nEspecially the aggressive supports like leona blitz alistar and pyke pick it more than 50% of the time.\n\nThe recent ignite \"nerfs\" also reduced ignite CD which was pretty neat for supports.\n\nOk then not precision to heal but maybe berzerker greaves to heal or anything ADC specific.\n\nExhaust would nerf the role in the sense that there would be less room for customisation.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-02-15T00:01:28.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saezio,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=d1wKf7Ex,comment-id=00050000000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2019-02-14T23:57:40.672+0000)\n>\n> The difference with smite is that pre jungle items junglers were still picking smite 100% of the time.\n> \n> That percentage is not even close with exhaust and supports. it's not even 95% to say that we can ignore the rest (5% is still a huge chunk)\n> \n> Especially the aggressive supports like leona blitz alistar and pyke pick it more than 50% of the time.\n> \n> The recent ignite \"nerfs\" also reduced ignite CD which was pretty neat for supports.\n> \n> Ok then not precision to heal but maybe berzerker greaves to heal or anything ADC specific.\n> \n> Exhaust would nerf the role in the sense that there would be less room for customisation.\n\nIt reduces what? Your choice between Ignite or Exhaust? In exchange for allowing gold income items to be healthy and balanced for their intended role?
