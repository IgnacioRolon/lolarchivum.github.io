If it was for Terms of powers alone we can be pretty sure ryze would have his current winrate +10% at least.\n\nas much as i like his design right now, no rework ever will make him balanced if they make his snare a point and click or an instant cast. at least give it an animation! \n\nas Cheesyjoe said, make it a skillshot but make it maybe more rewarding to land it","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2017-05-28T04:04:00.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Caitlyn aa range is 650...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordBrasca","date":"2017-05-27T16:03:15.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A point and click root on a champion that has also the ability to 100-0 you at the first mistake should never be a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2017-05-28T15:14:40.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know Annie doesn't have an instant root, but isn't her ultimate and W practically instant?
