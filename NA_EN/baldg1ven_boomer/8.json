Instead of giving you a bit of bonus damage per trade, it now gives you an entire abilities worth of damage per rotation (this scales to a bonus ults worth of damage later on) with the incredibly naive and quite frankly lazy notion that it will balance itself out because there should be a difference between the 2.  That's the thing Riot games, in practice there's almost no difference between the 2 and it's mind boggling you don't know this about your own game.  Almost everyone who could proc TLD before can proc electrocute now doing the exact same thing, except now you take literally 5 times the damage.

Here's a few counterpoints to his video:\n\n1.) He never really addresses the new damage from Sorcery and Domination Trees, which is absolutely ABSURD. Aery, Comet, Predator, Scorch, Eyeball Collector, ect ect. All of these things can be nuts for early game damage. And they all SCALE better than anything league has ever seen. Not that I think it's a bad thing, I actually think late game scaling is relatively healthy currently. But still,** you can't begin to address how damage feels right now without talking about these items.**\n\n2.) I feel like it's early game that's problematic, where players simply don't have good, easy access to MR out of the gate. The players who get that early advantage turn it into a midgame advantage, and so on and so forth. That's why players **FEEL** like the game is more snowbally.","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2017-12-21T20:24:50.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I also think that most of the burst and snowball complaints are geared towards champs like Maokai or supports who do magic damage but don't BUILD magic damage.  They aren't complaining about a Malzahar E doing half their HP, they are complaining because Sona clocked them for 1/3 of their health in one combo or Maokai came up and did 1/4 their HP in one Q.  So without taking even looking at keystones, those champs ARE doing more damage in most cases, BEFORE KEYSTONES! So add Aeri and or Aftershock or Grasp onto that.\n\nThe other thing which Phreak did say is that the Keystone has to do a lot of the heavy lifting. And it is.  I mean if your Malz goes Sorcery primary, then he takes Scorch, which is already doing as much as Deathfire used to, then you add Arcane Comet or Aeri on top of that!?  Then if he goes for free boots in Inspiration he gets to his damage 300g earlier?\n\nThen the third element is that Lethality builders are taking over games I play in.  So I need to see a video on lethality damage builders' damage compared to last season.  My hunch is they are doing more now.\n\nFinal element is the removal of catch up xp from kills.  This is fairly straight forward.  Back in the day if you were behind in levels and you managed to kill someone on the enemy team who was like highest or second highest in the game, it would often give you a massive boost to xp resulting in an instant or very expedient level up.  So the leads just stick more now.  This is more of the snowball than the damage argument, but it could contribute to \"feeling\" like the guy that is ahead is dealing more damage.\n\nBased on what I'm seeing in this video, basic calculations off Runes, and looking at the \"extras\", here's what I conclude:\n\nMages, auto attacking ADC's, and AD bruisers/juggers MAY be doing roughly the same damage as before, but EVERYONE ELSE is doing noticeably more damage (Possibly auto attackers and Mages are even doing a touch more damage because of keystones).  For the majority of the game anyway, with outliers being things like lvl 1 trades and Gathering storm in a 50 minute game.  But the kicker is that the runes provide snowball windows everywhere even if base damages are not higher.  Clepto gives money and possible temporary stat buffs, Domination is riddled with situational damage buffs, Gathering storm, randomly getting to cast a spell with mana refunded, getting 10% cdr for free, reduced ult cooldowns, free boots and stopwatch from your SECONDARY path.   I could go on, but I just want to end by saying the keystones and everything you get further down the tree and your secondary tree is a bit much in terms of value.  \n\nIn my humble mid-platinum opinion, lets get rid of Keystones all together.  Then separate all the remaining runes into two categories DAMAGE and UTILITY/DEFENSE.  You get to choose three in each.

Also, as was mentioned, early resistances are extremely low, which significantly increases the chances of getting snowballed on by bursty champions that thrive on early leads. The main counter to this as a bruiser is to stack resistances and HP early on, while saving the damage items for later (especially since most bruiser items are crazy expensive atm).
