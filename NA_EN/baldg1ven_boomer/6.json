This was honestly one of the worst changes to turrets, the old ones were fine the point of these turrets are they are suppose to be hard to seige and if you sucessfullly seige them you get a great reward. Not to mention how awful it feels to defend these things, you can have a 200 armor tank dive you easily and take 50 shots before he falls.\r\n\r\nPlease do revert turrets or am I going to have to wait a year before you realize how awful and unrewarding this change is.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-11-22T17:15:44.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They wont change it back.  I have no feeling s one way or the other on the turret change but I am happy that my friend can join in a siege and not have his computer tank due to the lazer effects","replies":[]}]}
