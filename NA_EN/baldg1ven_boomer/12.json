Last I knew, it was because Alacrity was too commonly bought (Alacrity was +Flat MS, ~20) and the other enchantments (besides Homeguards) had a hard time finding a niche, even though Furor was common on Chasers and ADCs (the former for chase speed, the latter for kiting) and Distortion was a favorite on Ghost-users. Captain was just a failure, we don't talk about those.\n\nRiot claimed that they were bringing boot enchantments back...Which means they're gone for good.\n\nTribunal: Been \"under maintenance\" for 2-3 Seasons, only lip-service (\"We're working on it\") and radio silence from Riot.\n\n1st-party Replays: JUST implemented in the Alpha Client. (Yes, it's still in Alpha. It barely works, to the point where I barely play LoL.)\n\nBalance In General: Uh...Do I even HAVE to say anything here? It takes less than 30 seconds of browsing Patch Notes and Red Posts to find tons of hypocrisy. My favorite: Riot was like \"Sejuani had a good run in the spotlight, but her time is done\" while Lee Sin has been in the spotlight for at least 3 Seasons with no nerfs in sight. (Riot quietly removed the Lee Sin nerfs they had on PBE. Not like they were huge anyway, 50/100/150 damage on his R, which doesn't nerf anything.) As it turns out, Riot nerfs based on whether they shut down their favorite Champs or not, instead of BUFFING AND NERFING BASED ON GAME HEALTH. (Which explains why they barely touch Vayne, Riven, Yasuo, Lee Sin, and most Mages.)\n\nAnd probably 50 other things that just escape me.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-12-28T03:43:17.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"captain was actually pretty good on certain champs like janna and maokai","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"badooga","date":"2016-12-27T23:55:37.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot deemed them unhealthy and removed them.","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2016-12-27T23:58:12.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC, they made a post saying they'll be returning in the future with new ones.","replies":[]}]}]}
