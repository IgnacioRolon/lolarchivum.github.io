Dude, are you insane, soon it will be reaching release-bard level winrates. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}\n\nWinrates on weaker champs are supposed to drop rapidly if they were inherently stronger the patch before, not sit where they were originally at for 20,000+ games and then bounce up a bit then go back to the same exact location.\n\n\nThis is extremely noticeable when you compare it to champs like Nunu/Ivern/Jhin/Varus/Zac/Malzahar/Graves/Gragas/Hecarim/Maokai/Rengar/Lulu/Thresh/Tahm Kench/Leblanc/Ahri/Yasuo/Taliyah/Cass/Azir/Ryze/Shaco/Yi/Lee Sin/Caitlyn(( Whose now at a 44% wr from a 55% wr btw, and it dropped significantly within the first day.))\n\nSo yeah, I highly doubt Janna out of all the champions is just going  gradually dip down to 49% wr after 800,000 games. After about 20,000-30,000 games if she's sitting at a 55-6% winrate she's going to stay at a 55-56% wr which means the nerfs effectively did nothing, and actually probably buffed her in the long run.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Celestial Lion12","date":"2017-09-27T19:49:28.997+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"thats a pretty small sample im giving it till friday before i make any kind of decision","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Celestial Lion12","date":"2017-09-27T19:51:21.660+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Also just checked according to lolking janna is at a 53% winrate not a 61%","replies":[{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2017-09-29T03:11:15.267+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"MUH CIRCLEJERK","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TRSpro","date":"2017-09-27T20:10:09.625+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know why the forums are like this.
