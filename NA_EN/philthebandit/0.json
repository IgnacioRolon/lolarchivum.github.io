His passive is amazing, his q is a better from of waveclear and cc, his ult cannot be {{item:3140}} ed, and it deals more damage, at a longer range, while also being instant (lissandra&#039;s is not). Sure she can heal and do damage in an AOE on self-cast, but {{champion:30}}  can accomplish the same thing with a {{item:3157}} . I know she&#039;s not bad, but she is still outclassed by so many other midlaners, that i can&#039;t seem to make her work. I haven&#039;t seen many people talking about this and wanted to bring this up. What should be changed? What should be Buffed?","replies":[{"poster":"TheProfezzor","date":"2018-02-17T01:03:54.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldnâ€™t.

But I can see your point and I gotta say - a good reason to pick her is because a lot of people have no idea what she does. She's great into some melee matchups and the punishment she can deal is criminal. Seriously pick Lissandra into a Fizz matchup and you will feel sorry for him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frozen Diva","date":"2018-02-17T13:47:45.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Lissandra is better than Malz.\nBut Riot knows she's in a weak spot atm and it's already confirmed by Meddler that she will receive buffs (more \"power\" as he wrote) in patch 8.6 and maybe a new passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-02-16T22:12:43.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright let's see, a champ that's rarely picked,banned, many forgotten, that's great for mystery picks since many don't know what she does at all like skarner.\nKite waveclear mage with some hard aoe cc engage disengage burst per second on squishie caught out adcs sup.\nShe's a mid game late early champ where she shines the most such as small teamfights/skirmishes think passive.\nProblem is, mana costs out the wazoo, you go mana now you don't damage anything, you go dmg but you got no mana and now the enemy can kill you easier/force you to back. Anyway her r feels so good on an adc or on yourself as you get their team to waste their abilitys on you and it's fun to disengage from the enemy with e and w q them in the face outta there. kiting better than ashe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mob Piru","date":"2018-02-16T22:09:12.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"she does what he does wiith being able to be safe and be mobile at the same time. \n\nI honestly think shes better then malz due to how she can be more useful then he is. \n\nOnce he uses his ult hes basically useless","replies":[]}]}
