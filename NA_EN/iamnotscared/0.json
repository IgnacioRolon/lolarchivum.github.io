Or any chat for that matter. So they could say they just didn't see it. Also they may not want to risk the other team playing that champ. This was your fault for only having one champ planned out of 20 other possible mid picks. And it's happened to me before when I was maining anivia and I did the same thing you did and got stomped and guess who's fault it was? Mine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phoenixdust","date":"2018-09-03T11:46:37.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"i had a free win which they didnt give, I had 2 wins already \" - What?\nDid you also prelock it before the banning phase?\n\nAnyway, if you are not first pick, it should not be instanly considered griefing, but this is very questionable. If you are FP or your team is FP and you can pick it, then it is obviously griefing, and fck that guy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morgana Ultima","date":"2018-09-06T08:39:36.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is it not griefing to pick Yasuo in ranked in gold/plat elo when you have a 20% win rate as Yasuo over 100 games?  \n\nIf you can tell me that's not griefing then I can assure you my banning that guy's Yasuo isn't griefing either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-09-03T17:03:01.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is always reasons champions are banned, Maybe they don't want to play against this champion, assuming that the enemy have the first pick and will get this champion first, or your teammate dosen't want this champion on his/her team, becuase they are looking for a specific pick and is using the ban to discourage the player and forcing them into said pick.\n\nyeah.\n\nits weird.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kats Pajamas","date":"2018-09-03T18:31:18.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You obviously ban their champion selection after they bans yours, pick teemo, then afk.\n\nThey eventually learn.
