I called top and locked my champion. Two people just instant locked lux and darius and went to top. I told them I have called top. They said &quot;its just a normal game&quot;. In my opinion, even a normal game worth my 30 min. It&#039;s just not fair to me. They won&#039;t leave top so I decided to feed their lane. After that, all the people just report me, and my account got suspended for 14 days.\r\n I know it&#039;s not right to feed the lane in the first place, but riot doesn&#039;t have any way to detect these players. They will just keep doing this and force players to leave the game during champion selection without getting any punishment. And its the positive players who get the time punishment and not the toxic ones. It&#039;s not fair.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-07-25T06:10:14.838+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intentionally feeding is not being a positive player.\n\nYou are also not entitled to any one spot in blind-pick. \"Calling it\" and locking in doesn't give you any more right to the lane than the other players on your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-07-25T06:14:40.469+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is no assigned lane in Blind.  That has always been the rule.  You can either play 3 tops or go to another lane.  Calling top does not mean it's your exclusive lane.  If you want assigned lane, go play Draft.\n\nWhy should Rito do anything about these players? They already spent a lot of time and resources to create Draft expressly for this situation.  If you choose not to play Draft (which is the biggest and most common queue), then you have no right to complain when you intentionally feed.\n\nYou reap what you sow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DearPear","date":"2018-07-25T06:38:36.383+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"B..B...But I said it first!\"\n\nEh.
