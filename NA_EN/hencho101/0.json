Both me and a friend are having this issue, but a 3ed friend isn't. Any clue what's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Hazoozu","date":"2017-06-06T07:30:41.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine is doing this same thing too riot, lots and lots of bug splats. Also I've notice my games are 3/4 times 10-12 higher ping for the past month or so and up until this point I've never consistently been higher than 56 ping. Also it never changes in game, it's either 56 ping or 67 ping. Once the game starts the ping is locked in.\nIs there something different on Riot's end?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-06T02:10:40.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be a coincidence that you and your friend are both getting that bugsplat on queue pops. It almost sounds like some of the game assets tied to the queue pop message might be damaged somehow. I'd try running a quick repair through the client options, but let me know if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
