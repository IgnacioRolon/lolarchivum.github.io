I already sent a support ticket for false accusation. A permaban is really too much even addressing the few two \"flaming\" phrases that I wrote.

Because that&#x27;s about It, just this game in two months and a half where I played good and I did better. Let&#x27;s not even consider the fact that this &quot;negative behaviour&quot; It&#x27;s merely subjective, because that&#x27;s what It Is. I&#x27;ve made read this log chat to lots of people and a good 75% said that Riot overeacted and I won&#x27;t get disban because they treat costumers as robots and not human being. They will never address that they, themselves, got a slip. \n> And, for the record, just to prove this point once more; I got this &quot;behaviour&quot; in every. other. single. games. (and also real life) and LoL Is the only one who has done anything to me this far, in other games I didn&#x27;t even receive an email arguing about my &quot;manners&quot;.\n> This Is what I get to try to respect the code of this community, I got threated FOR ONE GAME like other flamers who wishes deaths to others and family.\n> \n> My behaviour in some aspects may be considered inappropriate, even If I just used JUSTICE as my weapon (reports) and I payed for It.\n> \n> And those are facts.\n\nWhat things you didn't do? The only things I said you did were flame and harass your teammates, and you definitely did. You repeatedly told them to shut up, you repeatedly shrieked about reporting them and getting them banned (delicious irony), you told them to learn to play, and more.\n\nAnd once again, you weren't permabanned for \"just this game.\" You were permabanned because you misbehaved repeatedly, were told to improve your behavior repeatedly, and yet here you are again spending a match raging at your team and harassing people (yes, calling for reports is harassment, on top of being useless). Not only is a couple months a pretty short time period to go between instances of behavior this poor, you didn't even play much, so that just shows that when you do play your behavior is often bad.\n\nYour behavior was negative according to Riot's policies, which you agreed to multiple times when you created an account, installed the game, and acknowledged your punishments. This is Riot's game, so they make the rules, and you broke those rules.\n\nFor the nth time (though not the last, I'm sure), you weren't banned because of one game. You frequently break the rules, and Riot decided to put a stop to it.\n\nAnd, also again, your refusal to accept the fact that your behavior was considered inappropriate according to the rules you agreed to and therefore your ban is justified is the entire reason that your account has been permanently banned. Riot realizes that you'd keep doing this if they keep letting you play, so they're not letting you play anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"NekoMahou","date":"2019-02-05T02:33:46.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I repeately told them to shut up because THEY WERE FLAMING and this is considered flame too?

Stop trying to believe that Riot is right, and start really thinking about things with your reasonable mind, If you have one.\n\nHow does some positive behavior validate the notion that the banning system is completely wrong? Your occasional positive behavior doesn't cancel out your frequent negative behavior. Riot told you to stop it and you didn't, and it's their game with their rules, so what they say goes. They said they would ban you if you kept acting out, and that's exactly what happened.\n\nThere's nothing to \"expose\" here. Your behavior is horrible and you got exactly what you deserve with lots of warnings. I don't care what other games do. This isn't other games. You're like a child who wears shoes at your dad's house even though you're not allowed and then, when your dad tells you to take off your shoes, you scream \"but MOM lets me wear shoes at her house!\" And then he tells you to follow the rules or he won't let you watch TV, and instead of following the rules you tell him about what your friends are allowed to do at their houses, and you remind him that you did your homework, but you still don't take off your shoes. So he takes away your TV privileges, and you throw a temper tantrum.\n\nThese are the rules. You broke them.

Thank you very much :) \n\nWhen you'll face people who will  threaten to kill you and your family, or wishes the worst, you will understand that \"Hey, maybe that guy who only said \"learn to play\" doesn't really deserve to get permabanned, or else what would they do to punish this people and make a difference?\" and the fact that you think that me and those people are comparable is exact the reason why this community and Riot's banning system should be exposed.\n\nAnd, I'll repeat myself once again, I play Overwatch, Battlerite, Heroes of the Storm, Dota2 and I could keep going and NEVER had one single sanction about my \"negative\" behaviour. Only this should really make you understand that something is wrong in here. Stop trying to believe that Riot is right, and start really thinking about things with your reasonable mind, If you have one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NekoMahou","date":"2019-02-09T17:37:56.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Literally saying \"You got permabanned because you asked your teammate to report a player who flamed, intentionally fed, and afk.\" literally saying that I, the victim, should've got punished for asking some justice.
