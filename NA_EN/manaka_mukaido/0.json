I just think it&#039;s lame when you put up your best performance don&#039;t feed a single kill and hardcarry your adc keep chilling people out saying we got this. just to have him honor his 0/9 premade :(","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-07-11T16:09:13.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for being an honorable player! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nLooking at the bright side: your team won, I'm assuming there was a full team voting bonus (otherwise it's possible that some of those premades just didn't vote) and it sounded like a pretty decent experience.

What goes around comes around... but not necessarily immediately.\n\nWhile it is wonderful to win a game rather than lose one, it is rather disheartening to receive absolutely no honor from carrying a game and being a positive player because each teammate can honor only one person. I recently had a game where things were looking bleak to start with a 0-6 lead on the enemy team, but I did not rage, I did not even speak I simply pinged mias, objectives, and proceeded to carry my team through superior shotcalling and asskickery. I ended the game 14-1-7, most gold earned, most cs, obviously the hard carry of the team. I honored our ADC who definitely helped me out with the workload. However, I did not receive a single honor at all from my team even though there was an honor bonus for everyone on the team voting to honor someone. This hurt me as a player personally, as I felt it rude and just downright wrong to not have my work recognized. So yes, we won the game, but I lost in the end because of a system that does not let a team show credit to more than one player at a time.","replies":[{"poster":"HexaDecimel","date":"2017-07-12T14:26:51.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the real world, where half the good stuff you do will likely go unnoticed by most people.

They probably don't care if it cost them less or no honor. People did that in the old system so old habits die hard!","replies":[]}]}]}
