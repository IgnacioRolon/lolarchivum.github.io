And as support I have to lane with some racist and just be quiet about it? It's not even ranked. Its not as if we're worried about our elo, and yet the attitude is stfu and be nice to the racist. \n\nAnd on top of it all, I have to submit this ticket to a tribunal I can't trust will ever punish him? Great. Just a great game Riot. This might be my last time playing.\n\nEdit: Genius. At least the forum robot knows how to treat racial slurs.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T02:52:18.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that's definitely not acceptable behavior for *sure* and nobody would want you to have to accept that as normal. At the end of the game, I hope you were able and remembered to report him officially so that we have the game ID and logs to take action on. Submitting those reports in the best and quickest way to make sure something happens. \n\nSide-Note: Tribunal isn't around any longer, and the best way to make sure people like that are caught is to use the post-game reporting tool which saves the game and chat logs with the report.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-06T08:23:00.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just popping in here since I saw your edit and I don't know if the support poros will:\n\nThere's no robots on the forum - Broporo is certainly a real person. Furthermore, Riot certainly takes an extremely hard line against this sort of behavior, and as Broporo said, it's punished upon detection with an end-game report, and almost always with an instant 14 day suspension of the account. Keep in mind you may not get any notification or knowledge of their punishment, but that doesn't mean the system ignored your report.","replies":[]}]}
