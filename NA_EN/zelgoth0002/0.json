If you don&#039;t like it please give me a reason, and not just a down vote.  Thank you for reading!\n\nMaddox, the Hippo is a Juggernaut that deals and steals crit damage.\n\nPassive: Thick Hide: \nAfter being Critically hit, Hippo returns 20% of all incoming damage(before resists) to attackers for 5 seconds.  Also, while this passive is active, Hippo can not be critically hit.\n\nQ: Hunger: \nHippo hits is target dealing physical damage, and healing for 5% of his max health.\n\nW: Beasts Rage: \nPassive: Hippo gains 1% attack speed for every 50 bonus health.\nActive: Hippo loses his bonus attack speed to deal 10% of the targets missing health as physical damage.\n\nE: Give and Take:\nPassive: Each hit on Hippo reduces enemies as by 5% for 3 seconds (stacking 4 times)\nActive: Stacks of Give and Take are removed to steal 3% move speed per stack.\n\nR: Muddy Body Slam: \nHippo dashes a short distance and deals 5% of his current health as physical damage, steals 20% crit. chance from each for 5 seconds, and knocks up all enemies hit.  (ex. If the enemy has 80% crit. chance, he would lose 16% leaving him with 64%. Hippo would gain 16% crit. chance.  If 5 champions with 100% crit are hit, Hippo gains 100% crit)\n\nHippo is a Health Juggernaut that does damage based on his health and the Crit chance of the enemy.  He would be a good counter to the ADC heavy meta we have now.\n\nBuild with Juggernaut Items and a thorn mail to be op.\n\nThank you for reading again!!  please leave any suggestions and up-vote if you like it!\n\nEdit:\nChanged name to Maddox, the hippo.\nNew E","replies":[{"poster":"Borkahn","date":"2016-03-21T20:27:26.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You basically just took {{champion:98}} and {{champion:33}} kit and made a love child.\n\nNot really that original. Forcing a Taunt and reflecting damage....dealing % health damage and 10% at that with just one hit. healing 5% of the health is alot. His ult is way too overpowered considering many champs focus on the crit chance to even remain viable. This \"adc\" meta isn't even really that strong. I'll take Darius and Rammus on one side against your two adc comp and it's gg. Or Shen and Rammus and your adcs won't mean a thing. \n\nTL;DR \nKit unoriginal in most aspects, adc meta isn't even that strong or the main problem","replies":[{"poster":"Zelgoth0002","date":"2016-03-21T20:37:54.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your input.
