I used it a lot before NCS came out.\r\n\r\n  The first problem that I can see now is a little one:  Since charts and graphs were removed, you no longer need to have a filter option list.  In other words, the champion list at the bottom of the menu that is labeled &quot;Filter By Champion&quot; is no longer accurate since you can only look at one champions stats at a time.  This could be really confusing to new players that have never seen the old &quot;See More Stats&quot; menu, and suggests more functionality then there really is.  \r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like Riot to bring back the graphs and charts page, but seeing as it was removed before &quot;See More Stats&quot; even started to work again(Riot only explained the removal as a &quot;rip graphs and charts&quot; comment in patch notes), that may not be practical.  My suggestion is that the text should be changed from &quot;Filter By Champion&quot; to something less misleading like &quot;Champion List&quot;, and the &quot;Clear Filter&quot; button can be removed all together.\r\n\r\nMy second problem is just something that bugs me.  I have over 100 games on Nasus{{champion:75}}  and can no longer see how much overall Damage, or Physical Damage I have done.  It just doesn&#039;t fit in the box.  Self scaling fonts?  Do not really know how riot would fix that one.  Not sure how comment this problem is, since I do not have it with any other champion, plus its not really that important to know I just like to know things.\r\n\r\nTLDR: My suggestion is that the text on the bottom box in the &quot;See More Champion&quot; menu should be changed from &quot;Filter By Champion&quot; to something less misleading like &quot;Champion List&quot;, and the &quot;Clear Filter&quot; button can be removed all together (since it does nothing now).","replies":[]}
