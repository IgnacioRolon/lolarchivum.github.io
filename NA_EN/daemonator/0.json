It's not something that's formally plotted out using numbers or a formula though. Trying to assign a numeric value to hard to compare effects is much more likely to mislead than help (e.g. how many points of power do you assign to a vision reduction effect, as opposed to a 25 unit range increase? Easy to estimate some numbers, extremely hard to have a sufficient level of confidence in them). \n\nDiscussion of power budget instead focuses on intended areas of strength and weakness (e.g. Braum has strong defensive windows, but brings less kill power than harder engage supports like Leona). Once that conceptual framework has been established it gets tested and, once validated, numbers then get tested and balanced. For the exact numbers other abilities can be useful reference points (e.g. X damage is a good starting point for a point and click nuke, Y range is appropriate if you want X sort of playstyle).","replies":[{"poster":"Daemonator","date":"2014-04-23T01:14:41.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, if I am not mistaken, that is why hard CC abilities such as Morgana's Dark Binding will cost more(50~90) or have a longer cooldown(11 seconds) when compared to soft CC abilities such as Talons Cutthroat which is on a 10 second cooldown. \n\nBased on what you told me her E should be on a **much** longer cooldown or at least cost **much** more mana in the early levels than it does. I mean I love playing Sejuani but this has been bugging me for a while now. When I look at Permafrost and compare it to both Wither and The Box I notice that all three have the same concept to them:\n\n**Slow and don't let the opponent get away.**\n\nThough they are similar I can't help but notice that Sejuani's appears to be **much more** efficient than the other two. If you desire, I can get into further detail about this as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-04-23T04:41:07.629+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"More powerful abilities will usually have higher trade offs certainly. In Dark Binding's case one of the biggest trade offs for the power of the root is the missile speed for example - at 1200 units/second it's slower than most missiles in the game. Overall though we're much more focused on how champions as a whole compare, not individual abilities. Having mobility or reliable hard CC elsewhere on the kit for example has substantial implications for what sort of functionality can be attached to a specific ability. \n\nLooking at the Sejuani E example you discuss yup, Permafrost's potentially a very powerful spell and has a low cost. On the other hand it's also got a lower application range than Wither and doesn't slow attack speed. Sejuani also doesn't have the inherent sustain, or late game single target damage, that Nasus can bring. She also plays a different role to Nasus (initiator tank versus heavy fighter) and so needs to have different strengths and weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"ICantNameMe","date":"2014-04-23T14:18:05.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> In Dark Binding's case one of the biggest trade offs for the power of the root is the missile speed for example - at 1200 units/second it's slower than most missiles in the game. \n\nIt might be slower, but it also has double the hitbox width of any other skillshot in the game.

Ezreal's ult on the other hand is 160 and one of the widest.\n\nI certainly agree there are a couple of ways Morg discourages interaction (easy W farming and Black Shield versus some laners/junglers), Dark Binding's missile however isn't one of those to me though.","replies":[{"poster":"Fomorian27","date":"2014-04-24T00:04:39.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what he might have meant is that it's got one of the most deceptive hitboxes, since the particles don't really match the hitbox that well.","replies":[{"poster":"Risotadazo","date":"2014-04-24T00:20:46.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.
