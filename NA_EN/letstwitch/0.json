Where if even two different people in a lobby feel like _\"This match is going to be a dumpster fire, I need to get out\"_, they can hit it, and the match is canceled. Give it charges similar to champion rerolls in ARAM so people only use it when they really need to. Put a short delay on getting back into matchmaking, so it doesn't mess anything up in that regard. And have it auto-log the chat from the lobby for review when activated, to fascilitate stopping the toxicity.\n\nOr come up with something else if you prefer. But at the very least, we need to know this is on your radar, and that you're actually going to attempt to do something about it, because as I will reiterate - the way things work right now is completely unacceptable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-07-24T10:29:16.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Gxa3BzIh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-07T01:45:58.818+0000)\n>\n> You shouldn&#x27;t have gotten a 30 min LPQ just for leaving that one match.

I was wondering if it could detect the error message coming up in the client and reduce dodge timers based on that.","replies":[]}]}]}
