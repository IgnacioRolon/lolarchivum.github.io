Carry on.\r\n\r\nRecently I&#039;ve taken a break from my usual Ahri-main life, and started playing Ekko. Same Masteries, same lane, same Summoner Spells, and similar builds (not identical). I&#039;ve found that Ekko is kind of like Ahri in many ways, but better overall. Here are some similarities that I&#039;ve found between the two:\r\n\r\n1. Ekko&#039;s Timewinder is practically the same as Ahri&#039;s Orb of Deception, but with a slow, although it has slightly more range, and it has far better AP scaling on the way back.\r\n2. Both champions have a dash of some sort, and they tend to do the same amount of damage with it, but Ekko&#039;s is on a lower cooldown.\r\n3. They both have a form of hard CC, but Ekko&#039;s gives him a massive shield and is AoE, rather than a single-target skillshot, along with an extra passive. Also, the stun on Ekko&#039;s Parallel Convergence is longer until Ahri maxes her last rank on Charm at level 18.\r\n4. Ekko has better ability synergy.\r\n5. Ekko can be way more fun a lot of the time.\r\n6. Ahri doesn&#039;t carry nearly as well as Ekko does. I&#039;ve lost games with 25 stacks on Mejai&#039;s Soulstealer.\r\n7. Ekko&#039;s ultimate ability is stronger and has more of an impact on teamfights due to the massive damage and heal he gets, along with invulnerability for a moment.\r\n8. Ekko has more of a synergy with his items that he buys. Lich Bane is a perfect item for him due to the mana, Spellblade passive, AP, and movement speed, while there&#039;s no real equivalent for Ahri.\r\n9. Overall, the spell costs for Ekko are lower and more reasonable.\r\n10. The passive on Ekko makes even basic attacks do a lot of damage. You&#039;re always gonna be doing tons of damage, even if your spells are on cooldown.\r\n11. Ekko gains magic resist per level, while Ahri doesn&#039;t. Also, he has a higher health stat overall, has higher attack damage, and gains a higher attack speed eventually, which matters because of #10.\r\n12. For new players, it&#039;s easier to last-hit as Ekko.\r\n\r\nOf course, that doesn&#039;t mean Ahri doesn&#039;t have some things going for her over Ekko. Here are some things that Ahri has that Ekko doesn&#039;t do as well.\r\n1. Ahri has more sustain due to her passive ability healing her. Yes, Ekko has his ultimate, but Ahri is more reliable in her healing potential, while Chronobreak is more of an in-combat source for tons of damage and a quick uh-oh button for when you&#039;re losing health.\r\n2. Ahri has true damage from the second hit of Orb of Deception, and it gives her movement speed for kiting and running away.\r\n3. Ahri generally stays farther on the back lines of teamfights, so she&#039;ll take less damage overall.\r\n4. Ahri has higher armor stat growth per level, but it usually won&#039;t make too much of a difference.\r\n5. Ahri is better at kiting.\r\n\r\nAnyways, another thing to consider is that personally, I have a much higher winrate as Ekko, despite being an Ahri main with way higher mastery points on Ahri. I also have gotten far more S&#039;s than I would&#039;ve gotten in that same time with Ahri. So far, I have only lost 2 games as Ekko. Of course, I&#039;m only one person, and I&#039;m no master at the game, so I can&#039;t make too many reliable statements about him. Take this section with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nYes, I do know that Ahri currently has a higher winrate by ~3% and is overall doing better than Ekko right now, but you must consider that Assasins tend to have the lowest winrate overall. All things considered, Ekko is in a good place right now. Also, this is post is also about the similarities between Ahri and Ekko, and the thematic similarities between them causing a conflict in their abilities.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I have a few suggestions for a rework to make Ekko and Ahri different in playstyle, and overall better. Overall, Ahri&#039;s abilities are much more linear than Ekko&#039;s, so I think some changes need to be made for the synergy that Ekko has.\r\n1. One of Ahri&#039;s biggest unique identities is her spell vamp included in her kit. Her Foxfire is somewhat underwhelming in its effects, and it is really just a source of damage in her kit. Instead of what we have now, I suggest making her Foxfire a skillshot, but also have it heal her for a portion of the damage dealt. This makes sense, because she is a **soul eater,** after all, so more spell vamp is the logical choice. It would add to her consistency between her lore and ability set, too. When I say making Foxfire a skillshot, I mean making it similar to Taliyah&#039;s ability on q.\r\n2. Although this change is odd, I think swapping Charm and Spirit Rush as abilities may also work, making Charm the ultimate ability and Spirit Rush the ability on e. I know that it&#039;s odd, but it may work with changes made to both of the abilities, of course. Buffing Charm&#039;s damage or making it an AoE spell, while giving Spirit Rush only one dash and slightly nerfing the damage on it is my best suggestion.\r\n\r\nAnyways, this has been an incredibly long post, so I&#039;ll call this the end of it for now. It&#039;s been nice, but I&#039;m getting hungry for lunch! If I have anything to add to this post later, I&#039;ll be sure to change it! Feel free to express your own opinions in the comments, but make sure to be kind and courteous!\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2016-12-03T19:43:30.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I'll agree they both have similar skills, their execution is a lot different. There's not much I can say on Ekko as I've only played him a couple of times, but I would say he's more effective in teamfights than straight up killing a target by needing the 3 stacks for extra damage. Meanwhile, Ahri is able to go in, burst a target, and get out of a fight before it even breaks out. \n\nAs for her being on the backlines, I can guarantee that I'm usually in front of the fight to deal the damage and try and divert attention away from our slightly squishier carry.\n\nOne other thing I want to point out\n\n> 2.

Buffing Charm's damage or making it an AoE spell, while giving Spirit Rush only one dash and slightly nerfing the damage on it is my best suggestion.\n\nI can guarantee that would make her so extremely overpowered and would have her nerfed into the ground. She is an effective assassin, she's a decent mage, her mobility is the determining factor in the fights. If you allow her to get into the back line, she will get a kill where as Ekko is more reliant on waiting for the target to be low or previously CC'd to get his abilities off.\n\n~ From a 300k Lv 7 Ahri main.","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2016-12-03T21:53:50.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Level 6 Ekko**\nhe's super dangerous to teamfight with since he usually dies really fast without ult, yeah people say he just goes to the back line kills the adc and ults away but i guarantee you that's **NOT** how it works, you usually have to wait for someone to tank before fighting and even then you usually ult away from all the damage you'll take, he's not like Ahri where like you said she can burst someone before the fight starts because he's melee (aside from his Q but it won't kill someone alone) he works so much better in 1 v 1 or even 2 v 1 scenarios \n\nas for your claim about the enemy having to be low for a kill, he's actually really strong unless you really fall behind early game, once you have {{item:3100}} you E to them, auto, Q, auto and if they're squishy, half their health is gone and you auto them to death, he's a really good champion and doesn't rely on his teammates for a kill, which is why almost any good ekko usually dominates lane","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2016-12-04T02:38:16.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just speaking from experience and I have seen a fair amount of good Ekkos, it's hard to find where it is when they go from \"okay he's not doing much\" to \"OMG WHAT IS THIS DAMAGE???\" I try to analyze champions, their abilities, cooldowns, counters, etc. He's one of the few where I never got a good grasp on ability wise.\n\nI'll agree to the 1v1 scenarios where he shines most which is the first thing I usually notice.

Keep in mind that for the part that's entirely my own personal experience, I told you to take it with a grain of salt, a phrase meaning \"not taking it as the truth because it's subjective.\" Of course, their Q's are practically identical, and they both have a dash and crowd control. There's more than one difference, unlike your Ashe-Jinx comparison. Just because not everything about them is similar doesn't mean they have different playstyles, just like not all champions from a similar lane have similar playstyles.","replies":[{"poster":"Zen Ineth","date":"2016-12-03T19:19:28.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except even \"taking it with a grain of salt\" doesn't justify saying a melee AP bruiser is identical to an AP assassin. Ahri's Q does True Damage on the way back and has similar travel time. Ekko's Q widens at the apex, has a faster return time, and does only AP damage. The only \"practically identical\" thing about them is that they're returning skillshots, so you might as well say \"Ahri deserve a rework because Sivir's Q also returns\". \n\nEkko has a dash+blink, and is only good for engaging, unless you have enemy minions nearby. Ahri has three dashes that can be used in any situation. Not a lot of similarity there. \n\nThere's nothing in your post to suggest that they have similar playstyles at all, and even less to say that Ahri deserve a rework because of it.
