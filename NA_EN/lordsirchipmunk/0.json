I'm not sure as to how you find the exact thing that says that you have or haven't gotten the chest for this season with that particular champion. however, I know that when you hover over the champions, it shows a chest that's either bronze or silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-07-18T01:11:30.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two ways.\n\n1.) Hovering over their icon and seeing a bronze chest means you have gotten a chest with them.\n\n2.) There is a special golden border around a champion's icon if you have gotten a chest with them.","replies":[{"poster":"LordSirChipmunk","date":"2016-07-18T18:24:18.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot!

I believe that a more in-depth guide would help with the more complex ins-and-outs of the crafting system, especially because it isn't a year old yet, which may help new players, and people that are trying to figure out certain parts of the crafting system. As an example, there is nothing specifically stating that hovering over your champions on the champion screen of the summoner profile will show a chest indicative of your eligibility for a chest; it's rather vague in my opinion.\nThanks a lot,\nLordSirChipmunk","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skyzline","date":"2017-09-17T17:05:51.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what happens if you get all your league champions a chest?","replies":[]}]}
