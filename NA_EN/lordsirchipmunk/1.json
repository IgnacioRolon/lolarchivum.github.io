My friend created a normal unranked game, with a full party of people, myself included. At the end of the game, which we won, a third person in the group got an S or an S- or something like that. My friend obtained a Hextech Chest, and I didn't. I have never been punished by the Tribunal other than a couple of minor AFK penalties from a while before that, and I had the potential to get a chest; I have only opened a few since their release, and I play somewhat frequently. Does anyone know why this is happening? I haven't found any reason as to why I shouldn't have gotten the chest, and I have looked all over this website on Hextech Crafting.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T15:44:47.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zombiemaster provided some great information that I hope it was able to help!  One of the most common occurrences for not receiving a chest is indeed already earning it for that champion per season.  Another is that the champion must be owned to receive a chest.  Without knowing the champion you were playing, I'm guessing this may have been one of the reasons.  Hope that helps, and best of luck in your next games!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-07-16T01:26:18.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want more information, you can read [this FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide). There is a section explaining why you might not be earning chests.\n\nMy guess for why you didn't earn a chest in this situation is that you were playing a champion that you have already earned a chest for. You can only earn one chest per champion per season, so if you are playing a champion that you have already earned a chest for, then you will not earn another chest while playing as that champion, even if someone in your premade party gets an S grade.","replies":[{"poster":"LordSirChipmunk","date":"2016-07-16T01:34:41.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to know. Thank you very much for the help! As I said, it was a long time ago, so I don't know, but it's good to be aware of things like this for the future. Again, thank you very much.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
