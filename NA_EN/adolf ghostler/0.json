I was also inside the game. I don't know what happend but the entire enemy team was hacking. I'm talking Infinite health. gold, buy/sell anywhere, it was bad. One of them was even able to change their character in the middle of the fight so that there was {{champion:222}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:62}} on the team and I don't remember the 5th. Anyway, I was pissed. I go out of the game over to where the other players are grab one of the wukongs (some cubby little 14 yr old) and beat the shit out of him, I was okay with the others becuase they were just playing around and were sorry, but this litter shit was disrespecting me in my own home, so beat him up and kicked him out. Ended with me making out with the jinx player who was actually Jinx, not like in game jinx, I'm talking like 4k high quality get jinxed music video jinx. All in all pretty good. 9 out of 11 would do again.","replies":[]}
