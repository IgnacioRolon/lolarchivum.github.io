Not to mention that I would be banned 5 times over before even ending this post if it were on reddit since their moderation is borderline fashistic with their censorship. \n\n>b-but reddit has culture~!\nculture of circlejerk and esports fanatizm. I'd take negative circlejerk that actually improves the game of boards over the shit that goes on reddit any day.\n\nIn the end, i believe that Riot should just focus more of their attention to boards as a way of improving/strengthening their relation with the community. I see no point in doing amas on reddit or introducing pbe changes on fucking twitter. I do see a positive change from Riot in that regard but its clearly not enough. \n\nYou literally made your own reddit with the boards. \nPlease just use them.","replies":[]}
