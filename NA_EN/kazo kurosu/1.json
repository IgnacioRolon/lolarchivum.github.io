The system practiced for years now is champions that get developed or reworked dictate the type of regional LU. So you need that Yordle conduit to drive the release of Bandle City content, and that relies on the producers of champions to pick up a Yordle character in the first place.

Nunu and Willump operate as a single unit and give us some insight on the ancient yetis and how important they were for freezing the Watchers under the Howling Abyss. Lissandra got updated but a lot of it is a history lesson and in the modern day she kinda stays north of most of the other Frejlord characters and secretly looks for ways to stop the Watchers from returning. Ornn is another history lesson, and is just barely coming back out into the world so he hasn't had much of an effect on people. Brand's lore just shows how hard life is outside of the major factions of Frejlord. \n\nThere's been lots of Frejlord lore, but the ground level heroes like Ashe, Sejuani, Tryndamere, etc. still really need an update. Frejlord has one of the best historical records in the game (outside of maybe Shurima) but present day is still relatively unknown.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-10-20T16:50:56.961+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No sense updating it  until the  development team  considers Morde a champion again","replies":[]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2018-10-21T16:56:06.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you mean?
