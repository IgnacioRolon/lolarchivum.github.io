Otherwise, they would get out pushed, out farmed, and bullied out of lane. Similar problem with Jungle, they need to keep up with their counterparts, or they will get out leveled. So the only Tank who doesn't actually care about damage is the support tank. (And as a support main, I really don't want to be obligated to playing the teams tank.) \n\nI think the real trick though, is to shape Tank's damage into AoE, so that they are not doing a ton of damage to a single Target. (But it could mean that they deal a lot of Total damage in the end game stats) You could also use a Damage amp against minions, to insure that Tank damage isn't oppressive against champions. \n\nBut regardless, Glass cannons are Glass cannons. If you don't build any defenses, and your opponent doesn't build any offenses. The enemy tank's damage is going to be comparable at all stages of the game. (Notable changes though, would be increased damage in abilities as they level)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volibear Boss","date":"2017-04-29T04:45:41.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would think so too, but then the 5 items ADC/yasuo/yi/fiora comes and kills my tank in 3 seconds while he literally cant damage him duo to his lifesteal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2017-04-28T19:52:43.694+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nice try im pretty sure any logical people complains about the ways they die.
