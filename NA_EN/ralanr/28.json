Actually, that touches on part of the central issue. I want to be a support, not a servant. I want to make my team better, which is empowering. Making my team better says that I'm making things happen, I'm improving my team, I'm acting - I'm a force multiplier. I don't want to simply serve their needs, which is disempowering. That says I have no value outside of the needs of my team, that my role is whatever my team's whims say it should be, that I alone cannot decide my fate - I do not carry. Mind, as it stands, a good support can carry a decent team, but unless I play a damage support, my options for straight-up hard carrying a bad team are limited to nonexistent. Part of that is the force multiplier issue (multiplying a small number is not all that helpful), but it sets a bad precedent overall. I believe we need a serious conversation about how to make support a role that is less exclusively team-reliant without either damaging our position as a team-focused role or making us absurdly overpowered.\n\nSupport, as a position, needs more volition, more resources, and more influence on a losing game. Support, as a role, needs to be powerful enough that having mages come down and steal those resources to be another damage carry is not a universally superior option, though I am _not_ opposed to it being an option at all. Flexible meta is good! I want to see supports mid and top! I want to see mages bot and support! But everything has to be balanced on even resources for that to be viable. Otherwise, you'll either have the mid/top supports abusing the extra gold to become late-game supports in the mid-game, or you'll have support as a role becoming not useful at all in the face of an increasingly damage-oriented meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-05-25T17:39:10.561+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this. What defines a support isn't their access to Sightstone, or their proximity to the marksman, or their separation from the game's typical progression systems, it's their ability to completely alter the flow of a fight, saving allies from impossible situations and setting up enemies for easy kills. Having the power of life and death over your own team should warrant respect and authority in and of itself, yet that cannot come properly to the forefront while supports are constrained to a limited and boring set of strategic options, one that forces them to be subservient to their teammates.\n\nIn every class-based game, supports tend to be the least popular class, because most players want to deal tons of damage independently and rack up lots of kills. The right move should have been to compensate for this by giving supports the most love out of any class, and making sure they have as much freedom and enjoyment as they possibly can. Instead, supports in League are assigned burdens nobody else has to worry about, including rigid builds that are strictly enforced by their own allies, and limited choices on what they can do and where they can move relative to their team, and especially their marksman. It is no surprise that support is by far the least played role in the game, to the point where unpleasant systems like Autofill have to be implemented just to make sure queue times don't go way overboard. In turn, this makes supporting feel even more like a chore, since players who might have been interested in playing it might just not want to touch it willingly anymore, as they're sure to get forced into playing the role eventually.\n\nI completely agree that there needs to be more positional flexibility for supports, and 2v1 lane dynamics need to change so that being outnumbered in lane doesn't feel so horrendous. Many supports already synergize well with non-marksmen, several more could be made more flexible by having their kit disentangled from that class, and allowing supports to take up more positions could allow non-marksmen carries to shine (I'd argue that the only thing holding Karthus back right now is that he has no-one to assist him during his harsh laning phase, for example). While I do think it's important for supports to primarily contribute utility and CC in most cases, which naturally predisposes them to mainly synergize with allies, I agree that supports should be given a bit more independence, and I think it would be good for diversity to have supports in solo lanes or the jungle, provided they're healthy there. In fact, I'd totally support (heh) making the class part of the larger interchangeable pool of champions, so that it would be viable to have teams without any support, just as it would be viable to have teams with multiple supports. The same should apply to marksmen, but that's a matter for another discussion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2017-05-27T05:27:59.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they're doing it primarily because support is supposed to be a role, not a class.\n\nRight now they have top, mid, bot, jungle, and support as the 5 standard roles, because regardless of what class of champ you play, when you are your team's support you do certain things to help your allies that no other player on the team does.\n\nSupports as a class is a misnomer, because not all support class champions are bot lane supports, and not all bot lane supports are in the support class.\n\nBasically, Riot is clearing up this really awkward and annoying doubled meaning that support has had attached to it for years by giving subclasses that reflect how a champion plays, rather than what their specific job is in a team of 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-05-27T06:44:43.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's the thing, the support role is so named because its purpose is to support the marksman, whereas that of the support class is to support their team (and initially just the marksman too).

An important part of naming classes is that it's meant to set a strong fantasy, and establish a good enough image that future members of the class can be designed with that in mind (juggernauts are big, heavy-hitting and slow, for example, so in that respect it's a perfect name for the subclass). Because of this, \"Catcher\" isn't at all a good fit, because it's very obviously a term reverse-engineered from a disparate group of champions to attempt to put them all in the same box. It doesn't sell a strong fantasy, and looking at the members of the subclass, there are no consistent design rules to work with, not even when it comes to the \"catching\" part.\n\nBy contrast, \"support\" as a class name is both a strong fantasy (supports are very well-established in general gaming space) and an accurate descriptor of the class and what it's meant to do: all of the champions in that category are expressly meant to work with their allies, and operate by protecting or empowering their allies, and rendering enemies weaker or vulnerable. It's not a direction Riot's really trying to move away from, so it would be better to start with that name and see how the support class can improve over time.\n\nBy contrast, the only reason we have a support position is because of an extremely rigid positional meta. Out of practically every MOBA, League is unique in how limited its compositions are: Dota, an older franchise with very well-defined laning (to the point where some games are one big laning phase), has tremendous positional diversity, including 2-1-2 comps, 3-1-1 comps, the more easily identifiable 2-1-1-1 comp, etc., and more leeway on where different heroes can go. On the other side of the spectrum, Heroes of the Storm, which doesn't have a particularly strongly-defined laning phase, allows any character to basically roam from one lane to the other from the very start, and has no serious restrictions on which champion can go where. In these games, a framework such as League's Team Builder's would make absolutely no sense, and neither would there be in designating a specific bot lane \"support\" role, because there is so much more positional fluidity and diversity that it would be impossible to tie a specific position to a class. Considering how pretty much ever other MOBA has achieved this diversity, to its significant benefit, this is something League itself needs to move towards by addressing its own problems, instead of going about the nomenclature issue backwards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-05-25T19:09:45.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh boy!
