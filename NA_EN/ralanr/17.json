So from what I can tell, Mt. Targon runs on [Clarke&#039;s third Law](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw) based on the observations of {{champion:136}} (namely that {{champion:80}}&#039;s spear is more advanced then we realize.  Still not very advanced to Sol).\r\n\r\nReading Taric&#039;s comic leads me to think that it&#039;s mainly magic, but again Targon seems to have this &quot;so ancient it must be magical&quot; technology vibe hidden within it due to the golden city at the top, the space faring empire, and Sol&#039;s crown.  Then we have Taric&#039;s climb, which is filled with ghosts.  Are these ghosts mechanical in nature, like some sort of program?  Or are they actual ghosts, showing that magic and supernatural elements have mixed in with the scientific ones.\r\n\r\nIt also makes me wonder how aspects are chosen.  Clearly there is some destiny to them (The aspects already knew who the next {{champion:80}} would be after Sol incinerated the last one) but how is this decided?  A machine or program that calculates birth rates?  Granted they still have to climb the damn mountain, but it is known that they will be aspects.  The call to climb the mountain could be a Geas beacon of sorts.\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts really.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-04-05T16:16:11.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When we here \"advanced civilisation\" we generally assume technologically advanced, but remember that the most technologically advanced civilisations on Runeterra also utilise magic to fuel that technology in the form of hextech. \n\nThe likelihood is that, given the fact that the Targonians don't exactly go around in spaceships and whatnot, is that they are highly advanced in magic solely, since there's not really a need for technology when you're a non physical entity like the Aspects are. I can see Mount Targon as sort of being a magical focus point on Runeterra that was altered by the Targonians so that they could manipulate the magical energies in and around Mount Targon to their benefit and access it from other parts of the cosmos. The Aspects exists outside of laws of time and physicality, so a distance of light years might only be a minor inconvenience, but every second counts when you're dealing with universe-invading void monsters. The star crown of Aurelion Sol, the armaments of the human Aspects and the architecture of the mountain are likely imbued with magic more so than being some sort of technological device. \n\nThere's probably a few Aspects specifically tasked with watching over Runeterra as it's seemingly a very important planet, and from their vantage point in the universe will watch for potential candidates and select those who arrive at a time of convenience or are just too good to pass up. The Targonians will likely be able to predict or just see disaster coming, so they likely can pre-empt the actual need for a human host by decades or more to battle a threat in the distant future. I'm imagining that Aurelion Sol's impending freedom and some issues among the Targonians beyond Runeterra are making the four we've seen for Runeterra panic a bit, so they've been prepping human Aspects in anticipation for some big issues on the horizon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-04-05T16:30:46.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Targon has some weird cosmic magic going on, do I haven't the foggiest idea what makes you think there's technology afoot.
