Champions like {{champion:80}} (who I main so I do bully a lot I suppose), {{champion:58}} {{champion:236}} and {{champion:122}} are what come to mind when I imagine a lane bully.  But it seems a lot of people (or perhaps just G&amp;B) hate fighting oppressive champions.  I&#039;ve heard a few times that even {{champion:80}} is toxic (personal opinion: He&#039;s not.  Am I biased?  Yes and if a Pantheon is constantly throwing spears at you then he&#039;s burning mana fast like a moron) because all his strategy is his heavy damage point and click Q ({{item:1029}} works well against that) his W (which is a one second stun in a game where there are worse) his E active (which deals double damage to champions but you can avoid it easier than {{champion:122}} Q) the passive (Hey, {{champion:238}} has something similar that starts at 50%) and his passive.  \r\n\r\nNow the answer with Pantheon is &quot;He falls off late game.&quot; but that&#039;s not what people seem to be asking for.  They don&#039;t want a sucky laning phase, which from what I understand is the sign of a good lane bully.  \r\n\r\nSo, are lane bullies healthy?

There are too many late game champions for too many roles to just ban them all out, so in a world where early game bullies didn't exist everyone would just pick as many late game champs as they could and play safely until they outscaled. The game would move much slower than it does now and would only really start 20 minutes in when the late game champs came online, and everyone who didn't get to have a late game champ would just have to suck it up because they wouldn't have the power necessary to shut down a passively farming hyper carry due to not being an early game powerhouse.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-10-14T15:43:02.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are absolutely healthy.

I would argue its necessary to buff lane bullies because of how dominate hyper carries are. If you let them reach late game, its literally game over for you in most case. It should be difficult to reach that point though in my opinion. I think mid-game becomes the mid ground between lane bullies and late game champions though, if you're doing well as a lane bully, then you'll be ok, but if you're doing well as a late game, you'll also be ok.
