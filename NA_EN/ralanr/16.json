Often times I&#039;d just die or get too aggressive and somehow lose Skaarl to minion damage. Then when I&#039;m off Skaarl, my opponent is never close enough for me to reliably gain courage or they come at me when I&#039;m very low (not to mention I suck at aiming his pistol. I swear it should do more damage than it does). \r\n\r\nI tend to run TLD for quick burst trades. Should I run fervor?  Any tips to how I can play him in lane?","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-01-19T16:22:23.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go ham. That's basically it. Don't be afraid of dismounting and know that once you go in, you're fully committed to the engagement. You E+Q to force a fight with your lane opponent, use your entire W passive on them, and then reassess the situation after it's done.\n\nYou tend to be very powerful at earlier levels because of the sheer amount of health you bring to bear, which incidentally makes Grasp an attractive option.\n\nWhen you inevitably dismount, look for an opportunity to go back in on your lane opponent, preferably when one of their abilities is down and your W is up. Your dismounted Q is best used to either harass your opponent at,  back away from them when they try to go in, or simply popped at point blank range to regain the full courage.\n\nOther things to note include that: Your farming is much, much stronger post-tiamat, so getting one early is a good thing. Putting early levels into W helps the tiamat farming and also allows for more frequent trades in lane. Fervor is the mastery for when you don't intend to back out after engaging, TLD is for when you don't want to fully commit against an opponent, and both Grasp and Warlord's serve the similar function of keeping you healthier. Your Q and W are pretty telegraphed, so Fiora messes you up with her W, Teemo blinds you through the duration of your W, and ranged top laners will give you a hard time.\n\nOther than knowing when to engage and what you shouldn't be trying to fight in the first place, the most important thing is to remember that Kled's kit is made to get you into fights and keep you there. Don't go against that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-01-19T16:26:14.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pistol is easy as fuck to aim, remember it goes through minions and you only need to clip them with it.

I guess you try the Ravenous Hydra and Triforce combo if you need more burst but I wouldn't recommend it. Also Fervor is just too good to pass up because your W gives you those 8 stacks so quickly.\n\nThat's all I've got. I'm not a Kled main at all though so take it with a grain of salt.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-01-19T16:26:20.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mallet is a trap option on Kled.
