Now just to be clear, I don&#039;t think she&#039;s broken (she has powerful damage, but its all pretty avoidable) but rather that she is weak when facing players with better understanding of positioning. \r\n\r\nBasically she can be outplayed, but I don&#039;t think she can outplay others. \r\n\r\nMy issues:\r\n1. She only seems to offer damage, but we have an entire class of champion (who are on the opposite side of the map) that are built around damage.\r\n2. Now she does a utility ability, but I can&#039;t see where you would want it over a Blitzcrank hook, a thresh hook, a Nautilus hook, or even an Ahri charm. Sure it can create a vessel, but that only really harms players or teammates who have poor positioning. \r\n\r\nBoth Garen and Darius at least offer something if they fall behind (Garen&#039;s villain mechanic and Darius&#039;s hook. Not the best example for Darius I know). But Illaoi&#039;s utility is built around the mistakes of others. Not her exploiting those mistakes, but their mistakes in general (getting a kill from half way across the map with no vison there is incredibly awkward for me). \r\n\r\nApparently her ult can slam tentacles from all over the map (not sure on this) and you can teleport to her tentacles. But they don&#039;t show up on the map so you have to search for them (course that&#039;s only a problem if you play camera lock). \r\n\r\nShe feels too feast or famine to me. Her damage is worthless if the enemy is competent enough to dodge it (and we&#039;ve all had moments when we&#039;ve made bad plays that could have been avoided. So this isn&#039;t an insult to you if you get hit once in a while). \r\n\r\nSo why not give her tentacles more benefits or interactions?  What about allowing her tentacles to act like wards?  Their danger would still be dependent on enemy competence, but it would give her some defining utility. \r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?  What problems do you see with Illaoi&#039;s kit and how would you interact with it?","replies":[{"poster":"CIockw0rk","date":"2016-01-03T18:38:34.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi offers great zone control and possible extended fight.

Most of Illaoi's actions ultimately succeed or fail based on the enemy's knowledge of how to play against her (at least, moreso than for most other champions). The vessel state means very little if the enemy plays correctly around it, you can prevent her from getting kills in lane with almost perfect reliability if you play around her correctly, and even her potential to win trades is reliant on the enemy being in range of the passive tentacles. Her teamfighting is also very easy to play around if your team has any disengage potential at all.\n\n> Its good with team who can choose where to fight and force them.\n\nIf she has really, really strong engage from multiple teammates that can be true, but in my experience that usually just ends up with the teammate engaging and Illaoi not having enough time to follow up, and she won't have passive tentacles even if she does. I actually think she's good in exactly the opposite kind of team. She wants to be on a team based around not picking fights, and she wants to be against an enemy team that has to engage. Basically, a siege comp against a heavily melee comp. That kind of team can actually make use of her extreme immobility, by having her be a damage and zone control threat that prevents easy carry dives.\n\nI don't think she's actually good even if she's on that kind of team, but at least it makes her \"not terrible\", and that's good enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-01-03T18:47:33.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CIockw0rk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RfNuRxVL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-03T18:38:34.407+0000)\n>\n> Illaoi offers great zone control and possible extended fight.

She can't go outplay people, but she can bait people into fighting her, and then make them realize they messed up as they die to a tentacle slapping them in the face. She's more of a reactive champ than a proactive one. \n\nIf someone good plays Illaoi, she literally won't lose lane ever, and can easily go on to carry the game. She's not super mechanically difficult, but she requires a ton of game knowledge, how champ kits work and how to exploit all that. She doesn't outplay you mechanically, she outplays you  in a grander sense.
