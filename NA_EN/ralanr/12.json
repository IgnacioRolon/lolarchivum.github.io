Someone with big ears and a zipline.  I know this isn&#039;t canon, but this could be a sneak preview of a new champion.  Have we ever gotten a preview of a new champ by seeing their alternate reality self first?\n\nEdit:  All right guys, it's clear I got too excited and jumped the gun on possible reveals.  Ever since {{champion:78}}'s lore update, I've bee dying to see some lore updates on the Yordles.
