Vastly different voiceover, visuals, gameplay, and even the lore is a bit different. The worst of all is that they didn't make any traditional skin.

And since most of our champs are \"yes, I'm a badass <something>\" (because who wants to be a not-bad-ass?), it's kind of a meaningless term. That's totally fair, and for what it's worth, I do think our approach to champs is more nuanced than \"guys! guys! let's make a badass!\". Maybe our messaging could do better at touching on WHY they're a badass though. \n\nAnd now that I've used the word badass to death, on to the rest of your post:\n\nThis is awesome and super helpful, and I agree with the general point you're making. Looking back to Lissandra, the ones that I'd say stand out as \"bringing themselves to the roster\" are:\n\n{{champion:236}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:245}} (so 3 of the last 15)\n\n{{champion:201}} is kind of halfway between man and myth in my eyes, but probably doesn't count here.\n\nThe rest seem to be important either because of something that happened to them ({{champion:157}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:268}}) or because of their otherworldly/demi-godlike powers ({{champion:266}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:161}}), or simply by existing ({{champion:150}} {{champion:421}}). And then of course, we have our \"year of the myth\" champs.\n\nSo yeah, probably more of a balance that we can strike here. I really appreciate you linking to examples - that was really helpful. To help me get an even better understanding, which of the following would you consider a _champion_ as opposed to a _legend_ (and why)?\n\n{{champion:238}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-10-21T23:56:35.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the difference between a champion and a legend in Riot's eyes?

But at the same time he's still rooted in the \"real\" world of Runeterra, rather than the mythical/ethereal realms of Bard and Tammy Kench and suchlike.

Champions get their title by natural aptitude and/or good training.\n\nThose who are the closest to champions are Darius and Twisted Fate. Both have great aptitudes they trained and have recognition, but they are not destined to a particular, extraordinary life and don't have stories about them.\n\nLegends are one-of-a-kind and write history, champions are the best among \"ordinary\" people but are known in the present only and can be overshadowed by a better champion.\n\nLegends are known for what they are and/or what they did, while champions are known for their potential. Malzahar is THE void prophet, Nami is THE tidecaller, Aang is THE Avatar (well, the one that ended the hundred-year war). Darius is a great general but unless he realizes such a change in Noxus that it revolutionizes the whole Empire for an extended duration, he won't become a legend.

He has transcended those origins both metaphorically and literally; metaphorically, in the sense that he's become memorialized as the epitome of everything a Noxian warrior can and should be, and literally in the sense that he's been brought back as a towering colossus that wrecks entire armies.
