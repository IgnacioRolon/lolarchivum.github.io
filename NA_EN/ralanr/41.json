As someone who is on the boards a lot (seriously, I am), this is quite the accomplishment.  These are some really good ninja posts.\r\n\r\nOr they just aren&#039;t happening and people who are salty against tanks just have a free target for them to harass.  &quot;The board is mostly made of tank mains, lul&quot; and reddit won&#039;t shut up from ADC mains.  Your point?  There is bias everywhere, though this place is more likely to get a shitstorm started because people will actually talk and complain about gameplay.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s my view on the tank class from a tank main.\r\n\r\n-Tanks are not weak.  Lethality is annoying, but it&#039;s barely anything to an armor stacker until the adc gets {{item:3035}} and/or {{item:3071}}.  {{item:3071}} is being reworked on the PBE however and we are getting a defensive itemization update.  So any tank mains that may actually be complaining about how tanks are weak right now, **Shut up and wait for the goddamn update**.  If you have questions on the update, then I&#039;m sure Riot can answer them.  \r\n\r\nOverall, tanks are in a rather fine state (outside of {{champion:57}} who is getting nerfed on the PBE).  \r\n\r\n-Lethality is a problem right now.  But it&#039;s mainly for the squishy characters since it gives champions a huge powerboost (and gives ADC&#039;s that can use it a good early without really falling off.  Someone once told me that ADC&#039;s are balanced around each other rather than everyone else.  If that&#039;s more or less true, that should stop so we can actually have an ADC lane bully that falls off and allows for other carry roles.  Like carry tops, junglers, mids, and even supports).  \r\n\r\n-AD is kinda getting dumb.  Mainly because of all these penetration items working with AD.  So AP champions are getting royally screwed over a bit.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion on the matter.  I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get downvoted by the two haters who keep busting tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-20T05:39:15.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cant say i've seen any \"tanks are weak\" post.\n\nWhat are these so called weak tanks they speak of?
