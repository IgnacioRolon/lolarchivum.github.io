I guess that&#039;s obvious.\n\nI ask this because some older skins don&#039;t seem to fit the theme that newer skins of similar names fall under. \n\nLet&#039;s take Forsaken Olaf and Forsaken Jayce. Jayce looks like a Sith Lord with a hammer. Olaf on the other hand just looks like Olaf with a recolor. \n\nEdit: Pictures for reference.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZ21FGdBOw4/hqdefault.jpg\n\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/d2/Olaf_ForsakenSkin_Ch.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/613/height/460?cb=20110223135617\n\nThen we have the Vandal skin line, where Brand, Twitch, Vlad, and Gragas look like modern bikers while Jax is in blue. \n\nEdit: Pictures for reference.\n\nhttp://www.leagueoflegendsskins.com/images/champions/splash/Jax_2.jpg\n\nhttp://pm1.narvii.com/5780/532d6e6c1b0d71ba71ec44d16f2d921e7828ac27_hq.jpg\n\nI&#039;m sure there are other examples I could give, but I can&#039;t think of them at the moment. \n\nSo have you ever considered renaming a skin to make it fit or because it doesn&#039;t fit in a current skin line?\n\nEdit: Shen's rework is actually a great time to try this out.  \n\nCheck out frozen Shen: \nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZHvmmwWcAA3bCK.jpg\n\nThen check out Frostblade Irelia:\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/HAoBCFfQ2Xk/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nNow granted the main common factors between these two are ice themes, but that doesn't mean they can't both be in the same skin line ({{champion:59}} and {{champion:67}} are a part of the dragonslayer line despite their skins not looking similar to {{champion:201}} and {{champion:80}} in terms of color after all).  \n\nAnd since Shen is fighting Zed in this splash art, you could have the shockblade skin line be rivals to the frost blade skin line.  Sort of like the Marauders and Wardens or Dragonslayers vs Dragon Tamers.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2Q-Pn1jZvM/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nIce vs Lighting!  Two forces of the storm clashing in a hurricane of strife.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-01-20T09:05:22.491+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually yes, I bring it up on the team from time to time.

As people in this thread are mentioning, the most important thing is to retain the core fantasy of the skin that players like. With recolours this is very vague so there's probably more space to do something fresh, while something like Full Metal Pantheon has a clearer established theme.
