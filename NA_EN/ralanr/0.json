At least not in a good way. \r\n\r\nA character should be defined by their actions and personality more than their race. Race can be used as a good tool, but it isn&#039;t something that you can use to fully support a great character. \r\n\r\nAhri and Nidalee being Vastaya (and I don&#039;t believe Nid is one but whatever) actually gives the writers more room to make them unique. Rather than just making Nidalee &quot;magical for no reason Tarzan&quot; or Ahri &quot;generic fox girl number 1642&quot; \r\n\r\nDid they have unique traits before?  Yeah (at least Ahri did), traits that people seem to ignore. Ahri&#039;s character arc is about the struggle to become more human in both body and spirit. She was a monster that wanted to be human, something that we don&#039;t really see in other &quot;monster&quot; champions. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m probably going off on a rant here, point being that being in the same racial group doesn&#039;t stop a character from being &quot;special&quot; and being &quot;special&quot; because you&#039;re the only one is a poor character concept (something that teenage anime fans have to learn eventually. We all do). \r\n\r\nHell, even Alistar and Skarner aren&#039;t just about being the only ones of their kind left!  Alistar is about his own pride costing his tribe&#039;s safety and Skarner is about rescuing his people. Race is important to them, but it&#039;s not what they are that defines them. **It is what they do.**","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-04-04T16:15:55.089+0000","up_votes":99,"down_votes":4,"body":"Random isn't unique.
