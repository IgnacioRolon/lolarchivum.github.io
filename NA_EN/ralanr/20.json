If the only competitive reason for picking a marksman is because you want a strong late-game champion, then that means the marksman's contributions in range, teamfight DPS and pushing power are all failing to make them relevant, and their only saving grace is an artificially induced power curve. There are many more champions in the game that are specifically designed to be late-game damage carries, namely Cassiopeia, Karthus, Master Yi, Yasuo, etc., yet even those champions are being overshadowed by marksmen, simply because the latter are assumed to be carries by default.\n\nI also think the idea of marksmen being defined primarily by their late-game status is an assumption worth testing, as I don't think it's true at all. We've had heavily early-focused marksmen like Graves, Kindred and Lucian dominate for quite some time, and beyond that, League has never been in a state where marksmen could be considered non-essential, even when the class was at its weakest. In a game where top, mid and jungle freely exchange between assassins, fighters, mages and tanks, the fact that a single non-marksman in the bot lane carry position can draw so much attention is concerning. We're used to seeing entire classes practically drop out of the game for months on end, and each match will inevitably require each team giving up on at least one of the roster's six classes, but we're still really scared of the mere possibility of marksmen not being on every team. I think that's a double standard that needs to be addressed, and because of this I also think we could afford to have marksmen knocked out of their designated carry position, and start having individually-defined power curves just like any other champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Dubshoka","date":"2017-02-04T19:21:15.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a rational and well-worded post.
