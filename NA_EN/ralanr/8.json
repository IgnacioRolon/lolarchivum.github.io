Are other champions who struggle in aram going to receive anything? Any progress on Aram being actually random. Aram only accounts are getting more prevelant from what I have experienced and well if I dont face lux ziggs or xerath at least every other game I get surprised. And it's easy to tell too from the summoner names and the fact that the accounts only play aram even when premade with other people. It's kinda like how bot accounts in Co-op vs AI is a problem where both modes have huge cancers in them but neither is being addressed or talked about. Sorry if that sounds rude but I enjoy these modes and seeing them turn into this is just awful.","replies":[{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2016-06-15T13:58:04.074+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Boy, Meddler pops his head out for a second and everyone wants to ask about everything.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2016-06-15T14:26:09.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of how it is with riot members.
