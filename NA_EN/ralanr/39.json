Would changing her W to have more of a blueish tinge really effect the clarity that it&#039;s being activated?  Or making her E blue so it more accurately fits with her being the blue shooting star?  I can understand not changing the colors of the Q because that has a delay (though does Taric&#039;s stun color change with his skins?  I know Ekko&#039;s W does). \r\n\r\nWas Poppy&#039;s the last skin to be made?

Stars pop up when she smashes with Q, and in the very middle of the field. Stars are faintly visible in W and appear when an enemy jumps into it. Stars pop up when she slams someone against a wall with E. And then the pillars in R are stars.
