But having played against Eve a few times, I want to share what I think should thematically stay with our mysterious S&amp;M rogue. \r\n\r\nhttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cqp4Kwkuyds/Vw6QJOvIo7I/AAAAAAAA500/Tkwtl57Ek_QxEetrHOvKa8_CK05ips1rQCLcB/s1600/Evelynn_Splash_0.jpg\r\n\r\nYou see this picture?  You see that smile as she&#039;s killing (draining the life out of him?  Idk, Eve&#039;s offensive powers never really stood out as unique. They look like blood magic, but we already have Vlad for that. I&#039;d argue for some shadow magic effects, but we have Zed, so it&#039;s tricky) this guy?  That&#039;s the smile of someone savoring the moment, enjoying every second of pain they inflict. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s the smile of a sadist, but it could be better. \r\n\r\nWhen I&#039;m playing Sion, Eve is actually a match up I dread because every Eve I have fought just dances around me. Anytime I set up my Q, she uses her MS boost to get out fast. She always pops my shield, and she keeps moving around me so I can&#039;t E her. \r\n\r\nI feel like I&#039;m being toyed with, and that&#039;s what I think Eve should do. Toy with her opponents like a sadistic game of cat and mouse before finally killing them. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not entirely sure we have a sadist character in league, at least not one more focused on playing with their target as long as possible. Eve I feel fills that role perfectly. It&#039;s also why I hope she keeps the S&amp;M attire/design in her update. She&#039;s clearly not human (and if she is, definitely not normal) and has the ability to get in wherever she desires. She&#039;s powerful and she knows it, so why not have fun with her prey?\r\n\r\nTLDR: Evelynn&#039;s identity should connect closely with sadism if not both sadism and masochism. She should have her abilities be distinct from the effects of others, hopefully making her more of a &quot;pain mage&quot;. \r\n\r\nI apologize if this is set up poorly, I&#039;m on a phone and this are just rambled thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"BIackfox","date":"2017-02-01T19:35:35.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"Nope, ever since the sjws took over riot they won't do anything like that.

In-lore, Vlad is also responsible for creating Sion through his art. \n\nZed, on the other hand, stole the secret techniques of Shen's clan, which allowed him to manipulate shadows. His mastery over darkness seems to be ancient Ionian magic. \n\nEve on the other hand? Other than the fact that she hails from the Shadow Isles we know little about her, but that in itself is very telling. Think about what the ruination did to the denizens of the isles; they all became corrupted and vile. Preying on all life. Eve's overall design is not far off from a vampiress, or a succubus in the sense that we can gather she either drains the life-force of her preys or draws something from their pain. Being that she also strikes from the shadows, killing her target before disappearing again in a flash, it's possible that Eve might also be another type of spirit from the Shadow Isles like Hecarim or Kalista, albeit with a far more sinister purpose behind why she kills her targets. \n\nDon't be so quick to dismiss blood or shadows as possible pillars of Eve's character, since both prospects could make her character epic in a very different way than either Zed or Vlad.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-02-01T22:36:21.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is for sure a \"sadist\", but putting her in a dominatrix out fit was just riot being very lazy and uncreative(it was a long time ago).

The expression used is perfect and really shows her character.\n{{champion:28}} has 2 very core parts of her kit. 1. her passive and 2. her Q.\nHer passive allows her to fullfill her theme is way to many ways to talk about in this comment, but the main ways is of course \n1. assassinating low Hp targets\n2. giving enemies a sense of dread/worry when they don't know where she is\n3. weaving in between enemies trying to keep them out of stealth range and strategic hit and runs.\n\nHer Q is like you said. It whittles down enemies and toys with them. It also gives her sustain for clearing the jg which makes it core from a practical point of view.\n\nHer W is her gap closer and keeps her from being kited to kingdom come making it also pretty core.
