With Foundations updating the core lore of the LoL universe, skins became divorced from that lore and separated into 'alternate fantasies' and Blood Moon was separated from Ionia (as Ionia no longer looks like generic aisa). I just wrote up a post about Blood Moon [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/XekLQmn2-this-is-a-joke-right?comment=00020002000100060000), but when it comes to player creations I think use/ignore whatever works for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-01-24T21:16:37.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be because that is part of the Old Lore IIRC.  Riot retconned 90% of Leagues lore before.  Since it was released before the retcon as far as I know it stopped being updated with the new bloodmoon skins.  I would assume they are still part of the festival though and that the festival still exists as they still release skins themed after it and never mentioned anything about the festival one way or another during/after the lore changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-24T21:18:04.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really it just gives me more freedom to work with.
