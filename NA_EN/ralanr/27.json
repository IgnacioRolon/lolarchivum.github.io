Tank items are always at risk of being abused by squishies, because the same tank build will net you very similar amounts of defenses across all champions, and on top of that, some tanks have bases that feel either too similar to those of squishies, or even crappier: Shen, especially, is a prime example of a tank whose base durability is terrible simply because he's expected to build tanky thereafter and scale well (he has some of the worst armor growth in the game and his health growth is mediocre, and this is _after he received massive buffs to both_). Buffing the health/armor growth of tanks, perhaps even giving them bonus MR growth, could a) make sure they make better use of tanky itemization than others, especially if their items amplify bases instead of providing flat stats, b) intuitively set them apart as tanks just by looking at their bases, and c) allow them to grow in power more smoothly over the course of the game, instead of spiking hard in lane with early health/armor purchases and then hitting a wall later on once they max out on cheap items, yet still end up getting killed far too quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-01-03T23:36:53.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please, no.

Making tank items amplify bases would be a good reason to increase his own base health growth as well, even if his health from W would likely have to be considered bonus health (i.e. health that wouldn't be amplified). Your full AD builds would thus be even stronger on him, because he'd have more base durability to work with.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Glory ln Death,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AjPRcQeZ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-01-03T23:36:53.159+0000)\n> \n> If you make tanks naturally tanky so they can scale with %base items, they&#x27;ll have to remove ratios on their abilities. Otherwise, you end up with the opposite of Tankko - tanks building full damage because they can get away with it due to their high base defense stats.\n\nVery few tanks can currently afford to build full damage, not necessarily because they're too squishy, but because they generally end up scaling pretty terribly. Even when Rylai's was a dominant item across practically all AP champions, full AP Sejuani did not make a comeback, since her AP scalings got hurt pretty bad in 4.21. Even Sion, who has a few AD scalings, doesn't scale all that well with the stat, and tends to suffer a lot (perhaps even excessively) if he ever overcommits to damage.\n\nThe other major difference is that, unlike cases like Tank Ekko, Tank Yasuo, Tank Fizz, etc., all of which have been balance nightmares that only kit changes and mini-reworks could address, tanks can easily have their damage adjusted with simple number tweaks. If Malphite suddenly starts wrecking too hard with pure AP builds, he can just have his ratios toned down, for example, and the same can be done to Sion and Poppy with their AD scalings. If the issue is specifically with tanks doing too well with full damage builds, even though their tanky builds are meant to deal good damage, then the solution should likely be to replace some of their AD/AP-to-damage ratios with health or resistance ratios, which would encourage them to go tanky for more damage.\n\nOne of the big problems with tank stats right now is that there are actually very few scalings out there for them: tanks generally have only one or two health or resistance scalings on their abilities at most, whereas damage-dealers typically have three, four or five different scalings on their kits, sometimes even more. This is in part why it's so easy for squishies to get tanky via itemization, because tank items are currently designed for a class that mostly just scales with them out of a lack of other scalings, instead of making significantly better use of them than non-tanks. We need a greater differential in tanky item effectiveness between tanks and non-tanks, and only then can tanks then be balanced around the scalings they need.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-01-04T01:35:16.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AjPRcQeZ,comment-id=000300000001,timestamp=2017-01-04T00:00:54.399+0000)\n>\n> If Malphite suddenly starts wrecking too hard with pure AP builds, he can just have his ratios toned down, for example, and the same can be done to Sion and Poppy with their AD scalings.\n\n_This_ is the issue. If tanks' base defensive stats are increased, then _any_ tank who can deal decent damage by building AD or AP will _have_ to have their ratios nerfed. And for tanks to retain the full effect of tanky items while making the items \"meh\" for other, low defensive base champions, the tanks would need fairly significantly higher bases - meaning fairly significant nerfs to make sure damage oriented builds don't become prevalent.\n\nBasically, tanks would be _forced_ to build full tank. Damage builds would no longer be an option, even in game modes or ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-01-04T02:19:38.807+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you can really draw an equivalence between the value of alternative builds, and that of solving a persistent game issue that has critically affected multiple classes, not just tanks. Assassins, for example, are all saddled with shitty bases and extreme dependence on scalings because, given even decent amounts of base damage, they'd be likely to do too well with tank builds (that's why Talon has only a maximum of 160 base damage on his innate, for example). Marksmen as well have occasionally exploited items intended for tanky champions, and will continue to do so whenever those items are strong (Frozen Mallet and Sterak's Gage especially). As long as tank stats remain in their current state, we will forever be doomed to a state of damage classes where they will either be too snowbally, or too liable to make use of tanky builds.
