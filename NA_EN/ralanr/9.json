It's probably more complex than that, but remember:  Aurelion Sol puts a bit of himself into every  star he creates, so there is a massive amount of magical energy in these things.  \n\nNow for Targon.  Targon is an empire that is advanced enough that it has expanded beyond its home planet.  The theory is that they have used ascension in the same way that the Shurimans did, but to a much higher degree and more efficiently.  So efficiently in fact, that their magic allows them to possess (Pantheon) or half-possess/ share a mental link with (Diana, Leona, Taric) a being on another planet.  These Aspects of Targon don't only exist on Runeterra, but we aren't entirely sure what their purpose is or what Targon's true agenda is.\n\nBtw, we don't know if the Targonians originated on Runeterra or not, but I think it's more likely that they just keep tabs on every planet that has sentient life.  Also, Runeterra is apparently the planet that hold the key to Sol's freedom, so Targon is paying extra attention to the goings-on there by stationing more Aspects than usual.  It seems that Mt. Targon is just a place that is extra connected to the true Targon, and it serves as a portal of some kind.\n\nCelestial beings are just the godlike creatures from the creation of the universe.\n\nNot much is known about the Void, but I think it's a sentient being similar to Bard, but it's also its own dimension that spawns out these voidlings.  The Void just wants to consume other dimensions endlessly.\n\nAatrox and Tahm Kench are both types of demons who represent the weaknesses of humanity.\n\nConcerning spirits, I'm remembering this comment I made a while back talking about them.

It honestly doesn't matter at this point.  Apparently Sion running provides enough force to knock down a 10 story solid marble structure, as claimed by Reav3 in this thread.  Once you reach the force needed to do that and place it in a roughly human sized shape (I'll say 8 ft tall, just for the argument) then he could literally turn people into paste just by running at them.  A single such bodyslam would cause irreparable damage, assuming that Galio is made of the same consistency as real world marble.  \n\nI have no proof of this, but I'm just going to assume that Galio's actually made out of some sort of super durable stone, since marble falling down from 10 stories would shatter it.  Meaning that Sion could 1 hit kill Galio.  Which I don't think that's what Reav3 meant.  He can correct me, of course.\n\nAnd amusingly, because of the whole every action has an equal and opposite reaction thing, if Sion's body had roughly the same consistency of a human body then he also would just turn to paste if he ever actually tried to run headfirst into Galio.  I'm again, going to assume that Reav3 does not intend this to happen.\n\nReally all this means is, I was under the assumption that Sion was just an awesome warrior that doesn't die.  But really, he's the Hulk.  At the amount of energy in his legs, and again assuming he weighs roughly the same as a overmuscled human about his size (using Hafthor Julius Bjornsson as a weight model, he's 6'9\" and weighs 415, so roughly here, if Sion is 8 ft tall he should weigh around 500 lbs, I'll make it 600 just to account for the metal parts added to him).  So the force to knock over a 10 story tall marble structure put into an object that is 600 lbs would send it flying.  So, Sion, should be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, probably a lot more.  \n\nBut this is where we start getting into things not really making sense in real world terms, so I would basically just shut off my brain and nod to whatever Riot says would happen in such a confrontation.  I personally, kind of hate these kind of fantasy stories where the rules are whatever the writers happen to say at any given time, and the physics of the setting just don't make sense.  But, the fact that shounen anime and Superman are so very popular proves that I am in the minority there, so, whatever.
