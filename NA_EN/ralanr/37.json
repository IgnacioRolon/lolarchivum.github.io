That's my bad. \n\nJust something I&#039;ve been thinking about. Lane bullies are powerful early game champions that have a weaker late game to compensate them (best example is Pantheon, who falls off after 30 minutes). These are meant to counter hypercarries by prolonging their power spikes. \n\nNow every lane has bullies. Top has Pantheon, Darius, and Riven (I consider her a bully, but I could be wrong). Mid has Zed. Bot has Lucian, Miss Fortune, and Draven (and others I&#039;m sure). \n\nSo I have to ask, when do bot lane bullies fall off?  Draven I kinda understand because he&#039;s built around a positioning minigame that seperates good Dravens from bad pretty easily. But I&#039;ve never felt like Lucian (even when playing him if I get fed. He&#039;s one of my favorite ADCs because he encourages spell weaving) or MF really fall off as the game goes on. \n\nAm I the only one who thinks this?","replies":[{"poster":"Buff Jax please","date":"2016-07-25T14:02:34.887+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":4,"body":"ADCs are the only class in the game that are allowed to bully other champs in lane and also beat you lategame by default.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-07-25T21:32:49.447+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:268}} *Squawk?*","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2016-07-25T21:42:15.209+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir isn't a class.\n\nHe also has [the same class as ADCs](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list).","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-07-26T05:23:36.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir is Shurima's dawn.
