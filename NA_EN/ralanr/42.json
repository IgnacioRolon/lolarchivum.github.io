I can never farm properly once mid-game reaches because either team needs me or it's too dangerous to go out and farm.\n\nFarm jungle camps and manage multiple waves at once. Depending on what elo you're in people might not manage waves and just open themselves up to map pressure by sitting mid for no reason.\n\nJust go to side waves whenever there's a wave built up, clear it and move on to the next jungle camps/lane. When you sit in that lane with no purpose other than more farm is when it becomes a problem, this opens your team up to extended times of pressure and could also lead to you getting ganked if you go too far up without reasonable vision on the enemy team.\n\nIf you're managing waves to keep map pressure in your favor and then your team jumps in 4v5 then blames you for not being there, they're idiots and you should just ignore them.\n\nNever try to keep bot lane in check if baron could be on the table for the enemy team while you're gone, there are strict times that you have to identify when it is ok to be in a side lane and for how long you can be in that side lane. \n\nOnce you learn how to properly rotate between lanes and also clear jungle camps effectively, you will see your farm numbers and general gold income skyrocket. You may also find yourself dying less because you won't be sitting somewhere like mid trying to siege against high waveclear while they flank you, or anything else that's pointless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-04-01T10:01:03.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://45.media.tumblr.com/f931c5d99cc8d118b9dcae0f39be5aab/tumblr_o3o86rXtF41v9gbpno1_400.gif\nhttps://49.media.tumblr.com/a271f712a6d30758084b87319ed134d4/tumblr_n7zr3u43Pj1r113c4o1_500.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeiseAzir","date":"2016-04-01T04:38:42.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"down-vote me and move on","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnart Even Close","date":"2016-04-01T00:43:03.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play lucian or ezreal.  they have a more fun and easy to understand caster style and have mobility to correct positioning mistakes.  those are my two main adcs and i usually do ok, even though i'm a top lane main.  the thing with blue ezreal tho is that you have to play lane pretty passive because you build mana and not damage early, and you can't really push out that well.  lucian is a lot better for lane, and is incredibly fun to play","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-04-01T00:44:38.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love playing {{champion:236}} when he is free (which he is this week, so fun!) and it really does fit my preference of casters.
