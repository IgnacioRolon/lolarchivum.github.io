Her lore described her as this fighter cast out of an oppressed society and using whatever powers she could to fight back against her tyrants.  Your basic \"for the greater good\" and \"rebellion\" stories rolled into one.  Seemed ok for lore back then rather than just saying \"Purple lady is evil because she is purple and uses dark magics!\"\r\n\r\nThen I read Kayle's lore, which not only told me they were sisters but also basically said that she was a warrior who fought for justice to protect her home from crumbling and brought down evil terrorists (I'm paraphrasing here) who threatened the peace and harmony of her home.\r\n\r\nThen I reread Morgana's lore.  Then I reread Kayle's.  Then it hit me, the great thing about their lores is that they painted themselves as the good characters, the other as the bad characters, but as a reader, you couldn't tell which was really true.  That's what made their old lore so good, it was that you could see both of their sides and maybe even agree with each others methods, but in the end you weren't sure who was really right.\r\n\r\nAnd the new lore fails to do this.  Why?  Because we as an outside reader can relate our own morality into the story too easily.  When {{champion:10}} basically tries to Sodom and Gomorrah Demacia because someone killed Ronas, you kinda get the idea that Kayle went a little overboard.  But we don't really get that for Morgana because she basically killed Ronas in self defense because he was like, \"Kayle ain't doing this, so I'll put justice in my own hands!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Morgana was like:\r\n\r\n{{champion:25}}: No.  Back off or die.\r\nAnd then he died. \r\n\r\nKayle only stops because her rage caused her father to die, and then she decides to blame her emotions on the situation and bugger off to Targon while Morgana decides to wander the world to help people (and apparently never meet Poppy).\r\n\r\nWhere is the duality here?  I can see them arguing over areas of justice (Kayle being too harsh, Morgana being too soft) but nothing Morgana has done has backfired on her beyond \"Well I didn't want these powers, but I have them now.\"\r\n\r\nThis story works well for Kayle because we get to see how extreme she is.  She believes what she's doing is right, is just, and we are presented with that in her VO at times.  But we know that she is just taking things a wee bit too far.  We don't get that with Morgana, in fact, many people probably side more with Morgana because she's helping those who could be redeemed or misjudged.  \r\n\r\nWhere are Morgana's flaws?  Where are her mistakes?  Why must Kayle be the only one who makes a mistake and punishes herself for it?  Morgana's was simply binding her own wings to keep herself on the ground with mortals.  I understand that Morgana has a lot of humility, but what I don't see is where she could be wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to try and make a debate through two philosophies, you have to show the good and bad of both.  \r\n\r\nI do enjoy the character interactions and I feel as a duo they are stronger than ever, but seperatly their motivations and faults need more work.  I'm not asking for Riot to make Kayle go adopt a puppy or build an orphanage, she's fine so long as you push Morgana to an equal extreme amount.","replies":[{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2019-02-21T08:21:01.751+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with bios is that they don't give a good impression of the champion.

The point is that a biography is meant to be a like a wikipedia article. Informative and straight to the point. When the writers want to delve deep into the nuance of a specific event or character, that they do so not necessarily in a bio but save it for an actual short story.

However, pure compassion without a proper sense of justice, can be seen as soft. A man could plead with Morgana, and she might protect him from Kayle, but if he did it insincerely and goes off and does it again, would Morgana actually do something about it?\n\nWhat we see of Morgana isn’t always the greatest though. Did she really have to kill Ronas? Did she have to “[shackle] him with dark flame until he fell to the floor, dead”? Did she do anything to stop the riot that was happening in the city?\n\nBy Morgana’s VO, there’s also an interesting thing to notice. She’s often bitter, depressed sounded. She speaks of a broken heart and betrayal. Who knows what all she will do in such a state?\n\nIt also makes me think of part of a passage from my faith, “Seek justice.

No, she did not have to shackle him until he died. As far as we’re presented, she chose that route. The “stopping the riot” question is merely an unknown element from Kayle’s bio, because the riot is left out of Morgana’s bio but was a factor in Kayle’s.\n\nSo to me?

Kayle viewed her father's death as a consequence of human emotion clouding her judgement when she was seeking human justice for a human death.  She left the battlefield because she realized that human emotions have no place in her form of justice and we see in her quotes that she firmly believes that only the divine may decide what justice truly is. \n\nMorgana on the other hand saw Kayle's detachment from human emotion and their family as the reason for why her father was killed and in her mind the divine's detachment from humanity is what makes them unfit to decide what justice is.  So she bound her wings to detach herself from the divine and live as closely as she could to humanity, feeling that human's mortality and emotion is what makes them best fitted to decide what justice is.  \n\nSo basically what I got from the story was not that Kayle or Morgana are opposites because of light/dark or good/evil but their opposition comes from one believing in detachment from emotion when deciding what is just and the other believing that human emotion is the only way to decide what is just, a contrast between the divine and mortal; Kayle fighting against her mortal emotions and Morgana fighting against her divinity and the influential power it has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-02-21T12:45:57.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This was exactly the core of my argument against the recent storytelling which victims are currently Kayle and Demacia as a whole.\n\n\nI’m saddened though that the only reply we got on the matter is that, apparently, making it so Kayle would be relatable too would mean having “2-dimensional characters”.\n\nThen Scathlocke derailed the discussion into a Darth Vader apology which found himself again proven wrong in his views.\n\nI wish we could have a constructive discussion about it but this then needs both parties to engage in it.
