Even though Pantheon&#039;s passive will block the attack, he still falls under the effect of {{champion:86}}&#039;s Q and silence (which kinda screws Pantheon over what with him being an AD caster) and {{champion:17}}&#039;s blinding dart.  \n\nThis is by no means a QQ thread, but I was just wondering if it is intended for Pantheon&#039;s passive to not block the after effects of basic attack abilities.  And if so, why?  While arguing logic doesn&#039;t hold much ground in games, shouldn&#039;t Pantheon&#039;s passive block the entirety of basic attack abilities?  \n\nJust a thought.  What do you all think?  Please share.\n\nEdit: Disregard everything I say about Teemo in this post.  I got an answer to it and I don't want to delete it because that'd make the answering post irrelevant.

Destroyed my lane opponent, was 7/1 and well farmed. My enemy was GP.\nSo then late game came, and I became completely useless. My damage became very pathetic, I couldn't catch anyone, or escape. Just jump in and die instantly. And if that's not enough, my ult was good only to jump onto minions to clear them. Because everyone would escape the ult range before I hit the ground. Every. Single. Time.\nMy question is: what good is Pantheon's ult? It does 1k magic damage at the center and 500 at the edges. Casting ult takes 7seconds (start- land) so you can't really use it for anything other than getting somewhere quicker.\nMy suggestion is: either lower casting time at least in half, or cut the damage to champions (not minions) and remove the warning circle on land.\n\nThank you for your time.

Consider {{item:3078}} , or {{item:3071}} (asking Xin to perhaps go for something else)  instead of {{item:3742}}  (which I think isn't very harmonious with Panth).

Cleaver gives the same amount of armor _shred_ as LW gives pen, and thats for your entire team. You stack it super fast with your E. If you feel you died too fast... Well, then get Cleaver for more HP too lol. Hell, it even gives as much AD as LW, on top of CDR. \n\n> TF costs alot, and is better built early than late.\n\nNah. TF is a great last item.

Because _slows_, whch we all know Ashe has a lot of, takes away your stacks. No stacks means no MS, nor no slow.

His Q is his strong spell, what with it's damage, inability to miss when choosing a target, and able to proc his E's passive.\n> \n> But yeah, a lot of things are different on paper then they are in action.  Pantheon being a AD caster (like {{champion:83}}, {{champion:91}}, and {{champion:92}} (maybe)) doesn't fully rely on his auto attacks like say {{champion:59}} or {{champion:2}}.  He uses his spells for damage.  The trade off for an AD caster is that unlike normal casters, they have decent to good auto attack damage and unlike Auto attackers they have versatility in their abilities.  This is what I understand it as.\n\nI meant that his strong spells are Q and E and that his W is just a 1 sec and his ult is a utility transport over the map, without damage, but anyways pantheon autos are as strong as support autos his AD at level 18 is one of the worst wtf is this ? _Olaf is mainly auto attacker, _\nRiven has passive which boost her autos with decent value, talon passive gives him 10% stronger autos, yorick passive gives him 20% stronger autos if he has 4 ghouls and best of all J4 passive gives him 10% of target's max HP capped to 400 damage\n\nSo yeah as you can see the other AD casters, has passive which makes their autos to deal more damage or they scale with totall AD, i think that would be fair if pantheon AD per level is increased and at the end at level 18 to have 115-120, right now he has just 104\nAnd also his Q and E must scale with total AD, instead bonus AD, oo and to keep him balanced his Q CD must be increased early and at level 5 to match the current one\nRight now the spell looks like\nPhysical Damage: 65 / 105 / 145 / 185 / 225 (+ 140% bonus AD)  \nCOOLDOWN: 4\nIt could be changed to something like\n45 / 90 / 135 / 180 / 225 (+ 110% total AD /+ 120% total AD /+ 130% total AD /+ 140% total AD /+ 150% total AD)\nCOOLDOWN: 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4  \ncurrent E \nPhysical Damage Per Strike: 13 / 23 / 33 / 43 / 53 (+ 60% bonus AD) \nChampion Damage Per Strike: 26 / 46 / 66 / 86 / 106 (+ 120% bonus AD)\nit could be changed to something like\n30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 ( + 10% total AD/+ 20% total AD/+ 30% total AD/+ 40% total AD/+ 50% total AD)\n60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 (+ 20% total AD/+ 40% total AD/+ 60% total AD/+ 80% total AD/+ 100% total AD)\nThis way his early damage will be almost same or abit lower, but he will be abl to build tanky and to do some damage, right now if pantheon builds tanky his damage is equal to 0\nPS ofc these numbers are just example ones, rioters must tweak them, but you get the idea total AD scaling which increased with every level, abit lower early damage( you might say that it will be higher with current numbers, but due to the 2x higher cd it will be lower !!!) and tank pantheon to have some damage :))","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-09-13T19:44:43.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize I pointed out Olaf because he's more focused on AAs unlike Pantheon.  \n\nRight?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-09-11T21:34:01.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=healinglolz,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Pu1VE1yV,comment-id=0003000000000001,timestamp=2015-09-11T18:27:02.984+0000)\n>\n>if you get caught or jump on somebody you are dead in less then 1 sec\n\nAssuming you're behind.\nIf you're ahead, you'll be the one killing.\nFeast or famine, ever heard of it?\n\n> pantheon's damage late game is so small compared to othe champs,\n\noh yeah early game champ that must be why Lee Sin is such a good pick, because its bad\noh wait\n\n>most of champions can build 1 offensive item(trinity, botrk) and outdamage pantheon even if he has 3 offensive items(BC, HYDRA, LW) aka his core  how come ? how is this balanced?\n\nBecause he's allowed to block 2 of those attacks, possibly three if the fight lasts long enough, or maybe even a towershot if it comes at him.\nThat's why its balanced.\n\n>Also most of champions has either 3-4 strong spells or strong autos and 1-2 strong spells, lets take a look at pantheon he has 2 \"strong\" spells 1 sec stun and ultimate which is just a transport utility,\n\nLOLOLOLOL\nYeah this is where your argument ends.\nHis passive lets him block tower shots.\nHis Q is a point-and-click ranged(600 range, as much as the second highest's ranged champion's AA's[Ashe and Anivia]) nuke that deals 225 base damage, granted not a lot, but then to add to it... 140% bonus AD.

So 360% bonus AD not including your Q which is 140% bonus AD and then your basic attacks and autocrits after they get low enough... like wtf you think this guy is BAD?\n\nAnd then for his ult... he gets to move about half way across the map after 3.5 seconds, if not visible to the enemy team they only see it after 2 seconds and 1.5 second before he's going to land, and then boom he nukes their face for 500 damage in a big-ass AOE that slows them all.\n\n\nNot going to say he's strong because I admit, most of his damage is hard to land on multiple people because two abilities are single target, and he obviously has his AA's and then his cone damage is pretty small so you'll probably land it on your W target... but he's definitely, most definitely not weak. And not to the point of needing a buff.\n\nJust because he doesn't have a 54% win rate and everyone is begging for nerfs does not mean he's weak.
