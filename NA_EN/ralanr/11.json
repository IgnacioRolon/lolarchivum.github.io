I feel like the big eyes of an owl watching down on the evening was appropriate for TF as it ties in to his ultimate. As it evolved and I did a stack of versions there were of course comparisons to Reaper (and Amon) made but it wasn't an intentional thing and at the end we made efforts to ensure we weren't too close.\n\nBesides I'm a Roadhog main, Reaper can eat it :P","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-01-25T17:48:32.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jeez, you guys really go all-in with these designs.\n\nI can't imagine ever working that hard on anything except yesterday when I had to search up an image and draw a muscular back for a character.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-01-26T07:46:22.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha!

Why not purple or something closer to the rest of the skin line? Was there a specific reason that makes sense? The colour choice makes me appreciate the skin less, at is feels out of place when you line up all the skins together. And why the blue eyes too? I would at least hope for a chroma in the not-so-distant future :P\n\nThe same goes for Jhin with his green cloth and belt.

I will be brutally honest with you: the colours of both skins clash so hard with the rest that I won't buy the skins, and I was pleased when I heard Jhin and TF got BM skins. It annoys me that much... You don't deliver on the theme when you go so far away from the theme's colour palette. You might as well colour a Battlecast skin in neon pink and try the same argument. It will have the design of a Battlecast skin, but the colours of a Neon Strike or Galaxy skin.\n\nI am not saying that the skins are bad, but I am saying that I am extremely disappointed with your decision to make both the Jhin and TF skins stand out like that. Your argumentation is poor when you take other skins in consideration (not trying to be rude, just stating it as it is).\n---\n Purple is closer to black and stays with the theme, and you can get a real badass TF with some changes:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3uRSIOv.png\n- The cape is now red only\n- Purple instead of blue\n- Red eyes\n\nThe purple could be made even darker:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/h2LGf9p.png\n---\nWhy change the eyes to blue? TF looks so friendly and festive with all the bright colours... He is only a clown mask away from a Lunar Revel skin.\n\nI am sorry if I come off as rude - it is but my passion for these skins - and I wish that you pay more respect to the themes you have set than to move them in other directions. I do not think my message would be as clear if I sugarcoated it.\n\nThanks for taking the time to chat with the community :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2017-01-24T23:19:24.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 3 cards are really cool and have similar japanese-ish signs on it.\nIt's all pretty and stuff :>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2017-01-24T23:17:28.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"his SFX Style is one of the best in the game tho.\n\nEspecially the cards and the Ult are very japanese-ish. \nbye bye wallet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ayane","date":"2017-01-28T07:21:28.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reaper's been playing too much hearthstone","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-01-24T22:12:24.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the other splashes out yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Jad","date":"2017-01-25T01:43:56.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hello I am Bird,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xUfUjapL,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-24T22:12:24.001+0000)\n>\n> Are the other splashes out yet?\n\nNope, not yet.
