I&#039;m sure this thought has come up several times before however.\r\n\r\nI feel supports aren&#039;t really supports.  They feel more like guardians for the ADC.  Everything the support offers seems to benefit the ADC more than anyone else on their team.  Shields, AS, healing, all benefit the guy who has a low health pool and heavily relies on basic stats and kiting to function (course I&#039;m biased here).  These things could be beneficial to other roles, but they don&#039;t need them because they need to be somewhat self-sufficient.  Fighters and tanks have healing or defensive steroids of their own, mages don&#039;t bring out enough DPS and are usually much more ranged in a fight so they don&#039;t need the constant protection.\r\n\r\nWhen I play support, 90% of my thought process in a teamfight seems to be &quot;keep the ADC alive&quot; because I know that will win us the fight more or less.  No other class is better suited for my buffs and peel, and therefore the ADC takes priority.  It&#039;s weird because if a team actually helped a heavily stacked Nasus reach his targets, then he&#039;d be very useful.\r\n\r\nIDK, I think that supports need to be more team helpful then ADC sitters.","replies":[{"poster":"o brigid o","date":"2018-01-28T18:58:00.490+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":1,"body":"A good support already knows to prioritize the carry in team fights... and that's not always your bottom marksman.\n\nIf I have a 9/1 Nasus obliterating enemies left and right as long as he can get to them in the same game as an adc that isn't making an impact, you can bet your ass that I'll be focusing on helping Nasus carry the team to victory.\n\nA good support isn't an adc-sitter. You just start out that way at level 1. The rest is up to you.\n\nSupport and jungle are (imo) the most impactful roles because it's primarily up to them to have the best understanding of the overall match and make the kind of choices other players don't have to make.

Moving as a unit to place wards I would consider macro as it involves a concentrated team effort. A solid split push plan is macro in a 1/3/1 with baron. HOWEVER, your respective 1v1s in the side lanes, and your individual defensive wards you use for protection are micro as it is relevant to you as an individual to use the tools you have most effectively.\n\nYou can kind of think about it in the sense of micro is your ability to do a play that solo carries, and macro is what you use to get your team to win.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tibold","date":"2018-01-29T01:30:42.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nodice21,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1Ea475p7,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-28T20:17:26.440+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s the easiest role because you don&#x27;t do a whole lot.\n\nWrong.

After laning, he tends transition toward leaving his Bastion (W link) on frontliners/divers so he can get get some great stuns off (the frontliners gonna be in the action anyways, so Taric can help them survive longer with a Bastioned stun and the passive armor from Bastion. AND REMEMBER THAT TARIC'S HEAL IS AN AOE! So if Taric's moving around trying to give his team that sweet heal, stay within about 2-3 Teemo's distance of him (the AOE range is indicated every time he heals) to sustain. The only ability of his that only affects one person other than him is his W (the link).\n{{champion:53}} is fairly decent with target access.  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° Same with {{champion:412}} with Q and Ult\n{{champion:497}} simply existing can be helpful but he needs to be in slapping distance of them in the first place, so maybe work around some bush strats or something?\n{{champion:37}} has... mild speedups and and ult but it's low range given (or on the lower end of mid-range but I'm taking its travel time into account).\n\nI'm not trying to make your argument invalid. Just trying to find ways around the problem!\nI crossed out Nasus because... Nasus DOES have Wither for target access.\n\nEDIT:\n##I FORGOT ABOUT THE FISH!\n{{champion:267}} speeds everyone up with her abilities. Champs can even walk through her Q and get a movespeed bonus, I think. QWER all give MS for a small amount of time on top of Q and R's obvious CC potential.","replies":[{"poster":"AuraCreed","date":"2018-01-30T07:03:13.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Yeah your right about the Nami Q - you hit your allies with it and it gives the same movement speed. R gives additional movement speed beyond the passive, if I remember correctly.\n\n{{champion:37}} 's ult range doesnt necessarily matter when it's hard to predict and happens the moment you press the button, practically.\n\n{{champion:497}}  It's very important to know when you can flash W in, but being able to aggressive flash is also important on a lot of supports (EVEN Sona if you have ult up but thats highly situational)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-01-28T19:21:05.075+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"The role is defined by marksmen because the role goes bot lane with marksmen.
