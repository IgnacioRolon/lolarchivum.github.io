It seems as though Ulanopo is saying that in almost all cases where a player says \"report X\" multiple times in a match, it is done with the intention of harassing player X.  And the IFS treats any logs that are reported with that as containing harassment, and punishes players accordingly.  \n\nThe thing is, if a player has done/said horrible things in a match and you feel that they need to be reported for it, even if you want to ask other players to report as well, there's no need to ask multiple times.  Asking once is enough.  And you can say in that request precisely why you are asking for reports.  For example, \"Please report Akali for using homophobic slurs against our Ezreal, thank you\" at the end of the match.  That's not harassment.

This particular log ran a little towards the unnecessarily repeated request, which can be seen as harassment.","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-05-10T04:37:21.811+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He asked twice, and politely so.\n\nThat is not harassment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Joxcab","date":"2017-05-10T01:58:10.577+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"Not knowing the rules isn't an excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-05-10T04:38:12.198+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Unless the rules are vague and unclear; in this case, \"asking for reports\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-05-10T10:00:37.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ignorance of a law does not excuse from  a law.","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-05-10T16:58:32.719+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does when the provider of said laws makes it vague/unclear and not easily accessible/visible to the those that are required to follow them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lexyy","date":"2017-05-10T15:28:14.666+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the answer is: no, this chat log should not result in a chat restiction.
