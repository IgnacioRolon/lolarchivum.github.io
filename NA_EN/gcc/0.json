First of all it keeps crashing and updating. Yesterday i was in a ranked champ select when my client crashed and i tried to relaunch the client but it wouldn't let me and forced me to do an update which caused me to lose the LP but the thing is i didn't get the 5 min penalty before i could start another game. Is there any fixes, is this an isolated bug only for me, or is this a thing that is happening to more people.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-04T16:46:19.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We had a live service incident on 9/1/2016 shortly after 9:00PM PDT that was causing disconnections from champ select and preventing the start of games.

If your issue happened during that time, it could have been related to that issue. \n\nIf you're still seeing crashes and patching often, I recommend working through our [Bugsplat & Crashes guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) to try the most common fixes for this.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"GCC","date":"2016-08-09T17:09:31.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah,I guess it was fixed because it only happened then ty for the reply, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackfootedfox","date":"2016-08-04T18:18:32.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, we had an incident in the future?!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T15:12:53.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad!
