In the meantime, we’ve been updating at a fast and furious pace and we’ve been sharing our changes at a similar cadence. But that speed has a price and, understandably, you might’ve missed something. So, we wanted to aggregate all the changes over the last week in one place.\r\n\r\nWithout further ado:\r\n\r\n**July 3rd (These changes just went live)** \r\n\r\n_Units_\r\n\r\nPyke\r\nStun Duration: 2.5/3/3.5 >>> 2/2.5/3\r\n\r\n_Traits_\r\n\r\nYordle\r\nDodge Chance: 20/50% >>> 25/60%\r\n\r\n_Items_\r\n\r\nSpear of Shojin\r\nMana on-hit: 20% >>> 15% (For real this time)\r\n\r\n**July 1st**\r\n\r\n_Tier 2 and 3 units_\r\n\r\nTier 2 and 3 units are currently too risky to star-up when compared to tier 1’s.

I am not sure why you guys think yordles and even demons are underpowered when they aren't at all. Meanwhile pretty much every other class buff like nobles, blademasters and gunslingers are nowhere near close. \n\nDo you guys even remember that you put 6 knights in the game? It's so unplayable and so terrible that I have no idea why it's even in the game. It's like salt in the wounds when you worry about yordles and demons and can't even see the most underpowered and terrible thing in the game by far that is the 6 knight buff. \n\nThe game is already stale with limited options that I am already bored. If you any of you guys are desparate to win than just get 6 yordles and afk. Make a rank3 garen and it will faceroll for you to the end. My personal favorite is still 6 demons. It's actually unbeatable if done right.","replies":[]}]}
