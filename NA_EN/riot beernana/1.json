We’re releasing TFT on a deliberate timeline and with temporary restrictions to keep the servers stable as y’all show them your love in the early hours of TFT’s release. Keep in mind that TFT is still in a “Beta” period. We'll be looking to ship bug fixes and balance changes daily if need be.\r\n\r\n**Timeline (Pacific Timezone)**\r\n\r\nThis is the plan, exact timing may vary.\r\n\r\n**Tuesday (6/25)**\r\n_Note: There’ll be a Level 10 requirement for TFT on the first day and game starts will be throttled._\r\n\r\n* OCE\r\n* JP\r\n\r\n\r\n**Wednesday (6/26)**\r\n\r\nAM:\r\n \r\n* NA\r\n\r\nPM:\r\n\r\n* TR\r\n* RU\r\n* EUNE/EUW\r\n\r\n**Thursday (6/27)**\r\n\r\n* TH\r\n* PH\r\n* SG\r\n* KR\r\n* VN\r\n* TW\r\n\r\n**Friday (6/28)**\r\n\r\n* BR\r\n* LAN\r\n* LAS\r\n\t\r\n**Missions and Modes:** \r\n\r\nIn some regions, (NA,EUW/N, KR, VN, TW, LAN and LAS) TFT’s missions and client hub will be enabled one week after the mode is released. We want to be sure that the missions and beta pass are functioning as intended. We don’t want you to think you’ve completed missions to get your free Little Legend only to have them break. Once we’re confident that everything is working, we’ll get the pass and missions to all regions. **Note: you will not earn progress towards the free “Beta Pass” until this system is up and running. This means that your free Little Legend, emotes, icon, and board skin will be delayed.**\r\n\r\n**Level Cap**\r\n\r\nTFT will be temporarily restricted to level 10+ accounts on the OCE and JP servers. \r\n\r\n**General Measures**\r\n\r\nWe’re doing a few things in all regions to help with the expected increase in server load.\r\n\r\n* Transfers are disabled until July 1st\r\n* Practice Tool is disabled\r\n* Custom modes are limited to 10 players minimum \r\n\r\nWe understand that some of these changes will have a significant impact on many of you. We’re excited to get TFT into your hands, so thank you for your patience as we get this thing out the door.","replies":[{"poster":"AniMoLoL","date":"2019-06-26T10:50:17.296+0000","up_votes":172,"down_votes":22,"body":"Is it so hard to give Local Times? If we (the players / CUSTOMERS) can do it so can you... Also if you're giving us the time according to Pacific Time ZONE you SHOULD consider the giant time gap between NA and EU... For us in EU pacific time PM will be basically TOMORROW, Thursday not today Wednesady...\n\nIt's sad to me that you do the same bs like every other NA based gaming company... You think mostly about NA while the rest of the world (the majority) is left in the dark... For once I'd like NOT to be punished because I live in EU currently... In today's world it shouldn't be so hard to release games simultaneously in EVERY region despite time zone differences... You're not a small Indie company, you should be able to afford more servers if that's the issue... Sigh...

It seems very sneaky to announce that the game will be released Wednesday PM for EU Players, when in fact by their timezone that makes it the small hours of Thursday morning for EU players.\n\nGranted it says above the timeline is for Pacific Time Zone,  But for the sake of 10 minutes of someones time to actually convert all the posts to their own regions timezone would have saved a lot of upset and anger. I like many others planned my schedule around having Wednesday evening free to play this game, only to find out I will not be able to. I understand Thursday AM isn't exactly a long wait from there, but its beside the point. If people knew from the beginning it wouldnt be available til Thursday morning and weren't under the false claim of it being Wednesday afternoon it would have made this alot smoother, and a lot less upset current and potential new players. Not the start you should want with your playerbase.\n\nLike i said, for the sake of 10 minutes of converting timezones and posting them correctly for each region..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puddy","date":"2019-06-25T15:38:20.226+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"What time Wednesday PM?

Supposedly, they internally pivoted towards growing SR and LCS around the time of Dom's launch. That's (partially) why Dom never really got any balance patches.\n\nClaiming that Riot dropped Dominion because \"[they] couldn't spend time balancing a game that the community never played\" is a massive oversimplification that overlooks a significant part of the situation. Riot didn't spend resources on Dominion because the community didn't play, *and the community didn't play Dominion because Riot didn't spend resources on it.*\n\nAs a side note, comparing TFT to ARAM would've made much *less* sense. The guy you're replying to is arguing for game modes that failed because of Riot's lack of support. ARAM succeeded despite a lack of support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"3picgam3r","date":"2019-06-26T12:33:48.912+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm on the updated client on the NA servers, but I am having trouble finding the game mode.
