Whenever I clicked on her music icon the screen either froze for a few seconds, as Clockwork said, or I would have consistent frame rate drops while the music was active. Don't know if it's a general bug or not, I blamed it on the fact that I have a wired potato that passes as a computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-10T18:44:03.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey ClockworkSheikah -\n\nThanks for the report!
