I think everyone is upset, and understandably so, because Riot has taken so long to do anything about it. Mention of him being too strong was back in August but it was stated in a red post that they were not going to nerf him because they were heading into Worlds and he was not an issue in competitive play. Several months later and we finally get confirmation that Yasuo is going to be nerfed in patch 7.2 as stated here (patch 7.1 is already almost done on PBE and there is nothing changed on Yasuo): http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2016/12/ask-riot-yasuos-last-breath/\n\nI think it's just frustrating to most, myself included, that they say \"hey, we know this champ is too strong at the moment, we will nerf him in five months.\" No other champion is given this kind of treatment. Even Lee Sin, who just became a problem recently due to the combination of his Worlds buffs and the introduction of the Blast Cone, is getting nerfed before Yasuo is.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-12-26T18:26:07.464+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Zed had two month in the SoloQ spotlight before rito pulled the break and smashed him in his guts with the nerf hammer. \nNautilus top lasted for 1 month until they nerfed him so hard he wasn't viable at all except maybe as a support niche pick. \nYasuo?

Riot has made this amazing game that I love to play. It's just that at the moment, I feel like the balance team has had a few more blunders than usual. Riot has been on fire with their art teams working on new champion designs and skins this year as well as providing lots of great stories about their characters. On the other hand, the balance team while their heart seem to be in the right place with them communicating to the player base their opinions, they seem too rigid on their stance sometime. They mainly state their opinion and don't discuss it further, just go through with it as is. I hope next year the balance will finally be on par with the atmosphere that is created through the stories and art around this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2016-12-26T20:03:30.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well they clearly have biases, while the mains argue otherwise.\n\nI mean they flat out admitted that Lee is strong and has been, then said they were \"afraid\" of nerfing him too much.

Vayne has too many tools and is too forgiving for an ADc and as a high skill ceiling champion. \n\nActually, whole stealth rework could be done better. Yes, you could counter stealth with 75 gold ward, but in order to do that you need to buy that ward, you need to wait untill stealth champion comes to you and then it is just an immobile ward. Gold and lower, this was irrelevant because players never did this. Plat and higher you now have lens and nothing else. In other words, sure, you can't counter it with 75 gold, the only way to counter it are lens, which doesn't reveal them and your commons sense. Easy counterplay, no counterplay, both are bad, in my opinion. Of course I know stealth is crucial skill in many assassins kits but there should be one item, one simple item which you can build against them, with long cooldown and small range, so you have to use it wisely and get some advantage thanks to that or waste it completely. \n\nAnyways, you can still reveal them with some champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2016-12-26T20:53:35.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vayne is far from \"too forgiving\" considering she has to get in real close to AA you.

Well, Twich has more with ult and Ashe has 50 more, but still.\n\nThe problem isn't her range, of course. The problem is that her kit has way too much, some of the tools she has shouldn't be on ADc, at least not in the way she has them. For example, stun. Yes, you have to position yourself to do that but it's stun, not snare, not slow, stun. Which marksmen have stun? Ashe, that's all, and that's ult. Kalista, Draven and Quinn, but that is not even a stun. Not to mention it is also a knock-back. She still has dash on top of that. That dash also increases your next auto attack damage, can crit and have short cooldown. Okay, that's fine. True damage. Still fine. Stealth, okay. bonus movement speed while facing enemy. Okay. AD steroid on ult. Everything is fine, but combine it and it's a bit too much for ADc, really. I believe you've seen Vayne going 1v5 and getting penta of it at least once. Any other ADc would get destroyed, even Kog, Jinx or Twitch. \nWhat I want to point out by this isn't that that you can't put Vayne behind, sure you can, she is hyper carry, she has average early game after the Q nerf now. Still, her kit is overloaded, she can misposition and get out of sticky situations just fine. That's what I mean by forgiving. First thing that comes to my mind when you say ADc is high sustained damage and positioning. Positioning and Vayne, we all know how it goes. In my eyes she is not in a good state. I really would like her stealth removed, of course, give her something in return but like this it feels wrong for me, really.","replies":[{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2016-12-26T23:29:48.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Simply because she is Vayne though, the stealth is needed or she will never get any damage off. Her tumble is shorter than most dashes, even slower (movement wise).\n\nIt's kind of unfair to compare Vayne to kog Jinx or Twitch. Obviously they don't have her mobility, but they excel in other areas. I could list the same things you listed for Vayne for them.\nThey might not be able to 1v5 unless they're super ahead and kite well, but with the right frontline and engage they can do even more than Vayne does, and offer more to the team.\nThat's the thing, it's not just \"oh she can 1v5, shes too OP\". Other than assassinating someone or being the late game monster she is, Vayne really brings little to nothing else to the team. \nEven the Q \"buff\" that enables her to hit towers with it, still sets her behind compared to most ADCs in regards to tower taking.\n\nBut to be fair, I can't really disagree with you. If they remove her stealth and give something eles in return I wouldn't mind that. But I wouldn't go as far as saying the stealth on her Ult is the reason she's so \"broken\". She kinda needs it.\nMight sound like shes overloaded but her kit does interact with itself and pretty much every component is needed in my opinion. Like you said though, if they take something away and give something else then that'll be fine. \n\nHaving said all this though, the conversation wasn't really on if Vayne was balanced :p\n\nI was simply pointing out that having a pink ward absolutely counter invisiblity (used Vayne as the first champion that popped in my mind) was a bad choice.\nA single item that cost 75g should never be able to take out someone's abilities, let alone an ultimate, from the situation. And that's what led Riot to change it as a matter of fact.\nSome stealth mechanics were turned into 'camouflage' which reveal the champion if nearby an enemy player or turret.\nThat's perfectly balanced imo.

In fact, I dislike the champion, so I am not objective and it's my opinion. Well, not dislike like I hate her but I just don't like her as champion, because I don't play ADc so much. But back to discussion. xD\n\nVayne would be able to go in and do damage, but she would require more skill to do so because she couldn't be so carefree anymore and that's my main issue with her. Like I said, sustained damage and positioning is the first thing that comes to my mind when you say ADc. Vayne and positioning, well. Without her stealth she couldn't just rely on that to get away from almost everything. She would have to position carefully in order to do damage and survive. Kog must have good positioning else he won't do much damage, because his kit requires little to no movement. If he missposition, he will have to retreat and his damage will rapidly drop. Jinx have more tools, she is pretty mobile and has incredible damage, AoE damage. Still, she has trouble with fighters and tanks. If she want to do a lot of damage she must kill someone before she gets killed to reposition herself. And Twitch still have to position himself to maximalize his ult damage while being somehow safe while using it. You can still disengage if you want. And then we got Vayne. Vayne is a tank shredder. She can si behind her frontline where she is safe while killing enemy frontline, really, really fast. She doesn't even have to care about her positioning because she can easily reposition herself, while still doing great damage be it tank or squishy. She can even peel for herself, or even hard CC the enemy. That's the thing I don't like about her, that's my problem. I don't care about her true damage, it's something that makes her unique, I really don't want this passive to change because it's W what makes Vayne Vayne. Q with insane damage? Allright. self peel/hard CC? Still fine, she needs to position herself at least here to land that CC. Other parts of her kit even feel weak. But I really dislike that stealth. Sure, Twitch have stealth as well, but now it's camouflage and also he can't use it 3-4 times. He also don't have self peel. \n\nAnd that's pretty much why I don't like that. Her kit feels overloaded because of that and that's why I find her so forgiving for an ADc. \n\nAs for invisibility, I agree, but still 75g item (now control ward) takes out abilities - traps. Ultimate in case of Teemo. But that's something else.\nThat's why I would at least add one item to reveal invisible units, with long CD and high cost, let's say 2,5-3k gold which you would have to use at the right time to make it work, because it would be useless after that. Maybe something like old clayvorance. As for camouflaged champions, change to pink ward is irrelevant for them, mostly for Rengar. I keep forgetting about that silouette thingy that appears when invisible target takes damage, that's also something really really good. But it has flaws as well. It could be reworked better, or even worse. We will see what will happen in the future, this is not the first stealth change and I think it's not the last one as well. \n\nAnd by the way, why are we talking about Vayne and stealth rework in Yasuo flame thread? xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
