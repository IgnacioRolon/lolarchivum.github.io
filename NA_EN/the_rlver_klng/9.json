Enter Here!","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":27,"down_votes":5,"body":"https://m.popkey.co/0fe80c/VleJq.gif\n\n##ENTRIES CLOSED! \n\nGreetings everyone! Welcome to the LoL Board&#039;s first ever Crossover Custom Champion Creation Contest! In this contest, I ask for any and all Champion Concepts based off of an existing character of a fictional universe and/or setting and run it by a temporarily anonymous panel of fellow Summoners! If you&#039;re interested at all, read on! Everything is detailed below.\n\nContents: List of Entrants | Prizes | Entry Requirements | How to Enter | Timeline | Scoring | Judges Needed! | FAQ | Support the CCCCC!\n\n**Entrants: (16/30):**\n\n[Jack Spicer, the Evil Boy Genius](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Wxi9Wyuu-jack-spicer-the-evil-boy-genius) by Vanic998\n[Axel, the Flurry of Dancing Blades](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/OHUuvRBT-axel-the-flurry-of-dancing-flames) by AFK Trash\n[Sassy Natu](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/pWtfJO9m-ccccc-entry-sassy-natu) by PhoneS\n[Bowser, the King of Koopas](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/9i9lNHtm-ccccc-bowser-the-king-of-koopas) by Echoing\n[Wario, Treasure Hunter Extraordinaire](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/8VQjdW0F-ccccc-wario-treasure-hunter-extraordinaire) by Doctor Fail\n[Kamek, the Magikoopa](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/g2O3ifxt-ccccc-kamek-the-arch-magikoopa) by Chicken Dynasty\n[Amaterasu, The Celestial Brush God](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/UXAM5tOP-cccc-champion-concept-amaterasu-the-celestial-brush-god) by BowieTheNifty\n[King Dedede, the (Self-Proclaimed) Ruler of Dreamland](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/BTRARO50-champion-concept-king-dedede-the-self-proclaimed-ruler-of-dreamland) by Raxistaicho\n[Samus Aran, the Galactic Bounty Hunter](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/NX0XV6Fi-samus-aran-the-galactic-bountyhunter-for-the-river-kings-crossover-contest) by Alien Primate\n[Flash, the Scarlet Speedster](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ZFLeBEIE-ccccc-flash-the-scarlet-speedster) by iKraytosKlayton\n[Sora, Keeper of the Keyblade](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uJO5AuzE-crossover-concept-sora-keeper-of-the-keyblade) by Secluded Death\n[Dr. Octopus, the Superior Octopus](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/nfWERd5y-ccccc-dr-octopus-the-superior-octopus) by showcase25\n[Darth Vader, the Wrath of the Empire](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/vbOIJ5Ik-ccccc-darth-vader-the-wrath-of-the-empire) by Śovereign\n[Gehrman, the First Hunter](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ctlkwf3R-ccccc-champion-concept-gherman-the-first-hunter?comment=0000) by fugertech\n[Apollyon, the Wisdom of War](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/AOERTrMf-apollyon-the-wisdom-of-war-ccccc-second-entry) by ViceN53\n[Darkseid, the Lord of Apokolips](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/VeEWzAY3-ccccc-darkseid-the-lord-of-apokolips) by Genesis Xero\n\nNote: Don&#039;t hesitate to call out errors, mistakes happen!\n\n**Prizes:**\n\n* Top 3 concepts will be highlighted and praised in the results announcement.\n * ALL entries will have a score associated with their concept in the scoring categories as well as a good chance at feedback and critiques.\n * ALL entries will be referenced in the CCOS Archive to be viewed later in a special subsection!\n\n**Entry Requirements:**\n_For reference, [this post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/yHOTj2dz-cross-over-concept-darth-vader-the-empires-wrath) by Śovereign is generally what I had in mind._\n\n* Limit ONE entry per player.\n* Concept Entries must have been posted in the Year of 2017. If you so happen to have an eligible concept from late 2016, I would be inclined to let it in, however.\n* Concept Entriest MUST BE BASED ON AN EXISTING CHARACTER FROM A FICTIONAL SETTING, BE IT FROM A VIDEO GAME, MOVIE, TV SHOW, BOOK, OR ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE FORM OF MEDIA. \n * Character must be recognizable by me and the judges. No obscure anime or literary characters, please! I cannot judge your concept objectively if I do not know who the character is in the first place. To avoid any disappointments, consider shooting the name of the character by me first. \n * Characters from another MOBA, such as DOTA or Smite, are not allowed.\n * Hypothetically, multiple entries of the same character are allowed, but there must be significant differences in them for the second to be eligible. Two people submitting a concept for Link from Legend of Zelda is fine, but them having essentially the same kit is not. Maybe do Links from different timelines, or try and approach the concept in a unique way that others would not consider. Early bird gets the worm, however, so get started on your concept ASAP!\n* No WIP Concepts please. This contest is here to encourage complete content. WIP Concepts will be disqualified and / or ineligible for points.\n* Concept Entries must be YOURS. If the linked Concept&#039;s author and your name are different, your entry will be disqualified, and / or rendered ineligible for points.\n* All entries must at least have a KIT and OVERVIEW section to be considered a concept. By overview I mean a suitable description of the character, why their kit makes sense in relation to the character, alongside any other information you think is necessary to help me and the judges, judge. More (such as stats, role descriptions, quotes, gameplay descriptions, etc.) would be needed to become highly competitive, but to proceed to judging, you need at least that, and there is nothing wrong with simply a minimum. Concepts without these requirements by the time judging begins will be considered a WIP Concept, and thus disqualified and / or ineligible for points.\n* The first 30 entries will be taken. Any posts above that limit will not be entered. Sorry!\n* Entrants can be disqualified and / or be ineligible for points based on rude behavior towards other entrants / judges (though negative feedback, so long as it is constructive, is fine), as well as disregarding of the Universal Forum Rules (no, porn is NOT a legitimate reference image, and characters from franchises that are not appropriate to forum rules may also be at risk for disqualification). Other major problems may also qualify.\n\n**How to Enter:**\n\n1) Post your concept normally within the Skin &amp; Champion Concepts Board, if it&#039;s not already posted.\n2) Reply to THIS POST with a link to Step 1.\n3) Wait for me to reply with &quot;Entry Confirmed!&quot;. If it takes more than a few days for me to reply, don&#039;t hesitate to remind me! I might&#039;ve missed you!\n4) Watch the &quot;Current Entrants&quot; List above and double check that you&#039;re up there, if you are, then you&#039;re in!\n\nNote: There is max of THIRTY slots.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n4/26/17 - CCCCC begins, entries taken\n5/15/17 - Entry period closes, judging begins.\n5/25/17 - Judging ends\n5/26/17 - Results announced, next themed contest announced\n\n**Scoring:**\nScoring is based on this rubric*:\n\n(Max) Category\n\n(20) Balance\n\n(25) Thematic Appropriateness to the Character\n\n(20) Uniqueness\n\n(20) Cohesiveness of Kit\n\n(15) Effort\n\n(+10) Good Neighbor Bonus (LEAVE A LINK! No link = 0 points!)\n\n(100+10) Total per judge\n\nNote: If you have any questions on a category, we&#039;d be happy to go into more detail.\n\n_*Categories may change based on feedback._\n\nAs before, leave useful feedback on a fellow entrant&#039;s concept, then make sure the judges have a way to find it easily.\n\n**Judges Needed:**\nSo if you&#039;re at all interested in judging this month, e-mail me at thegreatclockwyrm@gmail.com; and I&#039;ll give you more info. I encourage lots of questions! I ALWAYS need more judges, and there is no detriment to stop trying and walk away halfway through (because a lot can come up over the course of a month).\n\nI do ask that all judges fill out the rubric and provide feedback for every champion. If you don&#039;t, I can&#039;t accept your scores.\n\n##FAQ:\n\n**But I&#039;ve never made a Concept before....**\n\nHonestly, just give it your best shot. Try searching up entries from our other champion concept, the CCOS, and look at what won first place. Focus on a character you feel you can embody well as a League champion and work to make a kit that is both balanced and thematically appropriate. Always feel free to ask questions, and definitely consider working on a submission for the upcoming May CCOS and seeing how it goes.\n\nOr just reference [Sir ArmaMalum&#039;s Introduction to Champion Concepts](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/X7h3YX5c-guide-introduction-to-champion-concept-making). That works too.\n\n**I have a WIP Concept...**\n\nFeel free to post and work on your Concept as much as you want. It&#039;s not technically entered until you provide the link to the entries thread. Just make sure you&#039;re not the 31st entry or beyond, and that the Concept is based on an existing character.\n\n**I don&#039;t have a Concept, and I don&#039;t have time to judge, but I want to help!**\n\nThis is still cool. The single best way for you to help is to give feedback. Negative or positive, just make sure it&#039;s constructive, and that the author can use it effectively if they choose to do so.\n\n**Can I change my Concept after entry?**\n\nAs encouraging feedback and Concept participation is a major motive behind this contest, I encourage iterating on a Concept, HOWEVER you have to be able to argue it&#039;s still the same champion, so no major changes. Otherwise, it will have to count as a new entry, with your previous entry being disqualified. Please keep in mind that your entry doesn&#039;t start until you provide the link here; If you want feedback before entering I advise you to simply post it normally, and provide the link when you feel you&#039;re ready. Just be sure to enter before the entry period ends, and before we hit 30 entries!\n\n**Does that mean I can&#039;t swap out my Concept completely?**\n\nNo. So long as there&#039;s still room left, you can completely swap out your Concept. If we&#039;re at 30 entries and you want to change, then I can&#039;t allow that.\n\n**Should I drop out?**\n\nYou can, but there&#039;s no opportunity cost to staying in, so I&#039;d recommend you just go the distance.\n\n**Can I change my Concept after judging starts?**\n\nYes, but this may not be the smartest thing to do. The judges peruse the entries at their own pace once judging begins, in whatever order they desire. This means there is no guarantee that your changes will be seen by every judge. If you do make changes, especially late in the judging period, you have to be prepared for a score that does not accurately reflect your final Concept.\n\n**Support the CCCCC:**\nSpread the word! This is a new contest, and I&#039;m sure could be off-putting at first. Provide links to it where you can and buoy the spirits of those who would be interested in joining! Foster discussion about possible characters to use and do research on how they play in their video game franchise (or if they were not originally a video game character, try and find a game they have been in or a scene in a movie, TV show, or book that showcases their prowess). Definitely put a link on your entry. This lets the CCCCC accrue more visibility without anyone needing to spam reminders. This is by no means a requirement, but thanks to anyone who does help out!\n\nAbove all else, have fun!","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2017-04-29T02:13:53.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZEV84o_E7U\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/BTRARO50-champion-concept-king-dedede-the-self-proclaimed-ruler-of-dreamland","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Fail","date":"2017-04-27T06:04:10.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"[\"I'm-a Wario!

However, characters from a MOBA, even if they have different ability systems, are already sort've half-completed for you, and thus it would not be fair.\n\nIf you wanted to run something by me before submitting, I would be happy to in the very least consider. But for the time being I think we should keep characters from other MOBAs off the table. Other video game franchises and types are fair game, of course.\n\nPersonally I want to see someone do Olimar from Pikmin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanic998","date":"2017-08-01T00:31:48.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who's the winner?","replies":[]}]}
