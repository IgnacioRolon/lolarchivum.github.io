I mean, they work thematically and all and they are definitely great skins in their own right, but a) Tristana already has 7 skins, one of which was released relatively recently by LoL standards and is a Legendary. The same goes for Morgana, with eight skins, one of which that was also released relatively recently and has great effects and art for a 975.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile plenty of champions haven&#039;t gotten skins in years, or have sat on 1-3 skins while not being recent at all. Illaoi is certainly due for a skin now that champions like Kindred and Ekko have gotten theirs. Those that come to mind include Galio, Urgot, Syndra, Cassiopeia, Yorick, Karthus, TK, Swain, Viktor, Vel&#039;Koz, Shen, Vladimir, Mordekaiser, Skarner, Heimerdinger, and Singed, among others, I&#039;m sure. Any one of those champions would have been perfect candidates for these skins.\r\n\r\nIn short I understand Riot is a company designed around making profits off of a free-to-play game but it would be nice if some other champions got to have skins instead of the same few popular ones, or in the very least ones that haven&#039;t gotten high-price skins recently or don&#039;t have many in the first place. Underplayed champions have mains too, you know, and they enjoy skins as much as the Lees, Annies, and Ahris, so I hope the Skin Team remembers that for the next batch of cool skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-10-04T23:11:02.178+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Did you factor in the possibility that some of these champs may have skins already in the works?

Great job.\n\nI get salty every time I see the same old champions getting high-quality skins, being part of amazing skin lines, and getting attention year after year. You have an entire list of champions that need skins, but all you can do is give the same champions high-dollar and well-made skins every year. This is an issue the community has been presenting to you for years now.\n\nI don't think you understand how frustrating it is to see Jinx and Lulu get a Star Guardian skin, when they already have a plethora of 1350 skins with great effects and part of other skins lines. You have champions that  fit the theme better and could have easily taken Jinx's spot as an antagonist in the story. You decided to write a character that makes no sense as a Star Guardian . . . . as a Star Guardian . . . . when say Syndra or someone else could have been that spot. You have other champions, like Karma, that could have been a Star Guardian . . . . since you know it kind of fits her theme and she doesn't have a 1350 skin or skin with great character. It's ok though. Will get another low-quality skin for specific champions while Ekko, Jinx, Lulu, Lux, Sona, Ahri, Annie, Teemo and other champions will get the high dollar skins with great character, particle effects, creativity, a great storyline, and media. While other champions like Viktor, Zyra, Cass, Karma, Heimer, and many more . . . can only receive 750 to 900 RP skins. I mean Jinx and Lulu both have 2 1350 skins now. Ekko, Sona, Lulu, and other champions are all part of well designed, creative and interesting skin lines. Stop saying you will continue to be fair and give us skins for all of these champions, when none of these champions line up with what you actually care about.\n\nThe community knows what you like to market and bring to the mass. I will use my main as an example. Is Karma going to be as popular as Jinx? No. Because the time and effort you put into jinx year after year is more than Karma. Jinx has an amazing personality and storyline. Jinx has a completed visual update with a good theme, particle effects, proper running animations, and more. Jinx has 2 1350 skins and is part of two really well-done skin lines. Jinx has a music video and media to advertise the champion. How do Karma and other champions even have a chance when you cannot even get a simple rework 3 years ago . . . . right? There you go. You did the same thing with Ekko to. Riot, you choose who you want to make popular in this game and you market it that way. If you spent even an ounce of time on unpopular and hardly worked on champions,  you would have a better roster of champions to work with skin wise. You don't. You have excuses as to why this said champion is getting two 1350 skins within a two-year timeline and another champion is only allowed to have a 750 or 900 or not get a skin at all. You have excuses. You don't have actual reasons or care about champion diversity in skins. You give the same champions the best skins every year and you ignore and give the other spectrum of champions the most unimaginative, bland and uncreative skins.\n\nI am already calling next year skin line choices:\n\nProject: Lulu, Lux, and Jinx.\n\nStar Guardian: Ahri, Annie, and Sona\n\nThe spectrum of your work is amazing. I love all of the skins you create for the specific champions you do every year. What the community has a problem with is your unwillingness to give other champions the same opportunities to shine. You do know there are Zyra and Cass mains out there right? You do know that Jinx, Teemo, and Lulu all have received 1350+ skins within a year and a half, right? You need to swallow your very big pride and start at least giving us more options in terms of skins. Stop creating low budget and bland skins for unpopular champions, but giving two 1350 well done and creative skins to Jinx and Lulu within a year and a half. Chocies Riot Games.

I can take for granted that I see much more than players do; a team of passionate people that care so much about what they do, the specific restraints and challenges they face as well as Riot's overall challenges, all the upcoming plans as far out as 2018, the data points between what I read online from players and players actual behaviour, skins that got cancelled for a number if reasons etc. This is one of the main reasons I keep coming to the forums, s@20, reddit, inven, even youtube comments; to try and maintain that perspective and not lose touch.\n\nI also have to admit, as someone that works a lot on trying to make 750's as great as they can be, and goes into meetings with the list of Champs that haven't got a skin since I started and representing them, it does hurt to hear them considered bland and to be told I don't care.

Simply put, Riot's statements on skin priority don't reconcile with what's coming off the assembly line. Here's a quick summary of the major complaints based on apparent contradictions:\n\n1) **Skin priority goes in order based on time since last release, from longest to shortest. Total number of skins also considered. Esports skins are not calculated in the skin priority.**\n\nThis is your standard complaint. Of the 10 champs who have gone the longest without a new skin, 7 of them have had (or will have) full VGU. The other three are Swain, Viktor, and Zyra, all of whom are near or past 3 years between skins.\n\nMeanwhile, you have Ahri getting Challenger, Academy, and Arcade in the span of 18 months. You have Draven getting Pool Party, Beast Master, and DRAVEN in the span of _ten months_. Then you have champs not only getting multiples but getting multiples in highly-coveted or high-price point lines, like Ahri, Lulu, Trist, Jinx, Teemo (thanks, btw!), etc. \n\nThe Cursed Revenant skins are beautiful, imo, but they aren't flashy enough for Nocturne players to feel like 3.5 years was worth the wait. Players talk shit about good work because they don't know how to communicate that expectations increase as more time passes.\n\n2) **Exceptions to the priority order are made based on inspiration and theme.**\n\nThis is another hard thing to reconcile when you consider Swain, Viktor, and Zyra. All of them have very strong themes and lots of particles/models. Viktor seems like an obvious candidate for a Dragon Trainer, Arclight, or Project skin. Beatrice is just begging to be made into a bat or a Poro or a sass-talking skull. Zyra was a great fit for Arcade, Program, Void, and Elderwood. Plus, people have been begging for a Death Blossom Zyra for yeeeears.\n\nThe inspiration thing makes sense when you have DRAVEN Draven and Hellspawn Teemo. Like, people get that. Bewitching Tristana not so much, even though it's a great skin. \n\n3) **No skins for reworks or upcoming reworks.**\n\nProject Katarina and Program Soraka sort of negate any MYMU explanation for Zyra, Vik, and Swain. \n\nLastly, as a Zyra player this is especially frustrating because her skins were really low resolution, and Wildfire was pretty poorly done all around. I also played Lissandra and didn't mind as much that she didn't have many skins because they were all very distinct and extremely cool. \n\nZyra's base is great now, but when she had no attention for 3 years, it was a big disappointment that Wildfire couldn't even get the kind of touch-up that SG Lux is getting now.\n\nHope that explains a bit better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-10-05T19:03:23.587+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why should we think the skins team cares when certain champs have not gotten any skin attention in 3+ years?

If Viktor theoretically  had 3 canceled skins over the past 3 years which equated to 0 actual skin releases, I as a Viktor player shouldn't have to care that there were 3 canceled skins.

The best thing you can do for Karma is at least complete her visual update and give her an appearance that stands out. She doesn't necessarily need a kit update.

These are all skins that take Karma out of her usual bulky armor and bland theme . . . . and into another creative light. That is the problem with Karma since day one of her rework. The balance and update team took away every bit of character from Karma they could . . . . to give us a champion that goes know where does nothing, doesn't represent anything, and is incomplete. She is a one-dimensional champion with a bland visual update and personality. The skin team doesn't seem to understand this either because you gave us Warden Karma which offered nothing.\n\nWhen the balance and update team gives Karma a character and theme, it might be easier for you guys to do your job and easier for us to help you.

Risen Karthus (akin to Fiddlesticks) could be cool, too.\n\n* **As an Illaoi secondary **(since she hasn't gotten her first post-launch skin yet): honestly, I'm not sure. An \"Elderwood Priestess\"/Druid/Earthrune Illaoi that wields gigantic enchanted vines as an emissary of an Elderwood Nagakabouros would be awesome and fit her theme as a promoter of life.

You give the same champions the best skins every year and you ignore and give the other spectrum of champions the most unimaginative, bland and uncreative skins.\n> \n> I am already calling next year skin line choices:\n> \n> Project: Lulu, Lux, and Jinx.\n> \n> Star Guardian: Ahri, Annie, and Sona\n> \n> The spectrum of your work is amazing. I love all of the skins you create for the specific champions you do every year. What the community has a problem with is your unwillingness to give other champions the same opportunities to shine. You do know there are Zyra and Cass mains out there right? You do know that Jinx, Teemo, and Lulu all have received 1350+ skins within a year and a half, right? You need to swallow your very big pride and start at least giving us more options in terms of skins. Stop creating low budget and bland skins for unpopular champions, but giving two 1350 well done and creative skins to Jinx and Lulu within a year and a half. Choices Riot Games. Choices.\n\nVery well and comprehensive post. I can't agree more all of your words.\n\nI'm very surprised that so many ppl still believe that the only reason the team hasn't given some champs a new skin is that they are not fitting the theme. It 's really ridiculous that only certain group of champs keep fitting theme than the others more and more. \n\ni'm not saying Riot has been lying to us but they tell us half of the story because Champion popularity plays a really big part of their decision.  More or less or even bigger than which champs fitting the theme. Some of Rioter told us that they were even arranged a meeting for finding a concept for Cotton Fizz skin.  The meeting was meant for that issue only. After that you know the rest of the story.\n\nYeah they are running their business. They can do what ever they want to make their profits. Unfortunately, As a customer. The only thing we can do is complaining.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"T8 Speedwagon","date":"2016-10-05T03:38:15.024+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please tell us that we will get this year a jhin skin.

There are larger priorities such as Galio, Urgot,  and Evelynn. Galio is confirmed, ans now apparently so is Urgot, but Evelynn has been heavily heavily implied to be getting one next year as well.

Last skin was a limited skin in 2014, before that she had a skin in 2013 and her release skin. Overall she may be the most ignored champ when it comes to skins, considering she has a grand total of 2 in the shop and neither are particularly appealing.

And by modern I mostly mean 'does it have a unique recall animation?'  If not, then it's really not up to the current standards Riot has set and probably shouldn't be counted quite as heavily.  Doubly so if the skin isn't available for purchase anymore.
