Lux was the champion that fit the best for this fantasy and since her last skin was over a year ago we felt ok with adding her to the group for this year, and she is also an extremely popular champion in countries that celebrate Lunar New Year, so we also feel these players will appreciate having her be part of this celebration.

Granted, not everyone's favorite would be selected, and as such, not everyone would be super happy about the result, but imo, having a voice in voting is better than having us say, 'here's an Illaoi skin, kthxbai.'

Some champions that you've named had pending reworks in 2017, such as Eve and Urgot, which made them ineligible for new skins. Swain's currently sitting on that waitlist right now. We tried to tackle some of the champion who needed love last year - Viktor, Cassiopeia, Yorick, to name a few. We have a ton planned for 2018, and I can assure you we've considered champions who haven't seen a new skin in a while. \n\n**Xayah and Rakan skins, though?**\n\nWe felt that this was a no brainer for this year's Valentine's Day skins. They're *love birds*. They're an adorable couple in Runeterra, it seemed like a really good fit!

'Oh, we chose Lux because we needed a female arbiter-like champion.' Okay.....that doesn't explain why Lux specifically though. With no other context, such as if other female champs who have gone a while without skins, like Taliyah and Camille, were getting theirs as we speak, I can't be at peace with this decision. It just feels like a cash grab for China. Both Taliyah and Camille would have worked wonderfully with this theme and had really cool effects - imagine Taliyah riding a spiraling gold/white/blue wall with the Lunar accents. Again, because you are withholding information from us about skins that may or may not be in production, you're doubling the frustration that not only is Lux getting a skin a year after her ultimate, but also in place of other characters that require a skin more. It's worded a little differently in your product owner's response, but he's essentially saying you're making this skin because it's going to sell well in China - which isn't a terrible thing, but still a little shady that y'all aren't willing to own up to it and let us know that yes, Taliyah and Camille are getting skins soon as well, and good ones at that. \n\n> What's the deal with the Illaoi skin?\n> \n> We realized that Illaoi had waited quite some time for a skin, and felt that letting players vote for a thematic would be a great way to involve the community, as opposed to just popping a new skin on PBE. We submitted three concepts that were vastly different from each other to give everyone a variety to choose from. Granted, not everyone's favorite would be selected, and as such, not everyone would be super happy about the result, but imo, having a voice in voting is better than having us say, 'here's an Illaoi skin, kthxbai.' This project also enables us to really show what goes into creating a skin, which may shed some light on why we make choices, why things do and don't work, etc.\n\nOf the three, I voted for Battlecast, and so I will probably purchase the skin when it comes out as Illaoi is one of my main champions. I think the idea of the vote is an okay one, but I really feel that the three choices y'all presented us were a little underwhelming. Over the last few years, we've had an insane amount of extremely cool Illaoi concepts - they're practically biweekly in Concepts and Creations. She's an extremely unique champ with a lot of moving parts, like Zyra or Heimerdinger, and so it makes sense for her skins to be a big effort y'all can't do as often as, say, a visually simple champ like Warwick. Still though, the Indiana Jones and Deep Space ones seemed a little underwhelming, and the Battlecast one I'm afraid will turn out visually loud and off putting like her Void skin. I'm sorry if the way I worded my phrase seemed ungrateful, because I'm going to look forward to an Illaoi skin of any shape, but it feels wrong to give us three skin concepts no one asked for and force us to choose amongst them when there were so many much better designs on the table, such as Elderwood or Gatekeeper or even Wacky Inflatable Tube Man. I like you alll showing us your process, but I feel like these designs weren't the best you could have given us.\n\n> Okay, but there are a bunch of champions who are in desperate need of skins.\n> \n> You're absolutely right. Some champions that you've named had pending reworks in 2017, such as Eve and Urgot, which made them ineligible for new skins. Swain's currently sitting on that waitlist right now. We tried to tackle some of the champion who needed love last year - Viktor, Cassiopeia, Yorick, to name a few. We have a ton planned for 2018, and I can assure you we've considered champions who haven't seen a new skin in a while.\n\nAgain, I feel you're dodging the issue. Sure, Eve and Urgot got their VGU's recently. So has Swain. But all three of those champs have gone literal years without a skin. It seems backwards for you to punish those players and not give them a skin for all those years because they were slated for a VGU, and then also after because they 'just' got one. I realize that there's a V in VGU that involves updating old skins, but that doesn't exactly make up for lack of new content or intentionally ignoring a champ for years even though their VGU is a long time off. You also didn't even touch on the other issue - non VGU champs not getting skins. Sure, Cass, Viktor, and Yorick got one skin apiece, but lots of people who play those champions don't like those skins, complained about them, and some problems were never even addressed (most embarassingly with Yorick). And you have to admit that the whole Janna skin thing was a total bait. You can't post a picture of a floating spirit sword and not expect people to think it's a Shen skin. That's like posting a picture of Nasus' halberd thingy and then saying 'whoops, lol, it's a Vel'Koz skin, you guys are so silly'. You also can't post a video with a huge dragon head on the door and not expect people to be pissed when its a Lux skin. I've said this over and over again, but it's just not okay for y'all to be a multibillion dollar company and have a skin system this disjointed, infrequent, and biased. You can't keep making empty promises about 'considering' champs or that they're 'on the table' but then give us two Master Yi skins in a row.\n\n> Xayah and Rakan skins, though?\n> \n> We felt that this was a no brainer for this year's Valentine's Day skins. They're love birds. They're an adorable couple in Runeterra, it seemed like a really good fit! This pairing of skins - Sweetheart - was one of the most suggested thematics from players for these two when they first released.\n\nIf you go around saying 'well, they just fit the theme so well' for only popular champs and continue to leave the same unpopular ones without skins, then you need to hire more conceptual artists. That's a fact. People have suggested PROJECT Shen since the theme started, but you gave it to Jhin, and if that isn't favoritism, I don't know what is. People wanted Star Guardian Taliyah, but you gave it to Ahri. People have been begging for Dragon Tamer Swain (and at one point didn't y'all promise it, years ago?), and yet here we are at his VGU and it looks like its going to be several more years after that. \n\n> Riot's a business.\n> \n> Yep, we are, but we truly do strive to be the most player focused games company in the world. I understand that we aren't perfect and that we do fall short at times - who doesn't?\n\nYou said you welcome constructive feedback - here it is. You all aren't doing a good job of being player focused.

Dev Corner is great, you guys responding to threads like these is great, but it's not enough.

So to be completely honest, I look at the initial iteration of a LITERAL \"rectangle cut from an otherwise complete shirt with the intention to show off cleavage\" was a mistake on my part. While it's a very prominent design choice made in lots of character costuming in our game and others, it undermined what I was really trying to get at: that in this world Illaoi is a survivor-turned-resistance fighter squaring off against monstrosities of epic proportions. Thinking about what my intent was for that detail on her costuming, it's clear I was channeling every female survivor protagonist from blockbuster films, hit tv shows and classic games (that I can't name due to legal reasons). All of them have very similar elements in their design and something as simple as a tank top signals that feeling of surviving, having full range of movement, etc. Where the design is currently isn't a \"look she has boobs!\" detail, it's an intentional design choice that's been refined and discussed both here on the boards with you guys as well as between us internally.\n\nThe other side of this rather touchy subject, especially in today's social climate, is that bigger women might feel it's offensive to HAVE TO cover up a character like Illaoi. I have a friend back home where I'm from who was super excited to see that there was a \"big girl\" body type being treated equally for once in her costuming. Look at other games and movies where there is a big, or muscular woman as a featured character... they're always seemingly covered up. What I took from that conversation is that while the intent to shield a female's characterization is super admirable, making assumptions that she should arbitrarily be covered completely is at best close minded.\n\nUltimately this is one of the zillions of reasons we wanted to include you guys in the process. If we created this skin behind closed doors, I'm confident we would've eventually came to a similar conclusion. That being said, the ability to field a simple 2D sketch to our players before even entering production and building her has been both a huge eye opener and an awesome challenge that I feel we've met head on.
