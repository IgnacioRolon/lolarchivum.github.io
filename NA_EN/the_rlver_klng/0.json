I may not be 100% fine with their kits but their personalities and interactions are top notch. You&#039;d be surprised how many sexual innuendos these two can squeeze into an hour of dialogue and a rated T game.\n\nLore, art, and VO teams get exponentially better with each release and rework, I&#039;m telling you. Rakan&#039;s first 15 minutes of dialogue is pure nightmare fuel but otherwise the two of them are frickin&#039; adorable.

I'm 99.9% sure that the VO file is fully loaded in memory when the game starts, and even if it wasn't, it makes no sense to have all versions of the same trigger consecutively, because it is very unlikely that you will use all of them in a row, to the contrary. The only thing that would be impacted is that it would be a tiny bit less practical to **write** the code for the human scripters when hooking the champ. But the efficiency of the client?

Keeping the same structure and simply putting the \"Taunt\" triggers or whatever as the first category would solve the problem people like me are complaining about here. It's simple, and it doesn't change a SINGLE thing to the efficiency or quality of the client.\n\nIn fact, the VO file could be in a totally random order, that wouldn't change anything to the efficiency of the client. The only thing that would change is that it would be tedious to write the mapping between a timer in the VO file and a trigger event in-game, so probably more mistakes due to human errors, but still absolutely no efficiency issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2017-04-24T02:04:25.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In my experience, people who have PHDs in \"Comp Sci\" don't how to develop.
