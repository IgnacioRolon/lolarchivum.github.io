It might look like a fast forward of everything until it catches up.  I recommend using Windowed Fullscreen if possible.  It also wouldn't hurt to make sure that all of your [drivers are up to date](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq1) as well to make sure everything is running smoothly.

Happens to me in a lot of games, that's why I usually always use borderless.\n\nWhen you go from the desktop (with all the windows n crap) to the game (which is fullscreen) since the game screen isn't \"open\" like when you use borderless it has to load first, at least that's what I think is happening.","replies":[]}]}
