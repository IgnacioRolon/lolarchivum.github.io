Explain to me how a melee marksman would be good? Considering ranged marksman complain they die everytime someone gets on top of them, I wonder how a melee marksman would do if he has to let them get on top of him to do dmg? Nice fix.\n\n\"He has not one, not two, not three but FOUR DEFENSIVE MEANS IN ONE KIT\"\nI dont want to assume to this so if you wanna clear up what these defensive means are because i know his shield and his wall.\n\n\"able to cancel almost every ranged attack in the game for a few seconds\"\njust every 20 seconds no such thing as actually baiting it out and playing around your champs strengths but... yeah continue on...\n\n\"being a tank-buster\"\nYou mean in a 1v1 late game against a tank? An adc with bt or bork and lord dominks can do that too guess all carries need a rework god forbid anyone can 1v1 a tank...\n\n\"highly mobile\"???\nIn lane with a ton of minions where dashing through them pushes the wave and puts him in a bad position in lane unless you push back?? Yea i guess you would see no drawbacks in that.\n\n\"having point and click crowd control that can affect multiple people\"\nwhich yasuo are you playing? I didnt know he had a point a click cc?? Is this new? maybe on the pbe??\n\n\"decent or greater wave-clear\"\n\"greater\" i mean he doesnt come anywhere near xerath lux syndra ziggs or anivia at wave clearing but i guess yea if you let a champion auto attack minions they should die...\n\n\"has synergy with any champion possessing a knockup or displacement\"\nthats an issue? because he works well with champions? Ori works well with malphite and shen is that an issue too? Does she need a rework for that? J4 as well pretty much any initiator \n\n\"low cooldown abilities\"\ncompared to what? on what his Q? his E? or his R? Lux cdr on ult can get to 20 seconds and lower she has a cc on a 4 sec cd thats okay but the melee guy that has to get in your face to Q cant be on 1.33 seconds? or his E where you cant redash through a target until a certain amount of time has passed i guess they need to change udyr's stun too then.\n\n\"HIGHER RANGE THAN TYPICAL MELEES\"\nAre you referring to his nado? thats up only a 3rd of the time if he's Q'ing constantly? Or just in general his skill shot Q distance? Either way i wouldnt call having a little bit of range on an ability on issue. \n\n\"and did I miss something...I probably did but I lost track\"\n\n\"they've gutted his stats from their release values and he's still a major threat in the game...that says something\"\nSo you're using your opinion as support for your claim?\nI dont find him a major threat at all.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-03-01T23:57:15.221+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"oriana's ultimate is conditional, requiring the opponents to be in close proximity and for her team to have the perfect setup to work with it \n\nYasuo's wind-wall is unconditional, unless we enter some odd meta where there are no ranged matchups for him to take advantage of ?

And technically in melee matchups you want to let the wave push to just outside your tower to make the enemy mid laner open to ganking and deny him farm because he cant walk under your tower to farm your casters. If we're talking about landing skill shots if you cant land a skill shot while yasuo is dashing at you then you need to see an eye doctor im sorry if you take that as a toxic but hes literally moving in a direction towards your character and cant change paths or cast wind wall during the time. By doing dmg to the minion wave which he has to if he wants to dash through a minion it starts a subtle push in your favor an the more times he dashes the faster it'll push problem with this elo we're talking about is players push it right back to keep it in a sweet spot for him and how do they do it? Using their mana so they run out of mana then start complaining that hes resourceless. Sound familiar to an argument you heard from someone on here?\n\npoint and click crowd control: Look up what point and click crowd control is. Point and click refers to something like teemo blind or veigar ult where if you displace the character the ability will follow its 100% chance of landing. Yasuo's nado isnt. And furthermore, this would be a mistake for playing against yasuo to be in range of him to E his target while his nado is up.\n\nsynergy: im not gonna go too deep into this because you're basically talking about chaining crowd control which if you're playing correctly you can chain crowd control with champions besides yasuo. (malphite zyra ultis, morg and lux binds, any 2 stuns, cho knockup with any other cc) basically any cc with another cc can be chained together so saying that he chains his cc with someone else's ulti is basically like saying hes playing the game the way it should be played.\n\ncooldowns: yasuo's Q starts on a 4 second cooldown(and is reduced by attack speed, netting him one of the most efficient build paths in the game...) \nWhat does \"most efficient build paths in the game\" even mean in this context? Lux builds ap and gets cdr with it dropping her abilities to 4 sec cd while increaseing her dmg a great deal same as yasuo. And the same can be said for other mages or tanks that scale off health (maokai) or armor (malphite). So why is it that yasuo's is the most efficient build??\n\nhis windwall which is more powerful than many ultimate abilities and just as useful as some of the most powerful ultimates in the game is only on a starting cooldown of 26 seconds\nThats just a striaght opinion so if you want me to respond with my own opinion it could also be one of the most useless abilities in the game. (In the case of malzahar it blocks none of his abilities) Its fairly easy to play around and doesn't buff yasuo or cc the enemy or deal dmg in any way.\n\nhigher attack range: how many people can actually kite with yasuo's auto attack effectively. In most melee matchups if you get in that range your going to be auto'd regardless this is nitpicking and just wantng to complain about something on his kit.\n\nIf you count his Q, which remember is only on a 4 second cooldown BEFORE ANY ATTACK SPEED ITEMS, he has 475 range with hit and 900 range with the tornado, which for some reason counts as an auto attack until after the first champion hit and then the info is confusing\ni dont even know what the point of this part is? The atk range doesnt really become an issue till he has his nado and even his nado will only be up 33% of the game if hes constnatly Q'ing a target. So majority of the time he doesnt even have the 900 range.

Yasuo might push the wave, but if he is pushing the wave, are you going to let him farm?  If you are close enough to auto attack, he is close enough to attack you and should you miss with your ability, you are likely going to push back against the wave.  He also does not have to use it to push the wave, only to dodge your skillshots\n> \n> point and click crowd control:  didn't you know that his Q can be used during sweeping strike, turning it into a targeted spin attack area of effect knockup ?  even if he chooses NOT to do that, he is then at point blank range to use his crowd control anyway\n> \n> wave clear:  you just argued FOR YASUO'S WAVE CLEAR, now you are arguing AGAINST IT?!\n> \n> knockup synergy:  it's an issue for yasuo because his power is based around his Q being the only source he has to engage with for his ultimate.

Lux's ultimate is at 50...  He gets TWO ULTIMATES IN HIS KIT AND BOTH ARE LOW COOLDOWN\n> \n> higher attack range:  yasuo's attack range is the second highest of all melee champions, only trumped by Irelia and BOTH are able to kite using this small advantage during trades.

Saying an ability can determine a teamfight is straight opinion and theres no way to quantify the value of an ability in a teamfight. Sure if we see a teamfight you can say \"WOW look how much that windwall did\" but at the same time thats only specific to that fight. Thresh and blitz hook can win  fight, A good ap lux W can literally win a fight from how beefy she makes her entire team for 500 ap she gives 600 hp shields at max benefit thats 3k effective hp  on a 6/5.5 second cooldown it lasts for 3 seconds meaning your basically going without a shield for 2.5 seconds. And she still deals insane dmg while making her entire team tanky as hell. Yasuo's windwall lasts for 3.75 seconds meaning if a team just peels back past the windwall if the enemy team chases the ability is gone the only time windwall is actually impactful is when it is timed perfectly to block a big ability. Its funny how people bring up the enemy team misplaying for the things i mention to work but they dont say anything about brainless the enemy team has to be to sit there and watch a wall block their attacks and they continue to sit there instead of repositioning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Light Burner","date":"2019-03-02T19:35:48.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Minimac2000,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ApTEofvg,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2019-03-02T18:37:38.258+0000)\n>\n> Every single ___ could win a team fight by ___ example you gave was winning a teamfight with an ULT\n> YASUO WINDWALL IS.
