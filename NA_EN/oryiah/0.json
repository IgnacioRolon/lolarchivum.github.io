Before you flame/judge what I have to say, please at least read through a little of it. I'm not doing this to get attention for myself. I don't wanna add anyone or duo with anyone who reads this. I'm trying to give my perspective on a situation that I think sucks. I'm also not claiming to speak for all girls in the gaming community. Just me and a few that I've run into. \r\n\r\nI can remember the first time I played this. I was never good at sports in school because I was painfully shy and socially awkward. I suffered from extreme anxiety attacks and I hated being the center of attention. But I always wanted to be a part of a team. League of Legends gave me that without the anxiety or fear. It's been _great_.  But after trying out 3 different communities I just decided to give up on finding one that didn't degrade me or make me feel like less of a human being by people who didn't even know me or give me a chance. \r\n\r\nYes, there are some girls who want to meet guys or get attention on League for an emotional or confidence boost. There are also many, many _**guys**_ who do this. I can't tell you how many posts I see in a given day from guys looking for girls to play with. But the truth is, most girls who play league just really like the game. \r\n\r\nWe just want to be able to hang out with you guys and play. Yes, most of you are _guys_ and that's just the way it is. So, we want to be able to joke and trash talk without the insults immediately going to slut jokes or degrading sexual comments. It does make us uncomfortable even if we pretend it doesn't. We're the minority in the community and so it's hard for us to join in on your calls/chats knowing that going in we're gonna stand out. It can take a lot of bravery on our part to try. Trust me. But we want to be your friends and to fit in. Trash talk us about our gameplay or whatever, but please don't degrade us. We really don't want to make it with every nice guy we come across. \r\n\r\nI'm not asking you to treat us like delicate little flowers. I'm just asking that you realize that the degrading comments/jokes very often do make us extremely uncomfortable. Yet, if we say so, we're being a \"sensitive girl baby whiny typical woman.\"  So most of the time we don't say anything.","replies":[{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2017-05-05T15:56:37.191+0000","up_votes":106,"down_votes":4,"body":"I, myself don't care if you're a boy, girl, dog, tree, or whatever, all I care about is having fun with nice people.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-05-05T16:11:49.182+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AgeOfTheMage,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Wd6eHx8c,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-05T15:56:37.191+0000)\n>\n> I, myself don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re a boy, girl, dog, tree, or whatever, all I care about is having fun with nice people.\n\n...does a tree count as a \"nice person?\" I feel there's an inherent contradiction between the \"tree\" and \"person\" parts. :P\n\nBut yeah.

Friendship creates a familiarity that helps us know that we can pick on a friend who is overweight and they will know it's good-natured.  Most of the time on League we are playing with total strangers, not friends.  Would you walk down the street and pick on passersby for their weight, political beliefs, and race?  I certainly hope not, but that's really what you are doing if you mock other League players for such things in game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZER0 2","date":"2017-05-05T18:33:34.546+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to think that this was bullshit because I never had problems with it myself as a female gamer, but as soon as I created another account that had a female-esque name, I've never been more flamed in my life.\nAlmost every single game someone points out I'm a girl or asks if I'm a girl (and if i say I'm not to try to avoid the situation, they call me a \"%%%got\" because of the name), and almost every single game I get flamed for it, whether it's by my team or not. \nBlaming my mistakes on my gender, the enemy team saying it'll be an easy time, saying I'm a waste of a woman because I'm not out sucking dick or in the kitchen, saying they'll find me and rape me, or that they're raping me by destroying me in game, and if I say something about it, then I'm a \"triggered\" or a \"feminist\" or a \"libtard cuck bitch\".\nI've never seen anything like it, and you're right, it's horrible and it needs to stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Oryiah","date":"2017-05-05T18:40:17.531+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheyCallMeJinx,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Wd6eHx8c,comment-id=002d,timestamp=2017-05-05T18:33:34.546+0000)\n>\n> I used to think that this was bullshit because I never had problems with it myself as a female gamer, but as soon as I created another account that had a female-esque name, I&#x27;ve never been more flamed in my life.\n> Almost every single game someone points out I&#x27;m a girl or asks if I&#x27;m a girl (and if i say I&#x27;m not to try to avoid the situation, they call me a &quot;%%%got&quot; because of the name), and almost every single game I get flamed for it, whether it&#x27;s by my team or not. \n> Blaming my mistakes on my gender, the enemy team saying it&#x27;ll be an easy time, saying I&#x27;m a waste of a woman because I&#x27;m not out sucking dick or in the kitchen, saying they&#x27;ll find me and rape me, or that they&#x27;re raping me by destroying me in game, and if I say something about it, then I&#x27;m a &quot;triggered&quot; or a &quot;feminist&quot; or a &quot;libtard cuck bitch&quot;.\n> I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it, and you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s horrible and it needs to stop.\n\nThanks for your experience.

I never speak with people on the internet anymore - all they need is your voice and they start falling in love, fantasizing, etc.\n\nThe worst thing is that *it is a recurring theme*, too.

Eventually i managed to climb to Diamond V - (Twinity Ferce was my name).\n\nAnd here everything turned on its head. He was angry. No, not just angry - straight up toxic. Im not Dia. I dont belong in the same rank he peaked in. Its wrong, i just got really lucky and got carried a lot during my climb through plat 1 and subsequent promition series. Im Plat, not Dia. \n\nAfter all, i'm *just a Girl*.\n\nIt devastated me. I had finally climbed to the level where i could duo with my mentor figure and he dod this. My focus and performance went to hell. I went from a 87% win rate to 48% in one week. When i fell back to Plat 1 i immediately got back into promotion series - but fell apart when he said \"told u you dont belong here\" and got myself banned.\n\nThat was the last time i revealed my identity or spoke a single word to someone on the internet. Its the only way you'll be treated like _just another person_ - by blending in with the guys.\n\nOf course, as the community consists of mostly male players, once my comment is seen it will be downvoted into oblivion.\n\nAfter all, i'm just a girl.\n\nSorry for any potential typos or poor grammar.
