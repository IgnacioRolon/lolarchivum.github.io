The buffs were nice, pls don't remove Riot. Only Fiora mains know this problem. Fiora's Q has the same sound as Yasuo's Q whenever they are both in game, regardless of which team the Yasuo is on. The sound applies to everything and not just on Yasuo.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpGldTyHQ3s","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NpGldTyHQ3s/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever Pool Party Fiora and Yasuo are in the same game,Fiora&#039;s Q has the same sound as Yasuo Q.

And the vitals on the pool party skin is very difficult to see.Can you make them a bit more distinguishable? In late game teamfights i can barely see the vitals.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-11T17:27:20.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey again! I took a lot at this in game yesterday, and the proper sounds are playing for me.\n\nI loaded into the game as base Fiora and Pool Party Fiora and in both instances, against an enemy Yasuo, the proper sounds effects played.\n\nI know we did some audio clean up for patch 7.1 - Jhin and Karma had a similar issue with audio being stolen from another champion, so that may have solved the issue. \n\nFeel free to lemme know if you're still hearing the incorrect sounds in the new patch, and I'd be happy to take another look. \n\nI know the pod who worked on Pool Party Fiora had sign off from gameplay that the vitals were okay, but I can sync up with them again and pass along your feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Fiora","date":"2017-01-11T18:49:02.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks !
