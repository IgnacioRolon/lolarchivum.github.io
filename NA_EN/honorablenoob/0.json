There is not enough time to build up, play safe, turtle, and comeback. \nDamage Creep: people claim it doesn't exist and riot seems to just disregard it entirely, but when team fights are over in under 15 seconds, and bruisers and supports are 100-0% people, there is a problem. There needs to be an overall damage adjustment especially to base damage, this forces people to actually **build** damage items to do damage instead of stacking health and doing the same a different champ who build solely damage. Also champs that relie on DOT are garbage right now.. either get rid of DoT or tone back the burst. Why would anyone pick {{champion:17}} {{champion:27}}  when they could play {{champion:45}} {{champion:63}} \nTurrets: for the love of the rift, turrets need a buff. They do not need more health, but they need to do %health damage effected by armor. you should simply not be able to 1v1 someone under their own turret and then walk away with above 75% health. This is some champs only method of defense until they hit mid game, and turrets are nothing more then confetti shooters made out of candle wax at this point.\n Invulnerability: There is little more annoying than playing against a {{champion:105}}  {{champion:2}} and having your abilities be meaningless because he is on his troll pole or ...simply immune to all cc. \nTrue damage: There should simply not be any true damage. The point of building items is to itemize against your enemies so that you are better equipped, true damage toxic to the game and cannot be balanced. \nItems: there needs to be more options for itemization, especially on the ap side.

I get that it is boring to sit in the jungle and farm, but its so toxic having the jungle be able to gank levels 1-4 because they already cleared most of the camps.
