I put in a support ticket that day in hopes i can get my account back and refunded my 200$ like we are supposed to. I even contacted PayPal and my bank just panicking hoping to figure out whats happening,\r\n\r\nNow two days later i get an email saying that my account has performed actions that are in violation of League of Legends Terms of Use. \r\nMind you it doesn't tell me how, when, or why just that the account is banned \r\n(VERRRY difficult to do since my account was inactive, right?) \r\n\r\nA week goes by and i'm starting to think, \"Okay Riot hasn't responded maybe they lost the ticket or i put in the wrong category\"\r\nSo i place in another ticket on the 29th thinking a week has passes it isn't a bad idea to make sure they still have it \r\nRight? am I wrong?\r\n\r\nNow another week has gone by (put in a ticket yesterday with it being a holiday probably gonna get lost nbd )\r\nBut still absolutely no response from riot and it's been a total of 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nTLDR\r\nSo long story short i'm annoyed that i spent 200$ for someone hacking me and i didn't personally receive, and even more so annoyed that the account i have way too much $$ put into is completely unavailable to me and when I try to contact support i'm getting absolutely no response?\r\n\r\nCan't even give much accurate info like when account was made since i cant even get into my account nor' can i even check my first purchases for the same reason.\r\n\r\nIf i can get any help on what i should do (other than put in a support ticket because clearly they are not paying attention to them) or at least mine\r\ni would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T21:18:16.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and found that an account specialist reached out to you in your initial ticket, and asked some questions to verify and help restore access to the account.
