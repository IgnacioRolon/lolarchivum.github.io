Oh wait, that was about the millennials of the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s, not you guys.\n\nOkay, here is one. From _The Child Worshipers_, &ldquo;We are living, like it or not in a child-centered society. In fact, child worship is in some ways a national epidemic.&rdquo; &ndash; published 1963. Oops, those are the stupid millennials of the 1940&rsquo;s and 1950&rsquo;s. Sorry.\n\nAhh, here we go. From _Suburbia&rsquo;s Coddled Kids_, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tougher and tougher to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to these kids and make it stick.&rdquo; &ndash; published 1962. I have to apologize because this is once again about those dumb lazy millennials of the 1940&rsquo;s and 1950&rsquo;s.\n\nNot to pile on you guys, but then there is this&hellip; From _Parents on the Run_, &ldquo;In those days children were supposed to be &lsquo;seen and not heard.&rsquo; There was no back talk and no nonsense. The homes of yesteryear were adult-centered. Today we have the child-centered home. In it there is little peace and quiet, and certainly not much respect for, or fear of authority. Indeed, it is parents who are to &lsquo;be seen and not heard.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ndash; published 1955\n\nAnd this&hellip; In _American Home_ an article was titled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Raised Three Selfish Little Savages.&rdquo; &ndash; published 1945\n\nAnd this&hellip; In _The Atlantic Monthly_ an article admits that kids have always been pleasure seekers but it is now &ldquo;different from anything we have ever seen in the young before.&rdquo; The editor added his own two cents citing &ldquo;that American children have the worst manners in the world; that they are thoroughly spoiled; and that, intent upon pleasure and oblivious to duty, they are driving straight to destruction.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;Though the world has certainly changed before, it ever has changed at the whirling speed of the last half-dozen years (1915-1921).&rdquo; &ndash; published in 1921\n\nAnd this&hellip; High school students missed two out of every three questions on a test of &ldquo;the simplest and most obvious facts of American history.&rdquo; &ndash; quote from 1917\n\nAnd this&hellip; Judges of a college essay were forced to select &ldquo;the essay having the fewest errors.&rdquo; &ndash; quote from 1911\n\nAnd finally this&hellip; Where &ldquo;Grades A and B are sometimes given too readily. One of the chief obstacles to raising the standards of the degree is the readiness with which insincere students gain passable grades by sham work.&rdquo; &ndash;  quote from 1894 about students at Harvard\n\nToday, 80% of people think kids today are more spoiled than kids of 10 or 15 years ago. If this poll was given throughout the past do you guys think it would ever change? Sure sounds like it has been the same for the past 100 years.\n\nJust something to think about.","replies":[]}
