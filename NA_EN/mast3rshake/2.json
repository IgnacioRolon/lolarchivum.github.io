You just clearly don't like to ward because \"Fuck vision, mah damage!\"\n\nFirst, as has been pointed out, her finding the ward is actually a victory for you. 1st, she has to destealth to kill it, and you can either collapse on her, or get safe in that time. Second, at level 9, you get unlimited pink wards for 250 GP. At the very least, she has to waste time on a failed gank, which if your Jungler is smart, should lead to a gank in the opposite lane the minute she shows herself. \n\nAlso, as has been pointed out, since she invades to push her stealth advantage constantly, you green ward your jungles camps, or near them. If your pushing bot, you can even ward her camps. When she shows to clear a camp, you know what quadrant she is in for the next 1-3 minutes. Don't overpush if it's near you. \n\nHonestly though, this is a losing battle. People are going to continue to not ward properly, or blame their support. The new vision system assumes competence and effort to deal with stealth the average player isn't going to put in. At this point, as a former Eve main, I wish they would just gut her passive, and rework it since she clearly isn't going to get a fair shake as long as the boards explode with:\n\n\"WTF!

And hard. \n\nHowever Lee Sin has several advantages over Eve: Much more mobility. He has an easier time stealing dragons and does not need to burn Flash to do that. Due to his insane base damages AND scalings, he can actually build somewhat tanky and still do decent damage late game. Or he could build full damage - this is not recommended, but the burst is insane. He uses energy so he doesn't run into mana problems. Also, he has much better CC. Eve's only advantage over Lee is stealth. But that's not something that is too hard to solve. A simple pink ward can ruin Eve's day.","replies":[{"poster":"Dealth","date":"2015-10-06T01:17:25.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee Sin's weakness isn't his scaling, he has some of the best scaling in the game for being a bruiser.
