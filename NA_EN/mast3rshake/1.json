I have noticed that in my past 5-6 games one of the two junglers has always been complete trash (sometimes they are on my team, sometimes on the other so I am not complaining about AHHH my jungler is always trash). In those games they have warded less than 5 times each, one jungler putting only one ward down all game. ONE WARD! How is that possible? I remember thinking when I was climbing that the macro play and warding was much better than it was years ago in bronze. Checking the post game vision score people bought at least one control ward, some people even two! I was thinking that in silver most peope will be getting at least two a person. Not the case at all. In high Bronze I felt like my teammates were working with each other most of the time and chalked it up to players in general just improving over the years lifting bronze up in general compared to those years past. However, in mid-silver it suddenly seems like people are clueless. Are they still dumping the new players into the silver 2-3 rank?

First, by stating the \"largest portion of the playerbase should be\" shows that you are conflating mean and mode. Assuming your graphs are correct (and Riot actually did a good job creating a better rank distribution) the median is Gold 4, when the largest portion of the playerbase is. \n\nSecond, the mean, or average, is not calculated by dividing by two. It is calculated by dividing by the number of total people. A trick you can use to do this when you don't know the exact number is to use the percentage as the number, so 0.4% becomes 0.4 people. \n\nLet's calculate the rank of the average Iron player in July based on your second link.\n\nDone your way you would get:\n\n4 ranks / 2 = 2           \nAverage player is in Iron II.\n\nThe proper way would be as follows:\n\nValues of ranks were assigned with Iron I being 1, Iron II is 2, and so on until you end at Challenger being 27. The percentage of players will act as the number of people in each rank.\n\nFirst, you take the rank value and then multiply it by the percentage of players in the rank to get the rank score:\n\nIron I          1 x 0.07 = 0.07\nIron II         2 x 0.4   = 0.8\nIron III        3 x 0.87 = 2.61\nIron IV        4 x 1.21 = 4.84\n\nFind the total of the rank scores:\n\n0.07 + 0.8 + 2.61 + 4.84 = 8.32\n\nFinally, take the rank score total and divide it by the number of total people (add together the percentages):\n\n8.32/(0.07 + 0.4 + 0.87 + 1.21) = 3.26\n\nSo, the average iron player has a rank of Iron III with 26 LP. \n\n\n\nUsing this method the average rank score comes out to be 12.11. Silver I has a rank value of 12 and Gold IV has a rank value of 13 which means the average player in league is in Silver I with 11 LP!\n\n{{sticker:galio-happy}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2019-08-06T02:36:34.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm aware of all this mathmatical stuff.\nAs it happens, I'm currently in a statistics course.\nBut you also have to account for the context of language.\n\nWhen people talk about the \"average player\", they are not using the mathmatical definition where average = mean.\nIn this context, average isn't the mean or the median, it's the mode.
