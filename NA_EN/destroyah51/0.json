I'm sorry, but no.  I hate when people talk about Kindred being Jhin (But hey, maybe it's a legit theory that I just haven't heard all of).  Look, Jhin and Kindred are associated with each other because of this:  Riot wanted to make a \"Bounty Hunter\" character, so they first thought up this cyborg cowboy guy who could collect bounties on other champs (and maybe jungle monster, I dunno).  Originally, his ult was going to be a near-global range Lux ult with a tiny hitbox.  If you were able to land this on a \"Bountied\" champ, it would be an insta-kill.  This eventually just became Jhin's E.  Anyway, they iceboxed Jhin.  While working on Kindred, they decided that the bounty system worked better with them, so they took it from Jhin and gave it to Kindred.  \n\nIf they share similar quotes it's probably an easter egg or reference to this relationship.\n\nâ€¦Geez, why did I write so much?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CobaltTheMadMage","date":"2016-09-12T01:58:18.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed probably screamed because having shadow spirits invade your mind and force you to kill your father to defend their anchor is not exactly a comfortable experience.\n\nThe LeBlanc reflection thingy was an aborted story arc where Noxus had her infiltrate Demacia, abduct, and replace Prince Jarvan for some sinister purpose, but it appears to have been retconned along with all the original Summoners/Institute of War lore.\n\nKindred and Jhin have no connection except that they both wear masks.
