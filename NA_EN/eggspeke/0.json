It hides minions and visibility on champions often and even though it shows the range of the stun, you're going to be aiming to hit a person dead center anyway most of the time unless you're trying to hit two people at once. Experience will teach that, some huge circle won't necessarily, especially since you won't be detonating the Q exactly where the indicator was in the first place making it not so useful as a real guide. It's easier to hit a skill being able to see it in flight and its path than a gaudy indicator. This is simply awful and I pray that they take the simple way of fixing the bug and just change the skill back to how it was. I've been missing a ton of Qs and I don't believe it's just because of the bug.\n\nIf you want to start adding new skill indicators to champions (I know it was recently done with Varus and people didn't like that either) just add in a UI option to display certain skill indicators in their 'optional forms'. As in, newbie guide mode and hey I actually know what I'm doing get this extra junk out of my face mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Dzop","date":"2014-10-10T10:01:21.922+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, the circle around the Q is very distracting, anivia was fine the way she was","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YuoDed","date":"2014-10-09T22:34:50.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing with Kassadin E.  really annoying please fix asap","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-10-10T00:14:49.914+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're looking into that too at the moment, sounds like it might be the same underlying bug according to the people investigating it.","replies":[{"poster":"Phobos Selini","date":"2014-10-10T15:31:18.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can not confirm this bug on Kas E on EUW.
