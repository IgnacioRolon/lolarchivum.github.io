(PLEASE HELP ME) :(","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, this is something that has really been bothering me for the past couple of hours. I've been trying to order all my mastery pages so that when I get into champion select, I can scroll to a section and it will already have all the pages for that role. Everytime I finally order all of them by Role, AP/AD/Tank, and keystone, and click save, the masteries soon revert themselves to some random order. I do not know why this is happening and it is REALLY bothering me. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Please someone help me with this because I can not play the game until I have my masteries organized! :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T21:03:12.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be pretty frustrated if I kept trying to sort my masteries but run into issues.
