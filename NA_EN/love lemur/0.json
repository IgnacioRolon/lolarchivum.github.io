Even has second account properties, and previous name properties even after name changes.\n\nQuestion though. In the very odd event that the \"global.properties\" file gets deleted for whatever reason, what would happen?? Especially seeing how it won't be recreated.

(after i resolve the issue many hours later unfortunately.)\n\nThe support tech did give me very useful information that i felt needed to be shared here since none of the solutions i found here worked for me especially seeing as how half of them are troll answers that arent even serious and are just going to mess with peoples computer settings in very irritating ways. \n\nAnyhow here is what he said:  \n\n> This error typically stems from a disconnection between your computer and our game servers. The error message is basically telling you that the \"heartbeat\" from your computer did not reach our servers in time. The \"heartbeat\" is a packet of information that needs to be sent to our servers telling them that your computer is still connected to the internet and is active. If the packet does not make it to our servers or is delayed our servers will actually terminate the connection in order to protect your account.\n> \n> There are a couple of reasons that the packet might be delayed in reaching our servers. The most common reason is that the packet didn't leave your computer in time. This is typically caused by a large amount of uplink network buffering. Network buffering is a buffer of information that is waiting to be processed. If more information is being received or transmitted than the bandwidth of your computer can handle the information is queued up in the buffer. Sometimes this buffer can become very large and data is not sent out when it's supposed to be.
