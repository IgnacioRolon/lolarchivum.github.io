It was automatic, as I was banned 1 minute after the game ended. To put this into context, this guy was flaming our team the whole game. I say one word, and I get a 14-day ban. Not even a chat restriction.\r\n\r\nSo my question to Riot is. What is so bad about calling a white kid the n-word? If \"no context\" is acceptable, why do they even let you say the word? Is it so you can shove your agenda down people's throats? Why cant you just censor the no-no words. And why is calling a white person a racial slur worse than flaming your team for 45 minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-03-02T16:30:59.683+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":">What is so bad about calling a white kid the n-word?\n\nBecause it's a racial slur that derives the negative connotations it has in *any* context from the fact that it is used to insult and denigrate people solely based on the color of their skin, and implies that that skin color makes them worth of being insulted.

The first is just zero-tolerance because racist behavior is something that is commonly known to be unacceptable in most social situations, and isn't just something that can be attributed to being very angry. That said, severe flaming can *also* earn an immediate 14-day ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Poondar","date":"2019-03-02T16:37:20.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":18,"body":"I didn't display any racist behavior.
