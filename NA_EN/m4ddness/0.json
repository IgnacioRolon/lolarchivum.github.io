Swain still references it in his quote. Swain also summons 1 particular raven who accompanies him during the recall animation, which we can probably assume it's Beatrice or at least their avatar of sort.\n\nLore-wise it was stated that Swain's current power is from a pact with Beatrice, who is stated to be a demon. Swain is a \"cripple\" in that he lost his left arm, the red left arm we see is not a real arm but something Beatrice granted him to channel their power through, which is why Swain only uses his left hand to cast spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2018-02-26T06:33:52.000+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"He says in his Joke animation \"Which one of you is beatrice again?\" \n\nWhich implies Yes, Beatrice is still around, but Swain just isn't sure which one is beatrice. ~~Dementia'sSettingIn~~","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DonatellaVersace","date":"2018-02-26T03:48:49.074+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"LCS and {{item:3504}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"gileskd","date":"2018-02-26T01:03:09.245+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"teenagers and tide pods\n.\n.\n.\n.\ntoo soon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seleena","date":"2018-02-26T09:17:34.918+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:28}} {{item:3135}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Call Me Nana","date":"2018-02-26T00:50:39.565+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"theres no icon for cancer +{{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2018-02-26T02:50:49.331+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://cdn.mysitemyway.com/etc-mysitemyway/icons/legacy-previews/icons/glossy-black-icons-culture/027235-glossy-black-icon-culture-astrology-cancer.png {{champion:67}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"paisy","date":"2018-02-26T01:43:09.815+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}} {{item:3146}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2018-02-26T00:49:18.945+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:136}} {{item:3030}} ;(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomievader","date":"2018-02-25T23:53:59.479+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:113}} {{champion:89}} No one can deflect the emerald splash","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-02-26T02:25:32.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:136}} https://pro-rankedboost.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/platinum-rewards-lol.png","replies":[{"poster":"Tomievader","date":"2018-02-26T02:34:00.144+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:75}} Q","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2018-02-26T11:36:39.415+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/91/WarwickSquare_old.png https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/74/Feral_Flare_item.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2018-02-26T17:29:04.017+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1042}} {{item:1042}}.
