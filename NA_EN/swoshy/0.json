Riot, i would highly consider you listen up. \n\nSo lets agree, it&#039;s almost impossible to perfectly balance every champion in the game (damage wise). Certain champions will always be meta and other champions will always be left behind. \n\nMy solution to this problem is to bring a different focus to those champions NOT considered meta. For example, objective wise in league of legends the point is to destroy towers...Why don&#039;t you take champions that are not in the meta and bring their focus to other things in the game, like objectives. Make them playable again, for other reasons BESIDE their damage and kill potential.  \n\nNow I don&#039;t play much League of Legends anymore (I wonder why) so take my examples with a grain of salt. What if- urgot{{champion:6}} , galio{{champion:3}} , kogmaw{{champion:96}} , karthus{{champion:30}} , etc. all of a sudden become gods at taking down towers. Now we know they aren&#039;t the most favorable champions in the game kill potential wise, but I have a feeling players will start to pick them up more because of their objective potential in the game. \n\nOn the flip side, champions that are \"overpowered\" (Jayce i'm looking at you) could have their tower killing potential greatly reduced :) (called balancing Rito)\n\n I&#039;m wondering what you guys think of the idea and if it could work, please let me know. \n\nSwoshy \n(Michael) \n{{champion:63}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-24T19:34:13.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are characters balanced around taking objectives, and whether or not those characters should be centered around that is subjective. None of them have any kind of theming that screams \"I KILL TURRETS AND TAKE BASE\" except maybe Galio. I think a good example of what you are talking about is when they  made Ziggs' W start executing turrets. That fits his theme, he throws bombs which are commonly used to destroy structures. His lore talks about him blowing a hole in a wall with them. \n\nUrgot's theme is that he is a mangle of a man seeking revenge against the man that killed him. None of that has anything to do with destroying structures. It does however fit him tracking someone down and murderizing him. His E and Q fit this theme pretty well, as does his W's passive.\n\nGalio's theme is that he is a gargoyle that wants to protect people, so he could maybe have something to do with protecting turrets, but personally I love playing him how he is now, where his theme is protecting your team by cc'ing the enemy team or with peel and buffs.\n\nKogmaw's theme is that he is a void beast in early developmental stages who predigests things. I think he should have more to do with lowering opponent's defenses and then doing something to finish them off. He kinda achieves this with his Q but I think he could reach his theme better. Something like a passive that makes him shred armor and mres with each hit and then deals damage when it is stacked high enough or something, but that might make him too similar to kayle, twitch, or kalista.\n\nKarthus's theme is that he is a person who gave in to the temptations of the shadow isle and became a lich who spreads death around. His W, ult, passive, and E all fit this pretty well.\n\nEDIT: I should also mention that I am under the belief that this game is very well balanced, especially compared to other games.","replies":[{"poster":"Swoshy","date":"2017-01-24T19:40:28.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you mean. I did not consider champion backstories at all. I do think it would be cool if there were certain categories for champions though (kill potential, objective potential ) WITHIN the champion type (assassin, marksman, tank).  For example making jhin good at killing people but not the best pick for taking down towers quickly, compared to the opposite of this for non meta champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-24T20:13:46.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are, they just are not spelled out like that. For the most part, adc's are the best at taking out turrets, however Jhin, as you said, is not great at it (they actually gave Jhin some sort of a buff against turrets a while ago because he was so bad at it). Tristana however is great at killing turrets. She can push waves with her passive and then use her E and Q to quickly demolish them.\n\nXerath can push waves, but he can't really destroy turrets quickly. Ziggs, on the other hand, can destroy turrets quickly with his passive and his W.\n\nJax and shyvana absolutely murder turrets, but poppy can't.\n\nLulu can give her carries an attack speed buff, letting them destroy turrets quicker, but what is soraka gonna do to a turret?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
