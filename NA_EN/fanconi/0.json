I think I have narrowed it down to GeForce experience \r\n&quot;optimisation&quot; of my game settings which has resulted in severe instability. Strangely GeForce Experience doesn&#039;t seem to change any settings from what I had already (very high preset).\r\n\r\nRepatching/corrupted file repair won&#039;t fix it but if I manually reset graphics settings it goes away.\r\n\r\nMy LOL installation is not on the C drive which might be part of the problem??\r\n\r\nThis bug has resulted in me being put in a low priority queue so thanks Nvidia... Please could Riot get rid of the waits?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-09-12T01:05:16.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nvidia experience is malware, ditch that shit.\n\nSoftware that modifies settings without the game being involved has a pretty low chance of producing good or stable results. It may be setting corrupt data, impossible values, or just really bad combinations.","replies":[]}]}
