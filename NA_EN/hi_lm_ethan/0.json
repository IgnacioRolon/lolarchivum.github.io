I have also repaired the client multiple times and nothing seems to be working. I don't know how to fix this problem and it is making it very difficult to play games with my friends and play blind pick games. I cant use any chat rooms but once I am in game I can chat freely, it is only while I am in the launcher. Also I do not appear online on other people's friends list and the only way they can invite me is to type in my name manually. This prevents me from play ranked teams as well. I am very unhappy that I can't seem to fix this problem and would like some help and support in fixing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T17:29:32.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like some network problem is specifically preventing you from connecting to chat services.  I know you've tried some steps but reinstalling is more likely to resovle file issues and not networking.  Instead I recommend using the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help.  Hopefully, that will get you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
