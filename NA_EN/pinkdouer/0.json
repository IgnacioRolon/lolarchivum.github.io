I answered the same question when you posted over on the megathread, but I didn't want to leave you hanging here either. \n\nIt sounds like your network is having a hard time getting a solid connection with our login servers. Without a stable connection, your client can't see whether or not your information matches the login info we have on file. Go through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and you should be back on track.\n\nHit me back if that doesn't seem to help!","replies":[]}]}
