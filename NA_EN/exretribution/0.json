I dealt with it and went without dodging for an entire month. \r\n\r\nToday I had a bit of an emergency and had to leave a game for 5 minutes. As soon as i came back I reconnected and my team won the game. Immediately after I got punished with a low priority queue lasting for 10 whole minutes. Does this timer ever reset?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-07-09T05:22:49.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't based on time since last dodge, it is based on games played. It does go down if you consistantly go without leaving for a while though.","replies":[]}]}
