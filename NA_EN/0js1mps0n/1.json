This rework has made LeBlanc's gameplay choppy, inconsistent, and has gotten rid of the fear people experience when she appears on screen. The ultimate is horrendous. I prefer the old ultimate. Riot sacrificed the nuke-mage aspect of LeBlanc for the 'deceiving' aspect that isn't even helpful. The only good things that I saw from this was, the new passive, updated art of spells, and the tiny visual in-game effects. Nothing else. If anything, LeBlanc needed a visual rework.

Looks like she is more set up to juke people or force summoners with illusions.","replies":[{"poster":"NakedGranny","date":"2017-02-01T23:40:16.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, what Riot was saying is true: she's more of a hybrid now than just-another-assassin.\n\nThe length of time it takes her to actually kill someone is slower than most mages (except possibly Morgana, Swain and Lux), but her control output is pretty weak by comparison. She could Mimic Chain to stack up to 3 seconds of root, but the double skill shot and leash range cripple that strategy. She does have more mobility than Morgana, but I'd rather have Black Shield than LeBonk's short range W. Her Q feels like a pathetic Annie Q in all ways. Less damage, less range, less of everything. The 1.5 second timer gating half her damage output is just crippling.\n\nShe's fun to play, though. Very twitchy. Sort of like Riven in a way, but requiring way more thought and work. And for less than 10% of the offensive payout.\n\nThe new Mimic is flat out superior to the old one, but there's something about all the hidden cooldown timers that makes new LeBonk feel too clunky to really make effective use of her pitiful clones.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-11-09T18:28:35.285+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You just need to get used to the new way she goes about things.

She is pretty bad.  \n\nShe's 100% useless after 20 minutes, falls off harder than she ever did before.  She has an ok-ish laning phase, but compared to the likes of Talon, Kata, Yas, Zed, any typical AP mid, she is just terrible later in the game compared to them.\n\nThey also slowed down a lot of her combos like W -> E.  Now the animation has to completely finish before the E goes off, it's just so fucking bad, to the point the enemy doesn't even have to try to dodge it, they just run in a straight line and it won't get to them in time.\n\nAnd as for the Clones from her mimic, 2.5s makes them useless.  For the old passive, it lasted long enough champs couldn't just hold CDs until the clone died.  Now, they don't have to guess, just wait 2.5s since she can't do anything to you until the sigil procs anyway, and blast her.\n\nAnd RR is just.. complete utter garbage.  Nobody even reacts to it, and it just kamikaze's instantly, completely unlike a real player would do.  LB Can't even pick off low-hp targets anymore because they'll just nuke her before she can do anything.  And good god that constant automatic laughing is so irritating, and also makes everyone BM you because they think you're doing it on purpose.  It also makes you look like a fool because she isn't deceiving anyone with her tricks anymore\n\nJust what were they thinking?????","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Moch√≠","date":"2016-11-11T02:19:15.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RR is actually cooler than you think. I just played a game where it traveled literally halfway accross the map and \"ganked\" bot. It took both bot lane ults XD. \n\nHonestly, though, she should have her role changed from \"Assassin\" to \"Mage\".

She is more of a team fight based control mage with unreliable cc as she can't really assassinate anymore.  You can be fed and catch an adc in a death bush and their team will get to you before you can kill them.  You need to adapt a new play style focused around your e and using your w to evade damage as opposed to nuking people.  This play style can be fun but it doesn't really have a place in this meta as other champions can do it better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unandir","date":"2016-11-09T23:15:42.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completly agree.
