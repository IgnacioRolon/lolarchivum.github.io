This means, like pyke's ultimate, it kills people no matter what if they're within a certain health range (the dmg of the ult). So why is it that pyke's ult is considered a true execute and will tell you on their health bar when you can just ez auto kill them, but it doesn't tell you with cho'gaths? \r\n\r\nInstead, they've decided to surround the champion with purple teeth, like when he does his knockup. Now like most effects, there's a problem with seeing the teeth during big team fights so why not do what they do with pyke's ult and tell you on their hp bar when you can just instakill?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-25T05:59:42.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not considered a true execute because it doesn't behave like an execute. It simply does the listed true damage. If that damage doesn't kill the target, due to e.g. a shield, the target will survive. Actual executes, like Urgot and Pyke have, will keep trying to kill the target with increasing amounts of true damage, up to over a million.","replies":[{"poster":"CjFletch","date":"2019-03-25T06:08:00.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do shields block true damage?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-25T07:17:56.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CjFletch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EsFEyGRj,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-03-25T06:08:00.466+0000)\n>\n> Do shields block true damage?\n\nYes, generic shields (not physical/magic-specific shields like Morg's E or Camille's passive) absorb true damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CjFletch","date":"2019-07-08T17:13:37.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh, 4 months later who would've guessed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-03-25T04:55:05.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:6}} ahem. i have an execute ult as well.","replies":[{"poster":"CjFletch","date":"2019-03-25T05:49:07.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, I've never used urgot so I don't know how it looks, I do know pyke tho","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-03-25T06:17:33.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shoot a drill at someone. drill starts to beep. if they are below a certain amount of health the beeping is faster and the drill is flashing. at that point activate ult again to  pull them towards you with chains and straight up execute them by grinding them for 9999 true damage.
