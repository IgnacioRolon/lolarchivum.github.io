I have tried about every possible solution I found by myself but no cigar. I believe this happened when I tried the new client when it became available, but then I downgraded again because I couldnt get it to work. Now that legacy client is retired, I can't play at all on this computer. Please please please help me :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T21:08:54.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"But no cigar\" -triggered-\n\nAhem, that kind of sounds like your OS is blocking League from running the way it's supposed to. That can happen sometimes if your OS doesn't recognize the program and thinks it could be malicious. Let's first check out your [**permission guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to make sure that League is allowed to run correctly, but hit me back if that doesn't seem to help!","replies":[]}]}
