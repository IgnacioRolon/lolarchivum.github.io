Our team was walking down towards dragon and the game was pretty close. Then, as I go to clear a ward in the river, my game just completely stops. My ping jumped up to the generic show-that-your-dc'd 500 and I couldn't do anything. This lasted for about 5-10 seconds. Then, once I could move again, I walked up the enemy team, ulted them, and ran away. After about another 10 seconds, my game just crashed again and this time it wouldn't reconnect. I can confirm that it wasn't a wifi problem because I could still message people through the League client, but I couldn't reconnect. About 3 minutes later, my team lost. Now I know that you can't undo the loss or anything, but could someone please tell me what the hell happened that made me DC?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T18:30:16.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client was unable to maintain a good connection to the server.
