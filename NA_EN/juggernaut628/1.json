Do you think that something&#039;s off with the items, do you think that Vayne is once again overpowered or do you think that I&#039;m crazy? For someone who has so many attack steroids it seems like a bit overkill for her W to have no counterplay but be so strong.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-07T23:46:12.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"She's OP to fight against IF you have a team that says \"it's okay, our Nasus will carry lategame\".

They're all too strong to be healthy in their own right. But Vayne has always been strong and then Riot buffed one of the two abilities she had that together make her extremely toxic (In my opinion, W and R, but some may say Q and W or Q and R.) Riot explicitly said \"Vayne must succeed with Silver Bolts\" and now her W is just the topping to an already strong kit. Back in Season 5 it was either her Q or W that would do a lot of damage, but now it's just her plain out autos with a 12% max health true damage burst with no cooldown between champions and an invisibility on a 2 second cooldown that lets her go invisible for 1.5 seconds and gain even more damage.\n\nVayne needs tuning SOMEWHERE because right now she is the best ADC by far above the rest.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2015-12-08T14:00:01.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So apparently rito thinks insane damage output ( note that no other carry , let alone hypercarry , has the ability to constantly spit out huge amounts of true damage like vayne does) and amazing self peel slipperiness and mobilty co exist very well and balanced together in a kit. And it's not just vayne but other late game hypercarries like jax or trynd can just annihilate when they get their 2 core items, thing is top lane is much much more snowballs than botlane. So when the jax loses first blood to the riven he can kiss his farm and late game goodbye, while vayne can always farm safely with her support, ( in general ranged champions can farm much safer ) shiv and canon passives r getting nerfed so no more vayne tank one shots , but vayne is strong eve without those items .

It doesn't help that she counters assassins aswell, you know...Those things that are supposed to kill ADC and keep them in check.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, she's too good at everything.
