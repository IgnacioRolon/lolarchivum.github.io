Then magic resistance glyphs. Then everything else you deem worth.\n\nArmor because overall are useful for any class ( from junglers to mages, to mitigate monster damage and mitigate minion aggro and jungler ganks ) and flat AD because it' s a core for many junglers, that rely A LOT on runes, it' s good for any laner because lets them last hit better ( and also harrass with the auto attack the enemy, don' t forget that ) and makes your supports more of a threat.\n\nThis just to say what i deem the most important ones, then there is a way to optimize everything. like, you would like to have magic penetration marks for your mages ( most of the times), or AP glyphs, or attack speed marks for your udyr jungle. I do not even mention Quintessences because those are another matter totally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IceTPain","date":"2016-01-08T05:32:19.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'll be maining {{champion:99}} Lux mid, or maybe a support like {{champion:99}} lux or {{champion:25}} morgana.
