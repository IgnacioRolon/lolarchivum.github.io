When I scrolled over my icon where my names at, it said silver 3. Just wondering if this is an actual bug, if I was actually silver 3 and all of my screens were just wrong before hand? What's up? Don't want to play another 7-14 games just to get something I already achieved. \r\n\r\nAlso: every time I try to sign in to submit a ticket, the site signs me out of my account and take me to an account recovery screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-09T22:12:46.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to see anything out of the ordinary here.  :/  It looks like you seeded in Silver 3 late January, and prompted to Silver 2 today.
