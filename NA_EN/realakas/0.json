I was in a premade with friends, just having fun, doing our thing, when one of us started joking around. The game was fine, no toxicity between the two teams, when after I receive an immediate ban for 2 weeks without warning for the evidence below, that doesn&#039;t even differentiate between all and in team chat. I have never been banned before, never received warning that I was toxic, no chat bans, I&#039;m always one of the most honorable players on my team with 2+ honors every game, and a dedicated player. I&#039;d like to know why I got a 2 week ban without warning for a 1 game offense against a premade when I have no prior behavior of being toxic nor received any warning that perhaps my trolling might have been going overboard. I&#039;ve been playing the game for years, reached honor level 5 far sooner than other players last season, and have never received warnings, or a chat ban in my life. I&#039;m a dedicated player and was a believer in the tribunal, but when proof of toxic players were not getting banned, and I receiving this unfair one, makes me want to quit. It&#039;s absolutely ridiculous.

Theoretically it works, and the groundwork for it is certainly valid. It's just that people themselves are selfish and always ruin communism when it is put into practice.\n\n> i still don&#x27;t like that you can get banned for this since you actually didn&#x27;t insult anyone\n\nIt is incredibly offensive.

And i&#x27;ll be banned because &quot;The typhoon is bad so you can&#x27;t be on its side&quot;\n\nIt's not the same, 'seig heil' and 'for hitler' are phrases with historical significance. They express support for a group and for ideals which were responsible for one of the worst genocides in human history. Typhoons may have killed many people, but there is no historical context of people hailing them, so it's less offensive.\n\n> On another side, i&#x27;m joking, i&#x27;m just making these stuff up.

It's the whole point of democracy. Discussion... meeting out the bad ideas and debating till we come to a consensus on the best course of action or the best way to govern. One of the scariest things today is the liberal culture of emotion over logic. They shout people down who disagree with them, and it allows alt right groups to gain some ground just based on the fact that nobody has a serious debate with them to expose how horrible their ideas are. If we would just allow Nazis a public forum  (mind you, in a league game is NOT an appropriate public forum), we could remind people why it's such a bad thing and their following would be educated and most likely change their views. Of course there are those so unintelligent and stubborn, that they will never change their views, but that's a small minority.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-02-27T17:22:44.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im usually against people being total dicks in chat, but i think this is taking it a lil bit too far.
