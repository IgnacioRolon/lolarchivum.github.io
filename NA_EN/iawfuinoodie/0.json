That is really the only correct answer.\nAll but all champions are strong and you can make any of them work for you if you learn how to play them.  Champions that are popular right now, champions that are supposed to be strong currently, they very well might not be a few patches later. For the same reasons, a champion that's unpopular or niche pick now might be really strong two weeks from now.  Either way, a champion you like to play and know how to play because you've put the time in is going to give better results than a flavor-of-the-month pick.  Be sure to play the rotation so you can find out what they are like and what you think of their kit.\n\n**\"Please tell me who would be a good idea for ranked.\"**\nOutside of those guys who think there are only maybe three champions you can win with per role, the answer is going to vary (and don't listen to them anyway; they're delusional).  The champions that are the ones you have the most practice with and find yourself doing the best with are the ones for ranked.  \n\n\nThis wasn't the answer you were looking for, but it's the answer that is true.","replies":[{"poster":"IawfuInoodIe","date":"2015-09-27T02:31:26.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is a few months later but I would like to amend you and thank you for your words, I have just recently realized how I used my words, and I do regret it, though I really just wanted to hear what champions work for other players that may also work for me, and also which champions others have fun as, so I can try them out to get a better understanding of which champions I want to play, once again, thank you for pushing me in the right direction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-16T00:27:41.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd suggest Nautilus. He's a flex pick for both Jungle and Support (and top recently in competitive leagues). He's also got a large amount of CC in his pocket with a hook, slow, root, and knock-up along with an ability that gives him a temporary shield.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-07-17T04:04:02.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:106}}  Jungler than can double as support or top laner and is kinda fun to play and bite people","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpartenA7991","date":"2015-07-17T03:57:23.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you should look for safe champions if you're not comfortable with a specific role.

Based on your junglers that you want right now, it seems you like those tanky, bruiser champions. Those champions also have some pretty good crowd control, with that fear hecarim and knockups on Jarvan / Nautilus. Stick with those champions if you like being tanky and bruiser like. Also, I recommend for jungle, you should buy Xin Zhao. His late game isn't that good, but his early game is monstrous at the point where he can close out a game in the mid game. With the new sated devourer, he is pretty strong.\nFor mid, I can see you like the idea of assassinating, bursty champions. I used to play a lot of Zed in ranked, and I can tell you he is really fun to play, but some champions countered him exceptionally well, like heimerdinger and fizz. I've never really looked into Talon and Malzahar, but those guys are TOUGH. I hate going  against them in lane, and because I saw your game earlier today (Malphite top) I think that you would do exceptionally well with those champions. With all due respect, you are a really good bronze player, but your farming needs a little bit of help. Heimerdinger is a champion that you just put towers down, and they protect you and gets you farm. Heimerdinger would be good for you, because you can focus on poking down the enemy while your turrets do all the work.\nAnyways, thanks for reading all of this if you do, and hopefully you take some of these suggestions. Hopefully we can talk more in game, and I'll see you in some ranked games this weekened!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nicorus ","date":"2015-07-16T04:32:10.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggesting going with Maokai, he's great in the jungle, great in mid, and great as a support. overall I think he fits all roles well.
