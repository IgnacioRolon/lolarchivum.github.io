Usually it happens if something big is happening on the screen like a team fight or multiple people taking drag. the screen freeze is permanent but he does not lose audio. When this happens he cannot even do anything else on his computer it is just completely frozen and the only way he can fix the issue is by Ctrl + Alt + Delete and restart his computer. When he restarts everything is back to normal. he loads back into the game and plays the rest of the game with no issues. Anyone have any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-19T05:48:44.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without any information on their system, nobody can do anything.\n\nIt sounds like either the CPU or GPU is overheating and/or reaching unstable power draw and crashing or freezing.\n\nGo to r/techsupport instead, though https://old.reddit.com/r/techsupport/","replies":[{"poster":"MAHEALEY","date":"2018-12-19T05:51:11.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks i will get him to do that. i suggested it may have been a hardware issue","replies":[{"poster":"GreatWhiteNorth","date":"2018-12-23T23:40:58.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MAHEALEY,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=YUJxdZjE,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-12-19T05:51:11.432+0000)\n>\n> thanks i will get him to do that. i suggested it may have been a hardware issue\n\nCan also help to simply install the lastest driver version.
