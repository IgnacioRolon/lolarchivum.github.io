I believe this ban was extremely harsh and I wish to apologize for my actions and wish to recover my account where I can be perm muted. The only way I have ever done anything wrong in this community is if I am typing towards other players. If I am perm muted, I will never break the rules. May I please recover my account? I spent so much time playing this game and for it all to be for nothing due to me getting bullied in chat is not fair. Perm muted instead of perm banned is a much more reasonable punishment for what I have done.\n\nI have been playing league for years now and the only thing I have ever done wrong is type negative things to players because they started it, I know this is immature from myself but the only way for me to not reply to others is to mute my chat entirely which is what i will do if I can get my account that i have had for so many years and bought much rp supporting riot games.\n\nI also believe that banning an account for flaming perm is not a way to fix the problem of toxicity in league of legends community. I believe punishments such as perm muted with a probation to playing ranked for 6 months, punishments such as these will teach players that if you flame or continue to be toxic in the community, you will pay the price and it will downgrade the amount of \"fun\" you can have while playing league of legends, rather than just freely creating a new account to just continue on and be the same toxic player you were before.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope you consider my appeal.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-01-04T00:56:27.395+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I have spent over $50 in RP towards this account\n\nAnd?

This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nRiot's punishment system used to hand out stacking chat restrictions, such that consistently toxic players basically had a permanent chat restriction. Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nAccording to [Riot Tantram](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000):\n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely.\n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nThe ability to play on a new account doesn't negate the benefits of permabanning toxic players. If every single one of them did that, then it would at least be a minor punishment, taking away their unlocked skins, icons, champs, and so on. Any who don't do that are removed from the game and the problem is solved in at least those instances. Quite frankly, Riot and 99.994% of the playerbase (people without permabans, according to Riot's figures on this, which I see no reason to doubt) don't give one whit for how permabanned players feel about being ejected from the game for consistently appalling behavior. Most permabanned players stop playing the game. It's extremely rare for a permabanned player to be so oblivious and/or unbalanced that they accumulate multiple permabans on a series of accounts. Riot does not have the wherewithal to prevent that except when a highly-visible player (such as a popular streamer) engages in this behavior, in which case they may issue an ID ban (Riot employees manually ban any account that such a player is seen to use).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-01-04T04:05:40.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry they dont do permamutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-01-04T02:17:50.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first step to reducing toxicity is for you to stop thinking people are troll and inters in your games .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hirokikun","date":"2020-01-07T05:38:27.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot only wants your money.
