But why would you think the system isn't optimized? What does Riot gain from punishing \"abiding players\"?\nI'm of the opinion returning an optimized Tribunal would make the system better, but as a singular system, the automized one is the best you can get.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-20T11:01:57.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say there is a reason to retaliate- to defend the ego. Yes, it is generally not the best way to deal with flames, but nor is stoic silence an acceptable option for everyone. We are all different in our self-awareness and it is not a single, rising path. Some *must* defend themselves, be it a fragile sensibility, a need to assert oneself, or, best of all, simply intensify their own emotional fuel. Anger leads to creativity and ambition, and can assist in communicating.\n\nSeriously. \"The angry man is aiming at what he can attain, and the belief that you will attain your aim is pleasant.\" -Aristotle\n\nThis means that angry players- now generally speaking- are more motivated to win, and pushes them harder to positively solve problems. I don't mean in a care-bear manner, I'm talking about effective, practical, non-destructive reasoning to learn and adapt on the fly. Mental fortitude, as mentioned earlier. Stoic play is opposite to this.\n\nAdded to that, being angry and solving a problem is outright *pleasurable*. We humans *love* to get angry and then solve problems. Winning is rewarding, but it is much more satisfying when we were angry.\n\nIndividuals who can make use of this are not inherently bad for the community. Some only let the anger rise in response to flaming, and not only is this a natural human response... it is a GOOD response if tempered with reason. Venting allows people to focus. By restricting people's ability to retaliate, most players continue to be angry without having been able to vent. Now, real common sense here, what happens when you bottle up anger like that?\n\nYa blow up. Every. Last. Human. Will. Blow. Up. Eventually. You HAVE to vent, or stop getting angry.\n\n_**League of Legends is an excellent game to play angry, if you're thinking \"don't play League when angry\", you're wrong.**_\n\nAs long as that anger is not used destructively, as in any scenario.\n\nRetaliating itself, as mentioned earlier, can assist in communicating. Firstly, it can help mitigate or even eliminate hostility. Showing some dominance or confidence in ego pushes back on most people-\n\n\"Pleeb can't last hit the cannon minions\",  \"i CAN and WILL, just stop pushing me to keep trying to protect your ass with your overaggressive pokes!\"\n\n...and the point is NOT that this is okay with the rules, but I insist it should be. The stoic approach would have the ADC remain silent and continue doing their best, be it now focusing on cannons and not help the support's aggressiveness or keep doing what they did to illicit the flame in the first place.\n\nAn angry retaliation will give a third option: focus on cannons with the support aware that the ADC needs to focus on it. Yes, a stoic person can actually achieve this- but as said, it requires someone who is comfortable with that approach, who is cool-headed in the first place. You can't ask an angry person to be stoic and expect them to perform well.\n\nLastly, I'll touch on why bans are bad. Again, actually.\n\nBecause they're entirely ineffective on some, and those individuals go on to be *extremely toxic* and spread suppressed anger like an out of control oil geyser, turning the League community into a primed keg for eventual explosive and destructive eruptions of anger.\n\nYes, it's a good answer to the majority, where banning is effective. This is why it is a moral failure on the few- it's not just to feel good about doing the right thing, it's to make the game better. It's not just the consistently reactive banned players suffering from the extremely toxic individuals, it's everyone, only a few are really suffering.\n\nHow's that for cracking the common perception?","replies":[{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2019-12-20T11:26:13.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see where you're coming from with your theory, but there's 4 problems with it.\n\n1.

If you don't succeed in better communication/play, it's gonna blow up regardless, with even more fuel at that.\n\n3. You undersetimate how quickly people are to give up. Especially in this meta where a single mistake can lose you the lane, any kind of returned flame can easily bring people to afk, troll, etc. That is not just about you as the flamed player, as flame often originates from losing in some aspects of the game (e.g. a failed gank/combo). Otherwise there would be no reason to flame in the first place.\n\n4. If we're talking about one of those people who flame for the sake of ruining others games, it won't matter.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player.

This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it.

When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem.

If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2019-12-18T21:37:07.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kill All Trumper,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=QzOTWFir,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-12-18T12:25:46.829+0000)\n>\n> Literally every single report ive ever gotten has been from me replying to someone who was toxic to me first. I just got banned in a match where my teamates decided to to troll me by flashing into me with zil bombs to kill me. Not one teamate, 2 of them. i then AFKd (it was ARAM and they were obviously premade. If they want to troll randoms, then fuck them)\n> \n> Then they said \"what a useless waste of life\"\n> \n> I said dont troll people next time then he devolved into the typical teenager thing of \"i trolled you and its your fault for being mad at it lmao look at this guy so mad\" etc etc.\n> \n> Enemy team jumped in, \"what a bitch for afk\". Like if they wanted to win the game, why are they flashing into low health teamates with zil bombs on them? Makes zero fucking sense.\n> \n> \n> Just so its clear I hadnt said or done ANYTHING towards them at all. Completely unprovoked trolling by a premade.\n> this is just _this_ match, every other report ive gotten has been me replying to toxic people. There seriously needs to be a system that checks things better. Im sick of getting punished even though im the victim.\n> \n> Getting the chat log on the ban screen saying \"this is why you're banned\" and it _fucking shows that IM the one who was the victim_ is infuriating.\n\nAnd this is why I mute chat. Because Riot doesn't allow you to stand up for yourself. Meaning, you aren't allowed to retaliate! If you do, you get punished. Then, just mute everyone from the get-go so you don't see them type nonsense. I mean, its either that or just not playing the game because no one likes to listen to crap from strangers and take it like a little bitch. \n\nOf-course. You can mute and report! But think about it, out of the X number of games you play a week. How many games do you get where someone just starts spouting nonsense without any provocation at you or someone else on the team? I dare say that atleast a little less than half or even more depending on the times you're playing at. That's just _tilting_.\n\nThen there are some exceptional cases. I saw one OP who I admired quite a bit because he spoke about how if someone says something to him in chat. He just doesn't accept it, it doesn't affect him. He talked about how he learned to control himself better and how strangers saying something to him was irrelevant. It makes sense. But this was one post/thread out of like dozens like the current OP's. I've not seen a similar post since! So my point is, most people who play the game are going to have the mindset like this. \"You slap my face, I'll slap you back!\" And some might even go on to say that they will not only slap your face but also kick it down for starting it. That's the standard response. The current system of no retaliation, mute-report may or may not be working for Riot. I don't know! But I'm interested to see if Riot keeps implementing this current system or revamps it to a newer one.\n\nConclusion? Just mute chat OP. Good luck with your future games. {{sticker:galio-happy}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinful Succubus","date":"2019-12-18T13:21:01.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"excuses are great and all but some chatlogs would be nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"PickPay","date":"2019-12-18T20:37:37.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Banning is a common business practice, all the big companies do it.\nAs for those that say \"you retaliate so you're just as guilty\" they defend the system because they're the ones abusing it.\nSorry you had to learn the hard way.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-12-18T20:57:21.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PickPay,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=QzOTWFir,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-12-18T20:37:37.995+0000)\n>\n> Banning is a common business practice, all the big companies do it.\n> As for those that say \"you retaliate so you're just as guilty\" they defend the system because they're the ones abusing it.\n> Sorry you had to learn the hard way.\n\n...

Are you even playing this game ?\n\nThe rules are pretty simple. Don't insult/antagonize/belittle people in chat. Poor gameplayer behavior is also punishable (starts at 14-day ban), but is harder to catch because of the ambiguity of it when trying to separate it from unintentional unskilled play.\n\nPlaying poorly is not bannable. Playing poorly **intentionally** is.\n\nMeanwhile chat is always under your control 100% of the time. There is no ambiguity to make the process of determining intent difficult.\n\nUnderstanding that poor gameplay behavior is harder to catch is not \"arbitrary\".","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rubber ripper","date":"2019-12-19T00:27:03.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless we see the chat log, it's impossible to know the entire story.
