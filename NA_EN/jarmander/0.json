From a balancing standpoint, I can understand the decision even if it feels awful. In this way, it felt like I was encouraged to ult my teammates instead of myself which was a pretty cool thought.\n\nI was very unpleasantly surprised to find out that even if Kayle ults one of her allies, she still needs to wait until the swords rain down after a couple seconds before she can do anything. I really feel that this doesn't fit at all.\n\nWhen you ult someone as Kayle (as the ult is right now), you have one or two motives:\n\n1. Save your ally/make them invulnerable\n2. Nuke the enemy team with a pseudo-Neeko ultimate\n\nThe constant is that Kayle needs to sacrifice her DPS and literally do nothing for a while if she chooses to save an ally meaning that Kayle has to choose between doing damage herself (auto attacking) or saving her allies (which locks her into doing nothing). That does not live up to the late game fantasy at all and it feels incredibly disruptive to play as Kayle, only to halt the flow of your auto attack barrage for a significant amount of time. \n\nIn fact, I'd say it's pretty plausible that there are tons of situations late game where it would be more beneficial for Kayle to simply not waste time saving her ally and get off 5 or 6 autos instead. So it's almost never ideal to ult either yourself or an ally as Kayle unless it's for the sake of the damage from the ultimate itself which really shouldn't be the case. IMO, the Kayle's ultimate is all about the invulnerability and that's what should be played around, not the damage aspect.\n\ntl;dr Kayle's ultimate doesn't work well with her kit as it is. It completely interrupts the flow of Kayle's playstyle, especially in the late game (where it is supposed to all come together) and frankly just feels awful in comparison to everything else. You either ult a teammate, making yourself completely helpless for a couple seconds (which is a very long time in a teamfight) or you ult yourself and you don't get to do anything during the invulnerability (i.e. a tuned up master yi meditate).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-02-21T09:08:22.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But is needed to make her balanced, it's not healthy that her alone can make herself invulnerable and melt everyone without counterplay\n\nI love the idea of her new R","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2019-02-21T06:29:19.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From a player's perspective i'd say that sounds terribly counterintuitive.\n\nGameplay-wise, however, the fact her ultimate is practically the same as a Neeko ult that DOESN'T reduce your movement speed means letting the late game hypercarry with undodgeable AOE true damage BASIC ATTACKS basic attack while casting/channeling it turn her into the de facto strongest champion in the entire game, to the point there's no counterplay whatsoever. Heck, an AOE nuke already has extremely little counterplay on a champion that can build mage items and massively buff their movement speed for an extended duration. Letting her basic attack WHILE completely invulnerable and charging up an AOE Nuke?\n\nJust think about it for a second. Try to come up with a way to play against it that doesn't involve building Zhonya's hourglass, playing Elise or playing Sivir.","replies":[{"poster":"Jarmander","date":"2019-02-21T06:46:03.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All your points about movement speed and being able to run up to someone with a nuke sounds broken if you describe it like that. But consider that when Kayle ults herself, she will almost certainly moving back, not jumping into the middle of a team. It works with Neeko to jump into the enemy team because, first of all, it's way huger, and second of all, there's a big stun that allows her not to get blown up the ultimate ends.\n\nI'm not saying that Kayle's current ultimate is super weak. I'm saying it feels awful to play. Kayle shouldn't feel incentive to purposely not ult her teammates in order to preserve her own DPS. She also shouldn't feel incentive to walk into the enemy team if she ults herself (for the AOE ult damage). There is no situation where ulting anybody (whether herself or an ally) feels like how Kayle should be played right now.\n\nAnd as a side note, her true damage only affects tanks, her damage output against squishies is largely the same, especially given that she used to have armor/MR shred in her passive anyways. She has always been a face melting, late game, invulnerable auto attacking machine in the late game. Nothing in that regard has changed other than she can kill tanks much faster now. Of course, if they were to restore auto attacking capability to Kayle's ultimate, they would take power from somewhere else and I'd be super fine with that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2019-02-21T13:47:35.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna be real with you, they wanted kayle to keep her iconic ultimate but not be unfun to play against because of it.

You can't make yourself helpless while being invulnerable, your invulnerable, you cannot die. \n2. I don't want to have to deal with a Kayle ulted Yi diving my team while kayle casually helps him rip apart my team in 3 seconds.\n3.

To add to this, when kayle reaches late game she's an absolute monster, the only way to stop her is to kill her but she has invulnerability, the fact she can't attack you adds a lot of counterplay and outplay potential because if she ults the second she see's an Evelynn she has a higher chance of dying since evelynn can chose not to attack, on the other side if kayle ults when she starts to take damage or, she's about to die, evelynn misses out on all her damage and more than likely the kill itself. Current kayle does not have this counterplay, because kayle can immediately ult and prevent all damage while simultaneously being able to dish out damage herself, by backloading her damage with an End Effect you also punish player's that over committed to killing kayle and failed to do so.
