I was playing a game a few days ago with Babsey and all of a sudden he leaves the game and can't log in, after a few attempts he was able to get in and play. Later on that day Babsey stopped playing but some one went on his account. The user also gifted himself 2500 worth of RP. Some one has hacked or has my friends account which resulted him to get perma-banned for no reason.\nPls Help My friend Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Babsey","date":"2017-05-16T16:54:58.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for you support bearbeast","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-05-16T17:13:19.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's normal for an account to get banned if compromised to stop the hacker from doing more harm until they know its safely back in the true owner's hands.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-16T17:03:06.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've removed those names for security reasons.
