There are already plenty of active items to mange .\r\nAn other reason i dont like this item is because it doesnt feel strong even though i know it is really strong. locket = immediat shield, zzrot= voidlings, zhonias= untargetable, glory=gottagofast, frostqueen=ghosts,.. -&gt; stoneplate: i get a big bigger and i didnt die but if i didnt knew i pushed to button i would have tough there was a bug that made some spels put their spell through.\r\nAlso its basic stats always make me feel bad. Yeah i know about the doubling resistance and the hp on active but when you buy it its a ton of gold for 80 resistances which puts me off it.\r\n\r\nTDLR: if we really do need this new active item as a core item, pls make the active more clear on use and give more stats in item and less in the active.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-26T22:54:27.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everyone complaining how stone plate is too strong and then there is this one person.\n\n\nHmm...
