However, I will say some of his designs rely a little too hard on gimmicks to function, and more often than not, he gets carried away just adding in a whole bunch of things that shouldn't be added in, or oversimplifying some parts of the kit (Zoe R) so that he can distribute the power into another part of the kit at a much higher capacity (Zoe Q). He needs to follow the words of Coco Chanel in regards to accessories - Take off the last thing you put on. If he started pruning his kits a little better, and worked a little hard at easing up his power distribution, he'll do fine, and if it take people hovering over him to coax him in that direction (like what happened with Warwick), then by all means, get those people to work with him. I think he just goes way too ham on his own, like the kid who wants to try all the jellybeans in the jars when his mom says he can get a piece of candy, so having some control and boundaries set for him will go a long way towards improving his designs. Sure, thinking and innovating outside the box is the way of progress, but then, so is innovating inside the box, in making existing things more efficient or twisting the rules a little bit that create new twists on things that have been done before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IvernBramblefoot","date":"2018-02-01T17:47:32.982+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"i appreciate the man's creativity, i just wish he would be fired and then hired instantly by some other company that doesn't make this game, with exactly the same pay and benefits. i don't wish the man any ill, in fact, if he was unleashed to rework ALL OF THE CHAMPIONS, i'd be okay with his vision, then it would be even, at least. it's not really 100% his fault either, it's riot's for hiring a guy who clearly has a different vision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"abca98","date":"2018-02-01T19:52:36.551+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" mechanical skill\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"{{item:3046}}{{item:3031}}   {{item:3022}} {{item:3072}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kavren2055","date":"2018-02-02T01:04:18.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ignoring balance all his champs fit their theme.
