Whenever it is patching it stops around 70% or so and gives me the failed patch error 004. I've read the threads in the forums and scoured the internet for fixes to no avail. I downloaded the hextech repair tool, but for some reason when it goes to configuring the DNS I get an an error with the Chromium Embedded Framework which always crashes. I've tried running everything as administrator and setting permissions to administrator as well. I've tried to reset my DNS and reinstall the game, plus download the latest patcher, but it still isn't working. I checked the unhelpful forum post and made sure I went down the checklist: ex. (make sure windows is fully updated) and whatnot. Please if anyone else has this issue please help me. I'm slowly going insane here and don't wanna spend all day trying to install a game, but repeatedly failing.\r\n\r\nANY HELP WOULD  BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.

It sounds like the client is trying to update some of those files but it hasn't been able to without the right permissions. Run through this guide on [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and let me know if that gets you running again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chibbslol","date":"2017-08-14T20:47:14.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really nothing?
