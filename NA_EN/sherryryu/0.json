Game says my ping is 500","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like my ping likes to go up whenever I get in the actual game. On loading screen (before the game started), my ping was at 30. Once I started farming my lane, my ping jumped to 300 from 30~50. Is there a way to fix this? I had no background app running. It gets worse when trying to team fight or anything. This has happened before and riot  told that I had pocket loss issue. But, the problem is that this ping jump is very random. Sometimes, I have a very smooth game on the ping of 30 throughout. Sometimes, I have a game of 500~2000 ping on the same internet. I really wish to solve this problem and play the game :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-25T18:32:47.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sudden lag spikes like this can be due to a weak connection or even packet loss, so the game server can't communicate what's going on in the match.
