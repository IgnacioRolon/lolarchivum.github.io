My ping usually stays around 50 to 70. However, the game I played yesterday, my ping was at 2000 to 3000 continuously. \r\n\r\nI played one game last night and called it end. Today, I decided to give a shot at the bot game to test my ping. I played two bot game and they were fine. It was running fine as it supposed to be. I thought that \"The ping is fine. I should play a normal game.\" \r\n\r\nThen, I got into draft normal game. It started out fine for few seconds... then my ping hit 300 when the enemy jg invaded our jg. It stayed at 150 to 300 mostly throughout the whole game. Without my support (who happened to crash and came back later), I tried to stay with my turret and farm as much as I could. Now, I was lucky enough to have a good player to carry the game and won the game, but I want to actually play the game and put contribution in team fight. \r\n\r\nThe ping was fine on Bot game, but why would it go crazy on draft normal? Is this happening to any of you guys? I would really love to get some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T16:39:32.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your network is having problems maintaining communication with the game server, so it can't provide information being sent from other players in your match.
