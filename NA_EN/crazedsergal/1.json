It still gave me a ban.

I know it feelsbadman, but it really sounds like you might have been gone long enough to get marked as AFK which regardless of winning or losing, will still get you the AFK penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedSergal","date":"2017-12-11T01:08:44.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was only gone for 2 mins however, it was at the very start of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T01:32:33.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're always welcome to reach out to the player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for those types of discussions, we can't take action on punishments here from the boards. \n\nAlso, keep in mind the system won't apply 20 min LPQ's on the first AFK. Usually, you get away without any penalties until the system notices a trend of leaves, at which point you only get 5 min LPQ's. You only get 20 min LPQ's when the system notices a history of that behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedSergal","date":"2017-12-11T02:40:30.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i've had plenty of occasions where my computer craps out or my patch messed up DX feels bad","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CrazedSergal","date":"2017-12-11T01:11:03.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was only gone for 2 mins however, it was at the very start of the game.
