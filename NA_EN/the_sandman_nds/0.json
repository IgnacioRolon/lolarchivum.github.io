Every lane loses. at 15 mins it&#039;s 12-3, 5-0 towers and a 4v5 game. I start a surrender vote and 2 people vote no. Their excuse? &quot;I&#039;m having fun, plus we outscale&quot;. \r\n\r\nThey drag the game out to 29 mins, we lose still 4v5, 9-1 towers, something like 29-6 in kills. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m the jerk for being frustrated at their wasting of my time. \r\n\r\nMy argument is pretty straight forward. It&#039;s bad sportsmanship to force people to play out an obvious loss. When the game is over, you knock over your king and start again. In the 15 mins they forced everyone to play out, we could have all been starting a new, hopefully more competitive game. \r\n\r\nI have nothing against losing. I&#039;ll play out a game that still has a decent chance to win (decent can be even 15% or so). But once your only hope to win is that 2 of them randomly d/c, it&#039;s time to move on. People have a limited amount of time to dedicate to leisure, forcing them to waste that time is selfish. \r\n\r\nThe &quot;never surrender no mater what&quot; attitude confuses me. The point is to have fun. Games on either extreme are not fun. Being face stomped, or doing the stomping, isn&#039;t really fun. \r\n\r\nAnyway, maybe I&#039;m just venting.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-06-16T18:47:17.715+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":">I'm having fun\n\nAt this point you have all the information you need. It's a vote for a reason.\n\nEither way, it's interesting that you should mention some people not having a lot of time for gaming available, yet you seem to not be thinking about people who simply might not have enough time to reliably commit to playing another game. By surrendering a game where they are still having fun, you might actually be cutting away from their leisure time.\nLikewise, surrendering a game where you still see a possibility to win, however slim, can be extremely frustrating. So again by surrendering because you find the game unfun, you might be taking away from their enjoyment of the game.\n\nYour fun and your time is not more important than anybody else's.","replies":[{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2017-06-17T13:53:04.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can only speak for myself but if somebody is going 1-12 18 minutes in and we have 4 towers down it really isn't fun for me or anybody else.

At that point, their enjoyment is moot since they are breaking the Summoner's Code.  We all have those two people who think even if it was 99-1 the team with 1 kill has a chance, but when people feed excessively and at least one person is AFK, 3/5 needs to be a viable surrender option.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-06-17T22:25:04.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">most of the people I encounter who refuse to surrender are the ones causing the loss in the first place and think its funny\n\nAre you sure that you're not reading too much into that? I rarely encounter this type of player... and honestly, it has nothing to do with the vote at this point anymore anyway. I mean, would it suddenly be okay if it was three people trolling with their vote? Would it be okay for three trolls to actively surrender a winnable game for the lulz?\n\nTrolls are always going to be a problem in any voting system, and they're going to be problem regardless of which outcome the vote is biased towards. And while the current system gives them more power to refuse to surrender unenjoyable games, lowering the required votes for a surrender gives them more power to surrender perfectly fine games. And I simply don't consider that to be the more reasonable option.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-06-16T18:44:12.137+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Comebacks are super satisfying to be a part of.

I can't tell you the amount of games where I had a similar situation and those two people refused to change their votes even when they were the ones usually feeding/dying the most.  So what should have been a 20 minute game went on to 40-45 minutes and it was beyond frustrating to deal with.\n\nThe problem is what you do about it.  If you flame you get reported, if you AFK you get reported, if you feed you get reported.  3/5 is 60% majority and would fix a lot of this, or at least have the option available if two or more people are premade/in the same club.  I believe there are unwinnable games, period, and there are those rare occasions where everything is against you and still you pull off the upset.   Riot needs to have a 3/5 majority for surrenders, even if its starting at 25 mins rather than 20.   What do they have to lose?
