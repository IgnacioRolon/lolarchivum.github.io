By hitting that you can turn it off and be able to freely move the camera around!","replies":[{"poster":"ImMartian","date":"2017-04-21T22:20:53.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sorry i should try and explain myself better.

I'm not entirely sure what could cause that, but let's start by resetting your config files to see if that fixes it.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"ImMartian","date":"2017-04-22T00:32:38.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried that a couple times before posting with no luck, i have also uninstalled and reinstalled the game just to see if that would help.

That camera thing may feel like a small issue, but it can definitely affect your gameplay. I'm not entirely sure what might be causing that, so let's get you set up with our tech guys through a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
