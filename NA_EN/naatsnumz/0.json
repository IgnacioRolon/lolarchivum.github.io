Use \"104.160.131.3\" NA server (as far as I know).\r\n\r\nIf you are too lazy to install it. The simpler way to see what I'm about to describe is by using the command prompt and doing a continuous ping. Like this \"Ping 104.160.131.1 -t\" hit enter. To stop it and see the results press Ctrl+C. I would let this run for at least 5 minutes before posting results.\r\n\r\nMy game has been feeling like it has small delays, its especially noticeable when last hitting.\r\n\r\nI decided to look into my connection using PingPlotter and the results were interesting. Find it at pingplotter.com\r\n\r\nIf some of you guys can please share it might help shed some light on this issue.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm noticing is that my connection doesn't show packet loss and the \"AVERAGE\" ping is ok but I get frequent spikes into the hundreds which is shown in the \"Maximum Latency column (add this manually by right clicking on Avg column and adding a checkmark to it \"Maximum Latency\". The spikes can also be seen on the graph.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know RIOT is not the issue here, this happens to me when I ping other places as well such as google.\r\n\r\nWhat this could help us see though is if we are having issues with our internet connection at our end.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T04:22:29.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall great post here. Your Pingplotter results certainly show some pretty nasty latency spikes along your entire route and even starting inside your own network. In your situation, reaching out to your ISP may be a good next move, since they may need to have someone come out and check the equipment or line just outside your home. \n\nLet me know if you have any other concerns. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Naatsnumz","date":"2016-11-01T00:59:46.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. \n\nI had already been through 3 issued Comcast XB3  (Arris, Cisco, Technicolor, all in 1 voice modems) and the problem persisted. \n\nAs a last effort before going completely insane I decided to purchase my own modem (Netgear CM500) and it fixed the problem. I later added a Nighthawk X4S that I'm still contemplating on keeping. Problem seems to be almost entirely fixed hardwired with latency mostly varying between 34-58ms on Ping Plotter. \n\nWith wireless I get very rare packet loss starting at the router gateway all the way to the final hop at about 0.1%. The latency seems to average at about 42 ms but has occasional spikes into the hundreds on the round trip and as high as 98 at the gateway. This is why I'm contemplating on returning the router, despite its amazing \"gamer router\" reviews.\n\nI was recently at a Marriott Wireless 2.4 GHz connection and it seemed even more stable than my hardwiree connection with latency only varying about 11 ms. I was very surprised to see this from a wireless hotel connection. Although It did have a spike of 124 ms during my 60 minutes of testing.\n\nAny suggestions on a router? Main focus is hardwired stability while other wireless devices are connected and per device bandwidth control/QoS on its software, which BTW my Netgear R7800 lacks.\n\nThanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T21:00:32.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The right network solution for your home really depends on a lot of factors. Some of these can be how many other wireless networks are nearby and what channels they're currently occupying. Additionally, depending on the layout of the home, you may require repeaters or powerline adapters to ensure best coverage.\n\nI can't really suggest specific models of routers, as there are some good choices from most brands out there, but again, it really depends on your specific devices and what will be done on the network. I recommend checking out [LinusTechTips](https://linustechtips.com/main/) or [Tek Syndicate](https://teksyndicate.com/) for some more detailed information that may help you make the best choice for your network.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
