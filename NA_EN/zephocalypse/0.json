At the end, my stats didn't load and the game wasn't recorded. After a while, and restarting league multiple times, the game is recorded but I'm still at 100 LP and didn't rank up. Kinda confused and annoyed since we won the game with four people on our team...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-17T01:47:59.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm this does a look a little weird, but it might have only been a small visual error on the client. I can see where you were sitting at 97 LP for a bit, then it finally pushed up and you entered and won your promos.
