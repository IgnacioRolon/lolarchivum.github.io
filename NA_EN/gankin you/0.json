Whenever League is open while that happens it says \"you lost connection to the patcher we don't know why blah blah blah\" and fucking instantly dumps the patches so when I re-open League I have to re-install a 1627.5 MB patch. This takes like 3 hours on this internet and it keeps fucking happening. \r\n\r\nThis is not okay, why does it do that just because of a connection loss? I took 6 hours to fully reinstall the game because it kept bugging out like seen here:\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4LSVkJf.png\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hJXeWPi.png\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QuLcIBn.png\r\n\r\nThen after I finally get done re-installing it has to patch the client, my internet restarts and it fucking dumped it all again. This is not okay, how do I disable this stupid fucking feature?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T21:34:53.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks that you're hitting so many connection issues with that hotel internet =\\ . Basically, the patcher is trucking along, but it hits a sort of hiccup during the process which interrupts the patch, but the patcher doesn't realize and keeps trucking along. I'd maybe try getting a hard-wired connection *if at all possible* since hotel wifi is known to be pretty spotty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-11T15:34:52.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a patch is interrupted, it has the potential to cause massive problems in critical files in the game folder. At best, this could lead to graphical or merely minor bugs, at worst it could cause the client (or worse Windows/OSX) to crash when you try and run it. To be completely safe, if the patcher recognizes that files may have been corrupted due to a spotty connection or other interruption, it re-checks all files to confirm they are up-to-date and non-corrupt. If it notices corruption in a file, it will restart the patch so as to ensure that no files it *didn't* detect were missed.\n\nTLDR: you can't disable this feature because the client would not work without it.","replies":[]}]}
