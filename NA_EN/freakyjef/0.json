Realistically if a player is going 2/23 in a bronze 5 game trying their hardest, ranked is obviously not the place for them. They need a lot of practice, and ranked should be out of the question if they dont even have the basics of the game like csing, pinging, or, well, anything. A system i would have in mind is if a player is performing like this in numerous games over and over, they have a week suspension and until they show improvement they get to do placement type of games to prove they are ready for ranked which would be available once a week.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-07-15T20:15:33.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=freakyjef,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=u3RrjjAq,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-07-15T06:41:33.148+0000)\n>\n> If a player is so bad that having them on your team is a loss 99% of the time, why can they not get a ranked suspension until they improve?\n\nBecause if they **really** have such an abysmal winrate over a significant amount of games they will play against people who would not have done any better in their place.\nPeople do extremely badly when they are matched against far better players. Punishing people because Riot didn't find them a proper match seems beyond ridiculous.\n\nEdit: I mean, just consider what usually happens within the first week after the soft reset. Lots of lopsided matches that are simply created by matchmaking having to cope with people climbing and falling back to where they belong. You could have lots of gold players screwed over completely by bad luck, who on top of this might then get suspended in ranked... and for what? For performing on their average level while being matched against people that before the reset were ranked plat and diamond?","replies":[{"poster":"freakyjef","date":"2017-07-17T20:31:50.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the account i was playing on was i think b2 and had a 75 ish win rate yet i got matched with a bronze 5 0 lp person with a 7 (i think it was 7 when i checked op.gg) win rate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I suck at Jhin","date":"2017-07-15T16:19:03.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because if that was the case, we would have only 5 different ranks.\n\nChallenger, Master, Diamond I 90LP, Diamond I 0LP, Permabanned from ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2017-07-15T18:34:19.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok i'm horny now.","replies":[{"poster":"I suck at Jhin","date":"2017-07-15T19:55:13.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go wank to ahri?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MatthewRT2","date":"2017-07-15T06:48:13.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We don't discriminate here unless you main Yasuo; If you are a Yasuo main just move along because we don't take to kindly to you persons.","replies":[{"poster":"freakyjef","date":"2017-07-15T06:51:18.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are a katarina jungle main who just went zed top and went 0/7/1 with 31 cs in a 22 mintues game Q_Q","replies":[{"poster":"MatthewRT2","date":"2017-07-15T06:52:48.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I bet the tried as hard as they could.","replies":[{"poster":"freakyjef","date":"2017-07-15T06:54:43.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And sometimes that isnt enough which is why i proposed this solution :)","replies":[{"poster":"MatthewRT2","date":"2017-07-15T06:58:59.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze is mostly about being able to carry, I don't play ranked because of people like these and just take it easy in norms. \n\nthere's a reason they are in bronze 5","replies":[{"poster":"freakyjef","date":"2017-07-15T07:24:33.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but if b5 is too high of a skill level, there are issues","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2017-07-16T11:33:03.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last season I had a long spell at B5 0 LP where I lost multiple games in a row.
