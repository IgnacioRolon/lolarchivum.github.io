How can I level this up if I can't even write on most posts/create posts half the time? Does anyone know any way to make this quicker for me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-19T23:23:45.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are connected, but it can just take a moment for your account to sync to your boards profile.  Your level looks to be showing 25 now!  Let me know if you run into any issues, though!","replies":[]}]}
