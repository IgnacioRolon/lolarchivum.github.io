I was at around  90 lp and a winning game wouldve taken me straight to promo, now im instead at 73 LP? Do not tell me as a rioter that you can't do anything about this because that would be extremely bad of you.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-13T15:50:16.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey that sucks man, I'm sorry.  I've been seeing a few reports today, and I reached out to EU support for more info.  There was an issue earlier with an exchange point that should be resolved. We can't restore game losses but I'd really like to find out what's going on.  When you get a moment, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to the EUW game server 192.64.170.252.  This will help us see if there's an issue while routing.","replies":[]}]}
