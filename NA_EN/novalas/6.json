And when it's veigar's job to eliminate a single target as quickly and efficiently as possible, it becomes difficult to do so, as most time the veigar player will either waste a lot of potential damage on his ult or run the risk of not killing the target at all.\n\nI understand the point of execution abilities, but when a champ's end game fantasy is pressing the delete button on a single champ.\n\nLong story short, can we see about getting visual indicators for when a target can be killed by a veig ult?

It also allows Ivern to base early and buy boots only having smited one camp, meaning he can get level 4 at 3:08 or 3:17 (depending on which clear he's doing) with boots rather than with Faerie Charm (which is the only reasonable purchase on that clear without Future's Market). Ryze can back a wave early to get his Tear, Kassadin can reliably hit his Catalyst, and so on. \n\nMost of these interactions take substantial planning and foresight to use, so I expect to see them crop up more in competitive play than I do in soloqueue. Future's Market is very invisible power that's hard to see or feel, so it's not surprising to me that most players don't think it's strong, especially when it's also inconsistent power in most cases.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LÃ©Noir","date":"2017-11-21T21:00:49.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey :D Shaco main here!

I think enchanter supports have a lot of options of what they can spec into. Kleptomancy, Summon: Aery, and maybe even Guardian are viable keystones for supports. I also think that enchanters have viable secondary runes in all the trees (Zombie Ward, Ingenious Hunter, Manaflow Band, Transendance, Scorch, Revitalize, Biscuits, Celestial Body).

In fact, we noted that we didn't have much collective experience on Mordekaiser ~2 months ago and put in a bunch of games to increase mastery. I personally put in the most games, playing 34 games in total across multiple different accounts. We do care about every champion, and we're constantly working to make sure we have appropriate knowledge coverage across the entire champion roster.\n\nAs far as your actual question, I'd say Mordekaiser feels a bit different on Runes. Before Runes went live I typically ran DFT Mordekaiser top and had a lot of success with that, though I did see some success with Stormraider's as well. On Runes Reforged I don't feel there's a good replacement for DFT (Comet doesn't seem as impactful to me for Morde), so I've run Phase Rush in every game I've played him and it feels relatively similar to Stormraider's Morde was before Runes Reforged although a bit less good early on and much better mid-late. Not needing to actually do a lot of damage to trigger the movespeed boost means it's easier to get away with lower damage builds (I typically prefer Rylai's+Liandry's -> full tank), but it does reward less for higher damage/burst builds like Gunblade. \n\nOverall feeling on Morde is that he's a lane-dominant juggernaut that has higher highs and lower lows than other similar champions (e.g. Illaoi, Darius). Both Illaoi and Darius have meaningful ways to contribute while behind and/or without committing their bodies to a fight, whereas Mordekaiser doesn't really have those options.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-11-21T23:34:34.602+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's a sound assessment and I'd like to share a bit of my own insight on preseason Mordekaiser.\n\nI personally always preferred SRS over DFT for the sheer combat mobility it provided and how easy it made sticking to some champions.\nNow with preseason Phase Rush replaced SRS and it is in fact better late game, mostly due to the slow resistance and how reliable it is to proc with simple E, R and Gunblade.\n\nI've been performing really well with him, using a standard Hybrid bruiser build {{item:3146}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3135}}  {{item:3078}} /{{item:3065}} \nHe does benefit a lot from the Sorcery tree and resolve adds that little extra bulk he needs in tough lanes.\nHe actually got the best kind of base stat compensation, making the little defense he gets from resolve even better on him.\n\nIn terms of overall performance and the amount of people always asking you guys on your thoughts on Morde, I do believe a lot of people just aren't used to mordekaiser and are somewhat uninformed about him. He does have a bad reputation for being \"bugged\" and \"bad\" despite him being one of the strongest laners with monstrous snowballing potential and ways to turn a losing game into a win with his ultimate.\n\nBut yes, he always suffered from a lack of fallback patterns when he's not doing too well due to poor baseline durability and lack of utility.\nI do suggest moving away from the Rylais/Liandries+Tank combo though as it falls off like a brick late game and does not make good use of his strong AP/Ad ratios and his durability being heavily linked to how much damage he can dish out.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2017-11-21T21:00:18.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thoughts about attack speed slows?

There's multiple reasons that many attack speed slows have been reduced or removed over time (Nasus W reduced, Darius W removed, Frozen Heart reduced), but there's also reasons for them to be in the game. In some cases attack speed slows give champions a specific niche they can play to (for example, Nasus' matchups into AS-based champions are stronger because of his W, which doesn't affect many other matchups - this is part of what makes him better as a toplaner than as a jungler). \n\nOverall I think attack speed slows feel worse than they are (in terms of raw power), but there are other similar mechanics in the game like silence and grounding that can still do good things in the right spot. In my opinion (note this is just my personal opinion, not the opinion of a designer or Live Gameplay or anything) I'd prefer it if attack speed slows were less frequent than they are now and perhaps a bit lower overall, but I think it's good for the game for certain safety valves to exist like Frozen Heart.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-11-21T21:44:02.225+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel attack speed stacking is out of control.

Hell the games are going to be over before I can get popcorn and a soda.\n\n\nWell at least HotS is a thing... because if I'm going to have to deal with sub 20 minute games... I'd rather do it in an environment where a 2 item Trist isn't E-> 4 shotting my 140 armor Bruiser 15 minutes in. Last hit for 10 minutes... leave lane.. die to Adc... get 5 minutes of actual play, half of it gray screened. Not a health thing for league.\n\n\nFB tower at 5-6 minutes is pretty much a thing now.\n\nFYI the team that get's FB tower wins > 60% of the time. (>62% if they are Blue side.)  It's boring to know the outcome 6 minutes in every game.... you know? The game hasn't been this snowbally since Season 2 Jax and Spell vamp stacking Akali.  Even then at least it took them 30 minutes to reach god status. I think most of us are missing Metagolem at this point. 45 minutes matches where games played out in a series of battles to see who won the war. Now it's FB Tower + Herald = your going to win 75% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-11-27T09:03:34.102+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure if you had actually been to the \"Red Tracker\" in the past week, you'd have seen at least a dozen Rioter Posts that answer each of your issues just fine.\n\nTowers will be buffed next patch.\nKlepto Ez is not out of line.\nBE is getting some changes, and Cactopus and co. have been super active on the boards to reply to every questions.\nGame time isn't much lower than before. 30 seconds, to be precise.

She's one of the top champions in the game in terms of winrate going up over games played, and she's also very strong in competitive play, so buffing her for the majority of the playerbase without overbuffing her experienced/competitive play is a hard ask. The goal with these changes is that it helps her out across the board but mostly buffs less experienced players, as her highly experienced winrate right now isn't bad, it's her overall performance that's in the gutter. That's why these changes are relatively conservative even though her overall winrate is quite poor.\n\nOn Press the Attack - based both on my personal experience and on internal data, Press the Attack is not Camille's optimal keystone. Phase Rush is seeing significantly more success and even other keystones outside Precision like Aery are outperforming PtA, which indicates to me that when people switch off PtA (or PtA becomes more usable for Camille, whichever comes first) Camille will probably see more overall success. \n\nAll told I'm not sure these buffs will be enough for Camille to feel good for most players, but we'll see. She feels pretty strong to me with these changes in but I have >100 games on her so that's not unexpected.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-11-27T23:52:21.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love that champ, and I wish she was more accessible.

E is already a lot of base damage, a stun, and an attack speed steroid if you hit it, and the punishment is already high if you miss - taking Aftershock feels like a win-more keystone where it only helps you when you're already doing well (hitting people with E in a position where you can stick around afterwards). Having health as a set bonus also isn't the best - for Camille above almost all other champions she wants to have kill threat if the jungler comes since her gank assist is so powerful, so it's easier to take offensive runes and itemize defensively early than it is to take defensive runes and itemize offensively since her early offensive itemization isn't great in bad matchups (doesn't have a lot of longswords in early build path for those matchups since you don't want to go Tiamat, and Sheen is a 1050g spike that's hard to get to early on). \n\nIn ARAM I think Aftershock is probably decent since she never gets a chance to 1v1 anyone and it's a lot easier to hit random Es, so it fits well.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-11-28T17:42:19.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer! I know this isn't Endstep's Camille 101 Guide, but I'll ask anyway because I love this champ...\n\nI understand Camille pretty well. The main problem I have is landing E and all the micro around a minion wave. For example, if I'm Katarina, I can hold the \"target champion only\" key for Shunpo, and I automatically get an aa reset.\n\nIf I'm Camille, a minion can shift in front of E, and I lose the stun and aspd bonus. There's no aa input on E, so you have to hit A after landing, and autos don't work with the \"target champ only\" function. \n\nSo you have a chance to miss E. A chance to misstarget the first Qaa. A chance to attack a minion when moving after first Q, since there's no move input without a built-in attack command. Then another chance to miss second Qaa. While timing aa resets, using an active item, and risking creep block.\n\nCompared to champs like Fiora or Irelia, that's a lot of inputs in a really short window surrounded by a bunch of moving hitboxes, and you have to execute them in succession with 100% accuracy to duel anything. Is there some trick to making Camille a bit more foolproof, or is completely perfect micro actually her intended skill floor?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-11-29T00:47:43.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hitting minions with E doesn't remove the possibility of getting the attackspeed/stun. All you have to do is hit a champion, and Camille's E2 only stops on hitting champions, not minions, so you can go through minions to hit champions and still get the full benefit of the ability. Holding \"target champ only\" won't do anything since Camille E is a skillshot, but you shouldn't have any problems with minions causing you to lose the stun/AS bonus. If you do have clips of that let me know and I can forward them over to someone who can take a look into what's causing it, though I've never heard of that being an issue before.\n\nAs far as \"is Camille's skillfloor at perfect micro,\" I'd say no - I don't think it's a lot to ask people not to hit minions with multiple abilities in a short window. She's definitely a lot more complex to play than someone like Jax or Irelia (after all, she is one of the most difficult champions to play by all metrics I know of), but the tight timing/relative high barrier of execution on EQAAQ is not what makes her so much harder in my opinion. I'd say her positioning as one of the weakest (perhaps the weakest) laning bruisers on top of being forced into double damage items, making her very easy to punish for any mistakes is a large part of what makes her difficult. In addition to that, she has a lot of counterintuitive optimization decisions (for example, almost all bruisers max their primary damage tool first, which for Camille is Q, but E max is almost always superior), requires a huge amount of matchup knowledge (as most bruisers do) to perform in lane, and has many small nuances with each ability to optimize usage (level scaling on Q true damage conversion, whether to guarantee W off of E stun, positioning closer to walls to get faster E casts, etc.). That's a lot of complexity for one champion, and I'd guess if you had a strong grasp on everything _but_ the micromanagement of EQAAQ you'd be a very respectable Camille player, even if the micro is the most noticeable thing that separates unskilled Camille players from skilled ones. I don't think it's necessary to have perfect micro to be a competent Camille player, but as with any champion every mistake has a cost. Camille has a lot of opportunities to make mistakes and the cost for executing improperly is usually high for her, which is what makes her so difficult, but I don't think that means perfect micro is her baseline - she can function with some execution errors.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Evil Yasuo","date":"2017-11-24T21:44:19.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to take predator on Talon but electrocute is just too good on him for laning.
