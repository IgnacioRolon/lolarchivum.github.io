I'm a QA Analyst on Riot’s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who work on Core Gameplay playing new and in dev content before they’re released. It’s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with to ensure that we’re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\r\n\r\nRather than a Patch Chat, we’re opting for a new approach these next few patch cycles. Lots of changes are planned in the upcoming patches and a lot of content is or has been on PBE for awhile. We’d like you guys to talk to us about your questions or concerns with upcoming content - We’ve tested a lot of it and would be more than happy to give you guys insight on how the changes are panning out. If you’d like us to test something in particular out - let us know and we can try to get it into a playtest.\r\n\r\nThe biggest changes on PBE right now are the Marksman changes and Pyke, the Bloodharbor Ripper. If you have any Pyke related questions (or water door related questions), feel free to ask Hjarta and Auberaun who were the playtesters on Pyke while he was in development! \r\n\r\nWe’d love for players to get in on this &amp; help the Playtest team make Patch 8.11 launch as smoothly as possible!\r\n\r\nHere’s a link to the content currently on the PBE.\r\nhttps://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html\r\n\r\nAlso, we're all on his list. \r\n\r\nBrandon \"Roku\" Davis\r\nChris “Auberaun” Roberts\r\nChristy “Riot Ender L” Frierson\r\nNick “Riot Endstep” Frijia\r\nSigmundur “GangIeri” Helgason\r\nArnor “Riot Hjarta” Halldorsson\r\nMiktat “Riot Koyuncu” Koyuncu\r\nBrian “Riot Madness Heroo” Pressoir\r\nNabi “Riot Novalas” Barak\r\nDan “Riot penguin” Hardison\r\nRobert “ROBERTxLEE” Lee\r\nLouis \"nubblez\" Carpetto","replies":[{"poster":"Rajinikanth Fan","date":"2018-05-17T20:19:26.342+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"Why are we talking to the playtest team and not the balance team.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hjarta","date":"2018-05-17T20:58:17.534+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Comes to a post named \"PBE Chat with the Playtest Team\"\n> \"Why are we talking to the Playtest team?\"\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2018-05-16T22:02:36.590+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Riot Novalas\n(Or whoever is best qualified to answer)\n\n\nA couple comments:\n\n1 - bloodthirster.

I understand that not every champion is suitable for multiple roles and I think Pyke fits into that category. You don't want a champion's identity to be artificially constrained by being forced to be good in several roles. \n\nHowever, if it seems doable without compromising the design and identity, it is only a good thing for the players. It's more work for you guys but it's so much more rewarding and enjoyable for the players. In fact, you guys even do this sometimes. Ekko being supported as both a jg and mid is an excellent example of this. However, it seems rather random and players on the off-role are often treated like second-class citizens. The off-role tends to be only barely viable and rarely actually good. It can also disappear in another season or rework. This is deeply frustrating for those players and I understand perfectly that not all off-roles can be supported to the same level as the primary role. It's unavoidable sometimes but not always! This is why players need support from Riot so they don't feel burned and alienated (as I did after Kog's first rework when I mained him AP for hundreds of games and over several seasons).\n\nIf I have no expectations of an off-role being supported, I will not be angry if Riot considers it too difficult for the champ to function well for it/doesn't work with their vision. Still though, there should absolutely be a list of SUPPORTED off-roles that Riot will prioritize to the SAME LEVEL as the primary role. For example, let's say you are willing to support Zilean mid and Zilean support or Ekko jg and Ekko mid or whatever else. This goes on the list for long term support just like for software and it gets labelled an official support. \n\nIt becomes something we can TRUST Riot to care about and so we feel comfortable buying skins, investing time in the champ etc. It doesn't have to be a long list but I'm sure you can do this for at least 2 dozen champs. For these, support 2 roles officially so we can trust that our effort is not wasted and so that we're not angry if an off-role for an unsupported champion is unfortunately unable to be kept. \n\nI played AP Tristana a bit but it was gimmicky as hell even if probably not OP. It was basically cheese and just a snowball 1-shot champ lacking a truly unique playstyle. I didn't expect it to be officially supported because it wasn't healthy gameplay and also didn't make that much sense with her kit as a whole. I wasn't surprised or angry when it stopped being viable. For AP Kog, with all magic damage abilities, AP ratios on everything, a unique playstyle and viability for several seasons, I was incredibly frustrated. Now, he's probably close to OK so that's good but you don't realize how damaging it is to a player's trust and enjoyment when this happens for champions they expect to be officially supported for the off-role too and at the same level not just a sort of placebo buff or tiny nudge like \"hey, if you go this off-role, it'll still be bad but you'll be less of a troll.\" Please figure this out for some champions and allow us to trust you that those roles will be maintained. It will be a huge service to the community and a much larger number of players than you realize (who want to play those picks but don't just because they think they'll be ruined later -> general lack of enjoyment). \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hjarta","date":"2018-05-17T22:14:37.996+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, thanks for writing this out and sharing your thoughts.\n\nI don't think I was clear enough in my last post, my bad.

If there is a way to have both roles viable and balanced, we for sure should strive for it.\n\nSounds good, thanks for your explanation. We're on the same page. Supports are always tricky to balance for multiple roles since their design is geared around lower gold income and more utility but a solo lane breaks that. I know top mains certainly weren't fans of Lulu in their lane. ;) \n\nAnyway, I still think it would be great to have clarity on which champions have 2 officially supported roles. That way, I can feel very confident in playing them even if it's not their most popular position. I also think that jungle secondary is usually easier to balance for because you can make changes to the kit related to monsters and thus not affect lanes much. \n\nThis doesn't mean players won't play a champ in other roles than the supported ones or that any meta is enforced. It would just mean that those roles will be taken care of equally and considered when changes are made to the game. If any other role was also viable at that time, there would be no guarantees for the future.  \n\nIt's alright if this is a short list. I just don't want to experience the AP Kog situation again on another off-role. I literally had 500+ ranked games over the seasons on that champion and basically never played him ADC. He's OK now and I understand if perhaps Riot wouldn't put him on that list but I don't want to be that dedicated to a champion's off-role without assurances. For me, it was as if my main champion was deleted from the game for almost a year.

This accomplished the goal fairly well, but the build path after Stormrazor was quite awkward it was actually more efficient to build flat AD (BF Swords) than a Zeal item second. This was primarily due to AD obviously working well with the upfront burst of the crit, %crit having anti-synergy with the guaranteed crit proc, and Stormrazor having enough AS in the base stats and passive that AD was generally more efficient in terms of DPS. This led to some awkward inventory's full of BF Swords and Zeals. The item also was quite powerful on AD assassins for obvious reasons (they like Flat AD and upfront burst, even if the AS isn't the greatest).\nThe newer version addresses both of the above issues IMO. By lowering the base crit proc to 160% and scaling it up to 200% with your crit chance, we are simultaneously removing some of the painful anti-Zeal synergy the item previously had and making it a worse standalone item for assassins. The reduced crit power also allows us to shift some more of the raw stats into AD without worrying about assassins too much, which further increases the benefits of building an AS item 2nd.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2018-05-17T00:04:36.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your thoughts on Pyke not being able to build health?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hjarta","date":"2018-05-17T02:17:50.648+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally, I think it's lame to have a very hard rule that heavy-handedly prevents him to get a respectable level of tankiness.

However im really worried about how this item will pair up with champions like Fiora and Riven who already build Deaths dance, Spear of the Shojin + deaths dance will make a lot of the bruisers in toplane almost impossible to kill unless they are kited to death and even then it'll be a challenge due to their gapclosers. Is there anything in the devtalks or whispers about maybe making Deaths dance and the Spear have the same Unique passive so they can't stack?

We've run it a few times and haven't found it to be significantly better than other Spear builds - mostly due to the expense and build path restrictions on both items, plus the issues of build order. Very few fighters often get DD in their first two items (Riven and Illaoi are the only fighters that realistically can in most games), and they are often more interested in other items for their early slots like Cleaver which pushes back the Spear of Shojin to later in the game (often 4th or 5th item) where the premitigation DR isn't as powerful.\n\nMostly, the issue with the high-AD Spear of Shojin builds is that it's difficult to get a lot of AD and also build the Spear early without making significant sacrifices in your build path.\n\nIf this does turn out to be the dominant build path for Spear of Shojin users it's something we'd likely look to separate out, though there are a lot of ways to do it besides just making their passives unique so that they can't stack.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"M00ndanc3","date":"2018-05-17T23:13:59.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you feel about champs like Jhin, Rengar and Pyke taking Spear of Shoju.

Do you feel like the role of Support is going to fundamentally change? To me, this puts a lot of additional pressure on Support players to roam and help on invading/defending invades. Or is this an overreaction and the “adc bodyguard” will forever be the primary function?\n\nAbout Pyke specifically: the itemization in the game seems to really let him down at the moment. All his good items are priced for solo laners, and the hyper-efficient Support items like Locket and Redemption just do not work at all. Do you feel like he’s currently in a position to succeed once he hits solo queue, or does something outside of his kit need to change?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hjarta","date":"2018-05-16T22:58:23.626+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Killgoldfish!\n\nHell yea, glad your digging Pyke! \n\nI don't expect the role of support to fundamentally change with Pyke necessarily as he is just a single champion, but he does pave the way for an interesting future. With Pyke, we definitely wanted to push the perception boundaries of what a support is and can be, and by doing so, we are opening up a lot of opportunities in the future to do something cool and interesting that isn't just \"big bulky dude with CC\" or \"Delicate enchanter that heals and shields your team.\" \n\nIn the context of the overall changes of the new role of ADC and Jungle changes, I think we could see a minor shift of the priorities of the support, especially around helping other members of the team earlier which could manifest in either further roams, invading and defending invades, and helping securing scuttlecrab. With some shift in focus, I could see the \"ADC Bodyguard\" aspect be less prioritize, but still be a major primary function of the support role.\n\nTo answer your itemization question:\n\n Pyke does inject gold into the game for himself through his ultimate to compensate for the higher cost items. In non-Pyke scenarios ADC's tend to get the kills (outside of occasional mishaps or necessity) and the support usually always gets the assist. This ends up being a 300g benefit for the ADC, and 150g for the support. In Pyke's case, the only difference is that Pyke gets more gold:  You could think of Pyke's ultimate as a self-gold generator as technically the ADC would be getting the kills on live, and therefore the full gold, and the only thing that is changing from a purely gold perspective is that Pyke is getting more $$$. \n\nThis does put pressure on Pyke to use his ultimate early and get kills to match or get ahead of the enemy support, making him more of a feast or famine character. This outcome is to some extent desirable for us as this matches a lot of assassins on live. Either they mess you and your team up, or fall flat. \n\nHopefully I articulated that well enough for you! Was having some difficulty finding the right words/examples.","replies":[]}]}]}
