It&rsquo;s time for Runes Reforged!\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m Riot Novalas &amp; I&rsquo;m a QA Analyst on Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who work on Core Gameplay playing new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they&rsquo;re released. It&rsquo;s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&rsquo;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. \r\n\r\nPatch Chat serves as an opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-722-notes\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re in pre-season now! This patch consists of massive, mega, uber changes to the game! Say goodbye to the old system of Runes and Masteries as we bring on the new Runes Reforged system!  Whether you&rsquo;re into breaking the attack speed cap or infinitely stacking damage boosts, chucking a meteor or swapping your summoner spells, summoning a pet to assist you or looting your foes, there&rsquo;s a keystone for you! There&rsquo;s also a plethora of other runes in each tree that&rsquo;ll allow you to do cool things such as gaining CDR on your ultimate or acquiring free boots after a period of time! \r\n\r\nAccompanying Runes Reforged, we&rsquo;re also changing items, jungle catch-up XP, adding in a new leveling system, revamping our IP system, and MORE! \r\n\r\nAsk us anything about the patch, our favorite rune builds on YOUR favorite champions, our favorite pair of socks, how often we execute to jungle camps, and more!... Or feel free to just chat with us! We like people (mostly).\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: We don&rsquo;t have any insight into skins. \r\n\r\nDon &ldquo;Riot Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nAdam &ldquo;Riot Afic&rdquo; Cohen\r\nChris &ldquo;Auberaun&rdquo; Roberts\r\nChristy &ldquo;Riot Ender L&rdquo; Frierson\r\nNick &ldquo;Riot Endstep&rdquo; Frijia\r\nSigmundur &ldquo;GangIeri&rdquo; Helgason\r\nArnor &ldquo;Riot Hjarta&rdquo; Halldorsson\r\nRob &ldquo;Riot King Cobra&rdquo; Rosa\r\nMiktat &ldquo;Riot Koyuncu&rdquo; Koyuncu\r\nBrian &ldquo;Riot Madness Heroo&rdquo; Pressoir\r\nNabi &ldquo;Riot Novalas&rdquo; Barak\r\nDan &ldquo;Riot penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nTrevor &ldquo;Riot ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"Garrotte","date":"2017-11-08T21:08:49.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has King Cobra grown tired of his 15 minutes of fame?","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-11-08T21:11:06.447+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can you ever get tired of starting the game with a 2k gold lead and leap strike in every direction","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-11-08T21:20:34.801+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm drowning in memes.

Quite frankly, the previous Runes & Masteries system was incredibly dated and served as a hefty barrier to new players who wanted to get into League of Legends while also tricking players into thinking they had meaningful choice every game. With the new system, it's a lot less overbearing (Runes are free~ There aren't a huge amount of masteries ~ Larger impact for each choice) and, ideally, every champion should have a few different options for keystones rather than feeling pigeonholed into one. From my perspective, this update was necessary to make League of Legends a more modern game. \n\nThe Runes Reforged system clearly does need some work to get to where it needs to be for Season 8 but, honestly, it's a massive improvement over what we had and I firmly believe that players will feel the same way in a short period of time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HideInGranny","date":"2017-11-09T21:04:39.094+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what's your insight into the skins?\n\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2017-11-09T21:05:04.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"HideInGranny","date":"2017-11-09T21:11:42.615+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh come on Nov,\n\nyou know you got a chuckle out of that.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"D2Vincent","date":"2017-11-08T21:18:21.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on First impressions, at least I can say I've got something for my JG Karthus to work! :P (Electrocute, Taste of Blood, Ghost poro, Ravenous Hunter with Presence of Mind and Last Stand) \n\nBuilds aside, where do you guys think Karthus stands in the Preseason?

The 25% reduced summoner cooldown helps his early clear via smite CD, and having Flash on a low CD is very valuable for his ganks.

Has high synergy with those looking for instant damage (lethality Nocturne), as well as bruisers who can navigate teamfights and proc it multiple times (Darkin Kayn).\n\nElectrocute: Generalist option like Thunderlords, a little harder to proc for some but generally just a buffed version.\n\nPredator: Option to improve your gank access. Really nice for some Junglers who lack a gap closer and normally struggle to get on top of targets like Skarner and Volibear.\n\nAftershock: Option for tanks that provides some damage for ganks as well as tankiness for skirmishes and teamfights.\n\nUnsealed Spellbook: We've found this to be pretty strong by virtue for the Summoner CDR. 25% reduced smite CD can help a lot with early clear, and some Junglers have extremely high synergy with Flash like Gragas or Fiddlesticks.  You also get slightly more stats for primarying Inspiration than other trees, and are allowed to pick what stat you want via choosing your splash, so this overall gives you the best clear power.\n\nSeveral other Keystones have their niche users as well.

Others on the team have found success with things like unsealed spellbook simply for the reduced CD of smite/flash (Trade flash with an enemy on first gank -> come back once your flash comes back up b/c theirs will still be down for a bit).\n\nIf you find yourself struggling to survive in the jungle, try splashing resolve and taking iron skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2017-11-08T21:19:58.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys!\n\nI could use some suggestions!

From what I've tried with him, Fleet Footwork is a pretty good keystone, but since he doesn't get a lot of use out of  attack speed it feels like that bonus is somewhat wasted. He'd much rather get flat AD from Sorcery or Domination, but none of the keystones really stand out for him there.\n\nI suppose there will always be some losers with the new system and some champs who don't have as many options as others. In general  though I think giving players more choice about what stat bonuses they want (and keeping that separate from what runes they want) would be a step towards creating better diversity.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
