So either landing 2 consecutively (the CD is quite low once evolved if you land it and with CDR), or landing it on an isolated target and going in for the Q+ 2 autos for passive proc is almost always a kill. Biggest thing to understand when playing the build is that your W burst when also proccing your passive execute is insane, and will pretty much always kill non-tanks from 60% or lower.

But the moment he buys it, it doesn't matter what I do, he wins purely through stat checking.\nNow pair this with spear of shojin and {{item:3047}} and not a single champion in the game could duel him.\n\nDo you have any great concerns regarding this item? Or who may buy it?\nWhat's the point of the  titanic hydra change? Seems like a flat out nerf. I don't think many care if it's a little pricey, but lowering its AD is just silly.\nHow much of Ornn's power budget is consumed by his passive? I know pros use him almost purely for the ult. But for a regular player like myself he felt so crap in lane even if I could stay there forever. His 1v1 is horrid vs just about everyone. So far I haven't vsed one but I think I'd end up devouring him based on what I've seen and who I play. \nWhat's the overall goal of the ornn changes on pbe?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-06-01T16:31:23.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spear of Shojin doesn't give percentage DR - it gives flat DR which is calculated pre-mitigation, meaning it stacks poorly with other DR effects (primarily armor and MR). Essentially, when you buy SoS, you're either committing fully to stacking AD with SoS as your only defensive item (maybe Tabi/Mercs, but those are minor and as mentioned stack poorly with the Spear) or buying other defensive effects like PD with the Spear which actually lower its effectiveness, both in terms of getting less total AD which makes the Spear worse and also making its effect worse since it doesn't scale with other DR effects well. \n\nThere are definitely some concerns around Spear of Shojin but mostly around champions which can gain huge amounts of flat AD (Rengar, Riven, Jhin) more so than champions that will have/buy other DR effects since those don't stack effectively. \n\nThe point of the Titanic/Ravenous Hydra changes is to allow fighters to spike earlier/a bit faster in the game - and as a tradeoff, those items are slightly less efficient buys. Currently, most fighter builds have a Hydra in their first two or three items, alongside either Trinity Force or Black Cleaver (plus Sterak's for most Triforce users aside from Fiora). The issue with those builds, in particular with the Triforce builds, is that the items are so expensive that the buys delay the next item spike for an extended period of time relative to other classes. Those other classes hit their item spikes much faster (compare to mages with Lost Chapter items or AD assassins with lethality items). The current thought is that it's not necessarily wrong that fighters as a class have powerful but more expensive items than most other classes, but that the degree to which that's currently true is probably too much - and so the place that's easiest to \"shrink\" a bit is the Hydras.\n\nThe tl;dr here is that fighter item builds are probably too expensive right now and it makes it hard for them to compete in the early-midgame with other classes that they should be competitive against at that point. Lowering Hydra costs helps those fighters spike earlier in the game at the cost of some gold efficiency overall.\n\nOn Ornn, the current changelist is intended to make him less of a universally powerful blind pick champion. The intention is to give him some sharper strengths and weaknesses so that he's not just powerful regardless of the context of his matchup and the game in general.\n\nNot sure how much of his power is in his passive - more of a designer question, but I'd say it's a fair amount. Don't have any real numbers/percentages to give but the ability to buy in lane is very powerful when correctly optimized, allowing Ornn to frequently blow through his mana and gain incremental advantages through map uptime rather than through direct interaction.","replies":[{"poster":"Zullar","date":"2018-06-01T21:24:12.516+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**tldr; For Bone Plating and Spear of Shojin the tooltip should specify if damage reduction occurs before or after resistances for clarity.**\n\n\n**Bone Plating:** Tooltip reads \"After taking damage from an enemy champion, for 3 seconds, the next 3 spells or attacks you receive from the same enemy champion deal 15 - 40 (based on level) less damage.\"\n\n**Spear of Shojin: **Tooltip reads \"UNIQUE Passive: Reduce damage from champion attacks and abilities by 20 plus 10% of bonus attack damage.\"\n\nNeither tooltip is clear and neither specifies if damage reduction occurs before or after resistances.

What was the design call?\n\nThere were a couple champs that I thought it would be good on, but I was hesitant because I wasnt sure if the AD over AP might cost me hard in the early game.  The three champs I had been thinking were Singed, Rumble and Morde.  After a couple games, I can say I dig it on Singed (in certain matchups) and Morde in general, I dont play rumble anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-06-01T16:14:44.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When we were iterating through early versions of Conqueror (originally called Embiggen), the stats given were adaptive, and we found some problematic abuse cases with a variety of champions - mages, tanks, and assassins that were all not intended to be served by the rune. The final shape and location of the rune makes it difficult for those champions to access the power of Conqueror effectively, but there were still enough concerns about champions like Fizz that it was decided not to go back to adaptive.\n\nIt's something that we might look back at in the future as we understand the rune a lot better now (given it's been on Live quite a while) and could probably make an adaptive version work at some point, but it's not a priority as Conqueror is currently filling its purpose and there's not a strong compelling reason to make it adaptive - likely only some fringe case users that might benefit some from it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SirPurrr","date":"2018-05-31T21:31:45.227+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered reverting the AD nerf on WW or Corki? The meta doesn't favor either of them anymore imo. WW needs level 3 and feels pretty awkward as an \"early game jg\" who can't level 2 contest scuttler well. If you level E 2nd instead of W, you really ruin your clear (similar if you level W first). I think the meta when WW was \"good\" (and literally only good in SQ... and in KR or competitive was still no problem at all) was entirely different than now. It was a really fast level 3 meta where you could quickly invade or gank top (because they never adapt) after red-blue-wolves or red-blue-gromp. I think those paths are huge for WW to really be worth picking. Now, because it's harder to snowball early off predictable level 3 top ganks, it's also harder to get Tiamat and farm properly. \n\nCorki is in a similar spot. He was nerfed hard when the meta was very different (despite never having an amazing winrate or high ban rate) and was left that way. Now his usual TF-Shiv-RFC is hugely more expensive. Also, while he has decent damage, he offers literally nothing else. No cc, no utility, just damage with some safety. It's easy to look at just the damage and safety and say \"wow, so strong\" but the opportunity cost is huge.\n\nZiggs? I don't even know what to say really... just feels very weak right now and I think most of it is his squishiness but I'm not really sure. Maybe he needs a little better ratio somewhere. I think he was definitely in a worse spot than something like Anivia which also had 2x the play rate (or lux).\n\nAny thoughts on trading some of the AP on Runic back for MS? Maybe 10 AP for 5% MS or something? It seems pretty good now but I still miss it and I think raw stats incentivize laners too. What do you guys think of it so far from the very limited data? I think AP junglers are alright now because the meta is very fast so something like Yi is not likely to hit late game etc. AP junglers are generally not strong early in terms of compared to the opposing jg but have pretty good ganks (better than most ADs) and a good mid-game.\n\nI remember there used to be PBE AS changes on Shyv & Voli. What happened with that? Are they still planned or did it seem unnecessary?\n\nWhen can we remove the random and unfair component on scuttler? I should know where it will spawn at all times even if it isn't always in the same spot. Can't you even draw something on the ground? I think right now it's terrible. When I get the timer,I feel like I just get lucky to be on the side of the map it spawns when I get the timer (and vice versa).","replies":[]},{"poster":"jamican banana","date":"2018-06-01T00:32:03.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Ivern main and now that the champ is finally good again I hope with all these Forbidden idol nerfs you guys thought of giving ivern a small buff to compensate.
