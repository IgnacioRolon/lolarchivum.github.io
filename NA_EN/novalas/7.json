I&#039;m a QA Analyst on Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who work on Core Gameplay playing new and in dev content before they&rsquo;re released. It&rsquo;s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with to ensure that we&rsquo;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\n\nLots of changes are planned in the upcoming patches and a lot of content is or has been on PBE for awhile. We&rsquo;d like you guys to talk to us about your questions or concerns with upcoming content - We&rsquo;ve tested a lot of it and would be more than happy to give you guys insight on how the changes are panning out. If you&rsquo;d like us to test something in particular out - let us know and we can try to get it into a playtest.\n\nWe&#039;ve got a new and improved challenger coming to the rift on the PBE this patch. It&#039;s not Bbtrox or Cctrox. We&#039;ve got Aatrox and he&#039;s undergone a large VGU.

His play rate is very low so it's mostly mains picking him and quite situationally. He's really weak vs pretty much everything meta and part of that is his clear speed relative to power farmers like Udyr, Shyv, Graves etc. or the weak early compared to many of those same picks and a few others like Kha. He basically gets bullied hard, can't duel even an Eve early and his mid game isn't even on par with stuff like Wu'Kong, Taliyah, Kayn, Nocturne etc., nor is his late game. He all around needs some help, maybe a tiny bit more armor or AS, maybe a tiny bit more damage vs monsters.  \n\nYou guys said you'd be monitoring it and I think it's pretty obvious he needs SOMETHING to be truly viable outside of just when you have a player who is so massively outskilling the other jg and so godly on Ekko that he can compensate and still reach only a 50% win rate. If he can't get a good win rate while he has a 0.6% play rate as a champion that's frequently one-tricked, you know he's pretty weak. 5% bonus AS or 5 more armor..., 5% more bonus damage on passive vs monsters... do something. We have Taliyah now still being really good when played by a lot of random players just because she's unbanned and then Ekko, a champion who was jungled since release is in a weak state jg and that's why you see that 0.6% play rate. You have to work for that barely 50% win rate 2x harder than anyone playing a decent jungler and it's not fair.\n\nThe other thing is, where are the Corki buffs (gutted for months since the base AD changes + FF nerfs + crit item changes) or Ziggs buffs or Tristana buffs etc.? I see random Xayah buffs and SO many champions are performing way worse than her. Are you guys playing favorites? Maybe she needs them too but the gap between S tier and the rest is so much larger for other champions atm... one of the largest I've seen in probably a year.\n\nWhere are the Irelia nerfs? Just because she doesn't have an obscene win rate doesn't mean she's OK. She's broken if played by a good player. Zoe is the same and has a poor design imo. You guys gutted AP Kog, who had mobility issues, super weak early, needed 30 minutes to scale and was squishy as shit with no hard CC but you made this soul draining cancerous monstrosity who fishes for one shots half the game from a screen away and without you being able to move? She is disgusting if played by a competent player. Her win rate doesn't means she isn't awful to face and broken beyond belief. \n\nI think you guys believe that 50% win rate means balanced and no it doesn't mean shit and neither does 53%. Win rates are mostly about how easy a champion is to execute, how reliable they are, how many comps they fit and so on. It doesn't mean they're fine. For example, WW I expect to have an above 50% win rate because his skill floor (not necessarily skill cap) is low and he tends to be reliably useful in most games even if he is objectively not strong. Lee, I expect to not hit 50% win rate even when he's OP and same with LB or Irelia or Zoe.  \n\nI'd also say that Wu'Kong, Talon, Udyr and Sol are problems but they aren't played enough for me to be sure.\n\nBTW: In general, this meta is too snowbally imo and it's shutting down a lot of the more late game oriented roster. In general, when tanks don't function well, a lot of champions become unviable. The late game monsters generally matter way more when they have a tank to shred as well as a frontline on their team. I feel like there are too many unearned advantages from being ahead. You get so much more than just the gold from some early kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auraswarm","date":"2018-06-14T21:42:03.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nDo you guys think Aatrox will still be primarily a top laner after these changes or will he be relegated more to the jungle?\n\nI really enjoy the AS drain-tank playstyle, and with these changes moving Aatrox towards being an AD caster there don't really exist too many innately tanky champions who can buy BorK now (Trundle and Jax being the only ones that come to mind). I used to play a lot of Warwick before the rework as well, back when people actually bought AS items on him too. But looking forward, do you think Aatrox or Warwick would be a better fit for a drain-tank playstyle?

late game but a-lot of things has changed ever since the runes reforged making him a-bit different from before so i am here to explain what happened \n\nNasus is by far the weakest melee champ before level 6 even worse than even Irelia and due to his stacking nature he cant trade with his Q because he needs to farm with it making him so the weakest melee champ at trading and having lane control but before in the old rune system you could go for a-lot of armor or magic resist instead to survive the laning phase al-ot better but ever since the runes reforged came he lost that choice and the only way he can lane is with the resolve tree but even with that certain matchups are just impossible no matter how good you are like nasus vs teemo. there are few ways you could play around hard matchups before like using E max with 2 dorans ring but E lost the early pressure because it lost the flat armor pen and dorans ring got nerfed too making it usless now.\n\nso im going to explain each ability of nasus and what i feel about them\n\nPassive-Soul Eater\n\nAs a long time nasus player i feel this passive needs to change because lifesteal is more of an adc type of stats and change it into heal by damage dealt so that his E can also benefit from it and the most important part is that i feel this should be a scaling passive weaker early and stronger at late because for certain matchups when nasus makes a mistake and loses health and waits for the minion to push under his tower he can just last hit or use Q to heal back up which makes it so frustrating for the enemy to actually take down nasus especially for melee matchups like tanks and i think this is the main reason why low elo players finds it impossible to win nasus because to beat nasus you need to constantly punish him for his mistakes and at low elo you cant expect everyone to have full knowledge of the game like a challenger so this change might help him overall in all elos.\n\nQ-Siphoning Strike\n\nHis Q scales infinite but there is a misconception about his Q that alot of people are not aware of is that even tho his Q can scale infinitely but he has to constantly stack his Q to scale and his Q is the only thing that scales, there are certain things that makes nasus stop his scaling like 1vs1, teamfights or splitpushing how? its simple because nasus unlike other carry toplaners doesnt 100% scale with gold like riven,fiora or jax etc because when you 1vs1 you stop stacking and delay your stacking makings his scaling graph suddenly dead, same goes for teamfight and the worse part is splitpushing because nasus excels at splitpushing but at the same time it also punishes his Q scaling because he has to hard push with his E making him lose ton of stacks and thus making him scaling stop. \n\nOn top of that nasus could take letality reds before from the old runes and some letality in the old mastery tree too and his E used to give 20 flat armor pen at level 1 making his Q very effective to the point where if you have 350 Q stacks with those letality and flat pen from his E he does the same damage as a 500 Q stack right now so losing those choices made him very weak compared to before\nbecause you guys at patch 7.15 changed his E from flat pen to %pen because you guys say that he needs it to deal more damage against tanks but the reality is that when nasus lanes against a tank it is sort a free lane for nasus because they dont do damage and he can Q farm and outsustain their damage thus making those matchup easy and he would have alot of stacks compared to other matchups, but the matchups he struggles the most are ranged matchups and skirmishers like jax, fiora, riven, camile, tryndamere, old aatrox, master yi etc because nasus has a weak early and has weak defensive stats so then they can harass him so much especially with the new conquerer keystone at long trades. but before he can deal with these matchups with those red letality and the flat armor pen from the E but when you changed his E to % armor pen basically it made nasus even stronger as a counter to certain champion like maokai and other tanks and made it even hard to win hard matchups against carry top thus making nasus a very 1 sided pick.\n\nmy advice is that his Q cooldown reduction should scale based on his stacks not with cdr items like yasuo's Q stack with attack speed instead, for example nasus Q based cooldown is now 5 seconds at level 1 and if he gets 150 stacks the Q cdr becomes 4 seconds so each additional 150 stack reduces his Q cdr by 1 second until the Q reaches at a 1 second cdr cooldown at 750 stacks\nand this important part which i really think is necessary is that his Q can be reset after killing a unit but the stacks will follow the base cdr meaning if my Q stacking is 5 seconds and i killed 1 minion with my Q so i get 3 stacks but if my Q resets and i can kill other minions i wont get any stacks until 5 seconds is gone thus allowing nasus to have small trades and have some form of wave clear like irelia's which i think would help this champion alot.\n\nW-Wither\n\nThis skill is great but in my experience i feel the halving the attack speed reduction part seems too one dimentional what i meant is that in certain matchups its very very useless like against tanks that dont use autoattacks or certain champions that can autoattack reset making it not that great and sometimes too strong and good against champs that purely relies on autoattacks likes tryndamere and jax thus making those players against nasus so frustrating to deal with on top of the slow already. so in my opinion this skill should slow people and reduce their armor by % instead of the E.\n\nE-Spirit Fire\n\nThis skills seems very odd because its great for wave clear but only if you max it and nowadays with the flat armor pen gone and the nerfs of dorans ring its never a good idea to go E max anymore on nasus, so we nasus players always max Q and since E is only good at wave clearing only if maxed so its almost pointless to have such and skill if we change the Q the way i have written above we wont need to wave clear from the E anymore so instead change this skill to it doesn't do damage anymore and whoever is in the circle and if they get damage they get additional maximum health damage depending on how much health they have the longer they stay inside the more bonus damage you deal,because ever since red letality are gone and the flat pen from E is gone health stacking became such a huge problem or obstacle for nasus to deal with and most bruiser all stack health and tanks like chogath always has so much making it impossible to beat or kill. this is what he really needs for a long time because nasus cant build blade of the ruined king as a juggernaut too risky and it makes him too squishy.\n\nR-Fury of the Sands\n\nThis skill in my opinion has too much stats given to it and the wrong ones too. because you see sure this skill makes him very strong for dueling but the thing i really hate about this new R is that it reduces your cdr of your Q by halve and i find it very very unhealthy for laners who are laning against him once he becomes 6 because you guys at patch 7.15  said that you buffed his R so he can have a better late game but in reality you actually buffed his mid game so much because lets say if my Q is 6 second cdr and i use R it will reduce 3 extra second and that is too much and auto losing a duel just because a nasus reached level 6 and the only option is to run away is very unhealthy for laning interaction for both nasus and the enemy nasus is supposed to be a late game champion not a mid game champion so i feel his R should no longer give that bonus Q cdr and his R also shouldn't do burn damage anymore but instead it should have some form of movement speed and why you might ask? because ever since storm raiders surge the core mastery on nasus is gone it made him lost so much engage and  kill pressure because even if have have all these strong stats and tankiness the enemy can just cc you or dash away thus making your engage or kill pressure 0 and then wasting you R and then making you completely useless.\n\nlet me elaborate on that as you are aware or you should know that at season 7  KHAN from LZ gaming but now named KZ\nhas picked nasus once in a competitive match as a counter pick to maokai, its not simply just because nasus was a just a counter pick but 50% of the reason why he picked nasus, won, carried that game and destroyed that maokai is because of storm raiders surge. because if he wants to engage on maokai and he uses Q and maokai tries to Q away nasus with his knockback and his slow\nnasus Q range is good enough and he can buffer his Q so the moment he Qs while maokai Qs him away normally you would get knocked backed and slowed but because nasus already used Q and proced storm raiders surge so even after the knockback the slow doesn't work because of the slow resist from storm raiders surge and plus the extra movement speed he can catch back up and Q again until he is dead. ever since you removed it, it made nasus get kited so easily and all you need to stop a nasus engage is just a slow that is considered a soft cc which is sad. \n\nYou might say but why dont you take phase rush then its simple,because if i take phase rush vs grasp of the undying, summon aery or conquerer ill have 0 kill pressure and get instantly out of lane or even worse killed because the numbers on those runes are 2x higher than the previous ones thus making it even more important to stack armor or magic resist which we cant anymore and thus making it an auto lost if you ever pick phase rush as nasus in a lane now. this is the reason why his R should have some form of movement speed buff like for example \n(15%-level 6) (25%-level 11) (35%-level 16) etc but can be slowed unlike masters yi's one \n\nbecause no matter how much Q stack nasus has he can get kited so his late game isnt really a late game if his weakness is this big such as kiting there were games where i had 900 stacks and still lost because i couldn't reach the target before getting killed.","replies":[{"poster":"XdeathitselfX","date":"2018-06-15T03:44:01.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"had no more space to type XD\n\nin conclusion the majority of

Unlike mobile fighters like Camille that can use their burst tools and target access to delete champions with more multiplier items before they get to use them, Nasus almost always has to enter real sustained combat with enemies to beat them - so to change that, Nasus would need more burst or better target access. \n\nOne of the things you've pointed out here (flat armor pen on E) would boost Nasus' burst quite a bit, particularly against squishy targets, but the point of shifting the E armor pen from flat to % was that at the time, Nasus was actually much better at fighting squishy targets than tanky ones, which doesn't make sense for the character's strength/weakness profile. Nasus should be relatively target-agnostic in terms of damage to be fair, as when he's better at killing squishier targets he's very binary in gameplay (he gets to the squishy and they die, or he never touches them and Nasus dies), whereas target-agnostic damage allows him to have more actual (sustained) combat against squishy targets while giving him a strategic niche against tanky targets (who he can generally lane against well and handle later in the game if he has %damage/%shred). \n\nLive Gameplay does currently have Nasus on their list of champions that could use a buff, and we had some discussion about what he could get - some thoughts about extra sustain (either lifesteal on passive or health regen) to give him a bit more breathing room in the early lane, or increased Q stacks for cannon/large monster/champion kills (to reward him more when he's doing well or going even, plus give him a bit of a comeback mechanic). No current plans to ship any of this stuff, but it's being talked about and might make it in one of the next few patches if one of the Live designers decides to put time into a changelist.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ducasi","date":"2018-06-14T13:55:12.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any news on {{champion:127}} ??\n\nYou mentioned upcoming changes and never followed up","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2018-06-14T23:18:34.323+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had decent results testing the changes that have been in currently, but we're still exploring different directions on one part of the kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2018-06-14T17:47:33.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're still being explored internally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2018-06-14T01:53:40.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, got a lot of questions about Aatrox coming from a current main, hope you can answer them!

Seems like it would combo well with his bursty nature. Any secondary runes that you like or are too good to pass up?\n\nOne thing I've noticed about the kit is that he struggles both when enemies are too far away from him (which is expected), and when they're too close, which is interesting. Q1 and Q2 require him to stay pretty far away from the target, so how do you deal with typical melee fighters like Fiora, Jax, Yasuo, etc who can dash away from his hitboxes and then basic attack him to death? It seems like all of his damage is loaded onto Q, so if you miss those abilities are you basically screwed?\n\nDoes he have any lanes in particular that he wins or loses really hard, so I can look out for those?\n\nWhat is his intended role in the team? Is he meant to just dive the backline carries and kind of let his team deal with the other bruisers? He doesn't have reliable autoattack DPS like his old self, so in extended fights it seems like he'd lose. Are there any items that you buy that help mitigate this?

CD is too long for laning phase for the uptime on your Qs. It's not a terrible choice as a jungler. I think Nimbus Cloak is pretty huge on him so, when going Resolve, I never want to lose out on that. Precision splash on jungle Aatrox has felt pretty good to assist with clearspeed.\n\n> It seems like all of his damage is loaded onto Q, so if you miss those abilities are you basically screwed?\n\nYou have some minor room to act. Primarily through using your E to get the bonus AD to auto trade (or disengage), using your W to disengage, or hitting them with your passive. But in general, his Q being down is a window to all in Aatrox.\n\n> Does he have any lanes in particular that he wins or loses really hard, so I can look out for those?\n\nHe tends to hard smash tanks (the exception is Maokai due to his passive but you still win mid-late). He has difficulties in skirmisher matchups such as Camille and Fiora but he can still win the lane. Other juggernauts tend to blast him though (Darius, Illaoi).\n\n> What is his intended role in the team?

He doesn't have reliable autoattack DPS like his old self, so in extended fights it seems like he'd lose. Are there any items that you buy that help mitigate this? And what build do you think is all around the most optimal?\n\nHis primary play pattern should be diving the enemy team; he has a lot of disruption in his kit (through his Q crowd control & damage) as well as high uptime with 40% CDR. Additionally, with Guardian Angel, it takes him a very, very long time to die. You can soak a lot of time from the enemy back line because it's likely at least two people will have to deal with you if you're far enough ahead. In general, Black Cleaver + Guardian Angel are the core items. \n\nFor core item build, I'd suggest Black Cleaver -> Guardian Angel -> (If ahead, Death's Dance) Sterak's Gage -> Spirit Visage/Randuins -> Flex tank items. Super high damage builds are OK when far ahead but playing him with a bruiser pattern is more reliable.\n\n> What do you think are the best summoner spells? Could Flash+Ghost work well on him to help mitigate his low mobility, or is the standard Flash+TP/Ignite just better?\n> \n\nThe standard Flash + Teleport is better imho. Don't think he needs Ignite. He has a lot of kill threat.\n\n> One thing someone also suggested to me was putting only 1 point into R at 6 and leaving it like that until all other skills are maxed, like Tryndamere. Honestly the movespeed on R seems pretty useless so the only reason you'd level it is for the CD reduction. Do you think that's a reasonable thing to do?\n\nI definitely disagree with the R being a 1 point wonder. You need to put points in it to reduce the CD. His ultimate CD at rank 1 is close to brutal. Additionally, the movement speed is actually incredibly potent and allows him to re-position effectively in fights (by disengaging shortly during the long ultimate duration and re-engaging).","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-06-19T15:23:26.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait so he gets smashed by anyone not a tank?

The primary methods are using the W as either a pick tool and setting up a Q sweet spot on where they're pulled back, using the Q1 to get a mid-range knockup, using Q1 + E dash to reposition to get a knockup, or using the previous combo and using flash alongside it. Outside of that, using your ultimate to flank and use the previous tools is another option to get onto the enemy team. \n\nTo address your second question on how to land your Qs when on the team; you can E backwards to reposition the Q once again. As for sidestepping, you'll have to play it like any other skillshot. Anticipate where they're going and throw the Q that way. \n\nI do expect that it'll probably take some getting used to to execute his kit effectively.
