It&rsquo;s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&rsquo;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\r\n\r\nPatch Chat serves as an opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks.\r\nYou can find information on the most recent patch by following this link:\r\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-84-notes\r\n\r\nRolling into this patch, we&#039;ve got a minor AP itemization overhaul with some new &amp; old faces! Say hello to Spellbinder ... and our dear old friend, Twin Shadows. Lots of the items have been tweaked as well.  If you&#039;re a mage, your itemization may have changed up. We&#039;ll be more than happy to push you onto the right path!  On the other side, Rengar Q has been reverted. Squishy champions beware because The Hunt Is On. Volibear has also received some changes that add on another method of skill expression to his kit. \r\n\r\nThere are buffs and nerfs aplenty this patch.  We&#039;ve got buffs to Darius, Evelynn, Fiddlesticks, Renekton, and more. Tristana, Zoe, and a few others took some hits as well. Tracker&#039;s Knife is now dead and there&#039;s a new rune in Resolve (Bone Plating!). Baron &amp; Elder Dragon have received some major buffs as well. \r\n\r\nAsk us ANYTHING about 8.4. We&#039;re here to answer questions about your favorite champions, inquiries about runes, or maybe how often we execute to jungle camps! Let&#039;s talk mage items or maybe discuss shifts in the jungle! We&#039;re also down to just chat, though.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: We have no insight on upcoming/future skins.\r\n\r\nChris &ldquo;Auberaun&rdquo; Roberts\r\nChristy &ldquo;Riot Ender L&rdquo; Frierson\r\nNick &ldquo;Riot Endstep&rdquo; Frijia\r\nSigmundur &ldquo;GangIeri&rdquo; Helgason\r\nArnor &ldquo;Riot Hjarta&rdquo; Halldorsson\r\nRob &ldquo;Riot King Cobra&rdquo; Rosa\r\nMiktat &ldquo;Riot Koyuncu&rdquo; Koyuncu\r\nBrian &ldquo;Riot Madness Heroo&rdquo; Pressoir\r\nNabi &ldquo;Riot Novalas&rdquo; Barak\r\nDan &ldquo;Riot penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee","replies":[{"poster":"Commander JC D","date":"2018-02-22T21:59:31.391+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Removing tracker's knife has left lee sin with a nerf while he is already weak imo, especialy when sightstone is also no longer in the game.

Obviously the ability to ward hop is super valuable for Lee and definitely has a meaningful impact on fights, but I imagine that Lee Sin players are just going to keep their yellow trinket to be able to ward hop. Having to think more meaningfully about when it's worth it to ward hop because you have less wards overall on is certainly a feelsbad, but I'm unsure what the impact on his power level will be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadPiriPiri","date":"2018-02-22T23:31:25.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\nDo you feel some non keystone in resolve underwhelming?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koyuncu","date":"2018-02-22T23:51:48.885+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally find Iron Skin & Mirror Shell underwhelming.

Personally I'd say Gnar and Jayce often violate the limits of how frustrating a champion should be to lane against, but at other times they're fine, so it's mostly down to their level of power and sharpness of matchups - meaning the frustration comes when they are tuned to be strong moreso than other champions (and/or in counter matchups), primarily because when they are strong they feel like they invalidate the cast of melee laners in lane. If it feels like picking a melee is asking to experience 10-15 minutes of misery with little opportunity to play the game, that's obviously not good - even if that feeling isn't true.\n\nMy hope is that at some point we can get Gnar and Jayce into a state where they can exist as strong laners that work well into melees but don't invalidate them, but that's a difficult state to keep them in given how sensitive they can be to small/indirect balance shifts. \n\nWe have some really promising exploration for Gnar potentially coming in a future patch that we wanted to put in 8.4 but didn't have time to properly validate. It's intended to be a set of win-win changes to make Gnar's gameplay feel more fluid and rewarding but also give him more windows of opportunity to use against him and in general make playing against him a more interesting/fun experience - can't say more than that but personally I really like the direction. It's currently looking unlikely we'll get to it soon but I'm hoping we'll manage to get it in a future patch at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2018-02-25T09:54:22.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the insight, I would also like to inquire this: If needed would you guys ever decrease Gnar/Jayce's aa range when they are in Ranged Mode so that there is room for champion with short ranged poke abilities to actually trade with them? Basically the idea would be that if they want to do small skrimishes they should also be at risk of taking damage back from the enemy laner without overwhelming as they currently can do.\n\nEdit: An example is {{champion:82}} vs {{champion:150}} , one of the more notorious match-ups for Morde since Gnar mini-form outranges his E poke and endlessly harasses him away from the minion wave even if he's under his tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-02-26T07:13:02.058+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's something we've considered before, but not something we've found a good list for. Specifically, we've tried reducing Gnar's early AA range internally (he gains range per level due to his passive which we left untouched) and found that it left him with such a weak earlygame it was hard to justify picking him over other options. Personally I think there is some merit to the idea, but it would have to come with other changes to the kit, likely something to reward Gnar for playing aggressively, and we haven't found something that fits well there.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2018-02-26T07:25:17.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wondering, but is there really a need for him to gain attack range with each level in his mini-form? I always thought of gnar to be that short-ranged top lane tank who, once he filled his rage bar, could engage fights and come out still hanging by a rope if he played it right. His current iteration feels more along the lines of: Once i hit level 3 you're never touching me or any of the minions I'm pushing into your tower.\n\nThen again I play mostly {{champion:82}} and {{champion:266}} in the top lane, so I'm not sure how much most of my input here means against the piles of data you guys have backlogged.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-02-26T08:10:36.810+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In an ideal world, the attack range per level is there to offset the increased danger of being close to enemies as the game goes on. Realistically, it's a lot of what makes Gnar frustrating since the more powerful you get (as you go up in levels), Gnar gets more and more difficult to touch as he's longer ranged and faster, though it's by so little per level that it's difficult to tell ingame that the range/speed is why he's increasingly difficult to all-in. The issue with removing his incremental range is that he's then put into a spot where he either needs the stats to scrap it out with other fighters to some degree (if he were very short range at all times, like Urgot) or just start at a high enough range that it's effectively the same or higher for most of the laning phase, which is obviously not an improvement from the side of the enemy melee. Alternatively, there's some thought that maybe he could have low range and be rewarded more for aggressive plays, but as I mentioned earlier we haven't found a good way to implement that. \n\nPlayer input definitely means a lot - even if we have tons of data saying that Gnar isn't even particularly good in soloqueue, feelings of frustration are definitely valid and understandable.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2018-03-03T21:10:23.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, can someone on your team take the time to nerf Support Items on Twisted Treeline please?

What do you think of this mechanic? Does it add depth to his gameplay, or does it just punish him for playing fights strategically and using Meditate, and waiting for good opportunities to attack? Do you think it makes Master Yi players act too aggressive in combat? Do you think it's one of the major reasons he's less effective in high elo, where melees naturally can't attack enemies as much? Would he be more balanced and healthier if the mechanic was removed and the base cooldown was lowered?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-02-25T08:22:35.303+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I really like this mechanic and think of it as a more elegant version of Yasuo's Q cooldown (which scales directly with attack speed, as opposed to indirectly in this case). I'm of the opinion that it adds a lot of depth to Yi's gameplay, especially given that Yi has an AS steroid and an AA reset in his kit (which can both be used to accelerate/\"cheat\" the Q cooldown refund). \n\nI'd say an important part of the Q cooldown refund is it also rewards Master Yi for building AS in a way other than straight damage - giving him more mobility/target access/untargetability the more AS he has, which is one of the things that allows Yi to function as a melee carry in a game that's very hostile to melee carries. \n\nAs far as Yi's discrepancy between low and high elo, I don't feel that the Q refund mechanic is the cause. While Yi will average getting off more attacks in lower elo, that refund is also going to be better utilized/optimized in high elo where each Alpha Strike has much higher value. For comparison, look at Tryndamere, who has a similar refund mechanic (on crit) on his E, who has very little difference between his high and low elo winrates - though obviously the comparison isn't perfect, it's a good demonstration that the mechanic is unlikely to be the sole (or primary) cause of the discrepancy. \n\nWithout the refund mechanic on Q I don't believe Yi would be any healthier, especially not if the base cooldown was lowered to compensate. To me that just encourages AD/CDR builds with little to no attackspeed where the focus of the champion is on repeated Q casts rather than actually autoattacking, which would be a fairly degenerate pattern since the main counterplay to Yi is preventing him from autoattacking via hard cc/spacing/etc., which is no longer real counterplay if all Yi needs to do is just cast spells rather than autoattack. That would be pretty similar to the old AP Yi play pattern, although likely not quite as offensive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2018-02-24T01:24:13.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many anonymous accounts do you guys have for playing on live servers?","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2018-02-24T01:28:21.116+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the person :D.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2018-02-22T23:51:50.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta say i have major concerns about how tanky singed can build + how much damage he can deal just by having{{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} with the rest of his items being defensive health items, given i have only played one game vs that so far but it was not very much fun to play against so would you consider changing the increased impairment damage to only be based off of champion abilities and not items?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-02-23T00:27:36.511+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a very likely approach to take on Liandry's given that the synergy with Rylai's is one of the compelling parts of the item for some champions and that the movement impairing synergy is already limited to a small cast of champions - making that group smaller would make Liandry's a very niche item which have been difficult to balance/support in the past. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better, mathematically the 8.4 changes don't make much difference for Singed's damage with Rylai's+Liandry's in most cases (except against high MR and/or low HP targets, where is damage is up) - he could do a very similar amount of damage before.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neverduft","date":"2018-02-22T21:56:04.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will there be any other changes to nocturne, that will actually make him better at dealing damage to champions?
