We're entering the breach. Welcome to the Kai'Sa patch.\n\nI&rsquo;m Riot Novalas &amp; I&rsquo;m a QA Analyst on Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who work on Core Gameplay playing new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they&rsquo;re released. It&rsquo;s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&rsquo;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\n\nPatch Chat serves as an opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks.\nYou can find information on the most recent patch by following this link:\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-85-notes\n\nOur newest friend on the rift is the daughter of the Void, Kai&#039;Sa! With multiple buildpaths and different play patterns, Kai&#039;Sa is one of the more diverse champions that have been introduced in recent memory. The primary playtesters for Kai&#039;Sa were Madness Heroo &amp; ROBERTxLEE. Feel free to ask any and all (gameplay) void-related questions and we&#039;ll be happy to give you insight!\n\nAside from Kai&#039;Sa, we&#039;ve got some buffs and nerfs to various champions; Nocturne, Swain, Rengar, and Zoe got some love. Azir, Galio, and Volibear took some nerfs. \n\nAsk us ANYTHING about 8.5. We&#039;re here to answer questions about your favorite champions, inquiries about runes, or maybe how often we execute to jungle camps! Let&#039;s talk bot lane matchups or maybe discuss shifts in the jungle! We&#039;re also down to just chat, though.\n\nDisclaimer: We have no insight on upcoming/future skins.\n\nChris &ldquo;Auberaun&rdquo; Roberts\nChristy &ldquo;Riot Ender L&rdquo; Frierson\nNick &ldquo;Riot Endstep&rdquo; Frijia\nSigmundur &ldquo;GangIeri&rdquo; Helgason\nArnor &ldquo;Riot Hjarta&rdquo; Halldorsson\nRob &ldquo;Riot King Cobra&rdquo; Rosa\nMiktat &ldquo;Riot Koyuncu&rdquo; Koyuncu\nBrian &ldquo;Riot Madness Heroo&rdquo; Pressoir\nNabi &ldquo;Riot Novalas&rdquo; Barak\nDan &ldquo;Riot penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee","replies":[{"poster":" Jar Jar binks l","date":"2018-03-07T22:22:42.039+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why does Phantom Dancer and Statiks cost 2600g?\n\nMy Bruiser ITEMS : Trinity + Steraks + Hydra = 3733 + 3100 + 3500\n\nVS the best scaling late game class ADC:\n2600 +2600 + 3400\n\n\n\nJust why?

Granted I do think that ADC itemization is too cheap right now, but realistically bruiser items could cost twice as much as ADC items and be balanced if the items were cost-efficient enough. Relative cost is not a sensible way to compare items since it's meaningless without the context of item efficiency - Sterak's is just a more efficient item than all the Zeal upgrades, so comparing them 1:1 and saying that the Zeal items are better because they're cheaper doesn't make sense.\n\nAgain though, I do agree ADC itemization is too cheap but that's a separate issue - ADCs spike very fast and get their multipliers early in the game, that doesn't mean that bruisers should be able to do the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2018-03-08T03:04:10.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this is true if you completely ignore item passive and actives.\n\nThe thing is that completed items have large bonuses that component items don't, so if ADCs can get 3 in the same time as fighters get 2 they have an advantage even if the stats equal out just due to their extra passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-03-08T04:05:48.519+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of course the more expensive item needs to be more cost-efficient for this to work out, but that's generally true already with most items on Live.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2018-03-08T06:39:29.398+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are fighter items really more cost efficient? Let's ignore Sterak's for a moment because it's gold efficiency varies radically depending on base AD and look at the other item I'd say most people would consider to be the prototypical bruiser item, Titanic Hydra.\n\nHydra's gold efficiency before its passive is 86.43% before its passive while PD is 97.02% and SS is 87.4%. I don't see the idea behind this argument, Titanic is already less gold efficient before you even consider that it has a junk-stat in HP regen on it, comparatively SS/PD have crit, probably the most undercosted stat in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-03-08T20:36:55.885+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say the prototypical bruiser items are Black Cleaver and Triforce before Titanic, but Titanic's not a bad example. \n\nUsing the gold efficiency of the raw stats on items is a good place to start, but I think it'd be pretty absurd to say that Titanic's passive and active are worth less gold than PD's passive. Even in just the on-hit damage on the initial target you're looking at 20-30+ damage per AA, which is 700-1050+ gold worth of damage if compared to Longsword (though obviously it's slightly worse than AD in most cases since it doesn't scale AD ratios but there isn't a good comparison point for pure on-hit damage). That's not even including the cleave and AA reset with additional damage on it. PD's passive is worth quite a bit of gold as well but it's hard to make a direct comparison there given that these effects are so variable in their value. \n\nThat said, I'd find it hard to justify an argument that the passive on PD is worth anywhere near as much as even just the passive effect on Titanic, given how powerful the on-hit and the cleave is, plus it also has an active which is quite powerful (worth a fair amount of gold by itself). Titanic's value is also much more reliable than PD's which in and of itself increases the value - reliable stats are just going to be better than inconsistent ones, I would say the PD passive is more situational than Titanic.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JabaTheHat","date":"2018-03-08T20:07:21.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Again though, I do agree ADC itemization is too cheap but that's a separate issue - ADCs spike very fast and get their multipliers early in the game, that doesn't mean that bruisers should be able to do the same thing.\n\nI think it's that the multiplier of critical strike is too powerful. Past a certain threshold it's by far the most dominating combination of items and will beat anything else.\n\nI'd rather see you guys decrease the effectiveness ceiling of crit and keep the cost of those items low. ADC who have to wait 25minutes+ to have an impact on the game just feel terrible to play, at least in solo queue. \n\nBasically, I think ADC should be less powerful late game and more powerful early game.

The issue is finding a way to buff Bot lane Lucian that doesn't push solo lane Lucian over the top, as he saw significant pro play Mid late last season despite being a sub 50% winrate champion in the role. Odds are he is closer to being viable solo lane than Bot, so we have to be very deliberate with how we buff him in order to make him strong bot and not oppressive Mid/Top. This is why we specifically buffed his crit scaling and reduced some of the level scaling last time around, as these affect bot lane Lucian more than solo lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zullar","date":"2018-03-09T01:23:40.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can anybody comment on the state of Ryze and why he was nerfed?\n\nThe patch notes state that the E change was intended to improve his early waveclear but I think it actually does the opposite (at rank 1 E splashes for 70/2=35 i stead of 50) and then it’s a strait up 50% nerf at rank 5.  I agree it is a little easier to kill directly with E at rank 1 (70dmg instead of 50) but this does’t even come close to offsetting the 50% splash nerf.\n\nAlso consider E splash nerf didn’t just nerf waveclear... the E splash was also a large source of lane poke.

Because she doesn't have reliable poke she has to rely on autos, but you can't really get close pre 6. I personally don't even think Riot knows how to play as her. They say she's auto attack focused but two of her abilities scale really well, and make her feel like a burst champ but, her abilities (outside R and the passive) are total trash. Q never hits the target you think it will and you have to be within your short ass auto range to even use it. W is really only useful if the monkeys on the enemy team afk so the incredibly slow speed of the projectile can possibly reach them before they return from their afk quest. E takes so long to \"charge\" that it doesn't feel that strong during fights that aren't premeditated. I don't feel she's weak or strong, just meh in lane, and if you're just meh in lane, you've already lost.","replies":[{"poster":"r4ndomkill","date":"2018-03-08T15:43:41.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally  i think that if they made her q prioritize marked targets then she could be good. as it stand her q is almost useless in skirmishes in minion wave, and down bot almost every fight is in a minion wave, at least if they do this they could make her keep a kind of all in assassin playstyle without giving more range and changing her identity.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2018-03-09T23:56:26.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you guys do to fix Karma's issue of using pretty much only one mantra (mainly) depending on what role she goes?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-03-18T01:26:17.245+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we were to approach changing Karma from the perspective of \"we want her to have more variety in what R she uses,\" there would be a few different ways to go about it from what I can see. The easiest (and also least interesting, in my opinion) way to do this would be to make the the different Mantras more similar - like putting a small haste on RW, a spellvamp effect (or other type of heal) on EQ, etc. The less difference there is between the Mantras, the less it matters which one is used - which likely increases variety, though not in a way I'd personally like.\n\nAnother (more interesting) way to go about this is to sort of \"equalize\" the different Mantras for the roles. That would mean putting more scaling power into RQ so that support Karma would be more likely to use it outside laning phase, moving RW's power away from being as selfish as it is now (with the %missing heal) and more into cc or damage to encourage support/mage Karma to use it and tank Karma to use other Mantras, and moving RE away from just being the most universally powerful when grouped (maybe less shielding/speed on allies and more into the main target shield/haste) so that support Karma doesn't feel as bad about not using it and more selfish builds might be more likely to use it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ducasi","date":"2018-03-12T19:11:48.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Assassins & Tanks Game Health**\n\n_I would love to see assassins played on LCS._\n\nYou say you are buffing them as they are in a weak spot right now, but I read from a lot of you that you actually hate them and don't want to see them played. And then you also are going to nerf duskblade the incoming patch and you have made huge buffs to the old favorite of yours ryze and the like with the new ap itemization. I am frankly starting to think you just buff based on what you play and like not considering what it is helpful and healthy for the game overall.\n\nI admittedly have been playing this game only for few years, but I have never seen assassins played in pro, like ever. Maybe a fizz or an ekko slips through but that's about it. And I don't say that they should be played all the time, but that they should be played in the right circumstances. For instance the opposite team is made of 3-4 squishies it SHOULD be viable to pick an assassin then and make it work and not the same mage in the midlane ALL THE TIME. This would make the game \"healthier\" as you can actually play all the champs depending on the opposite team comp, as you so often express as your ideal goal...\nAssassins are the most mechanics/skill based champs and seeing pro playing them would be really fun and exciting and it would make the game way more fun to watch.\n\nPro is boring to watch. The team fighting comps are the most viable and win the most and this implies the use of at least 2 to 3 tanks. Tanks are ridiculously overpowered right now and I believe it is once again to be able to protect your beloved squishies in the midline or botlane. Tanks have a lot of CC and it is actually stupid sometimes how hard it is to kill them, like 5 players ulting on them to see them drop below 50% health. They should have strength and weaknesses as other classes do. \nAssassins are mobile, very strong at picking one player, but they lack team fight sustain and tankiness. Fair. \nTanks have sustain, resistance, CC, mobility, and just _rarely_ lack some raw damage (indeed look at same of the many tanks with ridiculously unfair high damage like sion, cho or galio, or as another example look at the healthy speed of sej jg clear) which is anyway often replaced with % health damage or the like. In addition tanks are the least skill based champs as with other classes you would be punished heavily if caught in a bad spot, whereas they can often shrug it off their shoulders and be fine. If this is not enough, if tanks for some weird miracle are behind, they still remain a viable CC machine, whereas other classes would be left useless the rest of the game. This is what an overpowered class looks like and how it ruins a game. They should have some weakness like decrease their % health damage or their CC potential based on how much health they have, I don't know, I am a MD not a designer so I leave it to you to figure out. I understand your point of \"if not op, nobody would play tanks\", but I believe players would still play tanks in the right team comps and when they see fit (also in soloq), AS IT SHOULD BE and not all the time as it is right now.\n\nI really hope you can read this and not just another TL;DR as I share and express the view of many other players who love this game.\n\nToodles\n{{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2018-03-14T04:06:01.048+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Patch Chat, we like to be as transparent as possible with you guys on what we like and dislike. It's fun for us to chat with you guys about our game feels. Playtesters who are fond of mages may communicate that they're not fond of Assassin play patterns (because they're frustrating to play against if you're an immobile mage). Players who are AD mains may express distress with champions like Rengar or Zed. But, to a certain extent,  we definitely aspire to have most of our team play, (or have played), most champions in the game a large amount. In the case of Assassins, myself and Madness Heroo are both fairly familiar with Assassin play patterns; myself more so than him. I'm a big advocate of Assassins having agency to be able to assassinate targets and actively try to keep them in mind when assisting in providing feedback with the projects that I'm working on.\n\nThere may be a fundamental misunderstanding in why Assassins may not see professional play. **My personal read**: Assassins as a class function better in environments with low vision control & less coordination; the antithesis to professional play. Additionally, ADC and Support are fairly powerful in the current state of the game. A solution could be to, reduce the power of ADC's and Supports to give Assassins more agency and allow them to be picked in competitive. I'm not confident that this alone would be able to solve the aforementioned issue that Assassins suffer from. I'd argue that if Assassins were frequently played in competitive, that they're likely to be game warping in a solo queue environment, which in turn is arguably unhealthy for the game.\n\nTanks are certainly pretty prevalent right now in pro (Skarner/Sejuani/Zac in jungle) (Sion & Cho'Gath in top lane, with other champs mixed in). The Cinderhulk changes in 8.5 may potentially affect jungle picks and there are already jungle picks such as Kha'Zix & Jax in the jungle, and Gnar & GP in top lane that are played frequently and aren't exactly \"tanks\". I do think that the aforementioned champions are pretty powerful right now and I expect that they will, overtime with the changes that we're shipping out, likely see less play in exchange for more bruisers or carry junglers.\n\nSorry about the late response!","replies":[]}]}]}
