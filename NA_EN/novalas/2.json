It&rsquo;s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&rsquo;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\r\n\r\nPatch Chat serves as an opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. \r\nYou can find information on the most recent patch by following this link: \r\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-81-notes\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve got some love towards Brand, Graves, and Skarner &amp; a whole load of bugfixes for Syndra (and a bit for Evelynn). Zoe and Heimer have eaten some nerfs too! We&rsquo;ve also got some Predator buffs &amp; Resolve Set Bonus shifts. \r\n\r\nAsk us anything about 8.1! Our favorite rune builds, perhaps?

I've been in games where a 0/11 Tryndamere wins the game because he never stops split pushing and draws a lot of attention to himself, even if he doesn't even get to kill any towers. There's also games where the 0/11 Tryndamere loses the game because he's repeatedly dying.\n\n> that way i believe anyone who has constantly bad performance (in purpose or not) rightfully remains to a lower division for a longer time until there's some improvement and also cannot hold back teamates who are good enough but the matchup system and their teamates used to \"betray\" them.\n\nThat already exists in the current system.

That being said, I think relic shield start currently has little downside since the sustain provided in combination with Fleet + Overheal overshadows the lack of combat stats. All this in conjunction basically allowed Vayne's to more easily bypass her weaker laning phase. \n\n3 - I feel like Zombie ward is a rune that scales up in effectiveness the higher elo you go. I personally think that it's a little too ubiquitous in competitive/pro play and may need to be toned down.\n\n4 - Ornn has become a terror in competitive play (Highly contested pick/ban) and a pretty frustrating playing-against experience in the right hands. We're hoping to introduce some counterplay to his favorite ability by making W stoppable. \n\n9 - I think it's a step in the right direction, but we need to be cautious on how meta-changing it will be.

All three items presented are low cost, low efficiency that just don't seem worth upgrading to whatsoever in comparison to moving on to build any other support item. It also doubles as a noob trap for people who are hellbent on completing items one at a time.\n\nI personally think the gold cost minimum for a complete item should be around 2500 gold (boots excluded), because really, any less and they often feel like a waste of an item slot.

I've been experimenting with early AD items (to go with the AS bonus from Precision), but haven't found a build path I think is solid.

He felt a lot worse to me when Runes first shipped but he's gotten some indirect buffs that have put him into a decent spot, though I think he probably could be better.

He feels mediocre when I play him most of the time, though there are some cases where I've felt really good about Runes Reforged for him - mostly coming from Ultimate Hat allowing him to cast The Equalizer much more frequently. \n\nAs far as indirect nerfs, the biggest thing to me was the removal of Deathfire Touch which was a really high-synergy keystone for him that added a lot of (invisible) damage. Arcane Comet and Aery are both strong on him but his keystone isn't usually adding as much damage as it was before Runes. That's not necessarily a bad thing (he does have access to other powerful runes like Ultimate Hat that let him do some other things besides more straight-up damage), but it does seem like it's made him a bit worse.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-01-10T21:44:04.724+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have ya'll had any chance to test out the new sightstone/'new' support items, or is that still in the paper stage?","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2018-01-10T23:31:30.871+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had a lot of testing and exposure with the sightstone changes for a couple of weeks now.
