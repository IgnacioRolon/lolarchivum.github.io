Over time as she's been nerfed/buffed since release, she's generally had her utility stripped in favor of straight numbers buffs in terms of durability, speed, and damage. This has led to her being a stat-checking tank that doesn't really have the tools to support the play pattern of a stat-checking toplaner - the best tank example of that is Ornn, who (like Poppy) has some windowed damage but has enough consistent threat/uptime to back up that pattern, whereas Poppy's damage is more contextual/unreliable and she's much more limited in her ability to win battles of attrition. \n\nIn an ideal world, Poppy would be more about chip trading/utility rather than raw durability/speed/stats in general, and this changelist is intended to shift her back more towards those strengths rather than the ones she has on live. \n\nSpecifically on the R change, that's a straight utility buff that's also intended to help make up for her lower overall numbers since it allows her to guarantee another Q hit while the target is airborne, plus potentially an extra autoattack (just from Poppy, and more from her teammates in many cases). It is often quite a lot of extra damage as compared to Live Poppy.\n\nEDIT: I've also just realized that there's a line missing from the PBE data pull websites (it's on PBE, just doesn't seem to be listed correctly): Poppy's passive has +50 range on this changelist.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueHeart","date":"2018-04-18T23:37:42.454+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"yet these changes make {{champion:78}} less effective, the R is the WORST knockup in the game with a long cooldown. its not even a long knockup for the CD and the half damage from the snapcast is what had killed her ability to chip trade and finish anyhow. The huge cut to her MS irrelevates the E change anyhow and since the change {from my experience} doesnt change the carry range this is all irrelevant anyhow since it will still be unreliable. I can say for certain most of the mains ive personally talked to on the discord HATE the MS lose as it pretty much ruins her in the jungle and support to an extent. And it all ends up with her losing out in her teamfights where shes already struggled against other tanks like {{champion:31}} who can 1 shot people {{champion:516}} who can get 5 man knockups {{champion:54}} who has better engage {{champion:33}} whos tankier {{champion:57}} who has better sustain and thats not even touching the support who do her job as a peeler better. Even with the E buff this is overall a nerf since youre killing the 1 thing that let her have a snowballs chance in hell of surviving a teamfight. not to mention the lose of the MS on her W and base makes dodging skillshots harder. If you want to promote a chip trade around her focus on the passive. It got gut when Courage was introduced and now thats gone yet we got no compensation buffs, but look out if you nerf {{item:3147}} better buff {{champion:62}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}. you also nerfed her R snapcast damage so it wouldnt be used as an execute. now youre buffing it in the weirdest way possible to help when she all ins? How about you give her passive some scaling with her HP on the magic damage. She cant hold it forever without sacrificing farm there are about 5 better ways to promote a chip trade/ utility playstyle without gutting the things that make her fun and reducing her even more to a less effective {{champion:201}} {{champion:412}}. These changes dont help her in ANY WAY. shes fine where she is at, if you want to buff her look at her numbers. Were fine with that and we like her as she is without all this. Most GOOD poppy players can already time the R untargetable with the second Q proc anyhow so this just lowers her skill level anyway. How about DONT CHANGE HER and just buff her if you feel she needs it, this is NOT healthy for her or her trade pattern.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueHeart","date":"2018-04-19T00:03:05.606+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with +50 range on her passive it isnt helping her.

These changes imo really just makes her lane worse. Her W change i'd say is gonna hurt a lot when getting ganked, both the movement-speed and resistances, but even the ult i wouldn't say helps much in lane. I don't see the point in Qing while they're in ult as you'd save that for after the ultimate to slow them. If anything this just means i have less time to re-positioning for E after ulting because of the duration change.\n\nI don't really see any positives to the changes outside of the range buff on E, which is nice, but the carry range isn't changed which is really why it felt unreliable in the first place. That and that it seemed to randomly not stun when it should. The E is also not really that much more reliable seeing how the movement speed on W is now lower so getting into E range is harder now in the first place. In general i feel like this favours jungle and support poppy a bit, but i feel like the movement speed change will also screw with those two lanes, and top lane poppy will suffer as well because of these changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-04-18T23:55:34.462+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":18,"body":"These changes aren't targeted at a specific lane but just at the pattern of the champion as a whole. Buffing utility in favor of raw stats is generally going to favor lower-income roles like support or jungle, but I don't think the current list is enough to make her stronger in those roles than in toplane. \n\nThe R change is particularly strong in toplane as it allows Poppy to have substantially more kill threat 1v1. Being able to guarantee both hits of a Q and an extra auto by casting R means that your opponents have to respect Poppy's burst thresholds a lot more than on Live (or they'll die during the knockup if they don't flash the R in many cases, whereas with the untargetability in they have a window to use Flash/other defensive tools after being hit by R). \n\nI've also just realized that there's a line missing from the PBE data pull websites (it's on PBE, just doesn't seem to be listed correctly): Poppy's passive has +50 range on this changelist.","replies":[{"poster":"Morkaskog","date":"2018-04-19T00:36:58.227+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, after testing on PBE a bit i'd say i have to disagree with it being good in toplane. The ultimate is now too short to really get any time to re-position for E, which is what it was used for 90% of the time, and you can't even get a basic attack in unless you're already standing on top of them.\nSure you can now get both Q procks if you for some reason use it while they're in ult, but normally you'd wait so you can get all the stun you can out of it.\n\nThe E also isn't really that much more reliable since the reason it felt clunky was the random terrain sliding and sometimes not stunning when you're clearly touching the wall. The movement speed being less now also makes it harder to get into E range from the get go.\n\nSomething i'd also like to add is that with the W changes, Poppy now looses a lot of power in a certain place, getting dived. Poppy is renowned for being hard to dive, and now with the W nerf i feel like that will be lessened.\nI can't count the games i've gotten out of a bad start because i successfully turned a dive around on my enemy. But that needed me to be tanky enough to withstand their damage until i could align E, which again will be harder since ult is shorter and movement speed got hit.\n\nThe passive increase is nice though, never considered that the E and passive had interlocked ranges.\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"BlueHeart","date":"2018-04-19T01:42:14.222+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"The R change is particularly strong in toplane as it allows Poppy to have substantially more kill threat 1v1.

Didn't Meddler say that [Poppy was in a good spot just last month](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/g62V3OZh-quick-gameplay-thoughts-march-9?comment=00080000)? I would like to know the thought process behind these changes and if the full consequences of these changes were considered.\n\nThe ultimate change is not a \"straight utility buff\" as [Riot Endstep](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/oYqIA0zf-pbe-chat-with-the-playtest-team-89?comment=00060000) has put it. The people defending the change as a pure buff to Poppy's kit have either not played her enough to be very familiar with the intricacies of her kit or playing unconventional full damage/burst builds. The decrease in the knockup duration makes the uncharged ult less effective in certain situations. For instance, an uncharged ult can be used to reposition for a stun during the 1 second knockup duration, stall for cooldowns, and delay their escape so your team can catch up during a pick, among other things. All of these use cases have been hurt by the knockup duration decrease. Furthermore, the base movespeed nerf as well as the scaling movespeed nerf on the W exacerbates the problem by making it even harder to reposition for a stun while they are knocked up. This pigeonholes the ult into just another way to deal damage during a duel, making the spell one-dimensional and discouraging creative uses for the ult beyond a way to lay down more damage onto the opponent. You might mention that knocked up enemies no longer are untargetable, but while this indeed does make the ult less prone to causing your team to miss all their skillshots during a teamfight, the knockup duration is a measly 0.75 seconds which is not impactful enough as an engage or disrupt tool (especially with the long cooldown, Note: Alistar Q has a **13** second cooldown with a **1** second knockup and Malphite R has a **80** second cooldown with a **1.5** second knockup at max ranks, while Poppy R has a **100** second cooldown with a proposed **0.75** second knockup at max rank). Albeit Poppy's R has an uncharged and charged version with different uses, the 0.75 second knockup from the uncharged version seems underwhelming. In response to Riot Endstep's comment about using the ult to guarantee both procs of Q and an auto attack, given that the recovery frames of the ult on PBE (~16 frames), the startup frames of Poppy's Q (~13 frames), and the time to proc Poppy's second Q (~31 frames), enemy recovery frames (i.e. time spent in the AIRBORNE state: ~23 frames), there is no guarantee that the enemy will be hit with both procs of the Q if they flash out (as shown in Pyrofiend's recording in this thread). Using Q before R would guarantee it, but that combo would not be optimal in most situations.\n\nThe movespeed nerf in general is something that will hurt Poppy's greatly as utility as well. Movespeed has always been a stat that Poppy has relied on heavily since the rework (moreso than most champions) due to the nature of her abilities. Even if the E range increase is considered, I feel that there is a net loss as far as the reliability of successfully landing an E due to this movespeed nerf.  The change that very few people seem to be concerned with but should be is the nerf to the base movement speed. A decrease of 5 in the base movement speed of a champion might seem like a small inconvenience, but I am of the opinion that it is a huge nerf, especially in Poppy's case without a reliable dash/gapcloser (E requires a target). In isolation, analyzing the movespeed stat of a single champion is useless. The only statistic that matters in regards to how fast a champion is is the movespeed **in relation to other champions**. The average movespeed of all champions as of today is 337. Poppy's movespeed is being changed from 345 to 340. This movespeed delta of 5 can be seen in Janna's most recent nerf, one of the most consistent champions with one of the highest winrates in her role across multiple years. Why are we seeing a nerf of the same magnitude on a champion with abysmal pick/ban rates, both in solo queue and competitive, outside of as a Camille counterpick (because let's face it, she is only picked right now as a counterpick and because of one trick ponies like myself). Poppy's kit relies heavily on the fact that she can catch up to her targets given the lack of a reliable dash/gapcloser; increasing the range of Poppy's E while nerfing her movespeed heavily does not circumvent this problem and instead arguably lowers the overall skill ceiling and skill floor simultaneously.\n\nI understand that statistics such as win-rate, pick-rate, and ban-rate are not good indicators of how well-balanced a champion is, but looking at the numbers, it cannot be denied that Poppy's 48.28% win rate, 2.83% pick rate, and 0.31% ban rate (lolalytics.com) points to her not exactly being a must pick/ban in the current meta of the game. In my experience, she is only used either as a counterpick or because a player mains/one tricks her. Meddler has stated that \"one of our goals with champion balance is to ensure they're good choices in a wide range of contexts\" ([leagueoflegends.com](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/EEHXQ3kv-quick-gameplay-thoughts-march-23)). If Poppy is currently seen as a counterpick-only champion in both solo queue and the competitive scene, I feel that nerfing her further would only serve to lower the rate at which she is played, even though her pick/ban rate is already abysmal with the baffling amount of people I've seen say they have only seen Poppy being played once in a blue moon (does that not go against the ultimate goal of balancing a game? seeing the same 20 champions over and over again is tiring). I am of the opinion that one of the major problems of Poppy right now is that she does not excel at anything at the moment, and these changes are not sufficient to resolve this problem. She has the ability to take multiple roles and adapt to different situations, but in the end, whichever role she takes, other champions can do it better. Right now, I feel that she is in a good spot, but a weak one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhiteAcres","date":"2018-04-18T23:18:48.558+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"One of the more common builds on {{champion:37}} (at least from what I've seen) has been starting{{item:3303}} and then getting {{item:3070}} on the first or second back, since it helps her very mana-hungry play style, but seeing as both of these items are receiving mana sustain nerfs, I feel like she might end up being in sort of a weak state.

Especially when AP items used to have a high AP value (with low mana, and CDR) and over the past few seasons, we kept losing **a lot** of AP on our items but was compensated for Mana and CDR. So we lose a lot of AP to add CDR to our items, and then ADCs gets easy access to 40% CDR AND ways to refill mana with {{item:3508}} without sacrificing anything for it, and now Mages are losing a large portion of mana and gets nothing for it?\n\nI know that ADCs changes are coming soon...but why is this massive nerf to base mana of mages coming before the ADC changes? If this all happened on the same patch as ADC changes then it might be a bit more acceptable, but mages are getting a massive role nerf in 8.9 so we become weaker, while ADCs continue to stomp for another patch or 2...and that's assuming ADCs changes even make them weaker at all.\n\nAlso these changes are going to force most mages into {{item:3003}} because the amount of mana from {{item:3285}} isn't going to be enough for them...and this is 1 patch after you harshly nerfed Archangel Staff to be a poor item to rush and require stacking.\n\nYou make it sound like Mages still have all these options like Building {{item:3003}} {{item:3027}} on every mage isn't a way to \"fix\" this as not every mage can really build that, and even if they do...they would be extremely useless until like 30 minutes into the game, which games don't even last that long anymore and even stalling with mages wave clear is going to be even harder because of this...which in the end makes it more snowbally.\n\nDon't even bring up Ocean Dragon or Blue buff as viable ways to counteract it...Ocean dragon isn't super strong until you get 2 of them which is basing solely on RNG to even be lucky enough to get 2 of them AND that's only if your team is even in position to attempt to take it. And Blue buff? Sure in LC$ you would have no problem getting those blue buffs as a mid laner, but most of the time in Solo Que you don't even get blue buff as a Mid Laner. Only time you really see jungler give it is usually if the mid laner is super carrying/insanely ahead, OR your jungler is a resourceless champion or some one who barely uses mana. Most games, the jungler take the blue buff for themselves.\n\nAnd what are we supposed to do against Baron minions? Mages won't have the mana to waveclear through that all that well anymore...and even if you do manage to do so, would be OOM and useless for when the enemy team jumps on you. Do you basically want it to be, whoever gets Baron first can just push for game?\n\nThis whole change is terrible...especially for the main reason you guys give for the \"Mages shouldn't be able to waveclear without worry\" or something. Mages use their CDs to waveclear and uses mana to do so...You may think it's infinite mana but have you actually played as a mage when your team is losing and trying to defend? What about all the Non-mage waveclear in the game? {{item:3085}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3077}} even {{item:3025}} can be used to help. \n\nWhat about all the Mages who already struggle to actually wave clear? Do you just want them to never be played because they can't waveclear with what little mana they have? Guess that's why we never saw {{champion:85}} played mid anymore with his extremely low wave clear and why you are kind of heavily pushing him for bot now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-04-18T22:34:37.017+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright, I'll just kick start this whole thing:\n\nWhat are y'all's opinions of the mana changes?

ADs are tons more competitive in mid by comparison because most ADs have better range and damage, and don't need a resource to outpoke.

It's going to force Archangel on a lot of mages who normally wouldn't need or want it. Also there is a lot of negative feedback about it, because of the reason why you guys are doing this. The fact this is happening because mages need a limited resource, where is ADCs limit resource? If all the ADCs have an ammo system for their auto attacks like Graves/Jhin then I'll be completely fine with the mana gutting.\n\nIts not like mages are the only wave clear in the game...some ADCs are very close to some of the best mages in there. And this is after we had to deal with Baron minions being stronger (and after all these annoying Banner of Commands) Baron Minions and Super Minions which now mages won't even have the mana to kill anymore. \n\nThe way it would feel for mages...it'll be like if you super buffed the attack speed of {{item:3087}} by a lot like say 30-40%, but then nerfed every ADCs base attack speed per level by a half. If that happened, every ADC would kind of feel like they're forced into building Stattik, even if they normally don't.
