It&rsquo;s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&rsquo;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\n\nPatch Chat serves as an opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks.\nYou can find information on the most recent patch by following this link:\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-82-notes\n\nIn this patch, we&#039;ve given Evelynn, Kha&#039;Zix, and Vayne some nerfs. Ornn isn&#039;t unstoppable anymore, btw. Jinx received some changes to her play pattern. Nunu and Sona got some love! Sightstone, as an item, as well as all of it&#039;s upgrades are now gonezo and your support items now transform into a warding item!\n\nAsk us ANYTHING about 8.2! Any changes that you have questions about? Maybe our favorite rune builds? Or how often we execute to jungle camps? We&#039;re also down to just chat, though! \n\nDisclaimer: We have no insight on upcoming/future skins.\n\nAdam &ldquo;Riot Afic&rdquo; Cohen\nChris &ldquo;Auberaun&rdquo; Roberts\nChristy &ldquo;Riot Ender L&rdquo; Frierson\nNick &ldquo;Riot Endstep&rdquo; Frijia\nSigmundur &ldquo;GangIeri&rdquo; Helgason\nArnor &ldquo;Riot Hjarta&rdquo; Halldorsson\nRob &ldquo;Riot King Cobra&rdquo; Rosa\nMiktat &ldquo;Riot Koyuncu&rdquo; Koyuncu\nBrian &ldquo;Riot Madness Heroo&rdquo; Pressoir\nNabi &ldquo;Riot Novalas&rdquo; Barak\nDan &ldquo;Riot penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee","replies":[{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2018-01-24T21:13:22.233+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you guys feel about making changes to marksmen to make them better at sustained damage, while taking away their burst?

Nothing is more annoying than being equally fed as a Jhin, Caitlyn, Tristana or MF and dying in literally 2 hits. There's not much you can do to counter that damage unless you're a tank.\n\nThe state Tristana and MF are in are really puzzling.\n\nTristana is an ADC with A) an attack speed skill B) long range C) a gap closer/disengage C) another disengage/enemy knockback D) high AoE burst. She's got a tool for every weakness an ADC should have. It's hard to run from her, it's hard to chase her and it's hard to out-damage her. But it IS easy to die trying to fight her, so there's that.\n\nMF is an ADC with A) movement speed buff/passive B) AoE Slow C) MASSIVE AoE dmg D) MASSIVE single target dmg. Different kit than Tristana but basically the same concept. Hard to run from her, hard to catch her (although easier than Tristana) and pretty damn difficult to out-damage her.\n\nI want to know what Riot was thinking when designing these reworks. It's fine if an ADC has a few of these mechanics, but to create an \"everything you need\" kit was probably not the best idea in hindsight.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2018-01-25T00:39:31.742+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"When are you guys gonna buff Ekko again?

Internal data also reveals around a 52% winrate when using optimal runes, which I think is appropriate. \n\n2) I think it would be better to wait and see how the bot lane meta shakes up after the plethora of changes in patch 8.2.

I use champion.gg to look at winrates. And that's where I see a yearly long 52-55% winrate on Twitch(usually 53ish). How come it's so different from the other two big websites?

Q max first and then depending on matchup and team comps I'd say you either max W or E second. Probably E most of the time.\n\nIn terms of scrapped spells? Hmmm, we did A LOT of exploration with Swain. One example....earlier in development his passive replaced his trinket slot with a raven that you could place on the map at almost global range. The raven would act as a ward with a speed shrine on top of it (scuttle crab). The idea was that you were supposed to use it tactically, but we wound up realizing the optimal play was to either place it between towers midlane so jungle could move faster and mid could get to lane faster OR placing it in lane as a mid laner and just using it as a perma-ghost in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2018-01-24T23:12:07.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does he fare with the other Catalyst items like Protobelt and GLP?\n\nAlso, how would you say he performs top vs mid?

This would allow him to not be so easily kited, but also keep him balanced in teamfights.  \n\n* Perhaps a movement speed buff when under 50% health, and charging towards the direction of enemy champions? \n\n* I do like the idea of a small knockback on his E which was a previously discussed change. \n\n* An attack speed buff on his w was also discussed.
