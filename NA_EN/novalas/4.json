The numbers balance I'm sure you guys can easily fix, even if the new items are a problem. But I have two *fundamental concerns about assassins design that I would really like to hear your opinion on*\n\n1) **The effectiveness of Assassin is too tied to the presence of peeling supports --- namely Janna and Lulu.** It fees like, at least in solo queue --- if Janna/Lulu are in the game, then you're useless, especially in teamfights. If they're not, then you're OP and can easily have a huge positive impact on the game by running around ganking and killing people. Do you agree that this dichotomy exists and is a problem? Right now to me, I think generally speaking assassins are already OP in solo queue. But if they get HARD countered by those peeling supports. So it's so hard to balance them accordingly because the \"ON\" switch is always there to make them useless, almost regardless of how high their numbers are.\n\n2) **How you can buff assassins enough for pros to pick them up without ruining solo queue?** Pros are risk averse and new-strat averse. It took them ages to find that the pubstomping Malzarhar during worlds last year wasn't only good for pubstomping. He was insanely powerful for pro games as well. I'm afraid something similar might happen again --- even when assassins are buffed to be strong like Malz was, it would take too long before the pros can overcome their inertia to abandon old/safe strats. Meanwhile said champs completely devastate solo queue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wardude12110","date":"2018-05-02T20:57:06.828+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you confirm or deny if GP Q will proc Stormrazor?

It's hyperbolic to say that players haven't been feeling that. :p\n\nThese changes are intended to reduce that early pressure. In testing, we're experimenting with trading off that reduction in early pressure with more farming (since camps are spawning more frequently), allowing junglers other methods of getting ahead. \n\nAs for the machete nerfs, machete is generally just stronger than talisman on live. Machete only *had* attack speed to avoid having junglers be hardbound to the precision tree when Runes Reforged hit live.

First time I used it after reading through the description I assumed it would be available immediately, since there's no mention of a lockout.

I want propose some changes and give you guys my perspective on SHIELDS! \n\nWhatever the changes for shields to come, I hoping for no decrease on base shield values again.\nMy reasoning is:\n* - Damage and poke feel so high nowadays!\n* - Decreasing shields base value is a lazy way to solve things and very unexciting.\n\n**My suggestions:**\n* - An item that does %damage through shields or other item option that can help VS shield comps like Grievous Wounds exists for healing champions.\n* - I strongly suggest a new effec to shields: (SDOT) that is: \"Shield Decay Over Time\". \n\nThis would be realllllly sweet and here is why:\n---> Decaying shields are means to nerf shields and ALSO act as a form of skill expression, it makes well timed shields be the most effective of all, which requires a good timing or good prediction skills to get the most of the ability!\n\n**My conclusion:**\n* - Damage/Poke feels very high.\n* - In case shields need nerfs, please consider changes that do also enable SKILL expression such as timing and prediction and not just adjust numbers.\n\nI'm the Support Orianna player from a few months ago. \nDo note that Ori's shield has a delay, it isn't an instantaneous shield like a Lulu's, Janna's or Karma's. \nIt is also one of the reasons I really do enjoy playing her as a support, I feel that there's more skill expression and fun to be had with her than to play with other enchanters.\n**\n~*LifelessAngel***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koyuncu","date":"2018-05-03T20:58:17.216+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely something I agree with!

Unless the target is literally getting one-shot, shields are still at full effectiveness as a deterrent, and have the added obnoxiousness of having skill expression that pulls people out of lethal damage ranges. Everybody's had that game as an assassin where they jump in, get the adc to 3% health, and then their health bar is suddenly 60-80% full of white health that you have to chew through to do your job, except actually you just die because you spent all your damage getting the adc to 3% health.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wobly","date":"2018-05-02T21:31:14.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thoughts on the Ryze and Azir work going on the PBE this patch?\n\nAny concerns that the new IE might actually still be too strong?
