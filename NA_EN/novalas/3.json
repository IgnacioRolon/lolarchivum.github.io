Can you give us some kind of rationale behind why Sona needed the additional nerf, and why she's going to be getting yet another indirect nerf in the next patch?  \n\nHer winrate dropped considerably after the first nerf, and it made her so much easier to punish in lane that she wasn't just a lane bully anymore.  But then you tack on the Aery nerf, the Q bonus damage and mana cost nerf which are currently live.  But it doesn't even stop there with the direct nerfs.  In the upcoming patch, she's getting hit with a round of indirect nerfs via the flat AP from Sorcery+Inspiration and the shield/heal strength from Forbidden Idol/Ardent Censer/Redemption.  \n\nI guess what is making so many of us so upset is that none of the other champions were handled this harshly.  Even Leona and Miss Fortune, who both have great winrates right now.  Leona got a minor 20 damage off her TANK ability.  Miss Fortune hasn't had any nerfs.  Sona got an immediate hotfix, followed by 2 more rounds of nerfs.  And like so many other players here who try to be supportive of the decisions that Riot makes, I'm desperately trying to understand why this is necessary.  Why is this champion being gutted?  Why is Forbidden Idol being hit, when the tank supports are the most successful right now?  \n\nPlease, can you give us any insight?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotMadnessHeroo","date":"2017-12-06T23:57:29.110+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sure! Even after her previous nerfs statistically Sona was still a pretty big outlier. While her overall winrate was no longer insane, she was basically dead even with Leona and Taric for highest winrate in the role by our numbers, so she was certainly still very powerful. \nIf we go beyond overall winrate and go to winrate with their best keystone however, there was clear evidence that Sona was still too strong. Her winrate with her best keystone (Kleptomancy) was over a full percent higher than any other Support, and was in fact the individual highest winrate Keystone/Champion combination at any role in the game.\nI think these numbers indicate she has substantial room to be nerfed and still be a solid, even if no longer strong, champion.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-12-07T00:19:10.757+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think it's evidence of balance issues with runes that klepto was her best choice, not aery?

As such we don't want the Runes in the path to be too generically powerful, i.e we'd prefer that they be powerful when you pick them in the correct situation and weak in the wrong situation, rather than be generally average or strong.\n\nHow this paradigm fits into Klepto means that there's a strong chance it is (and should be) the optimal choice for several champions who can best make use of it's paradigm. If we are trying to reward you for taking an Inspiration Keystone, and this Keystone revolves entirely around being able to cast a spell and auto, there wouldn't be much strategic or tactical gameplay to it if it's best users aren't getting significant reward for it. Ideally you are rewarded for taking this Keystone both on the champions who use it best, and against the champions who can punish you least for frequently auto attacking them (should be viable in solo lanes as a ranged champion against some melee).\n\nSona and Ezreal seem to be 2 of the clear cases who best fit the paradigm in practice, and since this is the lone requirement we are imposing on synergy with the Keystone, the remaining way we could make it stronger/weaker for them specifically is to adjust the loot table to give items that are less appealing to them. \n\nThis is something we are thinking about, and it's possible we'll make more changes to how the loot table works going forward. Nothing planned on that immediately though.\n\nTo ultimately answer your question, it seems Sona is one of the best pattern fits for Klepto. Given that Inspiration Runes are supposed to sharply reward or punish you for optimizing (or failing to) around them, I think it makes sense that Klepto would outperform Aery on her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2017-12-07T01:20:38.182+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you help a man out though?\n\nAs a Sona Mid player, this nerf hurts my early game like hell.

She was my first support, and even after her first big rework, I didn't feel like she was this destroyed.  \n\nThe biggest issue I have with this changelist isn't the current nerf to her Q bonus damage, because I can understand bringing her damage back down a bit so that she's not overbearing in lane.  I can understand giving it a slightly higher mana cost, though that stings when supports don't have the ability to take mana regeneration runes or the meditation mastery.  At least Manaflow Band compensates for that some, and by completely changing my build order, I can deal with that.  \n\nWhat I can't really get over is the continued nerf to her healing.  It was already the weakest heal in the game, compared to Soraka ( level 1 base heal 80 + 60% AP for 10%hp/50 mana ) and Nami ( level 1 base heal 65 + 30% AP for 70 mana ) at ( level 1 base heal 30 + 25% AP for 80 mana ).  The ability to have an increased heal on allies below 40% health was removed a while ago, which would have made a huge difference if that was still in play here.  The only thing that was saving her heal was the 8%/10% increased heal and shield strength that she gains from the Forbidden Idol/Ardent Censer/Redemption Items.  And those are being nerfed next patch.  The last nerfs hit her early game heal hard, the upcoming ones are going to hit her mid game heal hard.

In all previous seasons, and I'm not just talking about the Ardent meta where supports were regarded as being too strong, I felt like I had a real, tangible impact on the game. Even if I was behind, the utility I could provide if I coordinated well with my team could turn a losing game into a decisive victory, if I played really well.\n\nNowadays... no. League of Oneshot means that if the enemy team starts getting a lead, then if my carry gets jumped on while I'm playing Taric I can literally spam Q, W, try and hit E and start my R, to a Knight's Vow-bonded carry that I've just put Locket shield on, and they've _still_ blown up before my ult even lands. I have impact if my team as a whole is ahead, sure, but playing from behind feels -really- terrible now, which is something I've seen people other than supports complaining about, but I think it's pretty bad for us.\n\nAny thoughts on this? Is there some secret trick I'm missing in preseason, or is it intentional that supports have less power? I've been a support main for a long time, but it's never felt this bad before.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koyuncu","date":"2017-12-07T05:41:02.856+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'm also a filthy support main who also plays Taric!\n\n1) I actually find the support role to be pretty impactful this preseason. Several supports (Sona, Leona, and Taric first come to mind) have been top outliers on the win rate leaderboards across all champions for the past 4 weeks. With Arcane Comet becoming more prevalent this patch, poke enchanters/mages have a lot of presence in deciding who wins bot lane.\n\n2) Playing at a disadvantage typically feels pretty bad. Why do you think it feels worse now than before? I'm still having success keeping my team alive before Taric ult pops. \n\n3) Personally, I'm surprised you feel that the support role is the worst it's been. Locket rush every game back in S5 was pretty boring, and having the sole responsibility of buying green wards in S2 was REALLY crappy.","replies":[{"poster":"Omituinen","date":"2017-12-07T06:08:18.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) I understand that winrates are a useful metric, but at the same time I feel like they give a poor indication of how strong a role is as a whole. For instance, if toplane is a really weak role, some toplaners will still have higher winrates than others because despite their lack of agency they can still influence things a little more than others. By the same token supports are always going to have some favoured picks (Janna almost always has high winrate, for instance) regardless of whether the support role is OP as hell or completely useless in deciding a game outcome.\n\n2) I think it feels worse because damage seems to be much higher than previously. As a recent example I came out of lane recently having gotten my Varus a few kills and a 50-60 cs lead. Then we tried to fight the toplane Jax who our Wukong had given a few kills to, and he one-shot Varus before I could even get my ult off. 2v1, we were ahead - in fairness, so was he, but I feel he shouldn't have so effortlessly murdered the two of us given we were also winning our lane. If you've got some tips for keeping people alive long enough for Taric ult to pop then I'd love you to tell me - I'm really getting tired of popping my ult and having three people including my tank go down before the ult lands!\n\n3) Ever heard of the term \"Boring, but Practical\"? I feel that's the thing - I played back when support was just \"ward-machine for the team\", but I still felt my impact noticeably when I managed to light up the entire map and deny all the enemy vision. Locket rush was again, very homogeneous, but it felt good to save people when I did that. Nowadays, I feel like I have a number of bad choices. I can buy  Ardent first, or Knight's Vow first, or Locket first, but if I'm behind it feels like I can't keep up with what the enemy team are putting out. Meanwhile, when nearly every assassin rushes Duskblade, nearly every AP mid rushes Morellonomicon, nearly every bruiser rushes Cleaver and nearly every tank rushes Sunfire (Bramble, before last patch's changes), nobody complains about that being \"boring\" like they do with Locket-rush on supports, it's just what those champs build.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koyuncu","date":"2017-12-07T06:43:50.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is some great insight!

That way she loses damage on the auto locking spell, and the only way she gains back that damage is properly landing Q->AA's.\n\nA strong factor that pushes sona out of pro play (and a known hard counter for her patterns) is having a champ that can brute force all in's on her since she is literally the only utility support without hard CC on a basic ability, heck her only form of CC outside of the ult is on the powercord E. Late game you don't really have that luxury to control that, and almost no control for being able to use it reactively, part of the reason she is famously known as a faceroll champ.

Srsly, why? _Maybe someone said that before, but I'll repeat:_ **She is dead as support now** - there is no hp, no heal, no armor in early/mid game _(I'm 100% sure, you-devs are perfectly know about that existing problems)_ and now with 7.24 no dmg anymore... Ah.. There is: also, support items (+heal/shield) will be nerfed soon. Cool, yeah... x.x\n\nFine, no poke, more mana... but can you fix at least armor (that is the lowest behind supp characters) - or sustain dmg (since her Q now is... don't wanna say that word here) - or HP amouts at least!?...

Numbers do suggest she may be weak but I personally think the Fleet Footwork buff was very substantial and she is maybe the best user, so I'd like to wait and see where she settles. In Kespa Cup the AD meta was also dominated by Sorcery primary poke AD's in lane (MF/Varus/Ashe/Jhin), so it's possible Caitlyn is just being crowded out by other champions filling her long range lane dominant niche better than her currently, which may change if we nerf Sorcery for AD's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-12-06T21:04:12.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Volibear has a buff in testing with his attack speed. \n\nTHat wont be enough, he needs a q buff and a passive cd reduction. \n\nAny future plans with him aside from attack speed buff?\n\nEdit: I was first btw @koyun.

There's too many potential changes all occurring at the same time for that to be feasible, so we have a division of labor system that sets up every changelist with a primary ticketholder who keeps up to date with the changes, any iterations on the changelist, and updates the team when necessary. That person is also the one that the designers who make the changelists keep in contact with for feedback, so in most cases it's easy to assign tickets by champion knowledge/lane/etc. - just assign the ticket to whoever has the most expertise in the area.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
