Get ready for the Swain Train!\n\nI&rsquo;m Riot Novalas &amp; I&rsquo;m a QA Analyst on Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who work on Core Gameplay playing new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they&rsquo;re released. It&rsquo;s our job to test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&rsquo;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\n\nPatch Chat serves as an opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks.\nYou can find information on the most recent patch by following this link:\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-83-notes\n\nSwain hits live with this patch receiving a full Visual Game Update. Riot King Cobra and Riot Madness Heroo are the two playtesters for Swain and they&#039;ll be around to answer (most) Swain-related questions! \n\nOutside of the Noxian Grand General, this patch has nerfs to Azir, Jarvan IV, Kog&#039;Maw and more! We&#039;ve also got some love for Master Yi &amp; Viktor. Unsealed Spellbook took a summoner CDR hit &amp; some Inspiration runes were moved around! \n\nAsk us ANYTHING about 8.3. We&#039;re here to answer questions about your favorite champions, inquiries about runes, or maybe how often we execute to jungle camps!

These buffs are primarily to assist with the hit that Yi took with that.\n\n I don't believe Highlander's duration getting reverted is going to be the solution here, mainly because 7 seconds in League of Legends time is already a --very-- long time. Would having it at 10 seconds be the end all be all solution to Yi? Or should there be bigger buffs/alterations on his ultimate to make it so it feels more valuable in the 7 seconds that you have it? I'm not necessarily saying that Yi is going to get those changes yet/soon but, having spoken to Ricklessabandon on this, we'd probably lean towards making the buff on Highlander better rather than reverting the changelist.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep","date":"2018-02-09T06:12:40.265+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"I hate signing into these boards but you do realize that new stupid mage item you're releasing is 8 seconds duration right? Even if movement speed is a shorter duration, the item does an effect for 8 seconds.\n\nBy the way -\n\nTake a look at Vayne's ult duration, you should probably nerf that judging by your logic (Please do, shes my 100% ban) (8 / 10 / 12s).\n\nSome reasons 7 seconds is not enough (on Yi, clearly enough on Vayne):\n\nGuardian Angel which counters Master Yi hard eats up half his Highlander\nFree stop watch eats up what 2.5s? Add in two mages and you're done.\nStealth champions eat up what another 4s? \nWhats that? Stuns get progressively longer because every champion has some sort of snare?\nYou guys literally throw move speed on EVERYTHING (except Yi items) now. Just look at PBE lol.\n\n\n7 seconds used to be a \"long time\". Stealth changes were great by the way, I love how theres no counter to Vayne, Khazix, Talon when you're playing a melee champion.\n\nIts fairly obvious no one in the team plays Yi. I recall a post from you (I'll end up digging it up for a video probably) where you said Yi pops off after a BOTRK purchase. I then checked your OP.GG live on stream and your only Yi games were 2 in normals against Silvers - one of which you lost. \n\nYou should give the \"rework\" or whatever you guys are calling it to someone that is willing to at least try the champion they're balancing. \n\nYou're playtest anyway, but it'd be great if we could see the person working on Yi was actually using his hours to get a feel for how the champion works instead of being completely dark to the community (RiotAugust is a really good example of how your balance team should behave).\n\nBut no, you're right, the duration alone won't fix what you guys have been doing to this game for the past two years. I recommend you change it back and do more. \n\nIf you want I can make a more coherent video gathering up a bunch of thoughts for you similar to what I did with those stupid meditate changes Rick did.\n\nHad a lot of edits with this post hopefully its easier to read.","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2018-02-10T02:42:26.513+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"My intent wasn't to say that 7 seconds is a magic number or to imply that the kinds of things you listed don't exist. They definitely do. It was more that 7 seconds as an arbitrary number in and of itself is pretty long in League, even taking into account that there are effects that last longer.\n\nIn terms of Highlander, I still do want to pitch some ideas for buffing it in some way, I'm just not confident that reverting the ult duration is the specific ideal buff to make. I personally agree Master Yi needs some help, in part because he's been left behind a bit in recent times for all the reasons you mentioned in your comment. \n\nTo reopen the conversation a bit, the question I'd like to pose to you would be: Would the current Highlander duration be good enough if Highlander's effect was enhanced in some capacity? e.g. higher movement speed or a burst of movement speed?","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep","date":"2018-02-11T09:05:49.207+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologize about my passive aggressive comments earlier.\n\nI don't think that the problem with Highlander is how fast Yi goes, but instead losing access to his attack speed and movement speed slow immunity during a fight.\n\n\nThere is a good list of items / spells that everyone can get that right now basically means game over for Master Yi:\n\nStopwatch - 1/3rd of highlander duration\nZhonyas - 1/3rd of highlander duration\nGuardian Angel - More than half of highlander duration, and you have to kill them first.\nHeal - More move speed so they run away and waste more duration, more health for another hit.\nFlash - If they're over a wall you have to give that kill up, useless for the rest of the fight if you put work into one target.\nExhaust - Even if immune to the slowing effect, and have some true damage,  it is hard to get a reset.\n\n\nThere is an even longer list of common items that basically means Yi is going to have a really hard time:\n\nNinja Tabis - These boots hurt Critical Build a lot, which appears to be the route the balance team is wanting to take.\nShield items - Locket, Barrier, etc. When an ADC gets stacking shields your Highlander reset becomes more difficult.\nGhost - It is incredibly similar to the speeds that Highlander gives you, denying you a lot of auto attacks.\nAll Move Speed items - Makes it harder to stick to a target and get that reset (more and more are getting added).\n\n\nOn top of that almost every new champion or rework has a really big burst of movement speed or dash that allows them to eat up even more of Master Yi's Highlander duration by simply running away from him. (Zoe, Kayn, Rakan, Xayah. Camille, Ornn).\n\n\nIt is ok to be building situationally against Master Yi. I think that is smart and would require the Master Yi to play differently in fights. If a player builds Thornmail because I'm fed I should respect that. The unfortunate issue is that every single mage player gets Zhonyas. Every late game ADC gets a GA. Sometimes I fight an entire team of GA / Zhonyas. Every player has flash. I can only flash after one guy. The support is going to build a Solari. These items are all built regardless of whether there is a Master Yi or not. There is no decision making in countering Master Yi, it just happens.\n\nSomeone in my chat brought up the point - \"If these are items that everyone builds anyway than how does it effect Yi more than any other champion?\" - Yi is unlike most other champions. A Zhonyas is a good time for a Khazix to have his Q cooldown come up, giving him more power. A Pantheon gets the benefit of waiting for his stun. Jarvan will get his E Q combo. Master Yi is backwards from most current champions. The Zhonyas duration will simply make him weaker as his Highlander disappears, while other champions get access to important abilities that make them stronger. Yi has to attack through the shields, hes running out of time. Other Junglers can simply wait it out and use their renewed cooldowns after the shield expires. \n\n\nThese points lead to the problem of his Highlander expiring. Without Highlander, Master Yi is... just not very good. Its an incredible ultimate, though people like to joke a lot about how the ultimate is slapped onto items. The immunity to Attack Speed slows and Movement Speed slows is absolutely huge.\n\n\nSo does that mean that more speed on the ability would help Master Yi? Maybe. It would have to be done in a creative way that makes the player perform in a risky way. I don't like the current style of buffing his overall damage because we'll see a 2% increase in win rate in silver, but only a 1% in Diamond, making him a problem champion. A lot of Master Yi's problems are simply meta related. Master Yi's kit does not synergize with the constant grouping, early ganking, tower sieging meta we're currently seeing. Changes to his kit should address that.\n\n\nIf you're really adamant about not buffing the duration of Highlander, the previous meditate change was a really good example of how you can target Highlander (Freezes Highlander duration). It rewards critical thinking instead of the mindless button mashing that Yi is known for. Creative solutions like that can help make Highlander relevant again without making him a total monster in the lower elos. Allowing the Yi player to extend the duration in a creative way or increase his movement speed or sticking power would be better than straight up buffing any numbers. Keep in mind that Master Yi hits diminishing returns really quickly as well.\n\n\nThanks for reaching out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2018-02-11T21:10:22.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pausing Highlander during stasis (Stopwatch, Guardian Angel, etc.) won't solve the problem but it would help. Alternatively, you could shift some functionality away from Highlander and into his basic abilities so that Master Yi could fight champions without it.\n\nIt would also be nice if we could \"store\" Highlander by using Meditate before attacking.

It's not just a basic \"super mode\" ultimate like Nasus' or Aatrox's ults, it's also a gapcloser and a means to avoid getting kited. It's difficult or impossible for Master Yi to fight without it, it's just too easy for enemies to kite him. This is because he doesn't have any CC, all of his damage comes from 125 range basic attacks, and Alpha Strike has a long cooldown if he's not constantly attacking. Without Highlander, he's dead in the water.\n\nWhen I say it's a gapcloser, I really do mean that you run up to people instead of Alpha Striking right away. Alpha Strike is your only defensive spell (because Meditate is awful) and you have to use it reactively to enemy spells. So you'll usually waste a few seconds of Highlander just trying to catch up to enemies.\n\nNow, before, the nerf, Highlander was very reliable. You could use it at the start of a fight and trust that the duration would last until the fight was over. But when the base duration was lowered from 10 seconds to 7, this wasn't true anymore. Now, any engagement with your opponents is a *panicked race against death* to kill somebody before your time ran out. There are many ways enemies can waste time on your Highlander:\n\n* Aatrox - Revive (3 seconds), lifesteal\n\n* Zhonya's Hourglass (2.5 seconds) (every mage buys this)\n\n* Ahri - Charm (1-2 seconds) and ult (you will usually waste your entire Highlander duration trying to chase an Ahri when she uses 3 dashes, even if you use Alpha Strike perfectly)\n\n* Akali - Stealth (8 seconds), spellvamp\n\n* Alistar - Pulverize (1 second), Headbutt (1 second or longer depending where he throws you), Trample (1 second), Unbreakable (even with true damage you'll need a lot of time to kill him)\n\n* Stopwatch (2.5 seconds) (This item is **everywhere** by the way)\n\n* Amumu - Bandage Toss (1 second) and ult (2 seconds), also he's really tanky\n\n* Anivia - Egg (up to 6 seconds), Ice Wall (this can waste a couple seconds depending on where it is), and her Q (1-1.5 seconds), she also usually has Rod of Ages and Seraph's Embrace making her really tanky\n\n* Annie - Stun (1.25-1.75 seconds)\n\n* Ashe - Ult (1-3.5 seconds)\n\n* Aurelion Sol - Ult (knockback)\n\n* Guardian Angel (4 seconds) (every ADC has this after 30 minutes unless they're greedy)\n\nThat's just every champion starting with the letter \"A\", and a few common items. You'll also be stalled by shields, heals, anything that keeps people alive.\n\nYou can try to buy up to 4 seconds of extra time on Highlander by Meditating, but it'll usually be interrupted by a stun, silence, knockup, suppression, fear, charm, sleep, polymorph, taunt, whatever. It'll even be counterproductive if your target is running away, ranged champions have no reason to stand near you.\n\nAnd let's talk about enemy champions running as fast or faster than Highlander. Highlander grants 25/35/45% extra movement speed, and thanks to mobility creep, that's not enough anymore. Any champion that isn't running at a normal speed will waste a significant amount of Highlander duration simply by running away from you.\n\n* Singed - 20%+ (stacking) MS from passive\n\n* Phase Rush - 15-40% MS\n\n* Heimerdinger - 20% MS when near his turrets\n\n* Zoe - 10-70% MS just by using W or a summoner spell\n\n* Fiora - Between her low Q cooldown and 20-50% MS from her passive, she will almost always run faster than Master Yi when she's chasing him.\n\n* Rengar - 30-50% MS from Ferocity\n\n* Volibear - up to 60% MS next patch\n\n* Katarina - 50-90% MS from W, plus Shunpo resets\n\n* That new item for mages on the PBE that gives a burst of 50% MS\n\nEvery time you've buffed another champion's mobility, you've nerfed Master Yi significantly because he can't right-click them anymore.\n\nThe duration extension of Highlander that comes from kills/assists was increased from 4 to 7 with the Highlander nerf, but that just feels less balanced. After a good fight you'll often have Highlander continue long after everyone's dead, e.g. when you don't need it.\n\nJust keep this stuff in mind when you look at Highlander.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"chartry315","date":"2018-02-07T23:49:55.538+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am concerned about what you guys are doing to urgot.

Graves builds something like an assassin/carry, while Gnar's AD builds naturally flow well, and his tanky builds are supported by mini-Gnar's powerful third hit and MegaGnar's amazing teamfight presence. In short, they have fairly clearly defined build strengths (Graves is AD, Gnar is AD or tank, and has the tank form to capitalize on that).\n\nThresh/Urgot/Rakan are a little weirder, because they're in combat and in dangerous situations, but not throwing themselves into it often enough that they necessarily want a full tank build -- it feels almost wasted sometimes. Nor do they have the range to make attack-based builds truly work, nor do they have the burst to make hard AP/AD builds work (unlike Graves/Gnar, who can position for harass or have the hard engages that MegaGnar needs to feel good about being tanky). It gives them this weird middle ground where durability can feel underwhelming but offensive builds ALSO feel somewhat underwhelming, and you're left puzzled for what itemization can really support your character fantasy and team role. Especially since most AD/AP items are clearly designed for characters with superior harass and/or auto-attack synergy than these characters typically have.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2018-02-08T21:03:48.850+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally agree with this analysis, though I think it's a bit more complex than you're representing here.

It almost seems like a situation where the kits of those two would need to be adjusted, as most changes to those items that makes them appeal to that pair more will, naturally, make them appeal to Enchanters as well. It sort of makes me curious if bonus health scaling on their kits would help them fit more naturally into a slightly tankier \"just-behind-the-front-line\" role, which their itemization and their design seems well suited for.\n\nHm. Sorry, just thinking out loud here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2018-02-08T00:09:11.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think about Swain being able to heal up during Zhonia's?

I understand that he can be strong in the right hands and is gated by his weaker earlygame, and that is fine.

That would reward good Kayn players that know how to snowball and make smart choices early game, without buffing his overall general performance. See it as a QoL skill expression buff.\n\nOn an other note. Now that Zed and Talon get buffed (and Rengar somewhat too), isn't that a sign that maybe Lethality is on the weaker side? Pretty much almost all core users suffer a bit (Jhin even received a buff due to this already), aside from Kha but that might be because of a *bug*.","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2018-02-08T09:05:13.380+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd personally be fond of a UI change indicating exactly how many of each orb you have.

((To clarify, this is something I'd be interested in, not that it's something that'll happen).\n\nI don't think Lethality is --too weak-- but rather, if you're in an even game state, it's difficult to get onto squishy targets around the point fights begin to break out. AD Carries tend to spike a lot earlier than normal (1 item spike vs 2 item spikes) and, if they're ahead, it feels pretty bad playing an assassin into them. However, in my experience, if I'm able to snowball even a little, I can close out the game with the lead by punishing the enemy bottom lane. I've found this to be the case on Kha'Zix, Rengar, and Kayn.
