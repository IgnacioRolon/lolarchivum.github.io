Found a part where they said he was kinda balanced. Had some fun to refutate.\n\n“But Zenon, how is that fair? I just spent all my CC on this guy, we were about to kill him, and then suddenly General Gulp comes in and whisks him away!”\nWell yes, imaginary FAQ person, but let me tell you about a few things I added in to help balance things a little. First of all, as I mentioned, while Tahm Kench has this pretty swell devour ability, he lacks a lot of the traditional tools _**Except a stun of 1.5s every 6s without cdr **_ that tanks usually carry around. He can’t lock down enemies at will _**Except a stun of 1.5s every 6s without cdr **_ , for instance, and he has absolutely no utility AOE tools that your average punching bag brings to a fight_** Except a stun of 1.5s every 6s without cdr **_. Secondly, while eating an ally to keep them safe is super clutch, the ability does come with some baked in drawbacks. Its relatively short range means Tahm, who most of the time will be on a support budget and thus not the tankiest man in the game**_ Or maybe both because of his shield and crazy peel (it is like the broken version of braum) Oh and epic basic tankyness_**, will have to stand close to your team_**Because you were mean to use him not to peel ??? **_, or at least close to members of his team who you want to kill_** Because He is mean to have big kill potential with big damage even when he is support**_. So uh… you can just kill him if you focus him_** Or can you ? Killing the most tanky champ of the game 2x because of his shield. Thats how riot makes countermechanics**_. Lastly, if Tahm Kench does eat his ally, the ability’s minimum duration means you’ll still have a few precious seconds to leverage your temporary numbers advantage! _**Or maybe get destroyed because you can't kill the target you focused **_\n\n“Okay. Tell me about enemy devour.”\nAs a raw mechanic - taking enemies out of a fight and severely reducing their vision for a few seconds - enemy Devour is incredibly powerful, which forced us to consider the circumstances through which it would be okay to use, even for a few seconds_** Consider if he is okay is one thing, balancing is another ... **_. We knew that Tahm Kench couldn’t just go around eating enemy champs at will - that would be ridiculous - **_Then why did you make him do that ?!_**so we started figuring out ways to backload the ability, or establish x criteria that you need to meet before y can happen. For comparison, Malphite can ult into a teamfight at will because Unstoppable Force is a frontloaded ability - it has immediate impact and once it’s spent, he has to wait a long while before he can use it again._**Because it is nearly the only thing good about malphite ? And you make it way longer to use than Tahm Kench devourer **_ Because we had decided he would NOT bring the usual tank toolset of locking down an enemy**_You decided that ? That's why he can remove a champion for 6s ?_**, we couldn’t allow Tahm Kench the same flexibility, so ended up implementing passive stacks into his kit**_2 auto attacks, that's just enough_**. So, while Tahm Kench can eat enemy champions and take them out of a fight for a few seconds, he has to hit them with a few**_ (2) _** basic attacks (or licks) first. This takes time and proximity**_2 seconds if you have 1 attack speed per second. And you slow him to make sure he don't get too far. And you stun him if he want to get away without being killed_**, and telegraphs his intentions to the enemy team, giving them plenty of time to peel **_Peel ? Did you mean realize they will die_** for the River King’s target. _\n\n I find everything about him wrong. Oh yeah and never play 3v3 again, it's even clearer that he got way too much damage ( most of the games in nearly all my games) , tankyness ( more than shen who is mean to only be tanky) and lockdown ( Cmon 3 AA , no wait 2 because he licked you before.
