Riven is strong in Solo Q, but other champs are stronger.\n\nThese threads are lame.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-15T22:43:58.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason both of these champions are hated is because they are mega toxic.

Most mobile champs will. Even some less mobile champs will, like Garen. \n\nRiven's damage is only \"insane\" if she's ahead. If she's not ahead she's perfectly manageable. Riven is strong, but she's not even the best Solo Q top laner, and it's possible to put her behind and make her a liability to her team.\n\nYou can't do that to Wukong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-15T23:06:48.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she used it to engage, you are probably dead. Even if she gets in trouble, she just stuns you, starts running, and then her Q comes off it's stupid low CD and she gets away. \n\nEven if she falls behind early, she can still come back and become a force once she gets a couple items. \n\nI will agree that Wukong is pretty OP right now too.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Adanim","date":"2015-07-15T22:11:36.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand.
