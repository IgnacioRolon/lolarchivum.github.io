He does very good damage, if he just builds one damage item. He is extremely tanky, even without items, add in his ridiculously easy escapes and he is realistically one of the hardest champs in the game to kill. His jungle clears are fast and safe. His ganks are very good as well. Lee literally has no weakness at all in his gameplay currently. \n\nI'm sure people will immediately jump on the \"he falls off late\" bandwagon. The thing is, he really doesn't. By late they mean post 50 minutes, and even then he is still quite good from his utility alone. \n\nUPDATE: Still hearing only crickets from Riot when it comes to actual balance on Lee. \n\nThen there is the \"he's very hard to play at that level\" crowd. Yes, he is one of the hardest champs to master mechanically. However, he is so OP at this point that you don't even have to be good with him to carry at 90% of the ELOs. Just watch a Bronze player with 10 or more games on him and that argument goes straight out the window. \n\nFinally you will hear the \"he just got nerfed not too long ago\". They lowered the damage on his ult. This pretty much had zero effect on his gameplay. Not a single person plays Lee for his ult damage. It was once again a joke nerf from Riot that does nothing to effect the actual health of the champion. (Another great example would be the last \"nerf\" to Ahri). \n\nSo Riot, grow a set of balls and actually nerf Lee Sin. He is at a point where you could literally lower his damage 50% across all of his abilities and he would still be a viable champ.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2017-02-20T16:11:19.067+0000","up_votes":80,"down_votes":4,"body":"Lee Sin's greatest weakness is that he can only be picked once per team.\n\nElse we'd see pro teams with 2-3 Lees per side.
