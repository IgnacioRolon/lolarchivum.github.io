I have had this happen FOUR times in the last week alone. Every time it has been intentional as well. This happens even though I have said nothing in the chat.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy team bans, that&#039;s fine, they didn&#039;t know who you were going to pick. Having your own teammates troll you completely ruins the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2017-07-22T01:02:46.397+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) This is rich coming from one of the most ferverent (at least in the far past) Yasuo QQers.\n2) If the champion is FotM or popular and strong and you're not the first two picks, it is perfectly acceptable to ban a teammate's pick. Rather not have to face them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2017-07-22T01:09:30.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, I have complained about Yas for a LONG time and Riot finally woke up and realized I was right all along. That's why he's being reworked. Win me.\n\nSecond, if you are afraid of facing that champ, at least talk to the team about someone being able to first pick them before you just ban them outright. I own every champ in the game and I gladly pick champs for people on my team because I like to win games.\n\nThird, I just wanted to throw in that this happens in NORMALS. There is zero excuse for banning someone's champ in Norms, ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-07-22T03:43:41.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't get to dictate other people's game for them. If they don't want a xayah in their game, they can ban xayah. I don't care who wants to play it. The ban mechanic is seen as taking priority over the pick mechanic - there's always going to be a loser. However, considering Riot expects people not to be one-trick ponies, Riot considers the player's right to ban who they want more important than you getting your first pick of champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2017-07-24T17:58:55.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it's perfectly fine for them to dictate their game on you.
