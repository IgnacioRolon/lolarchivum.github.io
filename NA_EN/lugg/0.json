The fact you think the words are the same shows your extreme racism. Racism will not be tolerated, do you understand buddy? I know you're having a hard time accepting that you're wrong but that isn't my fault, buddy. I've reported you for your toxic, negative, and racist behavior. Please forgive me, because I've forgiven you, buddy.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-09-17T05:56:19.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the gall to come on here and say that after your racist rant that is the subject of this post?

The fact you don't understand the difference between the two words makes you racist, buddy. I'm sorry you can't deal with that but I'm here if you want to talk it out, buddy.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-09-17T16:50:57.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok then, I will give you a chance, explain to me the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"BigBlackBook","date":"2015-09-17T16:53:08.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lugg,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=q86AgTOs,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-17T16:50:57.513+0000)\n>\n> Ok then, I will give you a chance, explain to me the difference.\n\nHow are you going to give me a chance, buddy? You already outed yourself as racist, buddy. I'm the one that should be giving you the chance to explain yourself, buddy. Now, why exactly are you racist, buddy? I've already reported you for your racist and toxic behavior, buddy. However, I'll give you the chance to explain yourself before the ban comes, buddy.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-09-17T17:25:38.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you are either the densest person on the boards or just a piece of shit troll.
