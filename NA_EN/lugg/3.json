They clearly have issues that impact negatively on the playing experience such as;\nA broken kit that feels unfun to play against (Master yi, darius, yasuo)\nA kit that lacks counter play and enforce a feeling of uselessness on the receiving end (Annie, garen, fiora , caitlyn)\nAre in fact too strong (Swain, vlad, hec with new tri force)\nMake an entire class of champions obsolete (Vayne, some assassins, trundle)\nOr perhaps an individual simply can't be f*cked dealing with a certain champions kit. \n\nI for one hate dealing with irelia top, ahri mid, vayne adc, yi jungle and morgana support. They aren't necessarily OP, but I simply cbf dealing with their kits as I don't enjoy playing against them. \nEveryone has a champion that they despise facing and wish could be permabanned. It's the reason I play ranked, to ban vayne every game.\n\nIf I was riot, and say..... \"Swain, vlad, zed, fizz, kindred, ireli, ekko, malz, yas, azir\" were always banned. Clearly something is wrong with these champions that give players REASON to ban them with such consistency (Note these are the 10 most banned champions according to champion.gg). It's a clear sign, that something is wrong with their strength or game-play health that should be addressed asap.\nAnd even if they're banned every game, people still play norms, throw out a change and observe their performance in normals where they can't be banned out.\nPeople would quickly discover through stats and norms their new state. And if they were nerfed enough, that their ban is better utilised on a different champion, maybe a counter to their own champion or their team comp.\n\n\nTo add to the OP, all the way in pro play. Abolish this Team A vs Team a meta where it's about using the exact same thing as every other dam team, just better. Wouldn't it be great if every team had their own unique strats? team compositions? styles?\n\nBut no, suppose we want; Shen, trundle, irelia top/// Vik, zil, azir mid///Gragas, rek sai, graves, kindred,elise jungle///sivir, ashe, jhin, ez ADC///Bard, Braum, Trundle, Karma support \nHow entertaining, seeing the same dull, boring champions every single game.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-07-02T13:32:54.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My baby's being played in the LCS?\n\nShenpai?!?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-07-02T14:00:02.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That isn't a good thing.\n\nPersonal suggestion, put on a helmet.\nThere is a chance of hammers raining.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-07-02T14:20:53.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they nerf Shen, I quit.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingnewgameplus","date":"2016-07-02T14:43:07.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, melee is one of the most popular esports in the world and there's like 5 viable characters, so maybe riot thinks they're a cool new melee that your parents can't handle?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-07-02T15:23:55.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Yes, give 5 bans.
