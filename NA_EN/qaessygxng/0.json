Your chat bans are very inconsiderate and point blank stupid. EVERY game, people rage over anything and everything for the entire length of the game. cant stick up for yourself or you get banned. Ive got to mute everyone at the beginning of every match because god forbid you get killed once or twice and have to hear about it from 1-2 of these turds for 15 minutes. So whats the point of having a chat system? Pls explain. I dont play video games to give uplifting feels to people I dont care to talk to other than calling something out. I&#039;m not going to be like, &quot;hey, nice job Billy!&quot;. Games have filters for a reason. This word &quot;toxic&quot; is the most unbelievably immature word I&#039;ve ever heard. Kids that cant be around any type of name or anything talked about in a chat shouldnt be on the internet to begin with. \r\n\r\nALSO, the voting??! UNREAL. why do i have to waste 10-15 minutes of my life for 1 or 2 people on a team of people that do not want to play anymore. This alone leads to &quot;toxic&quot; behavior from the whole team and is beyond stupid. Majority rules &gt; 1-2 people.","replies":[]}
