Like im sitting at full bars with about 30-50 ms but for some reason Ever since the patch, whenever I click to move or auto there is a delay. The delay varies for how long it is but its always there. It feels like it isnt registering my clicks for a while. My ping is completely normal and its making the game not playable for me because it gets me killed.... A LOT. plz someone help me","replies":[{"poster":"ECE","date":"2017-06-11T00:41:57.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, you should test your ping before starting your game.

Essentially, when you click it's taking an abnormal amount of time for that click to go between your network and our servers. Take your most recent game logs and pop them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Take a screenshot and post it here using something like Gyazo and I'll be able to see for sure if the main issue is packet loss.","replies":[]}]}
