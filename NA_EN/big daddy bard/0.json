Take some time to look over your network settings using this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but do pay close attention to how you can setup port forwarding and flush your DNS.","replies":[{"poster":"BIG DADDY BARD","date":"2017-09-18T10:03:10.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brother can still log in fine, and we are both using Ethernet cables to connect, while on the same wifi, could a connection issue occur on only one computer?
