The inactivity warning you saw sounds like it was the warning you'd see with decay [[**see this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760#h3q1)], which being in the rank you're currently at you wouldn't have any decay at all. If this happens again, please grab a screenshot to send over here to me, but also try to submit a bug report as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mckayormacky","date":"2018-01-26T15:49:46.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happen to me also this morning, was in a 5 game series, on the last game to get gold.
