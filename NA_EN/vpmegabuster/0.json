It does sound like some kind of block happened, likely a connection issue that other lost sync or disconnected you from the champion select service.  For now I recommend going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and testing it in a custom game first.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"PTsunami","date":"2018-01-06T17:36:30.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't dodge, I selected a champ, I banned a champ then I got banned for 30 minutes.
