Meaning they can get punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or a bunch of games with mild / moderate. \n\nThink of it like the health meter in music games, when you miss a bunch of notes, the meter increases rapidly. If you just miss the notes occasionally,  the health meter won't increase that much. \n\nBefore entering that game, you probably already were at the edge of your toxicity meter, so it's easy for you to get punished. But where is the other dude in regards to his toxicity meter? Who knows, but certainly it wasn't close enough to get him punished in that game alone. \n\nIf he keeps up with that behavior, he'll get punished.
