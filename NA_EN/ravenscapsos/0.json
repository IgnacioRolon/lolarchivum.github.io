He doesn't care what he hits with q as long as it charges his knockup. And he doesn't care who he ults because he gets the bonus armor pen on everyone regardless of who was hit and he gets a shield refresh too. And who needs to time a windwall its pretty lenient given its duration and size(later on of course) and unlike braum it blocks the moves in its entirety. At least braum gets hurt when he blocks things.\n\nI know hes not popular and not doing the best now but hes not exactly a joy to play against unless you're a brusier/tank because your tanky enough to withstand a crit and don't rely on projectiles for him to block.\n\nFiora was just broken and its a shame it took riot so long to fix her even when she was a competitive pick/ban for some time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-04-19T00:31:23.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he doesn't has a line skillshot knockup of his own that affects EVERYONE it hits amirite? the way you lay this down make it sound like his Q should knockup only the first person it hits, that would be a good direction in order to put him in line with the description but even then, double crit...\n\nAs far as Fiora, true damage... seriously, no burst?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-04-18T23:55:24.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the problem lies in the fact that the description is pretty accurate in team fights and wildly off in 1v1s and a variety of fights involving usually 4 or less people in total.\n\nIn the mid game try stopping a Yasuo who's split pushing top and has a record like 3/2/2 by bringing just two players and you might get rolled hard by that Yasuo in just a couple seconds.

It does say they have extreme sustained damage. Think of it as the difference between Lux and Azir. A lategame Azir might still burst you down, especially if he slides on you, but overall his pattern is just very high sustained damage. vs lux who catches you and instagibs you.
