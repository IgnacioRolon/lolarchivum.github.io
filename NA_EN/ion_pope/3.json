My ms was around 90-100, pretty high number but thats how it is all the time and usually the game runs smoothly. My fps was affected though, from 80-90 at down to 45, but that shouldnt be a problem here, its pretty playable at that number. More exactly the issue is the game delay, like...i right click to buy an item and nothing happens until 3 sec or until i press again or after few rage clicks, or clicking to move the champion the same way, and in general moving everywhere with high delay....","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T03:37:18.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right in thinking that this isn't really an fps or ping issue exactly, but this does seem to be a specific type of network-based issue. Packet Loss can cause things like stutters or delayed actions or movements as well. It'd be good to check first before jumping to conclusions though, so be sure to run a traceroute to our EUNE servers at 31.186.224.42 to see how your connection is looking on it's way to our servers. Be sure to post those results here so I can take a look as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-28T17:21:10.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played all my games for the last about 8 years with 120-200 ping, with 180 being the current average.

Thats why i said its not the fps.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-28T17:29:10.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds more like packet loss if your ping isn't spiking higher than 90-100 like you're saying, and yes, I've had that issue.
