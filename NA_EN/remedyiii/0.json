Champions like Nautilus or Evelynn that struggle to complete that first clear would benefit more from the leash on the buff. \n\nIf you don't play champions that have that problem, as taking 4 camps would suggest you don't, you may as well just start the smaller camp. It takes less time to get down so your leashers can get to lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"L7xLoTek","date":"2015-03-07T07:45:09.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you start from Krugs/Gromp with an instant smite, you'll get the stunning/poison buff, which lasts the entire clear against all those jungle mobs, which will save you health, enabling quite a few junglers to even gank without going back to base first. My personal favorite is the (Smite)Gromp-Blue-Wolves-Red(Smite)-Gank combo. Mind you, I don't play Lee Sin, so it might not apply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-08T02:10:38.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only real issue I see would be your blue start. Why not start frog to help clear blue a bit faster? This would also let you go Frog>Blue>Red>Gank or continue farming on almost any champion. Okay atleast the ones I have played a fair amount. Red start is fine as long as you don't chug an HP pot while clearing red. Also typically that start for red is used for a level 2 gank on a lane. In reality any route will work, it just comes down to what you intend to do. If you plan on power farming blue early is more beneficial as it offers more CDR, letting you farm better. If you are an early game Jg (j4, Lee Sin, Rek'Sai for example) red is a more key buff for the slow and bit of true damage in ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2015-03-07T15:20:10.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, you should be ganking sometime before you recall. It's a waste of the buffs, especially red since it gives so much ganking power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-03-07T14:20:33.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The theory, is that starting either Gromp or Krugs with smite gets you a buff which helps you clear better/faster and nets you lvl 2 in the process, giving you many tools for clearing your first buff by yourself, whereas starting the buff first gives you less benefits overall, and generally are more important to have when you gank. \n\nSo ideally, you go gromp/krugs->buff#1->wolves/Razors->buff#2->gank\n\nThe gromp buff gives you a lot faster clears, whereas the Krugs buff gives you a good deal safer clears because of all the stuns.\n\nYour clear pattern after the start can be quite variable though, and in general I think there's a lot of flexibility to your options, even more so when they nerf some of the damage next patch (in particular the razors are getting hit pretty good).","replies":[]}]}
