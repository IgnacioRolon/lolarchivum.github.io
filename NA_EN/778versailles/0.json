I've always been wondering about this, because if I buy a 1820 RP skin plus a 250 RP icon and I still don't get the border, isn't buying the skin kind of a rip off? Like there is nothing special I actually recently got the Project Yi skin just for the cool border and now I don't see it, it's not interesting to me, I also have Project Yasuo skin, but he also does not have the border.\r\n\r\nAnd I also have the same question for Elementalist Lux, why do some people have the border and some don't. If people don't even get a simple border for paying 3000 RP, I really think RIOT is just ripping off the players. Because the border of Elementalist Lux does not look as good as the project ones. \r\n\r\nThanks, I hope I can get the borders some how if not, I will probably leave it be, or hope RIOT does something about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-28T00:00:40.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having both a project skin and their icon on an account won't unlock a special border.
