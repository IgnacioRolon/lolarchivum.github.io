I can reboot my comp and get back into the game and play everything out like nothing happened however I miss the first 3-4 minutes of the game depending on how long the reboot takes. it gives me the WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR message when it crashes. I can play Smite fine and other games like Terraria, Minecraft, wow and actually playing league has no Issues it's just the champ select and it crashes my computer every single time.
