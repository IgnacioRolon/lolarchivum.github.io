I would get the connection error that says:\r\n\r\n\"Connection Failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server. \r\n\r\nInformation regarding what may have caused this error can be found here. \r\n\r\nService availability can be viewed on the League of Legends Server Status web page.\"\r\n\r\nI have tried everything possible to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI repaired my client. Uninstalled and re-installed League. Tried logging into an account on another region. Flushed my DNS and every other solution given from Riot on their support pages and I cannot log in. \r\n\r\nAny help would be highly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-01T20:37:17.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of potential causes for the login issues you've been experiencing, but the guides that *Rineyy* linked are a good place to start in troubleshooting this.
