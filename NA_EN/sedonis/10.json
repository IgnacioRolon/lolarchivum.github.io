Her damage is actually almost on par with any ADC. She soul bound to the top maokai.

Champs like corki and lucian can do this but they have CDs that are longer than my Pillar of Flame CD... The fact that she was able to dodge that and every skill shot I tried at her with relative ease does not mean that she is screwed when her partner shows up. Her partner only makes her more OP. Zed, Fizz, Syndra, Brand, Ahri, and any other skill shot champion that is mid that is not melee will fall before her unless the kalista player is stupid.. I say fizz in this list because of his troll poll as a super gap closer and a considerate damage dealer... You cant get close enough with a non melee champ to kill her.. Kalista is now the Queen of mid lane and no one if the opponent is an equal skill level will be able to stop her. You would have to camp her mid lane with a heavy CC and gap closing jungle in hopes of killing her early.. Now with that being said I have not seen her top but I am pretty sure she can do the same thing top. Looks like Teemo Top,Mid and Bot is now required.. If they ban teemo then jax might even have to go mid and if they ban those two well GG whatever lane(Mid or Top) kalista goes in will be screwed. \n\n\n TLDR?

You're calling me biased an bad because I disagree with Kalista's overloaded kit?  I had to Google logical fallacies just because I'm sure that the few I know didn't cover all the fallacies you just committed.  But I'll just leave it at Ad Hominem and Tu Quoque.  To humor your [bad} argument, I'll run down all the champs you discussed.\n\n{{champion:84}} I somewhat agree with Akali being able to do this, but 1, Akali doesn't go bot lane, and 2 fighting toxic with toxic isn't a good solution.\n\n{{champion:12}} probably the strongest contender for actually being able to lock Kalista down, but it requires airtight mechanics and good positioning.  Also at earlier levels, Alistar can easily be chunked.  If he misjudges Kalista's health, he gets no escapes and is guaranteed to die.\n\n{{champion:32}} Amumu's initiation requires him to land his Q.  Since Kalista gets a no cost and no cooldown dash each time she lands an AA, hitting his Q is easier said than done.  If he misses, he has no escapes and Kalista will kite him to death.\n\n{{champion:9}} Fiddlesticks has no initiation outside of his ultimate, which also has a huge channel time.  He will never get in range to successfully land his fear.  He will get kited to death.\n\n{{champion:114}} I agree with Fiora as well, but only when Kalista is top lane.  Since Kalista is an ADC, and will be thus played bot lane, Fiora won't be able to mitigate her toxic gameplay.  Also, like I said before fighting toxic with toxic doesn't solve toxicity.\n\n{{champion:3}} Galio has his E, but dashes>>>>high movespeed.  His ultimate is the only thing that can lock Kalista down, but she'll be able to safely dash back from its range, and kite him to death.\n\n{{champion:89}} It's pretty damn easy to miss a skillshot when you can double back effortlessly.  In fact, Kalista I'd say is Leona's hardest counerpick in terms of ADCs.\n\n{{champion:127}} Lissandra's E has a huge tell on it, and takes forever to move to position.  Also, not played bot lane.  Her ultimate is an on click stun, which is what you need to truly lock her down, but it's an ultimate, and her dash has no cooldown.  0 seconds >>>> 2 minutes.\n\n{{champion:117}} Skillshot slows <<<< free dash.  Lulu gets a little more leeway because Help Pix! allows her to reposition her Glitterlance better, but Kallista's dash is free and no cooldown, so even if it does hit, she can dash away effortlessly.  Lulu I'd say can probably go even with Kalista, but it's still quite heavily favoring Kalista.\n\n{{champion:54}} Even with his movespeed stealing on hit Q, dashes>>>slows.  Kalista will most likely be able to safely escape Malphite.  He won't be kited to death, but he can't kill her.  His ult can lock her down, but again 0 sec >>>> 2 minutes.\n\n{{champion:57}} A good counter, yes, but unless going Maokai support, will not help bot lane.\n\n{{champion:11}} Pre 6 Kalista can safely disengage.  Post 6, maybe.  A strong contender, but also fighting toxic with toxic.\n\n{{champion:75}} Once again, dash>>> slow.   The attack speed slow will hurt a bit as well, but Kalista will still be able to safely kite away from Nasus.  Also, Nasus doesn't go bot lane.\n\n{{champion:111}} Very easy to miss the anchor with a free dash.  Can use terrain, but most likely won't be able to keep up with her.  Ultimate yes, but 0 sec >>> 2 minutes.\n\n{{champion:80}} Even with Panth's incredible movespeed, a good Kalista will keep distance and kite back.  A stronger champion counterpick, but also Pantheon doesn't go bot lane.  I'd say this actually favors Pantheon though, but not going to help since she doesn't go top.\n\n{{champion:78}} Doesn't have enough movespeed.  Don't really need to go into more since Poopy is getting reworked anyways.\n\n{{champion:33}} Another good contender but requires camping bot lane.  If he fails to kill her after he taunts, she'll safely kite away from him.\n\n{{champion:58}} Even if Kalista went top lane, Renekton will land one dash and she'll kite away do to her double back potential.  Also, not played bot lane.\n\n{{champion:107}} Requires brush camping, afterwards she'll kite away if he doesn't kill her.  Isn't played bot lane, and requires camping if jungling.\n\n\n{{champion:92}} Really?  Unless she's got a shield momentum going, she's going to get outsustained and poked to death. \n\n{{champion:98}} Can easily dodge taunt when played as a support.  No scaling magic resist per level means he's going to get chunked.\n\n{{champion:27}} Requires ulting.  Will get kited without it.  Never played bot lane.\n\n{{champion:72}} Can engage with awesome movespeed, but without ultimate or passive will most likely be unable to kill her.\n\n{{champion:37}} I don't know what you were thinking.\n\n{{champion:23}} Dash>>>slows, he'll get one hit on her and then she'll kite away.  If he ults, she'll use rend to slow him.  Also an attempt to counter toxic with toxic.\n\n{{champion:6}} Will miss all pokes unless he lands E, then she'll kite away.  Will never land ultimate.\n\n{{champion:45}} Can actually escape the range of rage cage.  doesn't even have to sit in the center, she'll dash outside of it.\n****\nSo far none of the examples you have given addresses the core issue of her getting free dashes on a successful AA.

No, you probably won't land a bubble on her unless she's dense, but that doesn't really matter.\n\n{{champion:43}} - RE into W gets you an engage any time you want it.

It's a very strong passive for sure, but it comes with some significant weaknesses: \n\n1. It limits her early game farming by sticking her with a terrible AA animation early game. You can somewhat make up for this by using Rend to last hit, but if you do that you're burning a lot of mana. \n\n2. AAs do nothing if you lose vision, so you can be brush/stealth juked. For example, a Kha'zix could use his ult strategically to deny Kalista the ability to DPS him or dash away from him. \n\n3. Her dashes are amazing, sure, but they aren't all that useful once you actually get in melee range of her (which is not as difficult as people seem to think). If someone with CC gets to Kalista she's gonna have to use 2 autoattacks to get out of range. If she gets CCed somewhere in there she's pretty fucked. Essentially, her dashes are at their best kiting around the edge of the fight and going in and out of range; they are not very helpful once someone actually reaches you due to the long autoattack animation. \n\nIf anything, the things that are worth complaining about are:\n\n-%HP proc with a Soul Bound attack needs to be physical damage and have a melee/ranged split. 12% may be balanced for someone like Galio who has to walk all the way in to proc it (requiring much more coordination), but it's pretty stupid when you have, say, Janna proccing it. \n\n-E needs to be capped against minions, ideally a cap that forces her to compete with Smite. At the moment, if Kalista is there for Baron/Dragon on the team who first starts it, it's pretty much impossible to contest with a smite steal/global/Cho'Gath ult because mid/late game Kalista with E maxed can easily deal 2000+ damage with an E on Dragon or Baron.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sicarius Æternum","date":"2014-12-18T01:43:35.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldDiamond1317,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n01OJRnB,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-11-21T03:19:46.495+0000)\n>\n> Really. Are you guys having a bullshit competition at riot to make the most bullshit champion ever? An adc that can dash every autoattack and Q? Really? Really? What the actual fuck Rito. Please nerf it to like every 3-5 attacks or every other attack  and nerf her ratios and how long she can hold a champion. Because holy fucking molly I cant do anything she counters literally every adc I know Ezreal, skill shot dodge. Jinx skill shot dodge. Lucian every ability dodge. Cait almost every ability dodge.

Nerf\n\nShe is not OP as you think, but she is very good and you need to accept that because she is 6300. 6300IPChamps=GOOD. Anyways, she is good because of her passive, yes. But complaining about her Q is stupid. Just plain stupid. Jinx's Q is multiple times better, and has a slow. Kalista's Q does damage and applies something that can be activated later to do about 100 dmg. + She is super easy to counter WITHOUT skill shots.  All you need is a stun or a snare, and she is screwed. Can't think of a champ that doesn't have skill shot stun? Try {{champion:44}} . The only reason you think she is op is because you can't land a skill shot, and you play {{champion:81}} and he is, Guess what? All skill shots. Why do you even complain about that? You know you can't land skill shots for heck, just use AoE or selecting a target!

I mentioned I was diamond to illustrate the point that i know what the fk I'm talking about gameplay wise In practice (Didn't even check your elo you could have been master for all I cared). I respect lower elos opinions however I do not respect things that are simplly just **wrong**. Kalista is fine and seeing as how it has not been even a week since she has been released those who do not put the effort into learning how to play always whine. \n\nNote that {{champion:122}} {{champion:143}} (Not even a complete CertainlyT champion. Morello and Coronach helped too if you cared to do your research){{champion:157}} {{champion:412}} all kept their mechanics that made them unique (which most of the whiners want taken away from kalista). They just received number changes.\n\nAlso if ya wanna list certainlyT champions:\n\n{{champion:238}} {{champion:157}}  Were actually deemed trash on release.

The Darius rework is low priority(They have stated this if you actually care to look things up). Very low as in probably not gonna happen like the fiora rework. Hell it probably wont happen anytime soon like the ww rework that was announced over a year ago and that was way higher in priority. Now what is realistically slated for rework is poppy for all you know darius will not be reworked for 1-2 years.
