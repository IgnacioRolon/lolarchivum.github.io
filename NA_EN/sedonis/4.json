The Harrowing was just as bad.  There was nothing to do other than buy Riot's skins and read the lore that most of the community probably just skimmed over, me included. They seem to have just built a massive wall between the community and what everyone wants. They even tried to claim that events in RuneTerra come at random times in the year. And this year we don't even have ONE gamemode to play. All we get is some skins... an icon, and some minions. Last year we had URF, skins that were actually good, the URF Invitational, and some other things. \n\n\nThe events are slowly having less work put in to them. All we want this \"Holiday\" is at least one event to play Riot... I'm disappointed to say the least. If Acension does release tomorrow. Then I will be very happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-01T17:06:25.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you happen to miss the multi part story that introduced a new champion during Harrowing?\n\nAnd the casters are doing a special event today as well","replies":[{"poster":"Sedonis","date":"2016-04-01T17:09:20.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my bad, didn't notice. And honestly, half the community doesn't really care about lore or stories. Ill edit the stream part out though.

I can't remember.  Then there was the Bilgewater Event.  That and it's barely past noon CST, and there are a lot of tweets from Riot casters and analysts (Sjokz in particular) saying that we haven't even gotten to the surprise for today yet.  The day isn't even over and people are just complaining on the boards before the day is even out.\n\nIt really seems like people are waking up on Easter Morning and crabby that there are no hidden treats in their bed or immediate vicinity that can be reached without movement.","replies":[]}]}
