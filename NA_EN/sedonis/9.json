Don&#039;t quote me on this but I&#039;m pretty sure the proc of brittle activated the last tick of braum passive to get me the kill. I just thought it was interesting how the kill went to me rather than other people on the team. This is something that I have never seen on league before.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-03-18T04:47:41.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sedonis,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VMdqBnsf,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-03-17T22:21:29.389+0000)\n> \n>  I&amp;#039;m pretty sure the proc of brittle activated the last tick of braum passive to get me the kill. \n\nYou said that backwards The last tick of braum passive acrivated brittle.
