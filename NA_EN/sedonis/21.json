Once you lost the lead, you can't even stay in bot lane.\nHooker champions still ok to play against but ones with heavy poking abilities really so disgusting like they don't lose anything for their missed abilities due very low cd and mana consume yet they does way too much damage even ccs you to death.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sedonis","date":"2019-11-22T22:21:27.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea I was playing supp, we destroyed our lane but that didn't matter in the grand scheme of things as the top lane was extremely far ahead in levels and gold.

There was a darius top who was out rotating and quite frankly, doing the darius thnig were he dunks the whole team repeatedly. We destroyed lane but that did not matter in the grand scheme of things as the rest of the players in the game were 4-5  levels ahead at the time as well as a full item or even 2.
