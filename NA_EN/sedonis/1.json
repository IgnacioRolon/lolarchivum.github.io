The only thing that appears is an X at the top right. I've had this multiple times today alone, the only way that has worked to fix this is to completely restart league. This is awful because I get screwed over in champ select and have to select runes that are not made for that champion. My friends have also had this bug and have lost games due to not being able to change runes.","replies":[{"poster":"killz0n","date":"2019-11-30T11:03:49.804+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bug is back.

(my account is around lvl 92 at time of this post)\n\nMuch Love & would appreciate advice, current suspicions hint at 'package-loss-esque' things that i also experience upon client startup. However, noticed today that the \" client > collection > runes \" menu didn't load before i entered a game today, other menus did. Does this mean that sometimes, perhaps whilst some menus are being fixed/edited/updated, the package-loss or [whichever] connectivity issue, becomes a bigger issue dependant on that time?\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CattyKit","date":"2017-11-19T15:35:27.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"HZB","date":"2017-11-17T00:45:14.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
