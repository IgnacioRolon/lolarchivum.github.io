So I have 6 pages for champs I play regularly and then I have 3 pages that I just have sitting at the end so I can fill them in and edit them whenever I need. Ezreal is my first page and the last 3 are the fill ones.\r\n\r\nAnyway, now to the main point. When I want to change up my runes, I edit the ones I have set as fill as said above. When I edit the runes in champ select and press save, shouldn&#039;t it set that as the rune page I want to use? I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me but I have had many problems like this where if I look in the rune section before a game I have 2 check marks next to the runes I used last game and the one I just edited and saved. This has screwed me over a few times where I end up having klepto Warwick jungle compared to the page I just saved and thought it selected. I have no idea if this is a bug or a feature, either way it&#039;s hard to get around. I have to make sure to double or even triple check to make sure I use the runes I just changed.","replies":[]}
