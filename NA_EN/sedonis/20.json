If you don&#039;t want to hear my thoughts and opinions on the system, this thread isn&#039;t for you.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the Essence Emporium just doesn&#039;t feel all that impressive. Sure, we have icons and ward skins, but if you are like me you only use one ward skin and only occasionally change icons  because you have the ones that you want. So that crosses off the ward skins for me... Next we have the icons. I personally bought all the icons because I simply had nothing else to spend my BE on that really interested me. This left me at 2k essence. So... what now? I still have a few champions to buy with BE but how am I supposed to get enough BE to even pay for them? I played ALL day yesterday, leveled up once and halfway through level 31, and got around 800 essence. Now BE seems like it is incredibly tedious to get compared to IP where you could grind out 2k in a day if you wanted to with IP boosts and stuff like that. There have been MANY threads that have addressed this, so I won&#039;t go into detail. \r\n\r\nInstead take a look at these threads if you want to read into BE problems:\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IiE9T0GY-it-is-going-to-take-forever-to-unlock-6300-champs-now-roughly-every-150-games-played\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/E2ldsxJV-champion-capsules-are-utter-trash\r\n\r\nNow that i&#039;ve bashed the system a little, let me give the things I DO like about the new system. I like the idea of everything being bought with BE, but again it just takes WAAAAY too long and doesn&#039;t seem worth it... I like the level cap not being a thing, but there is not nearly enough XP being given out to make the rewards from leveling up seem worth the grind. \r\nAssume you get 80IP average in the old system, and in the video they said that it takes around 15 games to level up. \r\nThat&#039;s 1200 IP (EXTREMELY rough math)\r\nNow take the new system, where those 15 games go into leveling up in a tediously long process only to be rewarded with 800 BE, which after inflation... is nothing. A whole day of grinding to not even be able to purchase a 1350 champion. Whereas with IP, you could buy a 1350 champion in one day if you really wanted to.\r\n\r\nI want to hear your thoughts on this... I understand if my thread gets bashed. I just wanted to present my opinions and thoughts on the matter.","replies":[]}
