The missions that you get as a new player is also a decent way of getting new champions. If the capsules are the only source of BE, then why not just buff them a tiny bit so new players have the chance to get new champions and BE? I always get disappointed when I work super hard to grind out missions for key fragments, make a key, unlock a chest, and just get an utter garbage champion shard for someone I already have tier 7 on, or already own as a champion. I would literally take anything else I got out of the hextech chest. It just feels awful when you are expecting, at the very least, a ward skin or emote.","replies":[{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2019-02-10T17:43:08.634+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel mildly annoyed, especially since I have 33k BE already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeeWeeBojangles","date":"2019-02-10T19:54:00.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks to wait a week to open a chest just to get a champion shard. I own every champion already and just have a bunch of shard that i'm to lazy to dust. It really is annoying. Especially because you can spend money on chests and keys and still get champion shards in them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-10T19:49:39.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, you know, let us exchange BE for something and this problem is not a problem anymore xD\ngood things to spend be on, without much profit lost to riot and ofc no gameplay advantage \n* Single-Use Finishers\n* Single-use cosmetics (could be tower, skin, poro pet whatever)\n* Aram/Arurf rerolls (with a max per game ofc)\n* XP-boosts (can be single use or for set amount of time)\n* masterwork chests (for upwards of 10k-20K BE or something)","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-02-10T17:31:45.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hexichest belong to premium only things like wards/skins/gemstones/emotes (things that cost RP) personally. anything else is a abomination.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JOOTAROOO","date":"2019-02-10T20:39:48.462+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahahaha but obviously Riot games aint gonna read this problem cuz even if u get a skin you can get a shitty one","replies":[]}]}
