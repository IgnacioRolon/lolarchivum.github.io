Everyone is asking about solo queue and the best response we have gotten is it \"may not come back.\" There are multiple threads and Riot doesn't really want to keep people informed. They have also claimed it will be a couple weeks... then more weeks... then a month passed and nothing really happened. They seem to be off on their little island thinking they know how everyone thinks. Frankly, most people don't like dynamic queue, me included. I just want solo queue rather than be paired with quad queues. \n\nThere also seems to be an uprising of splash art things. Riot also seems as though they don't care to comment on those either. The community just wants to hear Riot's thoughts. I want to know where everything stands, I don't care if it's bad news or not. I just want to know what is going on. At least so I think because I can't speak for the whole community. I just want to know what's going through Riot's mind.","replies":[]}
