Now when I try to play it says that it can&#039;t patch and asks me to restart. Help? I just lost my team a game I think because I can&#039;t get into a game because of these bugs.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-01-18T06:00:53.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Refer to tasks #3 & 4 in the [Bug & Crash Exterminator.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) Kha’Zix and Elise won’t know what hit ‘em.\n\nIf you experience issues after performing these steps, please let us know. \n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/khazix_deathblossom_splash_1920x1080.jpg?itok=re5tY9ln https://static.lolwallpapers.net/2014/12/Death-Blossom-Elise.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Sedonis","date":"2017-01-18T21:52:33.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing on there worked, I ended up having to uninstall and reinstall.
