I play URF because I want to escape regular league and have mindless fun but out of the 18 games I played, I really only had fun with like... 3 or 4 of them. To put it as blunt as possible, playing against \r\n{{champion:126}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:103}}{{champion:9}}     \r\nevery game just ruins this game mode for me. Especially after draft URF came back. The pick ban system allows for me and my friends to play what we want, and take out champions that have an extra ability, the ability to drain the fun out of any and every game. It really makes me wonder why they opted for ARURF instead of draft URF. I just want to play what I want to play rather than what I think will do well...\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Void2258","date":"2020-01-19T21:11:40.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree. Certain characters are too good with low cooldowns and certain characters are hurt by other's not having cds (for example Xerath, Jax, Panth, etc. who have skills with a duration built in that can't spam). League is balanced for cooldowns and not having them throws everything to one extreme or the other.","replies":[]}]}
