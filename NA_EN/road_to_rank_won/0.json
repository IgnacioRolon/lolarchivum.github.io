Unfortunately, it's quite literally impossible for your Sonas to play any different than what you describe.  Her damage is crap, she dies to 2 autos early game &amp; 1 auto at mid or later.  She **MUST** save ult for herself, because without that or Flash, she's an immobile pinata.\n\nUnfortunately, she can't \"harass from a distance,\" because almost all of her damage is 550-units.  Her passive is an auto-modifier, her Q's cast has a \"champion priority\" range equal to her basic attack range &amp; her Q's shit-bubble is also an auto-modifier.  She quite literally **MUST** be in range of counter-harass to interact with the enemy.  Which like I said, means she will die if they're allowed to auto her just twice.\n\nBefore the recent \"buff,\" she was the least-played support in the entire fucking game for very good reason.  Character is genuinely useless.  Playing Sona is like playing a fucking caster minion.  Furthermore, the NERF this patch was because 1 Youtuber played Sona.  Her pickrate beyond that lone player was still nigh-nonexistent.  Rito literally nerfed Sona because **ONE PLAYER** was \"playing\" Sona.  According to Meddler &amp; Rito, Sona isn't allowed to have even 1 \"dedicated\" player.  That is the depth of Meddler's &amp; Rito's hatred of Sona as a character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Highwiseene","date":"2020-02-07T03:38:29.245+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"To all players who criticize people on their team below rank 1:\n\nFocus on your own play.

This player seemed like they wanted to not risk much while not giving much support to the team. Mobi boots are questionable since she never roamed to other lanes to try to gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Road to Rank Won","date":"2020-02-07T03:44:15.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Ah salty sona mains,  and yeah i'm literally on a smurf playing my best champ and i'm 1v2 in lane, the fuck you mean focus on my own game. botlane is a 2v1 lane with sona players.","replies":[]}]}
