During the game, everything on the screen froze except for the cursor.  I was unable to Alt-Tab out of the game or Ctrl-Alt-Delete to bring up the Task Manager.  The Task Manager did launch, but when I tried to Alt-Tab and select it the screen stayed on the frozen game.  I had to force League to close by signing out of my computer user account, then sign back in to my computer and League accounts and re-load into the game.  \r\n\r\nHere are some of my computer's specs:\r\n   Machine name: DESKTOP-UHO514Q\r\n         Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 16299) (16299.rs3_release.170928-1534)\r\n                 Language: English (Regional Setting: English)\r\n      System Manufacturer: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.\r\n             System Model: G752VL\r\n                     BIOS: G752VL.208\r\n                Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz (8 CPUs), ~2.6GHz\r\n                   Memory: 12288MB RAM\r\n      Available OS Memory: 12226MB RAM\r\n                Page File: 4970MB used, 12120MB available\r\n              Windows Dir: C:\\WINDOWS\r\n          DirectX Version: DirectX 12\r\n      DX Setup Parameters: Not found\r\n         User DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)\r\n       System DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)\r\n          DWM DPI Scaling: Disabled\r\n                 Miracast: Available, with HDCP\r\nMicrosoft Graphics Hybrid: Not Supported","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T01:24:27.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm it really sounds like something is causing League to hard lock-up with the only option being to force close it. I'd try running a quick repair first to make sure it's not the game files causing the problem, then I'd consider trying a clean boot to see if background programs might be causing the freezes.","replies":[{"poster":"KBingo","date":"2018-01-11T01:46:54.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm doing a full client repair now.  I believe I've run a repair in the past.  This happens once in about 20-40 games.
