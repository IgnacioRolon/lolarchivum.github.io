Immortals is a really good organization in taking care of it's players and is even trying to get them coaching experience for after their player careers are over. That combined with the fact that they came extremely close is a pretty good reason to stay imo. The only one who's openly said they're testing the waters to see what they can get is Huni (he's thinking about joining an LCK team apparently, but is open to anything). Coaching staff probably won't leave either since compared to other teams, Immortals looks like they'll have some strong players next season. Overall, most of the people on Immortals really shouldn't want to leave unless they're just looking for a cash grab or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2016-09-10T18:06:49.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i honestly think They could get by with either a better coach who is more suited to managing such a team, or just let them play another split as is and see if continuity works for them. They may have missed worlds, but they were the third best team two splits in a row so they're definitely not bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-09-09T22:48:23.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, I'm thinking that either all of them will leave (forcing IMT to get an entirely new team kinda like what TSM did last year) or none of them will leave. While they could theoretically stay together/pull a \"peyton manning\" (tons of regular season success with minimal playoff success), you have to think that their lack of results in the playoffs combined with all the potentially amazing offers they have (huni/reignover either back to fnatic, or joining SKT and giving them an actual top laner/consistent jg) would make this deal too hard to pass up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-09-09T22:42:23.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure that each player's goal is to win worlds or at least the region. So it really depends if they think they have a better shot at doing that on a different team.\n\nI can't say for sure what any of them are thinking but or the only 2 that seem like they could have a better shot at worlds on a different team would be Huni and Reinover. They aren't likely to find a better place in NA to get to worlds but they might be able to transfer to a different region and do that.\n\nThe other 3 likely wouldn't be signed anywhere out of NA so unless Huni and Reinover leave, I think they will stay. But it is really tough to say because we don't know what they are thinking.\n\nAlso, it doesn't seem that the Immortals organization has any incentive to go out and look for better players because they already have a really solid team. They just need to get them performing at playoffs.","replies":[]}]}
