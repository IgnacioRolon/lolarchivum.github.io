Confirmation Lag & Other Issues","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem is as follows:\r\n\r\nWhenever I would select a queue to join in, whether it's Classic, ARAM, or the Weekend Game modes, it would progress normally. The timer would tick upwards to the estimate and... keep going. Then after a while a message box appears saying that I have been removed from the queue due to failure to accept the match. Sometimes it shows the match accept box, but it only appears for a second before it gives me the failed attempt prompt.\r\n\r\nI repaired the client and it still didn't resolve my issue. I tried a clean install, and here where it gets wonky because whenever I launched the client after the install, it gave me the BSOD: Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap. After a while, I couldn't get it to even patch, but after a few random tries, it ended up patching successfully... but the problem persists. Help!\r\n\r\nI don't even know where to begin to troubleshoot it!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T17:13:16.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it sounds like your client is not establishing a clear and stable connection to the PvP.net service, which could be causing your inability to accept queues and your long queue times.
