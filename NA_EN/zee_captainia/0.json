However, I've heard people can, and have, been banned for changing the announcers voice either directly through the files or using a third party program such as lvoc. What I would like to know is - Does changing the announcers voice violate League's Terms of Service? And if I were to do it using a third party program, would it warrant a ban on my account?\r\n\r\nPlease help {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T16:59:54.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Third party programs and modifications are not something we support, and doing so is at your own risk.  My word of caution is that one can never be sure of what other content might be hiding somewhere in there.  We also wouldn't be able to offer support if something were to go wrong.  Our stance on this is also available in a recently created [article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848).  I hope that helps shed some light!","replies":[{"poster":"Zee Captainia","date":"2016-08-31T23:29:24.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks for the help! But I have one more question, (sorry), so using third party programs is a do at your own risk deal. Even if the application gave me no measurable advantage in the game, since it is just a different announcer pack, is there still a chance I could be punished in some way for using a third party program?
