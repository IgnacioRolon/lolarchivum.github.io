As a Xerath main, it's not simply just a feeling tactic to help lead the skillshot, but against faster targets or in the case you decided to quickly change your target you can no longer do that. It doesn't register the quick movement and leads to some really way way off shots.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PepsiDrinker","date":"2015-04-14T21:32:41.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}} {{summoner:30}} rito plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Rinkana","date":"2015-04-14T20:28:13.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is also an instance where your q (while charging) just randomly cancels itself.
