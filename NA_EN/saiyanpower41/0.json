If you are playing on our EUW server then your friend will need to be on that region as well to add and play with you.  Your friend can use the [League Signup](https://signup.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/) page and select the server you're on to make an account and play with you.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
