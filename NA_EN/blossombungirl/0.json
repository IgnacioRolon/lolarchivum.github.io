This player made threats to my life and used every diss he could think of to get me tilted. Including toxic comments about Americans and dying in ww3, accusing all Americans of being drug addicts, all Americans being fat, all Americans being dumb, hoping China drops a bomb on me, etc. I wasn't nice to the troll but i could have responded way worse.

I consider it a video game... a time killer. Not a sport in my opinion, but I know what youre saying, some do consider it a sport. But just because its a sport, doesnt mean that it has to follow a status quo. Like, should it allow everything other sports allow just because its categorized as a sport? The sport concept as a reason to be more lax on the rules makes no sense to me. Like, this isnt football, soccer, or bowling. So whats the point of comparing?\n\n If you think the rules are too strict, thats fine, I dont disagree. Just give reasons... not \"its a sport, other sports allow smack talk so why not this one?\" Thats not a good reason. America is a country, should america do everything other countries do just because its a country? I think not. Again, I dont disagree, I just think the reasoning is flawed lol.\n\nSo, why do you think the rules should be more insensitive, other than because its supposed to be a sport?

I disagree but your opinion is just as valid as anyone's. I would say no category of people deserve special protection here, so slurs and encouragements of suicide should hold the same weight as any other insult. Its meant to hurt your feelings just like any other insult. Some people are more offended by being called a dog than being called a racial slur, so it should all be treated equally in my opinion. You cant make up for the past by banning words, so dont give me the whole history of oppression shit.
