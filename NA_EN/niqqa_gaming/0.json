I know this can feel bad at first, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're in a bad spot. Keep in the ladder shifts down with new seasons to help show your progress overall as you climb the ladder throughout the reason. \n\nWith all of that out of the way, is there anything you feel could be holding you back or ways we could help you on your climb?","replies":[{"poster":"niqqa gaming","date":"2018-01-18T12:11:39.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean i guess i understand, but its just that in 2 of those games we lost were to dc or troll. we had a garen that fed, flamed, then rage quit. then in another, we had a kayle who inted and went 0/11.\n\ni just played my first match after placements, and there was a player named \"MF Or Troll\" who got filled suppourt. she tried to get mf, mf got banned, and she picked ashe, flash and smite, and continued to take jg monsters while the jg was taking them, take all the adcs cs, and walk around bot lane literally all game. we lost obviously. this stuff is just so ridiculous and continues to happen. im not even one of the people whos always like \"my teammates always hold me back thats why im in bronze\" but this stuff is so common here. \n\nanother question, my final flex rank was higher than my solo duo rank, so will my flex placements possibly place me higher since i will be playing against silvers?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T21:09:49.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmm yea it always sucks when it feels like your games are getting ruined by others, in the case of that \"MF Or Troll\" you should absolutely report that kind of behavior in the postgame so we can take a look. \n\nAbout the flex rank stuff, your previous Flex rank should only effect your Flex placements and same goes for solo/duo (if that makes sense).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
