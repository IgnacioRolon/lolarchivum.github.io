Any damage dealt while at max health with a Bloodthirster equipped will give you a temporary shield while in combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-06-19T15:30:14.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the self-mitigated damage stat only increase once damage is absorbed by the shield, or does that stat increase on shield use? Like, if Riven uses her shield to dash away, is the full shield value added to the recap stat? Or if she takes 0 incoming attacks in that scenario, is 0 added to the recap stat?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T20:24:15.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm preeeeeetty sure that stat only increases when her shield is actually damaged.
