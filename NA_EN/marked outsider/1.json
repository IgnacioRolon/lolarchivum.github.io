Every now and then i will join a game &amp; go through the whole champion select and when the timer hits 0 go straight to the re-connect screen that i can just spam click and nothing happens. Restarting the client does nothing, switching to legacy does nothing. What am i supposed to do? Get a free loss and take time out of my day and wait extra time to just PLAY a game? For something _i didnt even do_ how about your neighbor murders someone and everyone even himself knows he did it and you are charged with it. Come on riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T05:28:29.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Regardless of your intent, being absent from a match negatively impacts *everyone* in the match.
