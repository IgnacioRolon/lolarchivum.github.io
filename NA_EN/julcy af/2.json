Now punishing people who go to extreme amounts of &quot;Toxicity&quot; such as constant swearing is great. The problem is, people just report and there is no punishment for them. People who abuse the system need to be punished just as much as the &quot;Toxic&quot; players. An example, all the times I&#039;ve been reported for &quot;Offensive Language/Verbal Abuse&quot; yet there was no offense and it was just people trying to abuse the system. Where is the punishment for them? All I need to do is report everyone after game winning team/ losing team for &quot;Offensive Language&quot; and the case goes up for review instantly. The other categories do not seem to matter as much as the &quot;Offensive Language&quot; category in my experience. Fix the system, those who abuse the system promote toxicity and false reports are contagious.","replies":[]}
