His range scaling on W and his attack speed scaling on Q is pretty much the same as preseason kog. His Q attack speed passive is also insanely low when compared to other champs. Also, why is {{champion:29}} of all champions getting a huge nerf as well??? both of these are high risk high rewards adcs especially {{champion:29}}. What would even be the point in them anymore, look at {{champion:15}} and {{champion:202}} who are still insanely broken. Why does sivir get  to have higher scaling than twitch and kog when she is a &quot;utility&quot; adc. Sivir and jhin both have amazing early mid and late games. Wtf is wrong with you riot ???","replies":[{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2016-09-14T01:17:30.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm guessing you're a troll because kogmaw in my opinion needs a bigger nerf..

Thats your time to punish her, and jhins early game is bad as well. Not to mention youre comparing apples and bananas. SIvir is a utility adc, (notice that i didnt put it in quotes :) ) given that her ult is a team buff, and shes meant for wave clear and boosts. Compared to Jhin, who is meant to be a sniper of sorts. Jhin has little mobility, and anyone who gets close, gets a kill.  Kogmaws new play style is giving him the best of both worlds, his old and new systems. The problem with kogmaw is that he has become a little bit TOO rounded. (Not to mention he has been quoted as the 'perfect script champ')","replies":[]}]}
