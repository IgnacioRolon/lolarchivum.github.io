Per the [grading ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide)system, it isn't scoring you against other players in your match, but others who played your champion and role.  Among other players who have played Lucian and in that specific role, you earned an S which is pretty great.  It doesn't take anything about Vlad's performance into consideration.  Hope that helps with clearing things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-03-31T16:11:44.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"on top of what prices said, as a zyra main, I found it much easier to get an S+ grade on zyra support when Dragon Sorceress Zyra came out. Those S+ grades normally should have just yielded me an A- grade or so.\n\nDem influx of crappy zyra players (all with the skin) makes me cringe.","replies":[]}]}
