Even at the lowest settings I'm getting crazy fluctuations and stutters, I've followed Riot's recommended resolutions to no avail. I know it isn't my machine as every other game in my collection works flawlessly. I'm running an Alienware 17 R2 16 Gigs of Hyper X Ram, Intel i7 Clocked to 3.3 , Geforce GTX 980M, Samsung Evo SSD, Killer Wireless/Ethernet, Windows 10.  All diagnostics report my system is in good health and excellent condition. All my drivers are up to date etc. Any suggestions would be helpful as I've played for a couple years on this rig with no issue only to start having trouble the past few months and now it's the point of unplayable. Which sucks because I've dropped a couple hundred bucks into this game over the years.  Help, please?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T04:01:56.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most of the time, fps problems stem from some kind of bad interaction between your hardware and software. Sometimes its just due to some missing or outdated drivers. I know you mentioned going through some of the steps on our site already, but let's make sure to go through our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as well if you haven't yet.","replies":[{"poster":"CannabisRush","date":"2017-05-26T14:15:22.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have followed all of the steps in the guide short of downloading all of those programs listed at the bottom and sending in system data records because really that is a lot of hassle.  I've been dealing with this issue for months now, so I've tried pretty much every reasonable step I could and again all drivers are up to date. Nvidia is constantly releasing new drivers and I always get the fresh. SO with that being said, is my only remaining option  for a solution to submit benchmark data to Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T20:34:59.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those programs are a good step in troubleshooting these kinds of FPS issues, so make sure to go through the rest of those steps if you can find the time.

Till then I guess I'm just going to have to deal with a team fight phobia, which is rough cause literally all I do is ARAM. Speaking of can you guys reimplement the feature where I can see how much xp towards my next roll while in the champ select lobby ? That was always a big factor in if I was going to roll a champ or not and I miss it. Thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
