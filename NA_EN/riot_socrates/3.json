Known as Ranked Restrictions, the experiment restricted the in-game chat of negative players and prevented them from joining ranked queues until they’d completed the required number of games. With the feature proving successful on PBE, we’re rolling it out to live servers in NA and EUW in the coming days. Depending on the results of this, we’ll continue to add regions globally.\n\nWhen Ranked Restrictions go live on NA and EU, restricted players will be unable to queue up for ranked until they complete a certain number of games in Normal Draft. One thing we specifically wanted to address is that Ranked Restricted players will be Chat Restricted in other queues, and they can and should still be reported if they continue to display negative behaviors while playing through their restrictions. As with Chat Restrictions, after they finish the predetermined number of games, we’ll perform a final evaluation to make sure they've actually improved their in-game behavior. Players who haven’t shown improvement will continue to be restricted from playing ranked. Related to Ranked Restrictions, we’ve determined that Ranked Rewards should reward positive sportsmanship just as much as they reward great play, so the most negative players who are Ranked or Chat Restricted at the end of the season will be ineligible to earn ranked end of season rewards such as the loading screen borders or Victorious Morgana champion skin. While the majority of players will not be affected by this ruling, we wanted to message it well in advance so that players concerned about their behavior have more than enough time to adjust and reform before the end of the season.\n\n-Riot Socrates\n\n*Update 9/24 - Hey all, thanks for all the feedback on this. Wanted to further clarify a few points that I saw come up\n\n**Q: Will all chat and ranked restricted players be ineligible for rewards at the end of the season?**\nA: No, of the chat and ranked restricted players the ones with the worst behavioral records will not earn rewards.\n\n**Q: Do you expect to see the quality of normal draft decline from this?**\nA. We see that a players behavior shifts pretty dramatically based on the queue they are playing in. Since normals are less stressful and players who receive ranked restrictions will also receive chat restrictions, we don't expect to see an impact to the quality of the queue. That said, we'll be closely monitoring the health of the queue to ensure there isn't a negative impact.\n\n**Q: Won't these players just feed, troll, and AFK their way through the games?**\nA: Players have to win a certain number of games to lift the restrictions, so this would work against them. Also we'll reassess players as they near completion of their ranked restriction games. If we still see a pattern of negative behavior, the restrictions will be reinforced.\n\n**Q: Can players decay while they are ranked restricted.**\nA: Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-09-23T18:49:41.053+0000","up_votes":206,"down_votes":92,"body":"As someone who mostly plays Normal Draft, thanks for shoving all the assholes over to my preferred queue, Riot!\n\nI don't have a problem with preventing them from getting ranked rewards, but seriously?

I despise normal que's of all degrees because it promotes no growth in gameplay. You don't want prisoner's island, but you're going to negatively impact a bunch of games from people who don't like ranked by forcing someone like me, and many like me who don't like normals to play normals. You're better off banning for a week than doing something dumb like this, you're just going to fuel worse behavior. Because now we'll take out our frustration of having to play meaningless crap games that promote no skill growth because of troll picks and random bs like Fiddlesticks ADC. \n\nYou want to reform people, throw out bans instead of excessively long chat restrictions. Why did I not reform? Because when I get reported I LOLOLOL I'm on my 6th straight and not banned. The chat restriction is a joke punishment, and a lot of us don't take it seriously. Sad part was, everytime it hit me I changed for a bit but due to personal life issues sometimes my ability to regulate my attitude is completely ruined. \n\nYou're making a huge mistake with this change. I am more likely to uninstall the game than waste 50 games playing unranked. I am sure tons of people feel the same way. Also, a lot of us will resort to smurfs. Smurfing when pissed about restrictions ruins the gameplay for new players who can't properly play and draw our ire and anger. Seriously. I am looking out for Riot's best interest not my own. But unfortunately, seems too late for you guys to not do this.\n\nAlso, to confirm... if we have a 52 game chat restrict we have to play 52 normal draft games before being eligible to play ranked? Or you guys are giving a set amount of games we have to complete?","replies":[{"poster":"Baitsa Dasuto","date":"2014-09-24T14:24:58.418+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":6,"body":">The chat restriction is a joke punishment, and a lot of us don't take it seriously. Sad part was, everytime it hit me I changed for a bit but due to personal life issues sometimes my ability to regulate my attitude is completely ruined. \n\nRiot's stance on this is that we all have personal life issues, and as we don't want other people to burden us with these issues, they expect you to not push your issues onto these other people. League of Legends is a teambased game; if you're looking for a therapeutic experience try single player.\n\n> \n> You're making a huge mistake with this change. I am more likely to uninstall the game than waste 50 games playing unranked. I am sure tons of people feel the same way.\n\nAs only 1% of people get hit with chat restrictions I'm sure the overal impact will be quite small, both in numbers and percentages.\n\n>Also, a lot of us will resort to smurfs. Smurfing when pissed about restrictions ruins the gameplay for new players who can't properly play and draw our ire and anger.\n\nRiot already does itentify smurfs. If you think they can't track them, let me tell you this: They don't only track IP adresses. Every client has it's own unique ID, which is partly generated from your unique Windows installation as well as what hardware is in your computer. Unless you wipe your hard drive and change the major components in your computer every time you switch to a smurf they will be able to detect you. For particularly egregious offenses they have been known to ban both people's main accounts and all of their smurfs.\n\nBut you're raising a valid point: If leveling a smurf is faster than finishing one's Ranked Restrictions, Riot should take steps to ensure the Ranked  Restricted players cannot open other accounts with the client they're using on their computer, and should Ranked Restrict all other accounts as well.\n\n>Seriously.
