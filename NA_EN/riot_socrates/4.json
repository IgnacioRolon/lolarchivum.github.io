Any account definitively used by him will be banned immediately upon identification. \r\n\r\nWe know we’re not perfect, and this dragged on too long, but we want you to know when the rare player comes along who’s a genuine jerk, we’ve still got your back.","replies":[{"poster":"Drehirth","date":"2016-04-30T01:54:48.888+0000","up_votes":4182,"down_votes":929,"body":"I actually see this as a big injustice wow.. \n\n- he leveled his new account on stream\n- gets trolled every single game by both teams(but /mutes all when it happens)\n- has other streamers get jealous of his popularity shit talk him all day(and yet avoids the drama himself maturely and tells people to stop posting about it on his channel)\n\nbut he gets the ban instead.

He also gets trollers in his game but why ban specifically him?\nThis is not Tyler1's fault. \nHe tried his best to ignore and mute the trollers even though he gets a constant amount of trollers in his game. \nHe leveled up his account on stream without any hesitations nor obstinacy. \nIn those days that he was streaming, he actually showed promise.\nHe gets constant hate from other pro players / streamers but tells his viewers to avoid posting about it on social media.

Streamers like Kaceytron and Nicktron are still playing on the rift without punishments. They are doing the same thing. To be honest, they are worse than Tyler1. They mock League of Legends as a whole and treat it like shit.
