You can take spellbook and smite at the start. Then buy a hunters item and leave it in your inventory untill midgame. You can swap to tp after your first back and can still build and upgrade the jungle item.\nTested it with Cho. In lategame at lvl 18 with fullbuild and 10 stacks, cinderhulk passive alone gives you +~650hp.\nHope riot will somehow change it, so you only get the passive with smite equiped","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-02-10T14:02:01.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Work with Sion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-02-10T16:54:29.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's nothing gamebreaking really.
