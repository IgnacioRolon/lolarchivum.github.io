It&#039;s seen as a friendly rivalry from most players and spectators and it encourages competition. However as I watch the Twitch chat I constantly see the once funny joke turn into a hateful rivalry. As the &quot;rivalry&quot; continues on, comments have been becoming more and more cruel. Once clever jokes have become hateful insults with actual malice. In order to stop the hateful comments, moderators should be brought in in order to bring back the community from the excessive toxicity and encourage camaraderie and friendly competition.\r\n\r\nCredit to MetaNex\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3wmhta/na_vs_eu_topic_is_getting_out_of_control/","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-12-13T23:39:48.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty much impossible to moderate a chat when it has 100,000+ people watching it. It goes too fast to even attempt to do anything. You could get a bot in place to remove spammers but that's it.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliban Camgirl","date":"2015-12-13T23:56:01.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of having a bot for the chat searching for spammers. Perhaps key phrases could also be looked for? Besides that fact not all 100,000 people are usually in the chat. Only a fraction of that number have actually connected with facebook.  The system that I suggested would also ban people who used extremely offensive language and ruined the fun generated by the game. While not everyone would be caught, some people would, and those who repeatedly offend exponentially increase their chances of getting caught.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-12-14T06:30:38.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you got rid of all of the spammers and only 1% of the people watching were participating in chat (which is pretty low it would probably be more like 10%) you would still have 1000 or more people talking at once.\n\nEven if everyone of those 1000 people said one thing a minute (which is also pretty low) chat would just fly by anyway.\n\nMight as well just let the spammers spam and ignore chat.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The BÃ­g Ticket","date":"2015-12-13T23:43:20.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the 9/11 and refugee jokes are really childish and disrespectful towards person involved.
