I sent a request to Riot about the issue and was told to post here about it. According to &quot;Queen of Blades&quot;, it&#039;s a visual bug in my client. Not really sure what to do at this point. I asked if I could just get a refund for the amount of RP I spent, but I was told that I have no more refunds. I feel like if nothing else works, I should be able to get a refund for the icon.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-25T17:46:14.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NeverMeltIce,\n\nSince these were originally made available for another region's art contest, they'll be located a bit further down in your list of icons.
