We also won the game, but I felt like I didn&#039;t have a good game, even though I farmed well and didn&#039;t feed. However I also saw that I got an A grade after the game (which was probably the farm), and I was wondering how important KDA really is if you don&#039;t feed and you farm well, especially when playing a lane that is as isolated as top. I feel like in some cases the importance of KDA is exaggerated, but at the same time isn&#039;t it easier to win games with more kills? \nAn example of what I&#039;m saying is if the top laner has a similar stat line as stated above in the same amount of time, and let&#039;s say the mid laner goes something like 12/8/3 with around 120 CS, how much more important would that mid laner have been to winning than the top laner, even as the top laner was taking objectives and farming?","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2019-01-24T23:41:43.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally find the A in KDA to be heavily underlooked. I see all these players racking up kills and blaming everyone else for losing their games, yet those assist numbers really show just how little they helped their team. Particularly top laners.","replies":[{"poster":"DARKT1D1NGS","date":"2019-01-24T23:51:57.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I feel that. As a top laner I feel like sometimes I get those crucial assists that save my jungler or mid laner and get them fed, so in a way top laners can indirectly carry I guess. Sometimes it just feels like top laners are underappreciated for what they really do, just because we don't get as many kills and aren't as \"flashy\" as others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2019-01-24T23:28:19.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good kda _usually _ indicates that you do well, but the game is all about taking the opportunities you get.\n\nWhen you are bad in the game you have a much harder time, but a good KDA is worth nothing if you can't use your lead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-24T23:28:28.703+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"KDA has little or possibly zero impact on grading, it is just a correlation to earning gold, doing damage, and object participation.\n\nAs far as winning games, it varies.
