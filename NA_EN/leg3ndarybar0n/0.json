They use your account to send all of your friends that same link just so that they can get access to their accounts as well. If anyone knows a solution on how to get your account back please let me know. Riot please fix this so that we can all get our accounts back because i know multiple people who have been sent this link and some of which have pressed it where as others didn't because we were able to warn them in time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T01:47:02.416+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooooh it sounds like someone might have tricked you into clicking on a phishing link =(. Those work by stealing your login info when you type it in, and then sends it to someone who then can steal your account. Riot Games will never ask for your username and password, and the only way to officially get RP is through the client itself. There's not a lot we can do to stop this from happening other than trying to educate everyone about them.\n\nSince it sounds like your account info has already been compromised, I'd highly suggest reaching out to our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) when you get the chance. After you verify that you were the account creator they'll be able to help repair any damage the hacker might have done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeoghul Lucifer","date":"2017-11-07T03:19:13.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all it is known that there is no free RP on League of Legends, and you should be aware of that. Riot clearly states that. The only way to get \"free\" RP is by participating in giveaways and competitions. Having your account blocked like that is somewhat your fault too. I have been previously sent that kind of link and I never pressed any of them. Aside from that, have you tried resetting your email and password ? Are you not able to log in the client only or is the website blocked too ? And finally, did you send a ticket to Riot or not ? The best way to get help is to send tickets not post discussions, so If you didn't send a ticket, then go ahead and send it. By the way I'm not being mean, I'm just saying that you need pull yourself together and not go for easy ways: you want RP ? buy some, they're not that expensive you know ? See a skin you like ? 10 bucks should give you enough RP to buy it, apart from Ultimate and Legendary skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-07T00:04:23.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot time and time again have warned people not to click on any links offering free RP.
