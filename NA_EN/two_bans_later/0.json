I received ONE report and got banned 15 days. Only reason I ever get triggered is trolls. They troll, then I get mad at them because I&#039;m stuck in a game for another 30 fucking minutes with a troll and a loss. YET I get reported. Like WTF?! &quot;oh be the bigger man and carry and win.&quot; why should I have to get him a win. Trolls don&#039;t every get punished, unless they are toxic via communication. \r\n\r\nIt is unbelievable that people are so soft, they report you after you say something anything remotely rude. Riot(League of Legends) and its Tribunal is pathetic. Oh and pings, dear lord. Trolls ping the shit out of you, driving you nuts with endless pings and no consequences.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-11-03T10:12:41.027+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"1 report= 15 day ban you would of had to be high on the punishment list already\nor \nbroke a zero tolerance rule\n\n\nRiot gave you options to removing ping/chat/emotes","replies":[{"poster":"Two Bans Later","date":"2017-11-03T10:13:46.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"was a new account.\n\nand where is this option.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-11-03T10:16:27.156+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hold tab when in game, next to everyones scores are three little buttons\n1 is for chat\n2 is for ping\n3 is for emotes\nclick it to show the symbol crossed out and it mutes them for that activity\nall three will full mute them in the game\n\nNew account, obtained 2 week ban? logs?

Swearing is fine. It when you use it as a tool for harassment when it becomes a problem. But that should be common sense. You wouldnt curse out a random person say at the store/market place for no reason right? These people you are playing with are random people. If they are making mistakes in the game, what makes you the right to tell them off? If anything they should be around the same skill level as that is what matchmaking is suppose to do!\n\nAll in all though we cant make legit discussion since you are choosing not to show us your chatlogs which proves you have something to hide!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindspeaker","date":"2017-11-03T23:46:08.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmm  \"soft  \"\n\nor a \n\n  negative verbally abusive uncivilized person with emotional and  anger management who  rages at people in a video game.\n\nHey  i have no problem with \"soft \"  if  I have to choose","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-11-03T10:45:40.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Chat logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fermi Paradox","date":"2017-11-03T10:19:50.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You may have used some of those words that get you instantly banned.
