I said it needs to build out of something that can be useful in lane if the item wants to see any light of use outside of a few cases of people who just like the item. \n\nThere was an item on the PBE that built out of Vamp Scepter +400g(or maybe 450) that gave a slightly weaker version of the mana leach passive. I believe it was 2-6% instead of 2-8%. With the 10% LS and I think 20 or 25AD. \n\nFor 1200g that would be a fitting item for an early buy. ADCs tend to get Vamp Scepter early even if they don't finish the item. For 400g you could get that passive as well. \n\nIf they added this. Then made Reaver also build out of Bruitalizer, dropping probably 15-20 AD for the 10 pen. It'd see a lot more action on both ADC's and AD casters. \n\nUntil then. It just cannot compare to Muramana.

Ez, Sivir and Urgot are the first that comes to mind when thinking to ER, and even half of Jayce kit and the main Gangplank damage tool are marksmen like tools\n\nAD caster often coincide with some kind of marksmen or marksmen ability, so when looking at ER we should look at it ALSO as an ADC item","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroQuest96","date":"2015-01-07T14:36:09.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually most AD Casters are top laners and junglers, which Is why I think Essence Reaver should be balanced for them first and then tweeked to be fitting for both. It's much easier to tweek an item after it is somewhat viable in one catagory rather than its current state. I'm not saying we shouldn't consider ADCs I'm just saying only a minority of them would use it.
