Unfortunately, there isn't a solid repro, and without one, we're unable to fix it. :c \n\nThat said, I'm a Nami main and frequently use the Element chroma pack. I've found that swapping to another skin and back to the chroma I'd like to use has helped me avoid this issue in all of the queues I've been in. It's not a great workaround, but it's something until we can figure out what's going on with the loading of chroma packs. \n\n> Bloodmoon Kalista's face turns purple (like in her recall) when you do her taunt/joke.
