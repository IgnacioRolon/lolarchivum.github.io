My ADC{{champion:429}}  said that I was lagging her as well. I went to fountain to fix my lag issue but, my frames said it was a 00 and I tried to exit out of my game to restart it. Next thing you now it takes about 15 minutes to get out and restart my game. The game thought I was afk and game me an unfair 20 minute ban or 5 games. If someone can help me with this I would gladly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T04:05:22.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 5-game penalty *cannot* be added to your account as a result of a single game.
