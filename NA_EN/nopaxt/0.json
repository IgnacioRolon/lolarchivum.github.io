Even though I love the support position, I cannot climb out of bronze playing it. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that as a support I enjoy playing engage tanks, and want to help my lanes get ahead and stay ahead. I&#039;m not worried about kills, they will happen on their own, and assists still award gold. I want to translate this into the jungle role.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m practicing jungle right now, and these are the jungle champs I feel most comfortable on. (In order)\r\nWho should I add to my champion pool?\r\n {{champion:113}}  {{champion:120}} Ivern  (why does he have no pic?) {{champion:78}}  {{champion:111}} and {{champion:79}} \r\n\r\nI&#039;m also looking for tips on things like... \r\nwhen to farm vs gank (sometimes I gank when it&#039;s not necessary but I don&#039;t know that til it&#039;s over)\r\nDo I let a losing lane lose and keep winning lanes from from throwing or do I help them turn it around? \r\nHow do I know if I can flip the lane power into our favor without ignoring my own farm and other lanes?","replies":[{"poster":"Bl√†dedancer","date":"2016-11-26T00:03:09.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hecarim is just so insane, he's not hard to play, he has amazing gapclosers, he's super tanky, all around great jungler. Definitely play him. Also, a little secret pick of mine right now is Kindred, but she's very hard to play and weak, so I don't recommend her.\n\nAs for gameplay, \n\n1- I farm and counter jungle until I see a good opportunity to gank. While you farm look at the map, and if you see an opportunity go for it.\n\n2- When lanes are losing, it usually means they have fed the laner and the jungler is camping. So I tend to heavily ward that lane, and pressure, but don't gank unless I see a really good opportunity.\n\n3- If you see the laner is doing well and you can gank, go for it and get them ahead. If not, play passive and farm it up. Sometimes just peeking into a lane and showing yourself can help bring pressure, and you can gank other lanes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-11-25T22:10:11.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. {{champion:78}} \n\nI have not once seen a poppy jungle succeed in your elo range. She belongs in a punt-them-away-and-scrap-the-tower strategies which do not exist well in bronze. Whereas her ganks and team-fighting are otherwise mediocre due both damage and CC being lackluster compared to other picks. \n\n...if you do play her, for the love of Zyra, build some damage. Poppy with no damage is a noodle. \n\n2. CJ\n\nA stolen camp is worth more than a camp on your side. If you see the enemy jungler, and you're on the other side of the map with nothing to do, go a-thieving.","replies":[{"poster":"Dryditch","date":"2016-11-26T00:04:48.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy actually works quite well for early ganks, since she'll either burn a flash, zone the enemy out, or net a kill if her E lands properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-11-26T08:29:41.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience non of these happen on poppy ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Dryditch","date":"2016-11-26T20:35:45.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you're just playing with bad poppys or I'm just playing against true trash lords.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-11-26T00:12:17.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Hjbf1xYA4\n\n\n_________\n________\n________\n\nThere's also a \"How to Carry from the Jungle\" video right after.

I mained nautilus jungle for awhile in bronze and had a 60% wr but it slowly went down. Nautilus clears so slowly, and I don't recommend. I'm done playing support and being at the mercy of my team, can't deal with it. I like Hecarim, but I feel like I do no damage, right now I'm into champs like Udyr and trundle who can push hell fast, be tanky, and be a pain in the ass in team fights. Btw love your icon.
