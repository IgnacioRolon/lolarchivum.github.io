{"poster":"Stoopid Blonde","date":"2017-07-18T03:50:06.360+0000","title":"I dunno how to respond to","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":14,"body":"I got a chat restriction but in the chat logs all it lists is my comments, it does not show what i was responding to any potential harassment or trolling i endured it just shows me responding to it or ranting? Even if i agreed that my behavior was inexcusably horrible which i do not, i have a much harder time figuring out where i went wrong without the context of each game.\n\nI looked at some of the chat logs from others in these forums and they have people cussing others out and insulting them with really harsh words. I didn&#039;t do that. I like to think in most of my games I&#039;m nice and help out my team but apparently that doesn&#039;t matter if you ever mess up. What does matter is your mistakes not your accomplishments. I find it odd that a system is in place that will punish you if you make a few mistakes without taking any of the good you do into account.\n\nI would like to mention in every game in that log i was antagonized, trolled, or harassed for a good portion or all game. It becomes very frustrating when you are trying to learn this game and because most of the others you are matched with are smurfing they just leave the game when its not easy cause its just a a smurf. It is also frustrating as a new player when you are yelled at and harassed by 4 other players for not being a &quot;challenger smurf&quot;. I may have to post the chat logs in more than one post as i do not know if there is a character limit on this so if i double or triple post and that upsets you i apologize.\n\nI do understand that calling someone stupid or an idiot or threatening to make someone lose is not ok. But at the same time unless you are doing it all the time getting frustrated a few times should not get you punished. Any system that demands perfection is not a good system.\n\nI would be happy to try and provide context to the best of my memory for any questions that anyone has.\n\nEDIT: I am a new player yelled at constantly i have played like 30-40 total games and i think in two of them i haven't been harassed simply for being new. For not knowing everything, and being a \"challenger\" smurf like them. The second i get fed up with being told how shit i am and tell others to stuff it i get punished. No wonder 99 percent of new players are called smurfs, like 99 percent of actual new players are never gonna play this game to the point where they get good let alone max level why would anyone put up with a game that promotes punishing victims. I have never seen a community who would literally watch as someone was verbally abused over and over and then call the victim a monster who should be punished for standing up for themselves. Nowhere else anywhere besides this community have i seen so many people so detached from reality. Every single person here who has said no matter how much you are harassed you are not allowed to defend yourself is a terrible person. In a court of law,  if you get attacked and defend yourself, you will not get punished because in REALITY, not your safe space, you cant be a dick to someone then complain when you get called one. I bet you all think its absolutely terrible when a thief breaks into someones home and gets shot, when a rapist is beaten by their victim, when a parent abuses their child and the child defends themselves and the victim who rose above their attacker should rot in jail. You are all monsters. Wow no wonder this community is considered one of the worst of any game. I though it was just because it was full of raging assholes! But no you people are why this community is so very bad, you are worse than the people insulting others. You are the reason real progress and improvement cannot exist. You would rather blame victims instead of finding the reason there are so many and fixing THAT problem. Why are so many people harassing others is what should change not people defending themselves.\n\n\nGame 1\nStoopid Blonde: so whose my suppy?\nStoopid Blonde: no you arent\nStoopid Blonde: i called

I'd be okay with that being implemented.\n\nHowever, the important thing here is that you fought back -- it's not getting harassed for 20 minutes and then put in jail. It's more like getting a drunk guy up in your face at a bar for 10 minutes, and then arguing loudly with him and disrupting the other patrons for an additional 10 minutes, and then being surprised when you're both asked to leave by the bouncer.

Just cause there's words in a chat log doesn't mean ALL of the words said where against the rules most of them are not. So when you say riot only punishes constant bad behavior i am gonna have to say you are dead wrong. I do not in almost ALL my games act anyway but friendly.

I didn&#x27;t constantly do or say things in a bunch of games. I did it in three games maybe 4 out of like 40. I would also like to point out that most of what i said in all three of those games was on topic non harassment relevant to the game. Most of it was friendly or trying to reason with people. Just cause there&#x27;s words in a chat log doesn&#x27;t mean ALL of the words said where against the rules most of them are not. So when you say riot only punishes constant bad behavior i am gonna have to say you are dead wrong. I do not in almost ALL my games act anyway but friendly. This system gives no chances for improvement no warnings no consideration to what happened it just throws you in jail and doesn&#x27;t give you a trial.\n\nIn your reform card you're spending quite a bit of time arguing with teammates instead of focusing on the game, some of it in what appears to be a passive-aggressive manner. Obviously not all of it was bad, but most of it isn't good either. Also, I never said that you act the way you did here in all your games, but it had to be at least a consistent number of them in order to receive a punishment here.\n\nAs for improvements that's what chat restrictions are meant to help you do so-to-speak as the lightest form of punishment there is: show you where you went wrong behavior wise and encourage you to focus more on the game and less on arguing with people in the chat.

Yes it's not supposed to be a pleasant experience, but that should be all the more reason for them to take a good look at their behavior and work on avoiding displaying the kind of behavior that caused them to get punished in the first place.\n\nIn your case this is just a chat restriction and not the end of the world. Think of it like a citation or a speeding ticket where yes you still have to pay the fine (in this case a couple of games of limited chat messages to send at a given time) but it's not as bad as it could be (an account suspension or a ban).\n\n> if i scream out loud i get grounded i did try reasoning with them but when you&#x27;re being attacked constantly when you literally did nothing wrong and they just didn&#x27;t like your pick I&#x27;m not gonna be held hostage by a leaver punisher AND 3 assholes.\n\nIf all they're doing is flaming you then you should just mute, report and move on rather than add fuel to the fire. Doing that ensures that only they get punished and don't drag you down with them. As for Leaverbuster penalties, those only happen if you repeatedly leave games on a consistent/frequent enough basis, much like how the IFS only tends to issue punishments for consistent enough poor behavior.\n \n> i wasn&#x27;t it happened three or 4 times max got me punished which is why this is stupid.

All I know is that under normal circumstances punishments are only handed out if a player shows consistent enough negative behavior across multiple games.\n\n> You shouldn&#x27;t have to mute others just because riot cant find a way to make new players not have to deal with smurfs with an ego.\n\nEven if Riot could find a way to deal with that it's still up to the players to decide whether or not they want to use the tools available to them to help prevent any further toxicity from happening to them, and the mute button is one such tool available. If you don't want to use the mute button then that's fine, but compared to the alternative of listening to people complain and flame constantly it's a pretty sweet deal if you ask me (one less distraction after all).","replies":[{"poster":"Stoopid Blonde","date":"2017-07-18T19:39:32.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one has the patience of a god.
