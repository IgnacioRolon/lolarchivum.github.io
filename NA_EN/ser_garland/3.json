I'm glad that you share my enthusiasm.\n\nYeah, Jarvan 4 has already seen the spotlight for most of Season 3 along with Lee Sin, then Lee Sin and Elise in Season 4, Then Lee Sin and Jarvan going into Season 5. This is not exactly a diverse selection of Jungle champions, and is way too stagnant for the Jungle to be called a Healthy role in its current state.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-02-15T17:01:03.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you even notice that people complain about champs in the roles no one plays.\n\n\"Riot destroyed the Jungle, I'm going to got top, mid, etc\" -> \"WTF fix Lee, J4, (insert Broken jungler here)\"\n\nSimilar to last season.\n\n\"OMG, supports only get carried.\" -> \"Morg's hitbox, Janna's safty, Better nerf sona.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-02-15T16:44:52.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would at least be happy to have a cycle of different champions become used and powerful at different points as oppose to what we have now which is usually the same champions over and over with a few FOTM picks here and there.\n\nI can also tell based on your description of some of the champions that you've never even tried them or seen them in action.

The only one in that list that I main is J4. but I prefer to take him top over in the jungle, because a smart jungler can counter jungle J4 early and leave his problematic ganking in the dust.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SlytherinUmbreon","date":"2015-02-15T19:08:43.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nautilus is truly, truly outrageous. {{champion:44}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DollaMenunaire","date":"2015-02-15T17:38:26.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrighty boys, now that we have an \"Aatrox is OP\" thread, we have thus reached our goal of having a \"champ X is OP\" thread for every single champion in the game.\n\nPat yourselves on the back, you've earned it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zazusha","date":"2015-02-15T16:49:04.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every champ can be OP at one point, the problem is a select number of champs have been for too long. Also Riot's track record for nerfing (\"balancing\" as they call it) isn't the best.\n\nThey either nerf a champ to oblivion (see WW's nerfs this past pre-season, or Lucian's last season) or they dish out small nerfs one at a time, that have little to no impact (See anything they do to LeeSin, and the 'Nerf' to Zed where they lowered a fraction of his Atk speed).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ser Garland","date":"2015-02-15T16:57:58.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reasoning I see behind riot not nerfing this current slew of \"OP\" champions is that a large majority use their bread and butter engages and trades as skill shots. In competitive play, it's not unheard of to bait juke a Lee Sin Q.\n\nRemember when Kayle was \"broken\" she had a targeted slow followed by an onslaught of targeted E infused auto attacks and an ult that came off cool down every 30 seconds.\n\nI mained Kayle last year and even I agreed that it was BS. I could still get away with murder by maxing her Q over her E and building a stinger right after nashors tooth. -That- was BS. Ryze was BS. 4:20 Warwick was BS.\n\nThe fact that no one even mentioned Lee or J4 or Vi, or even Zed last year, just that they were always \"around\" speaks that we've dealt with a lot of bs champions and are now left with the question of \"should we nerf the next tier of champions?\" those that were once deemed healthy?","replies":[]}]}
