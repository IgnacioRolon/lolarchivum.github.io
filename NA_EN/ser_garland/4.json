Its purpose is vision, but what it also does is gimp supports out of having any fun, simply by existing as a bit of health. Not all supports benefit by building health (Hey Sona) and I feel like a lot of champions who should be viable mage supports, end up being unintentionally gimped because of this item. Sure, you can choose not to build this item, at the risk of your entire team being mad at you. I mean supports already have to deal with less gold and experience accumulation than most of their party. It even takes up an item slot late game for when stats could prove useful.\n\nThey should make sightstone into a fun item. Give it multiple build paths into a true end game item like last season&#039;s jungle changes.

I've had countless games where the chat said \"it's not my job to ward it's the support's\" after the support has 3 greens and a pink on the map and struggling to clear the enemy's wards. \n\nI understand I'm not very high up on the ladder, I get that and I don't think it will ever change, but I watch a decent number of highish level streams (plat+) and I still see a stupid lack of wards, even more rare to see people get {{item:3361}} on their first back after hitting 9(or even before 11 maybe 12), like seriously this item is SS on steroids and it's still not an extremely sought after item, though it's exactly what people see as an issue from solo lanes.  They already have a SS but better, though it is on a level before it's obtainable it's not hard to pick up the 2-5 wards you'd need until then to make up for that lack of having it.\n\nTL;DR I don't think it'd be a bad idea to buff SS in any way shape or form, {{item:3361}} exists (and as of 9/11 it had a 15.39% popularity over all ranks; info from lolking) yet nobody ever gets the item even if it's going to cover their warding for the rest of the game and it is STILL better than SS by a lot.  \n\nI'm also Silver so just ignore my opinions since I can't have good ideas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daxterr","date":"2015-09-14T08:41:13.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay for real how about this idea.

The extra ward is nice when you are running around different areas of the map with your team lategame (you ward out bot, then you need to ward up top with your team like 1 min later), or if you are in a \"ward war\" with the opposing support (or team), and your wards are being killed.\n\nSightstone is a really good item.  Ruby Sightstone...leaves much to be desired.  Back when it was designed (Preseason 3), before trinkets, it was designed to replace the \"ward slot\" that all supports had to have.  This was before there was a ward limit (Preseason 4), so supports would just buy wards (even 2 slots worth!), forgoing other items.  Supports were stuck with only 3-4 items plus boots.  With Sightstone, you could have your \"ward slot\" and have some stats, as well as still being able to buy more items because you weren't buying 5 wards every time you went back!  Just watch this video of CLG.eu vs. WE at around this time: https://youtu.be/bqdv1QX6kNg?t=178  You can see that the supports have 2 full slots of wards 60 min into a game, with only 3 completed items.  Hell, the Janna on WE just buys 2 gold-generating items and tier 1 boots.  60 minutes in.  It's also just a funny game (so long and boring that people cheered for ward kills.  I'm serious, watch it).  I'm pretty sure that seeing supports like this made Riot change the rules about wards over time.\n\nNow with the ward limit as well as the trinket slot, supports are supposed to not bear the burden of being ward bots, though they still do oftentimes!  Ruby Sightstone really doesn't do much to help supports over Sightstone, except for the 250 HP (that costs 800g!).  Besides, you should still technically keep a slot open for pink wards, especially since they can be killed easily if your team steps away from them.","replies":[{"poster":"High5","date":"2015-09-13T11:43:45.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very specific case.
