If a VPN was able to work, your ISP might actually be sending your connection in an awful route so that it can never reach our servers reliably. If that starts happening again for any reason, you should maybe try running a trace route to see where your connection is going after it leaves your network.\n\nhttps://thumbs.gfycat.com/SociableScratchyCaudata-max-1mb.gif","replies":[{"poster":"i just uwu","date":"2017-07-24T01:42:48.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooo any ETA when Riot is addressing or fixing?\n\nAlso from Chicago area, same issue.
