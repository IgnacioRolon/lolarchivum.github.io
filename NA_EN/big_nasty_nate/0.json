I've seen her wipe out towers in like, idk, 3 shots or some nonsense and kill tanks from a mile away with her new E ability, at first it was refreshing but now its just so impossible to deal with. Her range and escape mechanics were amazing to begin with, I really don't understand giving her the capability to melt towers from such a great distance. My crew and I just ban her every game now cause we haven't found a way to deal with the bs range, E, and jump. I don't really know her new kit by heart but that new E is beyond powerful atm. She's an adc/assassin with seige potential, this is starting to get really frustrating. Any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Matthias9119","date":"2015-02-01T04:45:01.313+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"She was always a hypercarry with self peel.  If you let her get way ahead or to full build she'll wreck you.\n\nThey just **lowered** her range.\n\nE does less damage than it used to unless she stacks it all the way by landing 4 autos afterwards; she used to be able to just fire and forget.  It's also physical damage rather than magic now, so she doesn't get nearly as much magic damage when building AD now.\n\nEvery marksman melts towers.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-01T10:20:49.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your points are... incredibly flawed. She was a hyper carry because of her range. Her range got lowered by about 50, so she's at Cait's range now, but she still has a huge attack speed boost that puts her over 2.0 with just a Phantom Dancer or Shiv. If you think landing 4 autos is hard as Trist, especially on a turret that can't exactly move, well, you're sorely mistaken. \n\nAlso, magic damage? Seriously? You're going to talk about her E being physical now and play it off like it's some nerf? LOL. Her E was 'Fire and Forget', but it was also DoT, so any kind of bubble stopped it. The Grievous Wounds was nice, but the ability itself was horrible after you got to mid game where everyone had a bit of magic resist and now you have no MPen or AP to make that E more than just a Grievous Wounds applier. This ability has also never scaled with AD until just recently, so she never got magic damage from building AD. Ever. Never EVER. Her W and R also still have great amounts of damage as well, so she has plenty of magic damage in her kit even if her E is now AD scaling, which synergizes with an AD build even more because now when she gets a LW, it's damage won't be negated. \n\nHonestly, I think her tower melting abilities with her E is a bit insane. She's always been a murderer just by pressing Q, but with her E now able to chunk the turrets as well, it's simply insane.","replies":[]}]}]}
