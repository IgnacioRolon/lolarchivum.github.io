Is it on Riot's end, because it kind of seems like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T05:04:30.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet loss happens before your connection ever reaches the server its headed to usually, but that doesn't mean it isn't related to playing League. Sometimes ISP's choose a really awkward route to send your connection, and when it happens it would only happen for specific connections and not others (which explains why stuff like Warframe is fine but League isn't). \n\nDo me a favor and run a quick traceroute to test for that packet loss before we jump ahead. Grab a tool like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a trace to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1. Post the results in a reply here, and that'll give me the data to know what to do next.","replies":[{"poster":"zenkai4511","date":"2017-11-20T22:19:11.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                  dsldevice.attlocal.net -    0 |  110 |  110 |    0 |    1 |   48 |   11 |\n|108-88-20-2.lightspeed.nsvltn.sbcglobal.net -   49 |   39 |   20 |   22 |   22 |   23 |   22 |\n|                           99.131.205.86 -   63 |   32 |   12 |    0 |   23 |   24 |   23 |\n|                            12.83.112.29 -    0 |  111 |  111 |   23 |   26 |   83 |   25 |\n|                   ggr1.attga.ip.att.net -    0 |  111 |  111 |   29 |   30 |  124 |   29 |\n|                           206.121.10.38 -    0 |  111 |  111 |   29 |   33 |  154 |   30 |\n|                          104.160.135.35 -    0 |  111 |  111 |   28 |   30 |  153 |   28 |\n|          ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  110 |  110 |   40 |   41 |   84 |   40 |\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  110 |  110 |   40 |   41 |   84 |   41 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  110 |  110 |   41 |   41 |   84 |   41 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n\n   Is this what you're looking for?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T04:43:06.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So these two lines....\n\n> |108-88-20-2.lightspeed.nsvltn.sbcglobal.net - 49 | 39 | 20 | 22 | 22 | 23 | 22 |\n> | 99.131.205.86 - 63 | 32 | 12 | 0 | 23 | 24 | 23 |\n\nare showing a good deal of packet loss, about 50% packet loss in the second part. Since packet loss happens outside of our servers, it's almost always caused by damaged nodes or just a bad route your ISP is sending your connection through. I'd suggest reaching out to your ISP about that packet loss, even sending this over to them as well as some data to back up your claim.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zenkai4511","date":"2017-11-21T03:26:15.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"<html><head><title>WinMTR Statistics</title></head><body bgcolor=\"white\">\n<center><h2>WinMTR statistics</h2></center>\n<p align=\"center\"> <table border=\"1\" align=\"center\">\n<tr><td>Host</td> <td>%</td> <td>Sent</td> <td>Recv</td> <td>Best</td> <td>Avrg</td> <td>Wrst</td> <td>Last</td></tr>\n<tr><td>dsldevice.attlocal.net</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 110</td> <td> 110</td> <td>   0</td> <td>   1</td> <td>  48</td> <td>  11</td></tr>\n<tr><td>108-88-20-2.lightspeed.nsvltn.sbcglobal.net</td> <td>  49</td> <td>  39</td> <td>  20</td> <td>  22</td> <td>  22</td> <td>  23</td> <td>  22</td></tr>\n<tr><td>99.131.205.86</td> <td>  63</td> <td>  32</td> <td>  12</td> <td>   0</td> <td>  23</td> <td>  24</td> <td>  23</td></tr>\n<tr><td>12.83.112.29</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 111</td> <td> 111</td> <td>  23</td> <td>  26</td> <td>  83</td> <td>  25</td></tr>\n<tr><td>ggr1.attga.ip.att.net</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 111</td> <td> 111</td> <td>  29</td> <td>  30</td> <td> 124</td> <td>  29</td></tr>\n<tr><td>206.121.10.38</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 111</td> <td> 111</td> <td>  29</td> <td>  33</td> <td> 154</td> <td>  30</td></tr>\n<tr><td>104.160.135.35</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 111</td> <td> 111</td> <td>  28</td> <td>  30</td> <td> 153</td> <td>  28</td></tr>\n<tr><td>ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 110</td> <td> 110</td> <td>  40</td> <td>  41</td> <td>  84</td> <td>  40</td></tr>\n<tr><td>ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 110</td> <td> 110</td> <td>  40</td> <td>  41</td> <td>  84</td> <td>  41</td></tr>\n<tr><td>104.160.131.1</td> <td>   0</td> <td> 110</td> <td> 110</td> <td>  41</td> <td>  41</td> <td>  84</td> <td>  41</td></tr>\n</table></body></html>\nI didn't know which one to send, so i'll send both of these.
