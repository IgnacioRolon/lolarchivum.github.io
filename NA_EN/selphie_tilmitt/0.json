I had some rp leftover and wanted to get couple 5 epic capsules before it goes away and ever since I made that purchase of $200, I keep encountering error as I click on the amount of rp I want to purchase. I'm wondering if anyone is having this issue or how to resolve this before the capules goes away.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T16:29:05.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not seeing anything out of the ordinary, but our billing team might have more insight.  You may have hit a daily limit or there might be some pause if the big purchase was unusual, but I can't say for sure.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our billing team can tell you with more certainty and offer some options.  We'll see you there!","replies":[]}]}
