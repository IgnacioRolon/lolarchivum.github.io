So here is the problem, my brother and i always enjoy playing league together, a great pass time activity. However, he has a problem, he keeps dcing when loading into the game, it will say his internet connection is bad but when we check it is perfectly fine, he is only aloud to connect after everyone is in the game by then he is missing valuable farm. We tried everything, troubleshooting the client, reinstalling the client but nothing has worked. Is there anyone else having the same problem of not being able to connect until everyone else is in game, if/if not so is there anyway it can be solved or troubleshooted. \r\nThank you for your time to read this and i pray that you can help me :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T20:43:19.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's see if can't get your brother in those games a little faster! Since you're both on the same network, that means your internet is obviously running pretty well. That means to main issue is most likely isolated to his pc somehow. It'd be a good first step to check up on his [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and also try flushing his DNS while you're at it. Hit me back up and let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"PinkishDoodle","date":"2017-07-18T08:37:35.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah mate sadly it did not work, we went through everything on the list and it still didn't work, he told me another bit of information though, he said this has never happened to him until the latest patch of 7.14 or whatever we are up to. Have you got any other suggestions, please get back to me if you do, if not dont worry and thank you for trying to help us mate :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T01:22:55.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm no worries just yet, that still helps us narrow down what the issue *isn't* so that we can figure out the main problem! Reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to read through your game logs to see just what was going on when your brother kept disconnecting!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PinkishDoodle","date":"2017-07-17T06:23:24.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for this mate, a good response, i will let you know if it helps at all :)","replies":[]}]}]}
