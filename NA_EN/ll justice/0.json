Since pre-Season 8 was just tanks obliterating every single bruisers because they didn't have a keystone (yet), Shen became a meta pick since he, well, countered tanks while doing what they do and doing what a bruiser do. Now he pretty much is one of the worst champs and thats not even because of said reasons above, since he was nerfed into the ground simply because he was picked like 3 or 4 times in 2 months of LCS as a support and Riot really didn't like that for some reason","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2019-03-06T03:53:37.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"They might as well accept that galio needs to go the route of mundo: an AP counterpick that gains a lot from building MR both in tank and damage.\n\nGeneralist galio is an abject failure.","replies":[{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2019-03-06T05:56:00.918+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Counterpicking ap is so rarely a thing because riot pander too the marksmen mains.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"noitarecaL","date":"2019-03-06T21:16:53.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I 100% agree galio really needs some help, they should just make him an anti-mage like kass that's early-midgame focused but falls off late due to his ult being a supportive spell.
