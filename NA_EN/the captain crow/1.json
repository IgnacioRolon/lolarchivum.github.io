That person hasn't been answered yet so... Here I am.\n\nThis has been happening since the most recent patches for me _(The last two, 8.10 and 8.11)._ The queue goes well. The champion select process goes well. The load-in process goes well... Then, when everyone hits 100%, the client says that I've been disconnected. I suspect it disconnects the moment the game begins. Usually happens twice before I can finally play in-game _(Which is about ten/fifteen minutes into an already-lost fight)_ - rarely happens once or three times only yet it has happened in the past.\n\nSo far, this has only been at play during ARAM matches. Haven't tried Summoner's Rift yet and it doesn't seem to stop what I do in Bot matches. Strange...\n\nMy PC's processor is an AMD E1-1200 APU with Radeon HD Graphics with 1.40 GHz. RAM amount is 4.00 GB (3.58 GB usable). 64-bit operating system as well. Just enough to handle _League of Legends_ at the lowest possible settings. I never had this issue while playing this game on this computer before... My internet is mainly fine, sitting at 42-47 ping usually and I don't usually have disconnection issues with the internet being involved as the catalyst for it.\n\nAlready used the Hextech Repair Tool. Only fixed the issue once and never again after the next patch. I still have yet to reinstall the client itself or use the full-repair tool in its settings but I have the most suspicious feeling they will not work. I'll attempt to use them, nonetheless, but I want to avoid going nuclear as much as possible.\n\nCould this be looked into? I have yet to find a solution for this on the boards and.. _Well,_ its frustrating to deal with during an event.\n\n_Thank you and best of luck to everyone having this issue!_\n\n_Edit:_ Oh, wait! Just so happens that, after repairing the client, it now effects bot games.\n\n\n_Post-Note:_ This is in the General Discussions boards due to _\"Report a Bug\"_ not allowing topics involving disconnections and, the main reason itself, the _\"Help Desk\"_ is _not_ an option I can choose from the _\"Creating a Discussion in (Select a Board)\"_ choices I have. I am uncertain if my browser, Google Chrome, is the suspect for this issue or not but my apologies if this is in the wrong board. Thank you.","replies":[]}
