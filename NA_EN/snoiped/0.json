I basically only play this game so I Was wondering, could I buy a 50 dollar RP thing and then use it without it having to actually be physically with me? Like buy a code from gamestop.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-08-21T13:08:43.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most gamestops have League gift cards (at least in my area also in NA). I beleive gamestop's website also has them listed, and they should be able to have it mailed to you as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T22:34:08.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure about which regions specifically sells digital copy cards except for Amazon.  Per our [RP Card](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753224-Prepaid-RP-Cards-NA-OCE-) guide, you can find digital codes on [Amazon's RP page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014X427WM?gwSec=1&ref_=br_imp).  Keep in mind that this is currently available in NA, and I'd also be wary about any other venues that might claim to have digital codes as I couldn't confirm it's validity.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
