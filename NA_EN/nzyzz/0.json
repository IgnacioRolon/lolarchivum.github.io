The only away to return to good standing with [Leaverbuster ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/ne5GBw7i-boards-badges-and-posts-not-updating)is by completing your lower priority queue matches and playing consistently without interruptions.  \n\nI know your laptop froze and it may have been out of your control, but all leaves are treated equally because it causes negative experiences for others.

I played a game of league. My laptop died, yet I reconnected and played on for the next 25 or so minutes. Got some kills, assists. Finish the game and I get a leaver buster for 20 min?
