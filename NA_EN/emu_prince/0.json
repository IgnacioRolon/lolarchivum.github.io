{"poster":"Emu Prince","date":"2016-11-17T02:35:23.259+0000","title":"Can log into client, but CAN'T connect to games","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just as the title says, I am able to log into the client, chat with friends, create game lobbies and join queue, but I CANNOT connect to any game mode once champion select is over. \r\n\r\nEvents leading up to the issue:\r\n-Roommates accidentally hit the wrong circuit breaker, causing the entire house to lose power for a few minutes. \r\n-Due to no electricity, router shut off and then turned back on when power was restored. \r\n-Ever since the router \"restart\" I haven't been able to actually load any games.\r\n\r\nSymptoms(?):\r\n-After a black screen, the error noise pops up and I get presented with the typical \"Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection\" \r\n-If I click cancel to the first error, I get presented with the league client's orange \"reconnect\" button, but still able to use the clients feature like messaging friends.\r\n\r\nTried (and failed) solutions:\r\n-Flushing dns (not sure what this does but I tried it and it didn't work)\r\n-Reset netsh (not sure what this does but I tried it and it didn't work)\r\n-Resetting router \r\n-Re-installing league client\r\n-Setting network from Public to Private\r\n-Double checking windows firewalls\r\n-Pinging Riot's IP through cmd. I get replied back and around 99% packets returned\r\n \r\nAdditional comments:\r\n-The voice chat program \"Discord\" also fails to connect now, showing up as a \"No Route\" error. This tells me it has something to do with permissions? (I am not a networking guy so I really have no clue).\r\n-I am able to use Discord in-browser, but not with the installed client.\r\n-The one thing I was unable to thoroughly try is typing in my IP into the web browser. I don't know the log-in credentials, and I hope that whatever is behind the log-in prompt isn't the only way to fix this.\r\n-League works just fine on any other internet source\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and any help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Emu Prince","date":"2016-11-17T05:11:37.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resetting the router through the reset button (not just turning it on and off for 15 seconds) seemed to do the trick.

You may need to be able to login to the router's firmware to resolve this by completing a *factory reset* of your router. You can try finding the default login credentials on [this page](http://www.routerpasswords.com/), though I'm not sure how accurate it is.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
