As you've mentioned, this isn't something that occurs all the time. I'm unable to reproduce this issue. :c I may suggest doing a client repair to see if a file may have been jumbled with the most recent patch. If that doesn't resolve the issue, please feel free to reach out and we can investigate further! :)","replies":[]}]}
