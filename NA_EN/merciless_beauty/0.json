I'm gonna assuming flaming since it's the most common.\n\nOne thing to do is say the flame out loud instead of typing it.  You can rant and rave all you want in your home and they can't ban you for it.  That might get it out of your system instead of you bottling it up.\n\nDo your best to ignore others mistakes.  You will most likely never see your teammates/enemies again unless you are high elo.  So telling someone that they suck does literally nothing because you'll never see that person again.  Yeah, they are ruining this one game for you, but that's one game out of hundreds.  If you are good, you'll climb.  This one set back isn't the end of your climb.  Literally had a promo series two years ago where first game my top AFK'd after 2 deaths, second game my top AFK'd after 4 deaths, third game my top and mid stomped the enemy team into them AFKing, and fourth game my top AFK'd after 1 death.  It was painful to get those games so close to ranking up, but it just took me 2 games to get back to 100 and 2 wins to promote.  So while sucky teammates make the game feel horrible, try to focus on yourself rather than others since your skill is what will help you win the next games, not their skill.\n\nChange/Remove your enter key.  I don't know how most people do it but you can run a simple AHK script that makes your enter key act like another button.  That way, you physically can't type in the game and even if you get really frustrated and try to use enter to open the chat it won't do anything.  Check around, I'm sure there are other ways to disable your enter key that probably are easier to implement.\n\nIt's a game.  A competitive one, but still a game.  If you aren't having fun, take a break.  Alternatively, get up and walk around after each game.  This helps get you out of your head.  It's easy to stew in that anger over that one lost teamfight where Lulu didn't ult the right target or whatever misplay ruined the game.  If you get your mind off it though, you should be able to let go of the frustration instead of carrying it to the next game.  Or, take a minute between games to write down what happened that game.  That way you write out all your frustrations.  You can then see after a few games how it's been going and either play another or decide today just sucks and go do something to relieve stress.  I did that a lot when I started playing ADC and noticed I had a 33% winrate on Caitlyn.  When I started tracking what happened in games, I noticed that a lot of the losses we due to teammates, so while it shows up on my winrate, it didn't mean I was the reason we were losing those games, it just meant I wasn't good enough at ADC to carry when behind.  I also noticed I started losing a lot on weekends, so I stopped playing on weekends and only played norms or something non-ranked.\n\nLearn when a game is lost and don't get down about it.  If your bot lane is 0/20 at 15 minutes, the game might already be over.  So, if you lose this game, don't get mad about it.  Yeah, we all hate losing, but if you can identify when a game is lost and basically lose interest in it, you shouldn't be too worried about mistakes your teammates make.  I once had a game where our Top laner was hovering Jax.  The enemy team banned Jax, so he started inting.  It was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen and I just instantly ignored this game since if he's going to int over the ENEMY team banning his champion, I highly doubt he'd be able to carry this game anyway.  Obviously do your best during the rest of the game, continue on like you might have a chance because there is always that change you'll stall out for that 40 minute coin flip teamfight, but just let yourself and your teammates off the hook a bit.  Had a game where our mid laner AFK'd after one death at 5 minutes.  We ended up winning the 4v5 40 minutes later because their 20/2 Rengar kept killing me (1/8 Kog'maw) instead of killing the 10/3 Darius or the 5/1 Malphite or the 8/2 Brand support.  The rest of their team didn't stand a chance cause Darius would reset off killing Rengar and with Malphite to get a good engage Darius and Brand just murder all of them with his fully stacked passive and Brand's AOE.  If we had lost that game though, you just chalk it up to AFK teammate and don't blame yourself for it.  It sucks, it happens, report them for AFK and move on. \n\n/mute all is your friend.  I rarely get upset but when I do I tend to be a passive aggressive person or I \"defend\" myself/others when picked on.  Obviously this is the wrong thing to do since I'm just ruining the game for 3 people who aren't attacking me.  So, if you find yourself responding to flame, just mute all at the beginning of the game and play.  I've learned to stop talking in games without needing to mute all, but even then I still get teammates who think I've muted them since they haven't seen me type all game.  If at any point someone starts getting to me, I just mute them.  It's not worth them getting in my head.  They aren't worth the stress.","replies":[{"poster":"Merciless Beauty","date":"2019-01-14T20:47:12.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been banned for multiple different reasons:\n\n - Ahri Carries All --> Verbal Abuse(?)/Griefing/Intentional Feeding\n - Best Foxx NA --> Verbal Abuse/Hate Speech\n - 2nd Best Fox NA --> Account Sharing\n - Akuma No Kitsune --> Verbal Abuse\n - I Am Best Fox NA --> Verbal Abuse\n\nBefore anyone says anything, these are my previous 5 accounts - all of them are permabanned.\n\nI rarely remember to mute all and the last time I was given a 14 day suspension I didn't come back for about 40 days.

That reduces received toxicity by at least 55%. That way you won't suffer that much even if you forget to mute all (I personally dislike the \"mute all\" option, but apparently there are people who need it. I mute the people who annoy me, and report them in post-game lobby instead of using crutch like \"mute all\". Self control & patience are needed part of human existence, so you might want to learn those instead.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-01-09T21:15:38.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was exactly where you are now a few years ago.
