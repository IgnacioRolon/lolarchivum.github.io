In a new champion?","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not hating Karma's newer kit. It's pretty cool and versatile, but it doesn't have the same feeling to it as the old Karma's kit had. I'm not able to link myself to an ally to speed them up or burst an enemy diving under my tower with a dangerous amount of health while they freak out about the sudden damage. I don't see any other kit other than Janna that lets me heal and provide a barrier in 1 kit, and Janna has to burn an ult for that. The newer Karma kit is less supportive than the old Karma's kit. It's been about a year or so since the rework, and I'm still mourning the old kit's removal. There were problems with it, of course, but minor tweaks to it like with Taric's reworked kit would probably work too.\r\n\r\nI'm totally fine with Karma's newer kit, but I still miss her old kit. I'd love to see a new champion take that up someday.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T00:43:40.514+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP old Karma.

They remove her before the support item were added which was what she kind of need more money\n2. They remove before Yasuo and Zed, she counter assassin pretty well\n3. They remover her before the meta of range/caster can go top ex. Ryze\n\nSo my theory is they remove her before people can realize how well she would of been. so what i fear is they wont bring the kit bad but I hope they will","replies":[{"poster":"KaelTheGreat","date":"2015-02-02T00:17:58.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot also hates people having fun with things that aren't EXACTLY how they wanted them to be. EX: Supports were able to do well by building full AP? Better change the entire game so people can't do that anymore. People are playing AP Rek'Sai? Better destroy her AP ratios so people can't have a little fun in normals.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-02-02T09:45:16.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol why does everyone keep calling rek'sai a \"he\"?

I really like new Karma. I REALLY like her, but not nearly as much as old Karma. Last season there was a HUGE meta for support carries. Karma would have, without a doubt been the best champion in that meta, but Riot changed her before she was able to get her spotlight. Even right now, Karma would fit well into the meta of midlane, and even as support. Idk, I miss her kit and character. Now she's all war hungry and mean, instead of peaceful and torn between saving her people and remaining calm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2015-01-12T00:50:08.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot hated her old kit with passion, so it's very unlikely she'll come back.","replies":[]}]}
