I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems with your game client. I'm here to help, so let's work together to get this resolved. It appears that there was a Windows 10 Anniversary update that was released that is causing problems like players crashing out of the client or fps issues. This seems to be specifically caused by a new feature called the Game DVR. To resolve this go to your Xbox settings in your Windows 10 settings and disable Game DVR. If that does not work, roll back the anniversary update that Windows 10 released by restoring to a point before the update or uninstalling the update altogether. \nThanks,\n\nBowlO'Ramen \nTech Support - Fizz OP\n\"Lunch time!\" \n\n____This is what BowlO'Ramen suggested to fix the problem. I can't say I tried it because I restored my whole PC to Fac settings to get it to work before this option became available to me.
