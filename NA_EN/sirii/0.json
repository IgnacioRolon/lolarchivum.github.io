Maybe you are recalling all of the memorable, unacceptable events from a gaming session.\n\nEven if a player doesn't get penalized, remember that if they continue with unacceptable behavior it will catch up with them.

Looking at your match history, you have one game where you are elise, and another game where you are shaco and talon is on your team. Right now, it's very confusing to follow which game you are talking about since you are talking about both game. \n\nMoreover, Riot Tantram is not intentionally misconstruing everything you are typing. They can see all your chat logs, while the general public cannot.
