Now after I run the installer and start the actual LoL executable the boot logo appears and the yellow bar starts to fill, but eventually it goes away and then about 30 minutes later I get an error that reads something along the lines of Bugsplatrc.dll resource missing.  After that, every time I try to open league again, the boot logo shows and then disappears.  The processes \"LoL Patcher\", PVP.net Patcher Kernel\", and \"Riot Client Patcher\" are always left running but not doing anything, they show up in the Task Manager.\r\n\r\nI'm running Windows 10 64 bit","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-25T23:23:19.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Bugsplatrc.dll error is typically an indication that something went wrong with your reinstall of League. Most of the time this can be resolved by grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and completing a clean reinstall. Simply run the application, then check the boxes for both **Reinstall** and **Clean uninstall**. After the application has finished running, simply find the League shortcut, right click on it, then run as administrator.\n\nLet me know if these steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Teamplayer1234","date":"2016-08-28T00:16:27.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried using the tool and it didn't seem to change anything, the problem is still occurring as I originally described.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T16:48:46.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange!
