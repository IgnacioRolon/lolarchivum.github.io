I feel like their are so many champions out there who have had only one skin for far too long. Sometimes I wish my artistic skills were good enough to produce a whole bunch of skins, but i digress. Someone out there, either Riot or the League community, needs to get this going. For far to long, new skins have came out for champs who already have like 6 skins already. While these skins are just SO awesome, I wonder why it is that someone like Jinx, Braum, or even Azir only have ONE other skin. They've been out for months, and STILL they only have their one other skin. All I'm saying is lets start showing these champs that have only their one other skin some more attention when creating new skin ideas.
