I doubt there is anything I can do but I do remember the year it got sold in 2011 and I also remember the old summoner name \"--snip--\" now that has been changed and I have since made another account with that set name so i don't even know if it could be found but i would love it if it could and i could get my old account back because i had some really cool things on that account \n---snip--","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T23:17:54.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a really unfortunate case, and I'm not sure what we can do but we can try!
