I dont want an expensive one though, a mid range like 50$.  I have look through soooo many headsets and the ones i liked i noticed there were 2 jacks, 1 for mic and 1 for sound. The problem is my laptop only has a headphone/mic combo jack and i know i can fix this by getting an adapter but i dont want to, i just wish there were decent headsets that have a USB and  will last a long time and a decent mic.","replies":[]}
