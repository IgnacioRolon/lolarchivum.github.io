Already have the 1350 skin for Garen and don't play Darius enough to want a skin for him.","replies":[{"poster":"Surazaku","date":"2015-03-20T20:41:22.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya but your 1 person what about the other people who play both champions or main them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2015-03-20T20:41:04.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you mean by \"they are essentially the same brothers fighting on opposite sides.\", but lore-wise, Garen and Darius only know each other as opponents. Darius and Draven are actual brothers, while Garen's sibling is his sister, Luxanna Crownguard (Lux, for short.)

It might also be fun to come out with some other skins between \"similar\" champions.  Another good couple would be Lux and Morganna, as their kits are VERY similar (Q:  Skill Shot Stun, W:  Shield, E: AoE damage) or maybe change around Volibear and Sejuani with \"Bear Rider Sej\" and \"Voli-Boar\" for fun.","replies":[]}]}
