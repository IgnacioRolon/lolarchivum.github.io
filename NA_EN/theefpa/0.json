When you have an unstable connection, the patcher isn't able to grab the data from our servers so all it shows is a black screen. Let's follow the [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if we can get you set up with a more stable connection.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"TheeFPA","date":"2017-03-20T00:12:49.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so I downloaded the hextech repair tool and I tried running it with the \"force patch\" box checked and then \"chromium embedded framework client application has stopped working\" popped up.

Whenever I try to force repatch another tab pops up that says \"chromium embedded framework (CEF) client application has stopped working\". I already tried what you have suggested yet it still doesn't work and the same thing pops up. I've been trying to play league for ages now and I had it downloaded weeks ago and I always had problems and once i resolved one problem another comes up, hopefully this will be the last one so I hope you'll be able to note me on what to do soon.","replies":[{"poster":"007Deadshot","date":"2017-11-16T03:29:55.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=shy snuggles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=lmhdOtH3,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-13T17:56:05.366+0000)\n>\n> I have the exact problem.
