At first I was feeling uncertain about it, but after viewing the boards for the past few days, and seeing what the community and Rioters had to contribute to the conversation, I gotta say I&#039;m on board with this.\r\n\r\nGetting to the point though, whether you agree or disagree with how Riot&#039;s approaching the preseason, you have to hand it to them for sticking through and communicating with us to see our viewpoints on the matter. MAJOR shoutouts to Riot Cactopus though for being so thorough  though in the past 3 days or so. This is the communication that really shines through for Riot. Even from the beginning of the topic of new runes, they&#039;ve been letting us know in advance to get our feedback on such topics; whether that be through boards, videos, Ask Riot, or the client itself. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, like I said, whether you agree with these changes or not you gotta appreciate the conversation here. From myself and (hopefully) the community, I wanna say thanks for talking with us and not leaving us in the dark about this preseason. Much love for the game and I hope this coming season will be the brightest yet! \r\n{{sticker:galio-happy}} \r\n\r\n(PS I really hope this isn&#039;t in the wrong discussion topic)","replies":[]}
