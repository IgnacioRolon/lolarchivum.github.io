So, I'm able to start League of Legends, to log in and start myself a game. When I choose to go for a ranked game I'm able to sit through the banns. But when you get to the choose your champion part my client freezes at the first pick at 42 seconds every time.\r\n\r\n2. When I try to start a blind pick I'm able to finish the prelobby with picks and all, but when the loading screen opens I do not see enemy team or friendly team picks, but only 10 empty frames . I noticed that on the bottem right side the circulair timer did not load, it's frozen. \r\n\r\nNo idea how this occurs everytime, can somebody PLEASE HELP!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nProbably the most addicted League player of EUW.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T18:41:59.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a connection issue that's failing to download assets (black screen) and reach the game server.  You'll want to go over the the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this, but test it in a custom game to be sure.  That should get you fixed up and the addiction flowing.  :p","replies":[]}]}
