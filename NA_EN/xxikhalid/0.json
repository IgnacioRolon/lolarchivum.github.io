We should be able to get that taken care of in your ticket, but keep in mind that we need to get some kind of artwork first. It's like a trade! You make some artwork like a drawing of a Poro or your favorite champion, and in return we could possibly help you with a little RP. \n\nRemember that you'll need to be patient, since if you reply to the ticket before we do it'll be bumped to the end of the line and you'll have to wait longer. You should be getting a response soon!","replies":[]}]}
