So i recently started to decay in flex queue and was forced to play a game just to reset the decay status and figured i would check it out to see if it has improved at all. It hasn&#039;t, and is arguably worse. \r\n\r\nThe &quot;challenger&quot; players of this game mode consists of mainly those who want to put a ton of games to climb due to the extremely low player base and ease to climb. In fact, there are countless players who have &quot;earned&quot; challenger in this game mode yet there skill and solo q rank level reflects that of gold level or lower players. This issue is also contributed to by the fact that since there is a low player base, players with greatly varying ranks such as bronze and diamond players will be put into the same games.\r\n\r\n While dynamic queue does not really affect the experience of a solo q player, it feels silly that it replaces a previously good system (ranked 5&#039;s) which teams could use to gain experience. What takes the cherry on the cake is the fact that the end of season rewards will be gifted to players whose ranks do not reflect their skill level at all. The ranked flex queue game mode needs to be addressed before the season comes to a close because there will be an influx of players rushing to get the end of season rewards while the consistent flex queue players will already be established in ranked and receive rewards that do not signify their efforts. An example of this is that if a gold level player reaches 800 lp challenger in flex queue and there is a month left to the season ending, they may just end the season as challenger even though they are a gold player due to the nature of ranked decay. \r\n\r\nTo sum it all up, the ranked flex queue system was a complete failure of a game mode and Riot needs to admit their failures instead of living in a false reality and pulling irrelevant statistics, similar to the situation when solo q was removed. Afterwards, flex queue needs to be revised either by replacing it with ranked 5s or through other means in order to maintain game stability.","replies":[]}
