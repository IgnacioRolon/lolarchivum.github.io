You could fight the same person twice, with 0 change in your champions, items and positions. Lose the first fight and win the second.

Players can still get absolutely nothing for items while others get 10 in the same time period.\r\n\r\nAnd adding new champions into the mix just further complicates and pollutes the already nonsensical store/pick; because it just got that much harder to get champions you need.\r\n\r\nAlso I am almost 100% convinced that after a certain level, some champions get removed from your store rotation, making the above even harder. Or if they aren't removed, they become that much harder to get since they don't show up as often because you are mainly seeing higher rarity champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2019-08-19T23:23:21.247+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":11,"body":"If it was pure RNG, than players wouldn't be able to climb to grandmaster / challenger by winning consistently ;). **Yes** there is certainly *more* RNG in TFT than say, League, but its not *all* RNG, if that makes sense.
