I have tried EVERYTHING on the FPS guide Riot has and it isn&#039;t my machine seeing as how I can run Destiny 2 at 200 fps on high. Is it an issue with the patch and if so, when is the fix coming cause this is really infuriating.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T18:51:01.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate trying all the steps in the guide, it sucks that your framerate has dropped so harshly.  :(  What OS are you running?

I have also tried to disable eye candy and run the game on low with a 20 fps cap and still drops","replies":[]}]}]}
