Then, how will we have stat boosts, rather than &quot;playstyle&quot; boosts? \r\nMy main concern is that I spent ~10k IP on Crit Damage Runes for when I play Miss Fortune whom I main, but Crit Damage isn&#039;t a stat that is very widely used (or cared for, or known at all even. I had no idea those Runes even existed before). What will happen to that with the new Rune system? I don&#039;t expect it to randomly have a Crit Damage thing when nobody uses that, but then what will I do? Will I be forced to give up playing Miss Fortune the way _I_ personally like, which I thought the Rune system was all about? Will I be forced to change my MF playstyle into something everyone else is playing? Will you really take the uniqueness of my playstyle away from me with the new Rune system? Doesn&#039;t that go against the point?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m hoping there will be an alternative for everything that can be bought as Runes right now. Everything is used by someone out there.

Preseason changes are _huge_. They tend to change part of the basic nature of the game. Last preseason - with the assassin and lethality changes - was weirdly small, but... before Preseason 6, masteries were trees without keystones, where many of the best masteries had prerequistes in addition to a minimum number of points spend in the tree. There were specific playstyles lost from the change (losing 5% AP -> on-hit damage actually weakened on-hit champs more than I would've thought), but, on the other hand, there were playstyles gain (and everyone - _everyone_ - used Thunderlords for about two or three straight months). We gained the ability to have 45% CDR and %shield/heals boosts (and to give our allies resists!), but we lost the ability to start the game with 15% CDR, +40 gold, and +1.5 Gp10. Losing Tough Skin (-2 damage from neutral monsters) and Bladed Armor (1% current health/second bleed on neutral monster when they attacked you) meant that a _lot_ of off-meta junglers lost their ability to jungle at all, especially combined with a more difficult jungle. We lost Expose Weakness for a while (Though we eventually got it back), and we us CDR supports had to choose between damage and CDR from masteries, meaning that suddenly the class now known as Enchanters was _much_ more powerful.\n\nSo yes, in short, things change massively every preseason. Being able to adapt and find new and different playstyles is a major part of playing League of Legends, and always has been. I'm sure there'll be new, fun, weird things you'll find. There always are. Things change, but that doesn't mean they get worse! In fact, some legends say...\n\n{{champion:121}}: Change... is good!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2017-06-19T01:48:09.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't removing the ability to buy Void Staff and Wit's End on Gnar.
