So an idea would be a baseball ward skin? Where it&#039;s shaped like a trophy with a baseball on the top? Just wondering because LOL is about LOL and not sports but I would like to include them to be diverse. Ty for actually reading this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-27T16:47:45.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya MisterReyes,\n\nWhen creating ward skins, we try to tie them to something in the realm of League of Legends. Generally, they're tied to events (Bilgewater, Lunar Revel, etc), Champions (Lux, Draven) or e-sports (Championship). \n\nSports certainly aren't out of the question in League (there are some olympic skins in the legacy vault), however, it's less likely since there are other opportunities that align better with in-game content.","replies":[]}]}
