I have the appropriate boxes checked regarding map and champion.  There is no pulldown menu to select from in the shop to see my  custom item sets.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me with this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-06T21:58:32.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your item sets may be corrupted. This should be resolved with a config reset with the steps below:\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into the game** then navigate to your install directory:\n\n**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the folder named **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, close League out, then relog. Create a test item set and see if it shows up in-game. Let me know if this helped! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Maximus Paine","date":"2016-12-31T16:17:42.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean delete the config folder and re-create a bunch of items sets again from scratch???\n\nI hope not, or you should find a way to restore the sets or import them somehow. They are present in the legacy Game Client Shop and editable in the Legacy client too. \n\nYou must have taken into consideration that the new client has to read the item set data from the old client. So there's a bug, not data corruption.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hungri Hippo","date":"2016-09-08T12:39:12.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I will be sure to try this after work later.  tyvm for the reply!","replies":[]}]}]}
