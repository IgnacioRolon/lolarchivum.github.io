I recommend using our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide for steps on updating your drivers and making sure your new pc is in its best shape to game.  Also, keep in mind that you can have this issue if your resolution is set too high (I noticed the monitor might support 4K).  4K is not currently supported, so you may need to reduce your in-game resolution as well as your monitor for your best display.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
