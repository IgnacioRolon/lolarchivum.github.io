The recent changes to [Fervor of Battle](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-ferocity) and [armor penetration](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-lethality), as well as the earlier [turret changes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-615-notes#patch-sr), have made botlane a wreck. \r\n\r\nWith botlane&#039;s turret being not as strong as the others, and first turret gold being a sizable chunk of money, it is no longer uncommon to see every single member of a team in the botlane to try and cash in on this. If one team doesn&#039;t join in, their botlane is rendered effectively useless, having lost their turret, farm, ability to push, and the enemy botlane having a sizable advantage over them with kill and tower gold. If both teams go bot, the botlaners still tend to suffer in experience from farming, and kills on enemy botlanes can end up going to the rest of the team instead of the bot. This means that it is extremely difficult for traditional botlanes to get early advantages that, in the current meta, they need to be relevant in the lategame. \r\n\r\nAnother contributing factor is that the aforementioned preseason changes to Fervor and Armor Penetration remove key earlygame power from essentially every single traditional botlane. The patch before these changes, Miss Fortune had the [highest winrate of adcs](http://na.op.gg/champion/missfortune/statistics/adc), being a 54.64%. Notice how she has the second highest winrate for shorter games. You can see the correlation between earlygame power and winrate. {The highest winrate for short games? [Ziggs](http://na.op.gg/champion/ziggs/statistics/adc).} Now, the highest winrate of traditional adcs is [Kog&#039;maw](http://na.op.gg/champion/kogmaw/statistics/adc), at 52.96%. \r\n\r\nOverall, the winrate for traditional adcs are down. Why? Because adcs no longer have as much of an effect on the game as a whole. Without any earlygame power and with botlane being a 5v5 moshpit, it&#039;s no longer up to the botlane what happens. It&#039;s more about the junglers or midlaners who get the kills from the botlane massacres and carry. Attack damage carry is no longer a proper name for these champions, because they simply don&#039;t carry anymore. This is the reason why off-the-wall stuff like Ziggs Botlane is now meta: because traditional adcs aren&#039;t. Reverting the preseason change to Fervor would help alleviate this issue, unless Riot is fine with letting an entire class of champions die in favor of one turret destroying Yordle. The solution isn&#039;t to nerf Ziggs; it&#039;s to buff the adcs.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I&#039;m not upset that Ziggs is botlane; I&#039;ve played and enjoyed it. I would be fine if Ziggs were relatively common to go bot. But the fact that he has a higher winrate than every single other botlane is an issue, which is why everyone else needs a bump up. Reverting the Fervor of Battle change would do that.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve added a poll so I can see what the rest of the community thinks about the Ziggs bot issue, and please feel free to leave feedback on my analysis in the comments. I&#039;ll try to respond to as much of it as I can.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-04T20:45:35.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot should really stop trying to enforce meta and just let stuff happen, carefully buff/nerf as it does.

This is one of those instances. There are around 15 champions which have the sole purpose of 'attack damage carry'. They may have let things like botlane Morde die, but that's one champion. I'd imagine that the audience of players who solo main or only play champions in this pool of 15 is higher than the ones who solo main Morde. As a game dev, I wouldn't want 12% of my champions to become irrelevant all at once. It's bad business.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-04T20:41:53.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you want tank/bruiser Yasuo back?
