This week, we're banning botted accounts.  We want each and every game to feel competitive, and having bots on your team cripples your ability to work together as a team toward victory.  As a result of these bans, we expect players will encounter fewer bots in their games, but there's still more we can do in our efforts against bots.\r\n\r\nWe wish we could provide more context, but we won't be answering questions about how we detect bots to avoid being reverse engineered. Just know that we're committed to keeping these bots down.  We'll continue to improve detection as bots try to get around it, and we're working toward other solutions that will decrease motivations for botting.","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2015-06-17T20:16:37.479+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the hard work.\n\nAny chance you guys can add an option to the report feature for people that we suspect are cheating or botting so we can weed them out faster for you?","replies":[{"poster":"The Wolff","date":"2015-06-17T20:27:07.163+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"Getting community support to identify bots can be helpful for investigations, and I'm excited to hear you want to help.

By that, I mean that when you first start playing the game, you start playing just to get frustrated at it, toss something at the screen, and then curse the heavens for a few weeks before you get bored of the next game or a friend calls you back, and you give it another shot. Before inevitably quitting again.\n\nI feel that levels off heavily after level 30 because of the even games, though not always by skill. I don't think that's a bad thing.\n\nThing is, unlike most genres of games, MOBAs in general might best represent a board game. Extremely confined playing field, very similar play of objects on both sides, a start and an end that gets repetitive between games, and strategy to progress through the game.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nNow let's compare to one such popular board game, Monopoly.\n\nLoL lets you pick the strategy you want to play. You can play the support, akin to the purples or light-blues, a good early build to get moving, in an attempt to squander the higher roles before they can get their full footing, but not likely to win the game alone. You can play the bruiser, akin to the light purples and oranges, who tend to need a burst of early game effort to ensure the endgame goes their way. You can play the tank, akin to the reds and the yellows, and sacrifice a heavy amount of health (often relying on support disruption) to shut down any real counterplay late game. And then there's the greens and blues... those darned carries that need help from just about everyone it seems... But they manage this much power, and you better start teaming up against that fella. Immunities galore amongst other teammates to ensure that carry goes down before dangerous.\n\nAnd then there's assassins. They want to be everywhere at all times, and poke for heavy damage early with **NO MONEY WHATSOEVER**, but (should) fall off heavily late. Clearly, they must be the railroads/utilities.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nSo, I can pay you money to ensure that I get the doggy as my character (Warwick). But not just the doggy. I want that doggy that ate that manatee, because that looks cooler on the board. However, I am playing this game, and people are starting off with full sets of light purples and oranges, and new people aren't able to afford it yet. How can you make fun games for people when leveling up often occurs with not only better Monopoly strategizers, they also start with properties initially. It's not fun. I have also gotten a taste of the 1-30 climb again after I made it the first time (legitimately), and it's a challenge as a veteran player, on several levels. But, one of the easiest leveling tools to fix, the easiest to remedy the situation, should have been simply to make the board even on all sides, though they *may* not be able to afford all the fix-ins for every strat possible... they should at least feel that their strat has a fighter's chance of pulling out a victory in the end.\n\nSo, c'mon, banker. I'm tired of you handing over properties during pre-game just because they have played a meager amount more than me. I want an even playing field. I want my *low-leveled friends* to have an even playing field, as it's not so fun to see them torn to shreds by a slightly unfortunate roll of the dice. A lost game should feel like *I played wrong*. I shouldn't feel like the board was set up against me, especially as a new player.\n\nI don't want to say that new players are fully ready to rock the League at playtime of a level 10 player. But at least have them play the same game as we are so that they can actually practice it. For some reason, they're playing goalie in a WAY bigger net.
