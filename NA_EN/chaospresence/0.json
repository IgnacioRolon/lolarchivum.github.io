We'll restore a backup version and try updating again after you restart the patcher.**_\" So i clicked on the \"_**Restart**_\" button. The client closed and reloaded as stated, and I received a message saying, \"_**We have restored this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.**_\" So I click \"_**Okay**_\", and the first window with the error message pops up immediately after. I am stuck in an endless loop of restarting and being restored and can't login or move past the error windows. Mind you, I've had the newest launcher for several weeks, and have been up to date with all recent patches. This has not been a recurring issue, and is a first time issue. I've tried restarting my computer, running normally and as admin, i'm not sure what else to do. I will try uninstalling and reinstalling in the meantime. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Paceboy","date":"2017-08-12T16:52:50.233+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"weird how all these comments are only several minutes old... this is happening to me too","replies":[{"poster":"JDB4","date":"2017-08-12T18:30:36.618+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PokeRanger69,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=k7xmElhu,comment-id=0008000300040000000200000000,timestamp=2017-08-12T17:32:27.400+0000)\n>\n> FOUND A HOTFIX:\n> Set the date and time back a day and an hour to fix spaghetti code\n\nWorked for me and some other folks!","replies":[{"poster":"NoobBehindU","date":"2018-01-26T05:09:02.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actualy worked for me, thanks summoner! ;) {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ErgoproxyXD","date":"2017-08-12T16:58:52.469+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"yea lol, on a 4 month old post.
