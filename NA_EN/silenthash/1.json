It's loaded into the client twice and then suddenly disconnects me again. Anyone else having this issue?\n\nEdit: And it's taking longer than usual to start the launch process. Just got into the client again and then suddenly says there's a problem with my connection. \n\nEdit 2: A lot of people seem to be having the same issue, so it's a problem on their end! They've acknowledged the issue so  hopefully they'll fix it soon!

I'm clearly still connected to the internet, checked my own connections though to make sure and regardless of how many times I restart the client it's still giving me this message. As soon as the client pops up that connection message accompanies it, so I can't launch through the legacy client, or login, or anything. Going to see if it kicks itself out, if not I might be forced to reinstall and see if that helps. My friend's having the same issue as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Allenah","date":"2016-11-23T03:53:29.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My fiance and I are having the same issue logging in.

Navigate to toolbar and right click the client icon and click \"close window\".\n2. When league asks you if you want to exit, click no\n3. Connection error should go away\n\nMac:\n1. go do your doc and right click league client icon and click quit\n2.  When league asks you if you want to exit, click no\n3.
