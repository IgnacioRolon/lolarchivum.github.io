It's also the first skin I am buying, so is there any chance I get the skin discounts before the reset?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nKatarouu","replies":[{"poster":"Thatfire111","date":"2017-09-23T17:51:49.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i want my champion ship zed with 50%","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thatfire111","date":"2017-09-23T17:49:08.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can somoene help","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thatfire111","date":"2017-09-23T17:20:47.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i try a ticket and i already send the ticket\nBut i dont receive the championship zed\nPorocles help me","replies":[]},{"poster":"M00STER","date":"2017-09-21T00:45:48.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does the your shop refresh every day or every week?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T15:24:24.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, just the current set you have now.
