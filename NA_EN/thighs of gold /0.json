But as you know gold is tight, with national treasures being stolen from our kingdom everyday by Noxus bandits. We need an emperor that is strong, fearless, and with 300 k plus mastery - a Waring Kingdoms emperor. Please, all we ask is 1 RP from the Riot federal government to sent to our representative Thighs of Gold. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\na humble Shuriman citizen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T17:27:07.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh dear, it sounds like the emperor is waring a lack of treasures.  Maybe if he did something about stopping the Noxus bandits, there would be a better abundance.  Emperor of the year.  https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/25/1.0\n\nNo worries, Zilean is in need of some Shuriman sand to fill his hourglass.  You might find that he offered you a small profit on your account in exchange.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Thighs of Gold ","date":"2017-09-22T17:41:52.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys are awesome, thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
