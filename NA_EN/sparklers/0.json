It seems when Amumu dies with that skin on and get revived by a Zilean ulti, the skin loses its ribbon??? I was able to view this on the replay, I as well saw it during my game and the person I was duoing with saw it too.\nIf you want to do this yourself just make sure you are in a game using the Regifted Amumu skin and have someone play Zilean and revive you when you die.\nI'm not sure if this happens with Guardian Angel too but yea. Happens with Zilean ulti.\n\n\nScreenshot Gyazo thingy: https://gyazo.com/0397a7bdee458d5ec643999ccb16a00b\nYoutube Video of the replay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3YtIxb1Kms","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-03-01T18:12:11.872+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there! \n\nAs if this poor dude didn't have it hard enough. ;_; Thanks for the report! We'll poke around and see what may be causing this to occur. I assume it has to do with any sort of revive.
