As the game player base grew, Tribunal couldn't keep up with the volume of reports that need to be judged and people were being punished months from the time they were reported (essentially allowing people to be toxic for months without receiving any kind of punishment or ban).\n\nRito created the Instant Feedback System (known as IFS) to automate the judging and punishment process.  It is a machine learning system and was initially fed data from Tribunal.  We were told RIto does manually review cases to make sure the IFS is working properly and players always have the option to submit a support ticket to ask for a human manual review.

It should activate fairly quickly within minutes.  The punishment for chat base toxicity is based on 2 things: frequency * severity.\n\nIf the chat is deemed mildly toxic, you will have a certain amount of black marks on your account.  Once your toxic meter reaches a certain threshold, you will be issue a punishment based on 4 tier of escalating punishment:  10 game chat restrictions, 25 game chat restrictions, 14-day ban, perma-ban.  Wherever you are on the punishment ladder, you'll just receive the next tier (e.g. if you already have a 25 game CR, you will receive 14-day ban on your next punishment).  As explained, if you chat is deemed mildly toxic and it does not push your toxic meter to punishment level, then you will not receive any punishment.  Because of that, it may gives players the perceived assumption that the IFS is not working and your report against a player is not doing anything.  Rito does give some linencies to mild toxicity because they understand sometimes players may have an off day and becomes mildly toxic on very rare occasion.  You will NEVER be punished just from one game of mild toxicity.  You will only be punished if you are frequently mildly toxic in your games.  (not sure if this answer your question).\n\nRito has a list of word what they called zero tolerance: homophobic, racism, sexism, hate speech, etc. that is more or less a word filter.  If you use any of those word, you will be escalated straight to 14-day ban even if that is the only game you are toxic in.  This is the severity part of the equation.\n\nThe second part of the IFS is the game play detection for such things as trolling, inting, griefing, etc.  This is the part the community complain the most and most will agree it doesn't really do its job very well.  I've been told there are a lot of human manual review of reports for these categories.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SanZero","date":"2019-07-19T05:57:48.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see thank you for the information","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-19T07:22:22.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BW4EtXPO,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-18T19:04:47.152+0000)\n>\n> I consider chat such as this\n> SanZero: i can make this an ff if you want\n> SanZero: say it\n> SanZero: want me to show you how i can be useless jhin ?\n> ...\n> SanZero: ill show you how kid i am\n> SanZero: i am gonna troll\n> [All]SanZero: go ff i am trolling\n> [All]SanZero: yes i am\n> [All]SanZero: yes pls\n> SanZero: nah\n> SanZero: no thanks\n> SanZero: eather give me free win\n> SanZero: or i give you free lose\n> SanZero: ur choice\n> SanZero: ?\n> SanZero: u are 5v5\n> SanZero: cant you read ?\n> SanZero: see why i do this ?\n> SanZero: ask jhin\n> SanZero: nope\n> SanZero: eather he give free win or i give free lose\n> SanZero: we well see how u carry this\n> \n> Easily worthy of a punishment.
