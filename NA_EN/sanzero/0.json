I am Blitzcrank Bot. My purpose is to provide a fast and thorough explanation of your recent ban.\r\n> \r\n> Players have reported you 6 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games, griefing your fellow players, and generally being difficult to play with over a large number of matches and teammates.\r\n> \r\n> Here are some chat logs from games where you were heavily reported:\r\n> Pre Game Lobby:\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> In Game:\r\n>     SanZero: ?\r\n>     SanZero: ty\r\n>     SanZero: look at the minion\r\n>     SanZero: what jhin ?\r\n>     SanZero: useless pick u say ?\r\n>     SanZero: want me to show you how useless i am ?\r\n>     SanZero: i can make this an ff if you want\r\n>     SanZero: say it\r\n>     SanZero: want me to show you how i can be useless jhin ?\r\n>     SanZero: acting like you cant read huh\r\n>     SanZero: stop talking ?\r\n>     SanZero: why ?\r\n>     SanZero: u are the one starting\r\n>     SanZero: saying useless pick\r\n>     SanZero: and says stop[ talking\r\n>     SanZero: omg\r\n>     [All]SanZero: dont forget report jhin for flame\r\n>     [All]SanZero: see\r\n>     [All]SanZero: reprot him pls\r\n>     SanZero: kid\r\n>     SanZero: ok\r\n>     SanZero: ill show you how kid i am\r\n>     SanZero: i am gonna troll\r\n>     [All]SanZero: go ff i am trolling\r\n>     [All]SanZero: yes i am\r\n>     [All]SanZero: yes pls\r\n>     SanZero: nah\r\n>     SanZero: no thanks\r\n>     SanZero: eather give me free win\r\n>     SanZero: or i give you free lose\r\n>     SanZero: ur choice\r\n>     SanZero: ?\r\n>     SanZero: u are 5v5\r\n>     SanZero: cant you read ?\r\n>     SanZero: see why i do this ?\r\n>     SanZero: ask jhin\r\n>     SanZero: nope\r\n>     SanZero: eather he give free win or i give free lose\r\n>     SanZero: we well see how u carry this\r\n>     SanZero: pls what ?\r\n>     SanZero: us ?\r\n>     SanZero: morg and jhin\r\n>     SanZero: no\r\n>     SanZero: why u say  huh ?\r\n>     SanZero: ask urself why\r\n>     SanZero: so jhin\r\n>     SanZero: carry ?\r\n>     [All]SanZero: ?\r\n>     [All]SanZero: he talk about himself\r\n>     [All]SanZero: gg\r\n>     [All]SanZero: its done\r\n>     [All]SanZero: trading huh\r\n>     [All]SanZero: lol\r\n>     [All]SanZero: izi\r\n>     [All]SanZero: izi\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Post Game Lobby:\r\n>     SanZero: free 18 lp\r\n> \r\nthen he said unrelated and unimportant story after that.\r\n \r\nthe first thing I noticed that it says \"Players have reported you 6 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat\", and I was thinking   \" HOLY!! when the hell did that happened?\"\r\n\r\n**so I asked for \"human request\",so  after one day someone called Naagaens a Player Support Specialist respond to me with: **\r\n> Hey there dude,\r\n> \r\n> Naagaens here from Heimerdinger's Pyrotecnic Provisions\r\n> \r\n> This is frustrating, I know, getting a suspension and all, and I completely understand what you're going through. you're trying your best to win the game, but your teammate(or even teammates) have other plans. I've been there. So, I went ahead and looked over the account in question to see what I can do and I'd like to talk a bit with you about what happened.\r\n> \r\n> Now, I won't go into a lot of details, but as you can see below, there are a few things that we absolutely do not want to see in the games:\r\n> \r\n> [3:47] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): useless pick u say ?\r\n> [3:55] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): want me to show you how useless i am ?\r\n> [4:16] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): i can make this an ff if you want\r\n> [4:28] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): say it\r\n> [4:52] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): want me to show you how i can be useless jhin ?\r\n> [5:12] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): acting like you cant read huh\r\n> \r\n> [12:17] [All] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): dont forget report jhin for flame\r\n> \r\n> [13:08] [All] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): reprot him pls\r\n> \r\n> [15:56] [All] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): go ff i am trolling\r\n> \r\n> [21:04] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): eather give me free win\r\n> [21:11] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): or i give you free lose\r\n> [21:23] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): ur choice\r\n> \r\n> [23:53] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): eather he give free win or i give free lose\r\n> [25:18] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): we well see how u carry this\r\n> \r\n> [29:53] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): so jhin\r\n> [29:56] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): carry ?\r\n> \r\n> [33:56] [All] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): lol\r\n> [34:22] [All] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): izi\r\n> [35:19] [All] SanZero (Fiddlesticks): izi\r\n> \r\n> Thing is, defending yourself, while that might seem okay, I can assure you that it'll only make things worse.\r\n> \r\n> What I'm trying to say is that, if the other person is negative, and doesn't want to listen, it will turn everything into a circle of hate, and it can only go downhill from there, my friend.\r\n> \r\n> The best way to go about this is to stop this circle is by stopping any form of communication with the negative intent, and that will help both you(by not getting you as tilted) and the other players as well.\r\n> \r\n> Now don't get me wrong, the other player's behavior may not have been any better, but it's not about them right now. I understand that in some cases, it can be hard to deal with players that intentionally make the game hard for you and try to get in your way. In moments like these it is best to show that you are the better player and keep a cool head and reach for the victory screen. Please remember that fighting fire with fire only creates a bigger flame and that will never direct you to victory.\r\n> \r\n> The reason we placed that restriction, is because we have checked the chat log from that match and some previous games. You see - negativity has many forms, from the early GG's and sarcastic congratulations, annoying whining in chat, harassment or just comments that distract rather than help, flame rather than aid, or telling people to report someone. Keep in mind that it isn't limited just to the things I mentioned here, but this is to give you a better understanding of it.\r\n> \r\n> All in all, after checking(and double checking) the account and the chat-logs, the restriction you received was placed accordingly, and we cannot remove or modify it due to the fact that you created a negative environment for others.\r\n> \r\n> I hope I've managed to shed some light over your case.\r\n> \r\n> Naagaens\r\n> \r\n> The Revered Inventor's Apprentice/Player Support Specialist\r\n\r\nThat was pretty weird... he said a similar thing \"The reason we placed that restriction, is because we have checked the chat log from that match and some previous games.\", while he and the blitz bot referring on the same chat from one game and both saying there is another game , i asked them to present what happened, at that time I already finished my 10 game and I care less about the penalty that I got, but when I saw the reason they mentioned that really tilted me so I said : \r\n> \r\n> Well... I am sure that is defending myself is not a wrong thing in any case , that's my be a philosophy argument and that's not why i ma here , the thing is i admit i made a mistakes on the chat you show me above in saying 'izi' , tho I didn't do anything , hence had no right of saying that , and also the part of asking for reports . \r\n> you said \"chat log from that match and some previous games.\" i wish you listed too , because the blitz bot says similar thing above \"Players have reported you 6 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games\" just to see where is the mistake that i made . \r\n> the thing i am not in agree with you is if you are talking about what i am saying in chat is an abusive then please show me where i abuse or insult someone in the history you listed above , and the other thing , the penalty isn't fit the mistake , you see ... limiting the chat for 10 games and dropping honor to zero and locking it is too much for a penalty for what i said if you look closely i didn't say a single bad word while i took many of bad words insults and verbal abuse , and here i am as you can see chat limit + honor drop . \r\n> you see... I don't see any of use talking now because i have almost finished my 10 games and the topic went cold anyway , to sum up ... the restriction I received wasn't placed accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Then I got a response from another Player Support Specialist called AYAME :\r\n**\r\n> Hello,\r\n> \r\n> Ayame here from @Player Support Team.\r\n> \r\n> The chat is there to help you coordinate with your team. You can tell them what they are doing wrong, as long as you are doing it in a neutral or positive manner.\r\n> \r\n> I checked your chat log and it seems that the restriction was issued correctly. I have noticed the following negative actions:\r\n> \r\n> spamming the chat\r\n> \r\n> threatening other players\r\n> \r\n> [3:47] Fiddlesticks: useless pick u say ?\r\n> [3:55] Fiddlesticks: want me to show you how useless i am ?\r\n> [4:16] Fiddlesticks: i can make this an ff if you want\r\n> [4:28] Fiddlesticks: say it\r\n> [4:52] Fiddlesticks: want me to show you how i can be useless jhin ?\r\n> [5:12] Fiddlesticks: acting like you cant read huh\r\n> [5:28] Fiddlesticks: stop talking ?\r\n> [5:36] Fiddlesticks: why ?\r\n> [5:54] Fiddlesticks: u are the one starting\r\n> [5:58] Fiddlesticks: saying useless pick\r\n> [6:04] Fiddlesticks: and says stop[ talking\r\n> [6:10] Fiddlesticks: omg\r\n> calling for reports\r\n> [12:17] [All] Fiddlesticks: dont forget report jhin for flame\r\n> [13:02] [All] Fiddlesticks: see\r\n> [13:08] [All] Fiddlesticks: reprot him pls\r\n> \r\n> giving up\r\n> [13:48] Fiddlesticks: ill show you how kid i am\r\n> [13:51] Fiddlesticks: i am gonna troll\r\n> [15:56] [All] Fiddlesticks: go ff i am trolling\r\n> [16:37] [All] Fiddlesticks: yes i am\r\n> [19:54] [All] Fiddlesticks: yes pls\r\n> \r\n> [21:11] Fiddlesticks: or i give you free lose\r\n> [21:23] Fiddlesticks: ur choice\r\n> [22:13] Fiddlesticks: ?\r\n> [22:15] Fiddlesticks: u are 5v5\r\n> [23:03] Fiddlesticks: cant you read ?\r\n> [23:11] Fiddlesticks: see why i do this ?\r\n> [23:25] Fiddlesticks: ask jhin\r\n> [23:44] Fiddlesticks: nope\r\n> [23:53] Fiddlesticks: eather he give free win or i give free lose\r\n> \r\n> If someone is negative towards you, you just have to mind your game and report them after and we will take care of it. \"Defending yourself\", \"he started first\", \"he said worse things\" aren't excuses.\r\n> \r\n> I'm afraid we have exhausted all possible ways of explaining this situation to you. Please keep in mind that this matter is not up for debate, we are here to inform you of the consequences of your actions which have been thoroughly discussed.\r\n> \r\n> If you have other questions on different topics please let us know, however further inquiries into this particular matter may be left without an answer and subsequently closed.\r\n> \r\n> Ayame\r\n> Player Support Specialist\r\n> \r\n> \"A sword mirrors its owner.\"\r\n\r\nI said to myself wow, I keep asking them about somethings and they answer the things that they like to answer, what happened when I said \r\n> \" you said \"chat log from that match and some previous games.\" i wish you listed too , because the blitz bot says similar thing above \"Players have reported you 6 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games\" just to see where is the mistake that i made\"\r\n\r\nthey simply avoided that point and went to the point they are strong with tho it was clearly not what I want to talk about nor do i care about i even said as mentioned the topic went cold, I don't care about the penalty and the only response I got is about the last thing I said \"the restriction I received wasn't placed accordingly.\" \r\nand she said :\r\n> I'm afraid we have exhausted all possible ways of explaining this situation to you. Please keep in mind that this matter is not up for debate, we are here to inform you of the consequences of your actions which have been thoroughly discussed.\r\n\r\nwow, exhausted all possible ways of explaining this situation? now I feel offended, making me look like I am the one who keeps this up and I don't understand what they write, so I decided to argue with the thing they want me to argue with them about so I said:\r\n> \r\n> it is a chat so what you are calling spam is not a really spamming , i didn't stick on one massage and repeat it through many time .\r\n> \r\n> and yes i am threatening him , why is defending myself while threatening him is an negative attitude ?\r\n> \r\n> and yes i called for report and present the reason at the same time and i didn't spam that like others do you see.\r\n> \r\n> no i didn't give up in any of that and if you mean \" go ff i am trolling\" that \" that's not pointing to giving up in chat \r\n> , you your self put \"u are 5v5\" how is that a giving up if i were to write a giving up statement i would at least write \"u are 4v5\" .\r\n> \r\n> you are saying \" \"Defending yourself\", \"he started first\", \"he said worse things\" aren't excuses. \" excuses for what ?\r\n> \r\n> the concept of \" Defending\" is writing by our friend Naagaens above , no point of it as excuses on that.\r\n> \r\n> \"he started first\" that's not what i said and i am sure you wont here me say it , and if you mean what i said to jhin \"u are the one starting\" i can just say can it be you read the chat from one side ? because i said it as a replay to what he says , i even don't remember what he said that time but i am sure u guys can find out and see by your self .\r\n> \r\n> and after that you said \"he said worse things\" where did i say that ?\r\n> \r\n> the thing i want to say is that your reasons are changing in every replay it starts as \" negative or abusive behaviors \" and went through \" chat log from that match and some previous games \" with \" defending yourself \" \r\n> until \" spamming , threatening , calling for reports ,giving up \" , what kind of judge is that ? it clearly changing per day , that's why i said \"the restriction I received wasn't placed accordingly\" . \r\n> and the end you guys closed the topic on your own and pointed as solved while it is not. saying \" we are here to inform you of the consequences of your actions which have been thoroughly discussed\" and the thing i am here for was not discussed thoroughly , i am here to know why i got the chat limit and honor drop while the reasons obviously are changing per replay and person who handle it from the blitz bot till ayame. \r\n> it appear like you are reading this from one side and charge for the single statement that's why the restriction was not issued correctly.\r\n> \r\nI hoped for a better response.\r\n\r\n**but then someone called IRON MELON another Player Support Specialist said:\r\n**\r\n> Hey there,\r\n> \r\n> Right, so, straight off the bat, I just wanna say I'm sorry that it has gone this far. \r\n> I know you didn't mean to say the things you did. \r\n> I know other players can be annoying, and that annoyance, if left unaddressed can grow into frustration. \r\n> Frustration can grow into bitterness, and sometimes even rage.\r\n> \r\n> I know how annoying it is to be picked on by random online keyboard warriors.\r\n> I understand how confusing it can be to play a match as you usually do, but suddenly see that you've received a punishment.\r\n> I also understand that you may have had the best intentions, and they may not show in the actions you took.\r\n> \r\n> I get why that made you angry!\r\n> \r\n> I know what I'm about to say may seem counter intuitive: \r\n> Arguing in chat, belittling or insulting and judging other players in chat is a behaviour that goes against our rules.\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, starting a chat fight and replying every few seconds in order to keep the argument alive leads to spamming, seeing as at that point, the only purpose of those replies is to taunt or negatively impact/trigger the other player/players.\r\n> \r\n> You may feel they earned it, but it doesn't help you win that match and it may actually increase your chances of loosing it. \r\n> You may actually be right, but you never know if they react negatively to it, and then return with even harsher arguments, turning a small argument in an all out chat fight - which is considered unnecessarily disrupting behaviour. No point risking it.\r\n> If you are too angry to communicate and start snapping at people, it means you may be too angry to focus and the enemy team could take advantage of that - which just leads to more difficulties during the match.\r\n> \r\n> https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/\r\n> Summoner's code section 1, 4, 6 and 7\r\n> \r\n> While I do understand how frustrating things can be, there's no virtual honour at stake that you would need to defend. \r\n> Negativity in a virtual environment doesn't damage anyone's HP, but by retaliating in chat, you risk turning a small argument into an all-out chat fight, which can damage your team's focus and motivation.\r\n> \r\n> Contrary to common belief, fighting negativity with more negativity doesn't stop the other players but encourages them to continue or display even worse behaviour, which is the reason we don't condone chat retaliation or fighting fire with fire.\r\n> \r\n> Last but not least, the summoner's code has not changed, nor have our rules regarding in-game behaviour. \r\n> You can also review the sections listed above, and the article linked bellow for more info: \r\n> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884\r\n> \r\n> Try to find your own way to vent outside the game.\r\n> \r\n> Unfortunately, as the punishment was correctly applied, it will not be lifted.\r\n> \r\n> I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours. \r\n\r\nI said to myself wow, he talked reason, but why dose it seems like he didn't read the full topic? he could at least mention the thing about the other games, but oh well thy clearly they don't want to talk about it, after that I saw the topic is closed and marked as solved, that angers me the most ... nothing is solved in here and why is it closed so I listed him why I can't accept the reasons.\r\n> Thanks Mr.IRON MELON \r\n> At least you are talking reason , explaining why is it bad to act that way and what is the impact of acting so , and i fully understand that . \r\n> but that's not why i am here , nor why this is taking this long .\r\n> \r\n> you see when i went to the site that you were referencing : \r\n> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884\r\n> \r\n> I saw the unacceptable behaviors that would act by riot disciplinary systems which states : \r\n> 1- Insulting, harassing, or offensive language directed at other players.\r\n> \r\n> 2- Any kind of hate speech such as homophobia, sexism, racism, and ableism.\r\n> \r\n> 3- Intentionally ruining the game for other players with in game actions such as griefing, feeding, or purposely \r\n> playing in a way to make it harder for the rest of the team.\r\n> \r\n> 4- Leaving or going AFK at any point during the match being played.\r\n> \r\n> 5- Unnecessarily disruptive language or behavior that derails the match for other players.\r\n> \r\n> 6- Inappropriate Summoner Names. \r\n> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n> and i am sure didn't surpass any of the written above , and if it, you should note that from what i said above to know my mistake . \r\n> what were you pointing in saying \"Arguing in chat, belittling or insulting and judging other players in chat is a behavior that goes against our rules.\" i am sure I was far from that , no word from what i said were directed to the player person by any mean, no bad words , and nothing personal were said , and you can review the chat above to see . \r\n> and in the next point you talked about two things together keeping the argue alive and spamming, and link those two concepts in the way you said \" starting a chat fight and replying every few seconds in order to keep the argument alive leads to spamming, seeing as at that point, the only purpose of those replies is to taunt or negatively impact/trigger the other player/players.\" \r\n> and directing those words as whole at me, I would say it is not a right thing, the starting of a chat fight is a thing and the way of replays grow with it is another , and both of that side i didn't do, and hence no spam -by your way of saying the spam is - is made , and again i still can see you guys are taking the chat from one side alone . \r\n> i noticed you said \" Last but not least, the summoner's code has not changed, nor have our rules regarding in-game behavior. \" , so why i get different reasons per person for the \" punishment , restriction \" that i got if the rules doesn't changes ? \r\n> if it is not changing, you guys are making this way too long for a topic to be discussed , you just can simply show me what i did wrong - regarding the reasons you point in the link you gave- , and link it to what i said in chat , and we get done with it . \r\n> \r\n> as for my penalty as taking chat limit + honor drop that i toke the punishment was not correctly applied , and the topic isn't solved so why again you guys closed and mark it as solved on your own \r\n\r\nhoped no one would respond to me, cuz i was pretty much fed at that point,.\r\n\r\n**and then Skiddo the Player Support Specialist came :**\r\n> Hey there,\r\n> \r\n> ꧁✿🌸╭⊱ Skiddo here from Player Support. ⊱╮🌸✿꧂\r\n> \r\n> My colleagues already showed you some parts from the chat logs you had which were the ones that triggered the penalty. As it was stated before, negativity does not refer only to using swear words, cursing or using \"bad\" words, it can also contain chat spamming, placing blame on others, targeting other players, hate speech, calling for false reports and overall bringing down the morale of the team.\r\n> \r\n> We are taking the chat from one side and that being your because first, we cannot discuss with you matters that involve other accounts or players so we'll discuss only your chat logs and second, we do not consider one player's actions to justify another's. Just because you've encountered negative behavior in your games, it does not give you an excuse to be negative in return. We believe all players are responsible for their own actions.\r\n> \r\n> When you see that someone is aggressive towards you, it can feel good to share with them some of your words and respond back. Is it worth it, to fight fire with fire when you are putting your account's health, your emotional and mental state at risk, while you continue to argue with people rather than showing that you are the bigger person and they can't get to you no matter what? These are things that you have to think of before responding back. You have the mute button at your disposal to make sure that you no longer see what they are saying. You can also report them at the end of the game and let the system do it's job so that they won't do this again to other players.\r\n> \r\n> While I won't be able to discuss details about other players due to our privacy policies, I encourage you to use the mute button, focus on fulfilling your role in that game to the best of your ability and report them at the end of the game so that negative behavior can be brought to our attention. As mentioned, each player is accountable for their behavior and we treat each and every case individually. Things like \"he/she/they started it\" , \"but they were offensive first\", \"they did this to me\", \"It wasn't me who was negative, I merely responded\" don't really give you a free pass to be negative in return.\r\n> \r\n> The honor system is a behavior based system, therefore it's tied to your behavior in game. If you receive a suspension, like you got the Chat Restriction it means that your behavior was not on the positive side, therefore you were not honorable which affects your level of honor by default.\r\n> \r\n> While our stance in regards to the restriction will not change, we would like to consider this matter closed.

I should end this so I responded : \r\n> i feel being insulted indirectly on the replays as this topics goes on. \r\n> your colleagues reasons deffer on some parts as i said before , as for being negative you said \" it can also contain chat spamming, placing blame on others, targeting other players, hate speech, calling for false reports and overall bringing down the morale of the team \" \r\n> i can see that my words in chat cross :\r\n> \r\n> first spamming , i talked about that and you can see the time between massage if you taking spam as the concept of time, and if you are saying it as what IRON MELON explained it also doesn't count as spam, I've talked about that above.\r\n> \r\n> third as for \"targeting other players\" what do you mean by that in details ?\r\n> \r\n> fourth and about hate speech it is simple , no single word of offence or hate were said.\r\n> \r\n> fifth \"placing blame on others\"... i told you, read the whole chat, and what i mean by that not to put blame on others or saying they deserve more, it is juts to understand what i am saying, imagine reading story by reading only the hero side of talk and avoid another, you wont understand a thing, so when someone asking me why that's happens or who told you this or that i would answer it is someone or others, tho i even forget what they were saying at that time because it is being days, but i am sure you would find that what i was said is not as blame it is more like answer, i don't believe no one would expect avoid respond to such questions in matter of placing blame and get restriction because it is negative by a way or another , and i know my self i am not the one who blame for anyone for anything even if it were true .\r\n> \r\n> and last \"calling for false reports\"in the term of \"false\" which my call weren't false at all, and in term of the \"call\" itself, by referring to the link IRON MELON present: \r\n> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884 \r\n> the report calling listed in things to avoid not on the penalty trigger side, and if you mean by what being said in the link at the part which state: \r\n> \" however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.\" \r\n> you can see i didn't call for a false one and i didn't \"constantly demanding report\" so why are you sticking on the report side like it would be alone enough to put a penalty ?\r\n> \r\n> but now i am relived somehow by what you are saying \" We are taking the chat from one side and that being your \" so that's how your judge system works, now that if i am about to say something even if it is good or by a good reason you guys well take it by one side ether it is true or by misunderstanding and put a penalty on it and referring it as a reason, you should write that on the rules that: \r\n> \" We are taking the chat from one side\" \r\n> so people can take care of that side, you also assure that when you say: \r\n> \" we'll discuss only your chat logs and second, we do not consider one player's actions to justify another's\" and \"We believe all players are responsible for their own actions\". \r\n> and again, I DON'T CARE about other players or what happen to them , we will only meat once maybe once in our life time so that i am not holding grudge on them or care what will you guys do to them. so when you say \"While I won't be able to discuss details about other players due to our privacy policies\" that's not what i am talking about when i said don't take the chat from one side -tho you guys already admit you did-, and about privacy, what is said towards me it concern my privacy in a direct way just to let you know. \r\n> you said : \r\n> \"\"he/she/they started it\" , \"but they were offensive first\", \"they did this to me\", \"It wasn't me who was negative, I merely responded\" don't really give you a free pass to be negative in return.\" \r\n> no, just no, i didn't write any of these nor i explained that's my words are a pass for negativity if that's what you are pointing to , if it not than sorry for misunderstanding. \r\n> I don't know why are you keeping this topic this long, if its about moral and negativity you can see we win that match you were talking about, and as i said as for my penalty as taking chat limit + honor drop that i toke the punishment was not correctly applied . \r\n> and in like always you closed the topic obviously by your own and said \" we would like to consider this matter closed \" and mark it as solved while it is not. \r\n> but you know what i am tired already and the topic went cold days ago, and i don't care anymore wither there is a penalty or honor drop or something , just say it solved as you want and let it be.\r\n> \r\n> and as i marked before creating this thread at \"I AM HAPPY TO ALLOW OTHER PLAYERS TO SEE MY SUPPORT TICKET IF IT WILL HELP OTHER PLAYERS SOLVE SIMILAR ISSUES.\"\r\n> \r\n> i well spread this matter in the forum and other places so the peoples can take caution and know more about how the tribunal and penalty system works so it wont take them long topics like this.\r\n\r\nso my advise is :\r\n1 - take the penalty as it is, don't ask about it \r\n2- as I said before, everything well is used against you, even thing that you don't know so don't tire your self about it \r\n3- about the things you don't know about it don't ask about it \r\n4- don't say any word that if you put it by itself on paper well appear as negative because you will judge by your word alone\r\n5- Blitz bot always is right \r\n\r\nthat's that for part 3 ...\r\nif you want screenshots of the conversations above or anything just let me know .\r\n\r\nPlayer SanZero from EUNE\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n\r\nI thought I am the only one who got this problem,  our friend DARCKD00M (NA)  that commented on part 2 appear to have the same issue, kinda relieved that we are in the same boat. thanks for commenting Mr.DARCKD00M (NA)","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-20T21:21:48.517+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"They marked it as solved because the situation is as follows:\n\n0.
