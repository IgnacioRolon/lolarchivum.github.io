Sometimes when I click reconnect it will fix it then but I have problem where it can take upto five times for it to work. Then when I get in pregame in the chat it'll say \"Disconnected from PVP.NET it will automatically reconnect when possible\" and then it'll say \"Reconnected To PVP.NET\" before shortly disconnecting again. Please help; I've tried repairing and I've forwarded the ports to LoL.\n\n[Both pictures (PNG so wouldn't let me attach)](http://imgur.com/Wzh3QxA,b8vVsYj)","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-01-30T02:22:56.056+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nWe commonly see this issue when there isn't a stable connection to our PvP.net Servers.  When you open up the client, your computer and our servers constantly play a game of catch.  Your computer pings our servers, our servers receive it and ping back, and so on and so forth.  If your computer pings our servers, and never hears back, it will give you these disconnected errors.  \n\nIn order to try to resolve these issues, make sure that you complete the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  There are a lot of steps, but they usually resolve this issue.\n\nAfter completing the steps and it still leaves a red notification on your client causing you only to see red as well, don't give up on resolving this just yet!  Make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our Tech Specialists.  They can work with you further to get this resolved ASAP.

Same issues as everyone else. Connection to PVP.net just randomly drops every 30 secs/minute or so. Makes it almost impossible to join a proper game lobby. Cannot party play or play any normal or ranked queue. Only been able to play the occasional ARAM (two in the last week!) if the connection holds long enough to get into the lobby. Been getting alot of timed lockouts for queue dodging when im not dodging the games. The connection to PVP.net just drops causing me to be locked out of even trying to join another game for 15/30 mins at a time.\n\nThis problem affects both my EUW and NA accounts.\n\nThis is most certainly not a problem at my side. Have been through the troubleshooting threads extensively (im rather tech savy, so i understand thoroughly the situation), that will no doubt be posted in auto-response by a red here. I would just like a little explanation as to what this problem is and an ETA on when it will be fixed. \n\nBe safe in the knowledge that the game is unplayable for the many people currently suffering from this problem.
