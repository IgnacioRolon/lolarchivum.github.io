Since the beginning I was running on V-Sync on, cause well, this is not FPS game so there was no need to turn it off. It also didn't produce any lag whatsoever.\r\n\r\nA week ago I had to reinstall my OS. After the reinstallation, I run LOL just to see the setting etc. Everything was in place but panning screen with mouse was somehow off. I feel like there is a little lag before the screen actually started to move after the mouse pointer hit the edge.\r\n\r\nWell, this is something I cannot play with. Colleague was advising to turn off v-sync, which was i reluctant to do, because it never caused any problems.\r\nTo my suprise, when it is off, the panning screen lag goes away. Of course it introduces screen tearing which also is not a best solution.\r\n\r\nWanted to ask if anybody else had this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T21:55:27.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens if you disable V-Sync?
