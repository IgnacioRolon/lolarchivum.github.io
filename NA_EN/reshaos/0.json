You are gonna dodge and lose lp by not playing the game at all without trying? And what if this supposed troll actually does well? There are a lot of issues that people have in ranked and everyone has had their number of trolls, but it's the people to stick to it that often get surprised at the result of the match. If you dodge, you lose lp without even putting any effort into the game. When i say suck it up, I mean tough it out. Stick through it. Ranked are hardly enjoyable anymore thanks to the community and when i go into one, i don't expect to have fun. By dodging, you give exactly what they want and it only hurts you. It takes a strong person to tough it out in game and work as a team to pull out a win even if the odds are against you. If you can't do it in a game, how are you going to handle real life? And how exactly do you get anywhere in ranked with this ideal that you lose before you even get into the game. I know it isn't right if someone steals a role, but sometimes you have to work with what you got. If you don't like what they are doing, report them at end. Just don't dodge the queue and then blame the troll for why you lost the lp. I didn't get to gold last season by dodging queues. I got it by working hard and sticking through every game i played. I never dodged a ranked and I never will. It's not in my character to give up before I try and I expect of others what I expect of myself.","replies":[{"poster":"FearEngineer","date":"2015-05-04T18:04:20.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sure you did.\n\nIt's not possible that other people have different experiences with the game than you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reshaos","date":"2015-05-03T05:05:47.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PrincessKairi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4K25Lmg0,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-03T02:33:56.751+0000)\n>\n> You mean the ones you could just suck up and play with anyways because YOU could still pull a win out of a game by just sucking up your sour mood and playing the game?\n> \n> I have had plenty of those in ranked, but I ALWAYS suck it up and play.

So everyone in league should just start insta-locking to the role of their choice because there is no punishment. I mean if we all forced mid we may pull out a win right?\n\nThat's the problem. These people should be banned. Nobody should have to put up with people who locks a mid champ when they are last pick and we really needed a support. So that person goes mid in game, acts all nice and innocent so when Riot reviews log they of course won't get banned, while everyone else might due to them swearing at the person. So who gets stuck being the support? Oh the Zed that first picked for mid. He's forced to play as the support because of this troll.\n\nZed support? Game is winnable if the other team is just terrible, which at that point you seriously have to question why you're even facing them.\n\nI am suggesting that the Tribunal, or whatever Riot uses to review reports, to start literally recording footage of the champion select screen. The entire thing. That way if there is false reports for off-meta picks then those false reporters get \"temp banned\" themselves. Just as you would if you made a false police report. They will get to see who picked the champion first, read the logs to see if any player indicated what, etc.\n\nWill this ban players who first state \"x role\" but another player chooses the champion for it before them? Nope. This will not ban those players because that is fair game.","replies":[{"poster":"QueenAqua","date":"2015-05-03T19:03:27.017+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not saying they don't get punished. I agree that champ select chat should be included within the report at the end. What I'm saying is that implementing a report system before game will render most reports invalid and less likely to make it to tribunal at all. In the end, players are the ones that decide the fate of those reported, not Riot. The system can very well be abused. A report for before the game is impractical and more than likely will provide no help in getting rid of toxic players, esp since toxicity will be created THROUGH these reports.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-03T15:55:11.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"That is stupid","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-03T15:54:15.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No excuse.\n\nKarthus jungle is well known.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łunacy","date":"2015-05-02T18:51:48.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
