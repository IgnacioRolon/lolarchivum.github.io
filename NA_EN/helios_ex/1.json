Or were you actually selecting Sona yourself in Champion Select and the game crashed after the Load Screen?\n\nWe are aware of a game-crashing bug right now concerning spectating a game with Sona in it, but if this is a different issue, getting your r3d logs from the game would be super duper helpful! (If you'd like to send em over, you can find your r3dlogs here: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Game - R3d Logs)\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Hertenz","date":"2016-01-31T15:17:38.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me , i ranked a game with a friend , sona was selected and the game has crashed.
