I tried both ways he said. Something about open it as a admin after changing regions and resetting my PC date to the 10th of the same month. After that it would fail to even get to the log in screen before giving me a new error message. So I tried an uninstall and reinstall. After I did that I started to play some music and play an offline game(forgot what game). Then the song stopped(about half way through it) then I alt tabbed and looked at the LOL client and then tried to look at my google chrome but it would not do anything if I clicked on anything at that point. So I had to hold the power button down. I tried a few more times. Still freezes in the 40's or 50's of percentage. So I stopped trying until yesterday(9/20). Same story as before. This time I was looking in a folder and nothing was in the folder so I went back one level and nothing was in that folder(not even the folder that I was just in)! I was able to hit the restart button from the start menu and nothing happened. I opened to task manager and tried to close out of the last thing I had open(skype), but it would not even let me from that. Not sure how much of this mattered but I wanted to post as much as I could remember seeing as I don't think that I could record that on my PC and my phone does not have much room on it to record a video.\r\n\r\nMy Processor is AMD FX(tm)-4300 Quad-core Processor            3.80 GHz\r\nI have a 64 bit operating system and have 16 GB memory if any of that matters.(windows 7 pro)\r\nIf anyone can help me that would be grand","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T22:23:13.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changing your PC date and time can actually cause you a lot of issues, especially with logging in so you don't want to do that!
