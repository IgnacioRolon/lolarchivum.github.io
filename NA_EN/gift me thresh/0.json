I don&#039;t know if I should be relieved or depressed. I love this game but it gets to me sometimes and I don&#039;t know how to control myself. I try to ignore everyone but that doesn&#039;t work for me because I still want to help my team mates out. I&#039;ve had some really toxic games where I just go off and i&#039;ve had games where i just dont type for the sake of wantign to win. Yesterday after another one of my toxic games I was finally perma banned. I recieved multiple warnings but I just ignored them thinking what I said couldn&#039;t be bad enough to get me perma banned but i was completely wrong. I&#039;ve spent easily over $200 on this game and I don&#039;t regret it. Although I&#039;ve never told someone to kill themselves ives said horrible things such as &quot;youre worthless in this game, youre garbage, stop feeding noob, u suck&quot;. After getting a 2 week banned I knew i wouldnt be  getting my ranked rewards so i wanted to change but I just didnt. I think ill finally stop playing this game today. I just wanted to discuss how to fix my issues because this is only the game were i rage.  I want to be given another oppurtunity but that won&#039;t happen and i completely understand. After playing this game for over a year (played after Yasuo&#039;s release) I can say that today I will quit league of legends for good. I&#039;ll still watch competitive games and streamers but this is the end to playing  the game i most enjoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"The Fire on Fire","date":"2015-10-30T13:56:33.609+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good for you that you realize that you are toxic.

I'm in the same boat as you. Note: Raging can mean a lot of things, so if your yelling @ the computer screen @ a feeder etc. to the point of disturbing others around you i still advise you to seek help. I** admit** I attend some anger management classes in groups which I've learn to toned my voice down  i thought it was impossible when i was younger.

Why do you have to eat crap and they don't?  \n\n2. \"Smurfing is legal deal with it.\" - Why?  That's like a pro football player beating the crap out of high school kids.  Why does Riot do nothing about this?  It's ruining the ranking system and games.  Why is it legal for a bad player to be boosted by a smurf with Duo Queue?  Do you even begin to understand how frustrating it is to lose several games in a row because there's a smurf in every one of them?  End of season is like, hurry get me my gold border and smurf.  So if you complain about this in game you will be reported for verbal abuse but there is no report option for, \"This ass is boosted and ruining my game\".  Just listen to TheOddOne complain about boosted players all day, guess what it happens in Silver / Gold too.\n\n3. \"There is a profanity filter.\" - Why?  If you curse you're reported.  Why have a filter then?  Why can't I curse?  What happened to freedom of speech?  I just want to say, \"Man I fucked up there.\" without being reported.\n\n4. \"You shouldn't duo queue because it makes the enemy team have higher MMR.\" - Why?  Why does Riot assume that players who Duo have some sort of advantage over other people of the same MMR?  They are just kids who want to play together.  There is no advantage at Silver / Gold MMR.  This isn't QT and Kiwi in bot lane here...  Why isn't there any consideration for the fact that at lower MMR duo queue doesn't give any advantage?  I lose most games that have a Duo Queue on my team.  \n\n5. \"It's just a game, chill out don't get mad.\" - Why?  Have you ever seen a football fan yell at his TV?  It's a SPORT not just a game.  If you aren't prepared to play your best don't queue ranked.  Why can't I report them but they report me for getting mad at them?

If someone's being a jerk in the chat, mute them and report them after the game. By not joining in on the chat rage-fest you ensure that they're the only ones who can be valid reported in that game for their poor behavior.\n\n> 2. \"Smurfing is legal deal with it.\" - Why?

In fact chances are we'd never even know that someone's a smurf if they didn't admit to it in the chat. If someone is Elo Boosting and/or playing on someone else's account then yes they will be punished for that accordingly but regardless there's no reason to verbally abuse people just because they're doing something that you don't like.\n\n> 3. \"There is a profanity filter.\" - Why?  If you curse you're reported.  Why have a filter then?  Why can't I curse?  What happened to freedom of speech?  I just want to say, \"Man I fucked up there.\" without being reported.\n\nLyte talked about this in the [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400) thread of old: \n\n**1) What's the point of having a language filter if I can get banned for 'adult' language?**\na) We aren't out to punish players who use adult language; in fact, very few players are ever banned for saying stuff like \"f***, I missed that skill shot\" or \"damn, f***ing close game!\" However, the language filter is not an excuse to verbally abuse someone in the game. When you verbally abuse or harass someone by calling them \"f***ing ******\" or \"n*gger noob\", that's when you've crossed the line and will be punished by the Tribunal. I've said this before and I'll say it again, we aren't trying to clean online games of adult language; we're trying to reform or get rid of jerks who like to verbally abuse and harass other players.\n\nHe also talked about it in the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284) as well: \n\n**Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?**\nPlayers shouldn’t need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player.\n\nAlso Freedom of Speech doesn't apply here. Ulanopo talked about it in their [Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541) here: \n\n**Freedom of Speech!!!!!**\n\nDoesnt apply. No really. If were talking about American law, the First Amendment only applies to the government making laws that prohibit speech and, even then, freedom of speech isnt absolute. For example, you cant incite a riot, plan to kill the president or yell fire in a crowded theater.\n\nAlso, theres nothing in the First Amendment that protects you from the consequences of your speech. People are fired all the time for making derogatory comments about their employer. My workplace, for example, has a social media policy that says that I can be terminated for badmouthing the company. They dont ask for passwords and access as some companies have been known to do, but it wouldnt be all that difficult to find me on the internet, knowing my real name, phone number and address.\n> 5. \"It's just a game, chill out don't get mad.\" - Why?  Have you ever seen a football fan yell at his TV?  It's a SPORT not just a game.  If you aren't prepared to play your best don't queue ranked.  Why can't I report them but they report me for getting mad at them? Why is it OKAY to be BAD in ranked games but not okay to be mad at these people?\n\nYou can get mad and be mad but you just can't be a jerk. If someone is doing poorly then MatchMaking will try to set them up to play with and against players of a similar skill level as them. Keep in mind though that everyone has bad games from time to time, even you. By raging at someone who's having a bad game you're only making them play worse than they already are. By building them up instead of putting them down, not only do you increase the chances of that person playing better than they were already, but you also increase your teams chances of actually winning the game as well.\n\n> League of Double Standards - And I'm sure EVERYONE will disagree with everything I said with some Holier than though self righteous bullshit, but deep down inside you all know I'm right.\n\nYou are free to disagree but regardless the rules still stand. If you don't like them then feel free to play a different game, but keep in mind that more and more game companies out there are cracking down on verbal abuse and the like, so naturally they will have rules that you don't agree with.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2015-10-30T13:47:06.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could always make a new account but if you don't change your behavior you're just going to wind up getting banned again.\n\nSomething tell me that all this rage you get in game is most likely because of stuff going on in your personal life rather than what people in league do. You shouldn't be playing league, especially ranked, if you are pissed off about something in real life. If you are pissed off about something in real life honestly the best way to deal with it is to work out. Not only does it get out all the pent up energy but working out actually releases chemicals into your brain that improves mood.\n\nIf someone going 0/10/0 really pisses you off that bad you can still yell and scream at them, just don't freaking type it in chat.
