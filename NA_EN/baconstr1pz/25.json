There was this really hot hipster chick that was in the group and i started to chat her up. The 6 of us start talking to specific people and me and this chick where really hitting it off. Obviously we were all drinking. I decided to make a move and i comment on her weird ass ring . She was \"like oh this i got this when i went to peru-\" I hold up her hand  to examine it and she immediately look into my eyes smiling. I grin and she pulls my arm closer to her because spots spots the c9 wristbands on my arm. She asked me \"whats this you have here?\" And before I answer my league friend jumps in and says  \"Sasha respect the cane\" That straight disrespect!\"  She pulls her hand away from mine and look a little wierded out. I gave my friend the look. \n\n\n\n\nWe left about an hour later and i got the mood back again and she seemed to have recovered from the outburst. I walked her to the bus stop and she pointed to where she was headed. It was in the wrong direction so i held her arm and pointed it into the right direction but she was just staring at me. So i go in for the kiss but then- \" LOL (my name) did you just get baited and out smarted?\" \"bruh make sure you dont facecheck that brush kid\"  She kissed me on the cheek and promptly left. I got a text from her later saying Your friend is really weird. \n\n\n\nLesson for the day dont fucken use league memes in the real. Dont be that idiot.","replies":[]}
