Gp has insane lvl 3 to 3 dmg. Im not saying q every time its off cooldown but fucken q people.\n\ndblade for cheap ad and health plus ruby, gets you tanky and you might have enough for a flask\n\nrush phage always, godly kiting potential with this item. theres a reason everyone rushed it in s2\n\nrush shiv after becuase its more dmg than triforce at this poitn. Plus the movespeed you get from both items is awesome. never rush shiv first. Phage gives you the kite and hp and ad to keep pumping out the crits.\n\nthen rush sheen. When you ahve sheen and a shiv you basically have a ghetto triforce.\n\nonce triforce is coompletly you go super sayian. \n\nIf the enemy has a bit of armour and things are slow so you cant build up to that ie. go ghost blade. Or get avarice and farm up that ie\n\nthe rest of the build depends how the game is going. \n\nGp best works with crit. tanky crit or glass canon movespeed. \n\nI tried korean plank and its meh. you are ignorable and basically do nothing.\n\nGp power spikes lvl 1 \n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\nphage completion\n\nshiv\n\nsheen\n\ntriforce\n\nand every item after that. Gp scales off of is q. keep that in mind","replies":[]}
