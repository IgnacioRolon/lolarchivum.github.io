The initiation is quite hard to land. It's too easy to dodge it.\r\nIf he successfully initiates a fight, he can only stand there and hope that the enemy team is braindead and focuses him. His e is to short and too weak to even hit anyone. His q is a channel that can be easily avoided. His w is basically the only ability he can use in a fight.\r\nHe feels like a sack of meat. An incredibly tanky, kiteable, low damage dealing sack of meat.","replies":[{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-03-06T22:28:17.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.  He sucks late game.  That infinitely stacking health?  Survivability is for chumps, AMIRITE?  20% armor shred?  Your ADC doesn't need that.  Two AoE  knockups?  Oh pls Yas, try harder.  1500 range AoE slow?  Not useful for catching enemies at all.  AoE % Health bomb?  NOPE.  Gigantic character model?  Naw man, I'm gonna let Jinx take that Blitz grab to the face, who needs her and her silly rockets.  \n\nSion is a late game God.  There are few tanks who match Sion's poke, AoE damage, AoE disruption, engagement and re-engagement potential.  Not only that, but you can absolutely SHRED their team if they actually manage to take you down, each AA during Glory in Death is fixed at 10% max HP.  Your ultimate is on such a low cooldown, sometimes you can even use it twice in one battle.  Considering how important mobility is late game, that ultimate is a godsend to any team trying to lock-down objectives after a teamfight.  \n\nYou must think of Sion as a ranged mage tank, not a melee brawler.  He is a back-line bombardier until it's time to bring his disruption to the front-line.  Want to win with our favorite undead brute?  You need to take Hybrid Penetration runes, use 21 points into the offensive mastery tree, buy Sorcerer's Shoes and Liandry's Torment.  Stacking your W passive and building tanky resistance items on that foundation will allow you deal good damage and survive heaps of abuse well into late game.  Additionally, This allows him to protect your carries while also providing substantial poke.  Don't underestimate the damage a minion-tossed E will do with a magnified Liandry's proc, even lategame.  \n\nThe biggest caveat to Sion is that his skill shots will make or break him: he needs help landing hard CC and he needs a mobile assassin or long range mage able to follow-up on slippery targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"youngjake93","date":"2015-03-06T18:04:39.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what?

That way its much more reliable.on a cc heavy team if jugle support and mid have cc  sion can really end a fight with his ulti and cc chained.Yes he is tanky as hell if u can cs.And omg if and i mean if they  manage to kill u u can dive their adc or mid and kill them. Sion is really good now and if buff (which i am for) he will be top tier champ in top lane.but he isnt supposed to deal massive damage in late game, he sould be a brick wall for ur back line. His early game is good which can get him on the snowball train to supreme tank land.you cant just spam ur abilities and expect to win, u need to know when and how to use them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-03-06T18:00:24.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you do know his lategame job isnt to do damage right? his lategame job is to become the biggest tank he possibly can and initiate for his team even if his initiation tools arent great thats his job","replies":[]}]}
