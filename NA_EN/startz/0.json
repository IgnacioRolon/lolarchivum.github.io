The bola is a bad candidate for a typical stun animation because it has an effect in a wide area outside of just the opponent it hits that causes it to shatter. Furthermore it slows in a wide area when it shatters of its own accord, indicating that it has an effect due to something other than it physically shattering.\n\nYou don't want parallels between Ashe and Sejuani, they are meant to contrast each other and use their knowledge and power of the Freljord in different ways due to their different interpretations of how their people should live.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-03-30T19:30:59.702+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"the arrow is magic, it was conjured with magic, and its giant. do you think that ashe carries giant slabs of ice? the moment it was conjured by magic is the moment it was lost, and even if the arrow isn't magic and the bow is magic, why does that mean the bow cant enchant the arrow to freeze?

It is a flying chunk of ice in the shape of an arrow. Its size and velocity are at the level of \"silly\" but it is still composed of a natural substance with no supernatural properties.\n\nAshe's passive causes a slow because the arrows are cold.

It merely shatters in an explosion that damages and slows nearby enemies (in a pretty small area I might add).\n\nHave you ever been cold? Your skin contracts and forms goosebumps, your joints and muscles stiffen, your whole body instinctively slows down to conserve energy and instead use it to try and counteract the chill.
