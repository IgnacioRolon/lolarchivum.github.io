So I waited 24 hours and I decided that a login attempt couldn't hurt (I mostly play only with my friends now a days so I didn't feel the need to log in for a game earlier than that) but when I tried to log in my fears were confirmed and my password didn't work. I even tried copy and pasting the password from a word document to make sure that it worked. It did not. I had no new logins on my email address as I checked the account activity history, and I have notifications on my phone for new logins of my account. I had Riot send a password reset email and I was able to change the password to none that was randomly generated and has nothing to do with the old one. But first I had changed it back to the old one and tried to copy and paste the password that had previously not worked, this time it did. I'm not sure why it wouldn't accept the password that I have been using since late Season 2 until I changed it back to it, and how someone may be able to change it without accessing my email or changing the password on that account. This could be some crazy glitch or error but for now I'm not taking any chances and felt that I had to share as my younger brother's account was stolen back in the middle of Season 3 before Riot's support team got it back for him (thank you by the way). I hope it's nothing, and if not, I hope this helps somehow.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T04:33:17.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear you were able to recover your account on your own by submitting a password reset, but let's take a few steps to make sure your account is still safe and secure. Double check your email for anything that might have been deleted, as the hacker might have had access to that email and simply deleted any trace of his existence.","replies":[]}]}
