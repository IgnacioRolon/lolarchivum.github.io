Everything has reinstalled properly except League. When I attempt to launch the installer from the League website, nothing happens. I've tried running as administrator in at least 5 different ways. Only running the installer through Command Prompt as admin will open it. Even then, I get to the installation, and I get a prompt asking, \"Are you sure you want to cancel the installation?\". It does this over and over and I can't continue with the installation. Is this a problem with the installer, or is my machine the problem? I didn't have problems on this machine before.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\n\r\nCPU - Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.80 GHz\r\n\r\nMemory - 4 GB\r\n\r\nOS - Windows Vista SP2 32-bit\r\n\r\nGraphics - GTX 650","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T20:09:31.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're on the right track, because it sounds like some setting in your OS is blocking the patcher from launching.
