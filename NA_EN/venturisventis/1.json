I've been getting promos as normal; get to 100lp, get an afk in two games, lose promos, get back with free win, carry, rinse and repeat. Upon getting to my promos in Bronze III, I carried my first game and won, and got an off-role my next game, with an afk and an off-meta jungle pick and \"it works, trust me\". Nothing out of the ordinary. However, when I ultimately lost, I was told I'd failed my promos. I had only played two games in my promos. Does this mean that the two promo games I played both had to be wins? Is this because my MMR is two divisions higher than my rank, to make me prove my MMR? Or is it a bug of some sort?","replies":[{"poster":"venturisventis","date":"2017-04-12T04:54:50.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is strange. I didn't dodge a queue by my own will, but there was one time directly after getting into promos where champ select suddenly ended right before it was my turn to ban. The client told me someone else dodged, but I wasn't in the queue anymore, as if I had dodged. I thought I must have cancelled the queue somehow after champ select ended, but it may have been the dodge you're talking about. If so, then I believe that's a bug in the alpha client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-11T20:52:25.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it looks like you had a queue dodge which counted as a loss in your series.  The dodge followed by a loss resulted in ending the series.  I also believe that a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) will disqualify any promohelper that would have been available.  You're really close into getting into another series, though!  I hope that helps clear things up, and good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"venturisventis","date":"2017-04-11T11:50:02.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump?","replies":[]}]}
