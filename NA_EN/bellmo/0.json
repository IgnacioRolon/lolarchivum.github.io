I have had the same issue for about 2 months now. I am also a mac user. Have tried everything, from the HRT to every single step of the connection issue guide. Nothing seems to work. I have to try logging in 4-5 times with a couple of Laptop-Restarts and Router-Restarts in between to finally be able to play. It is getting really frustrating to the point that  after 15 minutes of attempting to log in I loose patience and don't want to play anymore. From all the other threads I have read, it seems this issue mostly occurs to Mac Users on the EUW server. I can easily log in into the NA servers with my other account every time. The problem seems to be with the EUW server. Can Riot please look into this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T17:30:20.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue may be more local if different connections are causing the same problem, and for multiple patches.
