I have to say even though I think NA is stronger then ever I don&#039;t like my options at all.\r\n\r\nTSM is looking the strongest it ever has. Sadly TSM still has the distinction of being present at every single World Championship, yet being lucky to ever get out of groups. Hell I don&#039;t think they ever made it out of the first bracket since Season 1. I&#039;m sick of them coming up short and embarrassing us despite having more international experience then any organization. However teams won&#039;t be able to reliably camp the hell out of Dyrus this time. \r\n\r\nCLG not sure WTH happened after MSI, but they look strong after their series against IMT. If they can pull back that championship level MSI level performance I&#039;d take them. Not sure what happened to Darshan this split though, and I&#039;ve never been impressed with Huhi replacing him for Pobleter was huge mistake imo. \r\n\r\nC9 I haven&#039;t followed them much this split, but I feel that their win over IMT is more so about Huni choking then how strong they are. I&#039;ll have to see how they to against TSM to make sure. C9 has historically performed the best Internationally out of all the NA teams. I think of them as the FNC of NA, they wont win but they show up. But I don&#039;t have much faith in them w/o Hai&#039;s shotcalling.\r\n\r\nIMT kind of a wildcard, they&#039;ve shown to falter in series matches despite their dominance, and seem to be easy to exploit. Higher level teams won&#039;t allow them to just get a lead and run rough shot over them, but I think I&#039;d prefer to see IMT over any of three teams above simply because I&#039;ve seen all 3 teams come up short internationally in embarassing fashion with the exception of C9.","replies":[{"poster":"hotarse","date":"2016-08-28T14:51:22.935+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"History says Liquid will get fourth.

I have no idea how good C9 is now. \n\nTSM's roster is pretty much entirely new now. There problem at the World stage imo is they're best player by a wide margin was also their shotcaller. And being a world class mid laner like Bjergsen doesn't matter much at Worlds cause your dealing with the likes of Faker and a bunch of other elite mid laners. \nNow he has roster of players who are all top players within their role in NA, and Doublelift backs up his shotcalling. Still I'm not a fan of the two most mechanically taxing roles (mid and adc) being your shotcallers. So I'll take them. \n\nI actually have faith in IMT in the group stages. There problem seems to be adapting in series, I suppose they don't have the proper coaching staff yet. When they finally stopped letting CLG bully their bot lane they crushed them. So I'll take them. \n\nIf Darshan can get his shit together it'll solve CLGs problems really since he's supposed to be a strong link. Aphromoo is tried and tested but the guy really does some dumb stuff sometimes. Last worlds the guy picked Blitzkrank into a support Kennen.....like WTF your just helping him at that point. \n\nC9 does the best internationally but that's with Hai. I really don't know >.<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xTropicalPenguin","date":"2016-08-29T00:05:25.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would like someone from na getting out of groups before getting smashed but i doubt it","replies":[{"poster":"Croanin","date":"2016-08-29T08:25:49.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xTropicalPenguin,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=shZwp9Gf,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2016-08-29T00:05:25.964+0000)\n>\n> i would like someone from na getting out of groups before getting smashed but i doubt it\n\nI've always counted on C9 for that.

I think it's extremely probable that they'll be one of the teams representing us due to tsm being the heavy favorites to win summer split.  Clg plays musical chairs with who is going to fuck up each game and a lot of the time it puts them in a hole so deep that they can't come back.  I am not thrilled about them going to worlds.\n\nIdeally I think it should be tsm/c9/imt, but realistically I think it's going to be tsm/clg/imt.\n\n-edit\n\nLiquid is just out of the top 4, but I can't see them running the gauntlet against imt/c9.
