However, an issue I have is that the SFX audio slider does not affect the sound a champion makes when picked so it&#039;s very loud compared to the rest of the sound. Muting the client isn&#039;t really an option either because then I miss when it&#039;s my turn to pick/ban. Fixing this would be great :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-11-19T15:45:47.317+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, a couple of audio fixes are coming out with the next patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fisherman Fízz","date":"2016-11-19T13:44:01.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"More audio options were added. http://prntscr.com/d987tt\nShould fix the current audio problems in champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Cosmos","date":"2016-11-19T14:16:38.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, yeah it will fix the issue.
