Also, lets not take all the money they want to throw at us for legacy servers! That would be bad!\r\n\r\nRiot - Let&#039;s just keep ignoring the community.... oh wait, this isn&#039;t working. New plan! Let&#039;s take one money brick out of this money castle and use it for something.... no? Oh wait, I have an idea! We already pay these guys to do work... let&#039;s just have them come up with a similar system to another MOBA in which game modes rotate based on a timer. Hmm.... but we can&#039;t have them available all the time or else people would have fun and enjoy our game. OH! BETTER IDEA! Let&#039;s bring back URF, and lets make it only last TWO DAYS! Then let&#039;s make every other mode last a week! Brilliant! Let&#039;s just not make a second ARAM queue that is URF on Howling Abyss. That would like, let people enjoy the game or something. We&#039;re totally not about that. Are we starting to sound worse than our competitors yet? No? OK, we&#039;ll keep working on that.","replies":[{"poster":"x R e n g a R x","date":"2016-04-23T15:35:58.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"qq thread lol\n\nNo one cares about your opinion kid.
