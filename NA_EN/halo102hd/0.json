So here are the steps...in detail. Make sure to go through each one and if you continue to have issues afterwords make sure to let me know. \n\nYou can address this issue by changing your resolution in Windows to the ideal (native) resolution:\n\n> -Click the Start Menu\n> -Go to \"Search programs and files\" at the bottom and type \"resolution\"\n> -Click \"Adjust screen resolution\"\n> -Under \"Resolution\" for the monitor or monitors you are seeing this issue, change the resolution to the one marked \"(recommended)\" (it should also be in bold)\n> -Click Apply, wait, and then click \"Keep Changes\" unless you see a major issue with your monitor\n> There's a chance that you're already using the native resolution and don't need to Apply any change, if so, move on\n\nAfter this, you will need to reset the Config files for your League of Legends installation so that the game has the correct resolution too. You'll need to do the following to reset your Config settings:\n\n> -Launch League (make sure it is set to \"Run as Administrator\": https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions#wq3 )\n> -Login (but don't start a game yet)\n> -Minimize the game and Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n> -Delete the Config folder (delete the entire folder, not just the contents)\n> -Start a Custom Game to verify changes\n\nAfter doing this, the settings should now be updated with the correct resolutions and the game should now run properly. Since you should have access to the menus now, you can change resolution and other settings as you wish.\nRiot Games Support\nSetting up your Permissions\nLeague of Legends requires administrative privileges to install and run correctly.
