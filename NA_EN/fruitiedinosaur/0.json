The wording they use IS different, but all of the stats are exactly the same. The only real different between those descriptions is that the in-game one lists the 90 sec Cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"FruitieDinosaur","date":"2017-05-09T13:03:48.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except 40% of current health and 40% of Max health are different, if you get 40% of current health when you activate it and not 40% of Max health. Those could be drastically different. If I have 2000 current health and 4000 max health and I get 40% of max, that will be 1600. In the same scenario if I only get 40% of current I only get 800. It is at the least unclear in game and should be clarified, but it doesn't seem as if it gives maximum health gain in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T21:35:16.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhhh I see that now! So the more in-depth description is the correct one, you get 40% of your MAXIMUM Health. The in-game tooltip doesn't say maximum or current, so they aren't really conflicting, but I definitely see where that could be confusing. \n\nI'm going to reach out to who I can to try and get that updated for you, but in the future this might be better posted in Gameplay or Report a Bug ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2017-05-11T21:43:32.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well your maximum increases by 40% or 100% but your current hp% also stays the same. So a person with 2000 max health at current health of 1000 would get maximum health of 4000 but curernt health of 2000.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
