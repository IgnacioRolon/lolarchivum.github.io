I&#039;ve survived so many assassin&#039;s attack from simply dropping a Q on them and healing back from 10% to 40%.\n\nGood AP Items to build would be the following, most are situational, so choose according to what&#039;s going on, and based on your team/enemy comp.\n\n*Banner of Command {{item:3060}} (Gives AP, and the Aura for your team, also pressure the map with your super minion/gives you gold)\n\n*Ardent Censer{{item:3504}} (Take this when your team is Auto Attack Reliant)\n\n*DeathCap/Ludens/ Mejais {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3041}}  (When your team is snowballing/wealthy and you are allowed to be greedy) \n\n*Hourglass {{item:3157}} (When the enemy team has assassins or you need protection to not be focused)\n\n*Twin Shadows {{item:3023}} (This item is op, no one ever buys it, and i promise you, it will catch people and win games late game. Nice MS also)\n\n*Morrelo/Athenes {{item:3165}} {{item:3174}}  (You can buy morel vs. healing comps)\n\nRandom Support Items, you can buy these anytime you wish, if you want them/need them.

It's not uncommon for the enemies to instantly focus you because your heals are outrageous with how low of a CD they're on and how easily you sustain by hitting 2-3 people non-stop in a team fight, BUT... Warmogs makes you lose more health. \n\nA big problem with people and playing 'Drain Tanks' or 'Sustain Tanks' is that they build health. Health is wonderful, it really is, but not on a Sustain-based champion. A WW with a FH and SV will be much better off than one with a Warmogs and a SV just because the armor from the FH synergizes with the sustain since it lowers the amount of damage taken, so you get to keep your low health bar and sustain with huge numbers because the sustain is actually tiny, but you're taking so little damage that you're able to use that weak sustain to your advantage. When it comes to Soraka, Mogs is nice when you're not focused, but a good majority of the time, you're a high priority target and need the resists and armor rather than health, that way you laugh at anyone with a LW/Void, like tanks, while still being able to sustain incredibly well off of the carries due to the fact you're build with high armor and resists rather than health and letting your sustain act as health.\n\nThis is also why people can't play Aatrox in the jungle. You can't drain tank with a Cinderhulk. It really, really doesn't work, especially when your passive heals you based on your well, not by your % health and his W heals for a certain amount, not for a %. Plus none of the jungle items really works well with his kit 'cause let's face it... Warrior is iffy at best for him, Cinderhulk doesn't work well with his kit, Devourer requires farming, something he doesn't excel at, and AP Aatrox isn't legit enough.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UPfreely","date":"2015-05-28T06:01:27.713+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"both are horrible items on raka\nit takes about 7 seconds for warmogs to break even after every heal and 20 seconds if you're taking damage.(assuming 2k health)\nit takes 17-50 seconds to pay for the entire heal.\nspirit visages' passive offers about 12 AP worth of stats to your self heal at rank 1, 33 at rank 5, with no AP.\n\n\nstick to resistances for tankiness and AP for self healing.\nonly go health against unavoidable true damage, or when necessary(e.g. sightstone/aegis)\ncoin and/or biscuits make you a sustain monster in lane, you don't need to build items for it.\n\nuseful tidbits:\n\nit takes 63/88/113/138/163 AP to double your self heal at each respective rank.\nit takes 200/250/300/350/400 AP to double your heal at each respective rank.\nyou can get over 35 HP5 from runes, scaling yellows being the most efficient and becoming equal to flat yellows at lvl 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-28T15:50:42.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her base regen is so trash that getting those two items is not worth it at all.\n\nYour better getting AP and landing Q's","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnchantÃ©","date":"2015-05-28T12:37:12.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about rylais? it helps her slow better, gives some AP and health?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuzzyDevilCat","date":"2015-05-28T04:45:20.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka doesnt need tanky items, due to the fact she uses a percentage of her health, if he build ap, she will get alot of healing done, to herself, and her allies (plus minions) spirit visage, isnt good for soraka, cuz she doesnt need the health, the only thing with heath would be {{item:3027}} do to it give ap/health/and mana","replies":[]},{"poster":"AFK Push","date":"2015-05-28T04:03:16.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Boku no Pokemon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3rRR0BIx,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-05-27T23:08:13.799+0000)\n>\n> The only tank items soraka should get is {{item:3083}} and{{item:3065}} .

Nine HP5 seals and 2 HP5 Quints, along with the 2 minor points in the defense tree will give you enough regen in the laning phase to be able to liberally heal minions to deny the enemy ADC CS as well as top off your own ADC when needed.\n\nOf course, cooldown reduction is the one common factor in any Soraka build now, so much so that I recommend running 10% CDR in runes. With 10% from masteries, this equals 20% at level 1, which is extremely potent at making sure ANY level 1 engage on your ADC will not kill him/her if you start with W.\n\nI used to run full AP runes on Soraka but realized that a combination of CDR and health regen is better for the early game. You can then build your choice of AP item once laning ends. This would usually be Twin Shadows, Banner of Command, or Ardent Censer. After this, the next item depends on the game:\n\n1. Rabadon's or Luden's.\n\n2. Warmog's Armor if both teams have 2-3 tanks so fights are longer and if I feel like I can't safely self-heal from Q lands.\n\n3.

But choosing a Sightstone that has only wards over a Sightstone that also gives HP doesn't make sense.\n\nIf Astral Infusion takes you down to 90% HP, it technically \"cost\" more HP to cast it with +150 HP from sightstone.  But you also have more HP left.  90% of 1000 HP is 900 HP.  90% of 1000 HP + 150 from sightstone is more than 1035 HP.","replies":[{"poster":"Xinotine","date":"2015-05-28T20:53:26.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her W passive.

I mean, yes, technically your heal costs more, but it's the same percentage. And the more health you have, the more damage you'll be able to take from enemies. Obviously full tank seems like a bit of a mistake, but health definitely can't hurt?","replies":[]},{"poster":"XProc","date":"2015-05-28T15:07:31.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I build AP in SR and in ARAM I build Warmog's/Spirit Visage/Max AP and carry with no problems lol","replies":[]}]}
