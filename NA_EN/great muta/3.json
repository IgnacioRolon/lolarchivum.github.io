That&#039;s what I did. Plus, I can then dodge more freely as time penalties aren&#039;t a factor. I guess the loss of runes and having to spend some cash is an inconvenience, but that's about it.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2016-11-02T22:01:51.665+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure I guess if you have a lot of money and you don't care about sentimental value on anything then yeah, bans aren't really that effective. I mean, besides having to level a new account to 30 and play ranked games to get back to where you were, drop a lot of IP on your runes and rune pages, etc.\n\nFor me, I've had my account since 2011, I even have some skins you can't buy anymore like the original Championship Riven and Judgment Kayle. Not to mention my summoner icons, a lot of which you can't get anymore. It'd break my heart to lose all that I acquired since I started playing and if I got a permaban I'd probably never play again.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2016-11-02T22:10:11.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=elduris,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9oKIjhVL,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-02T22:01:51.665+0000)\n> \n> For me, I&#x27;ve had my account since 2011, I even have some skins you can&#x27;t buy anymore like the original Championship Riven and Judgment Kayle.
