I think the system should just not let you do it. As in you can't click to ban a champ once your teammate declared.

If he falls behind, he tends to get screwed for the rest of laning phase against competent opponents.\n\nIf they aren't playing Yasuo, then a significant portion of that may be rendered moot since their new champion would have fallback patterns and lack some of the above weaknesses.  Since they are no longer getting stomped or have alternative fallback patterns, they are less likely to be toxic since they can still be useful.\n-----------------------\nAlso, while not the intent of doing so or something to encourage, it can have the side effect of helping to screen out toxic teammates during Champion Select.
