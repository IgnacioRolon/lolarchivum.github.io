This undoes how I have been playing since semi-locked became an option.  That it does not center the camera on the character in Per-Side Offset mode makes things even more confusing, as this change resulted in making semi-locked mode less useful.\n\nI agree that having a button to force-center the camera on your character in all camera modes would be useful, but that should be a different button than \"return camera to its default location\" which is the function that spacebar has been filling for the past couple of years.","replies":[{"poster":"correct spelling","date":"2017-11-22T02:16:04.889+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, this has completely fucking ruined my ability to keep the camera where i want throughout the game. is there a different button that centers the camera and allows you to position it in the semilocked mode?\n\nessentially semilocked camera is meaningless now. grats.","replies":[{"poster":"Epic3801","date":"2017-11-22T22:08:38.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=balinha,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=phEoQMy4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-22T02:16:04.889+0000)\n>\n> yes, this has completely fucking ruined my ability to keep the camera where i want throughout the game. is there a different button that centers the camera and allows you to position it in the semilocked mode?\n> \n> essentially semilocked camera is meaningless now. grats.\n\nYeah semi locked is pointless now, if they dont fix it dont think ill play the game anymore.

However, instead of using the 'toggle lock' key (default: Y), I have been holding the 'center camera' key (default: spacebar) to keep the camera locked on my character when I need it.  Reaching over to keep toggling on and off automatic locking was not useful to me, and having a button that forced the camera to the place that I had put it that I could release and hold as necessary was incredibly helpful.\n\nWhat I would like (and what the sentiment of this thread seems to be) is for the \"center camera\" key to instead return the camera to its appropriate offset (which it currently does for Per-Side Offset) instead of to directly center the camera on my character, which undoes the muscle memory of the last couple of years of enjoying Semi-Locked mode.\n\nI can understand why there would be a dedicated \"center the camera on my character\" key (which I thought was F1), and why some people would want the current behaviour, and why the change was made, but I would like to have a \"return camera to where I put it\" key that I could set to mimic the functionality before this patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2017-11-27T21:08:14.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't forgotten about you!

I want the camera to stay where it is, relative to my character.\n2. I want to reposition the camera around my character, and have that be the new currently locked position.\n3. I want to freely look around the map using existing controls (edge of screen, and using the minimap) with or without holding down a button to free myself from the camera's locked box\n\nThe reason that the previous spacebar functionality was ideal was that holding it gave #1 and #2 - the camera stayed locked on my character unless I moved the mouse to the edge of the screen to reposition it, and it could never leave a (sometimes too restrictive) box.  Releasing the spacebar engaged #3, letting me look around the map until I needed to see my character again.\n\nIn the ideal setup, a way to toggle quickly from 'return camera to locked position' and 'enable free camera' would be the most useful, with a separate keystroke/keyhold for 'I am repositioning the camera now'.  It would take some getting used to, without a doubt, but the reason I found holding spacebar to be preferential to pressing Y was that I could get 1+2 or 3 by by holding or releasing one button.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riddarn","date":"2017-11-23T21:04:56.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=phEoQMy4,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-11-22T23:20:07.056+0000)\n>\n> So, let me understand this correct.\n> \n> You are using semi-locked camera without the camera actively being tracked (Camera Locked: Toggled OFF, with Camera Lock Type as Semi-locked.)\n> When you are pressing Space while Camera is locked, you want the old behavior where it returns to the last offset position?
