They also started to hack into my friend's accounts via links. They send you to like the league of legends site saying you will get the riot kayle skin coming out or the free dreadknight garen skin that was available a long time ago i believe. However, the link redirects after you sign yourself into the league site and they get your account information. I would just like my email reset and to anyone else facing this current issue and my 5lp back for dodging my ranked game would be nice too ;-; rito help and you get caught into the trap easily because they log into your account afterwards and send it to all your friends causing more and more people to be caught in this","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T20:17:30.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clicking on unsolicited links is always a risky click, even if it's from a friend.
