I have received multiple honor check points since my last punishment and really think this is unfair. I have played hundreds of games without being toxic/leaving/etc. I believe the automatic system flagged me and perma banned me.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-12-13T00:12:22.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we see your reform card please?","replies":[{"poster":"TlNY MEAT GANG","date":"2018-12-13T00:15:27.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can I show you that?

At that point, it's so long between punishments you're hardly gaming the system.\n\nAnd no, no one's likely to test this because it would take too long and more effort than it would be worth.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-13T05:57:52.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vreivai,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XFRdeRr0,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-13T05:55:04.716+0000)\n>\n> Punishment levels de-escalate if you show steps toward reform, i.e. a sufficient number of neutral/positive games.\n> \n> And really, if there&#x27;s a couple years (or longer, Riot is understandably intentionally vague about how long it takes to de-escalate a punishment tier) between behavior that escalates to a 14-day ban, is it that bad?
