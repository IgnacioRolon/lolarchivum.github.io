My paypal has 49.96$ CAD on it, and my card has less than that amount. Yet, when I try to make a 50$ RP purchase and have it use both methods, it seems to ignore the fact that I have money in my paypal and tries to make the full 50$ purchase with my card. How can I make it so that it pays 49.96$ from my paypal, and then the other 4 cents with my card? If it's not possible, why not?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T18:36:40.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe a transaction can only use one of the methods for the purchase, and not both.  You might have to transfer some funds from your card to your paypal wallet.  Make sure to include any potential taxes in that balance.  That's my best guess though, but you might get better context by contacting our billing team through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  They may be able to help with more info or options.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
