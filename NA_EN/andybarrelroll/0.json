I was super tilted in the game, but I never wrote anything negative about another player, just about wrote that I was bad and tilted. I gave positive feedback to my team the entire game and didn't use any words that might have been harmful to other players.\nHere is the chat from that game: \nhttps://gyazo.com/0f1f94eea045b086c11ec3e17b57edfc \nI don't know if it's a bot or human that read the chat, because the two things I can think of that might have been offensive to another player is the first part were I wrote that he was just a ''small black baby'', but that was his actual ingame username, and the second part were I wrote kys (which I instantly corrected to kms). \nI just want to hear your opinions on this! :)\nSry for the bad pic, but I didn't want to send 9 different ones so I melted them together fast.\nEdit: does anyone know how long the support takes to answer? \nEdit2: Thank you so much for your help lads! A riot employee reverted my suspensions and if it wouldn't been for your help I probably wouldn't have sent in a ticket! :) https://gyazo.com/87e72ec871e1dd893db3f3fee3259765","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-12-12T11:24:57.539+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see a bit of possible racially-charged chat with \"you're just a small black baby, nothing you can do against that.\" But the lines that probably triggered the ZT filter for the IFS:\n\n> i want to kys\n> not kys\n> kms\n\nHonestly, you might want to put in a support ticket about this one and see what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"AndyBarrelRoll","date":"2019-12-12T11:27:16.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I thought about the baby part aswell, but his ign was that haha and I wrote it after he died to an invade. :P \nThanks for your opinion, I will send in a ticket!

It's not like a racial or homophobic slur which also would lead to automatic bans as well. I assume most people know what \"kys\" means what what if someone doesn't and simply asks what does \"kys\" stand for? Would they be automatically banned as well?\n\nBut anyway that appears that's what happened here. The term \"kys\" is a zero tolerance term that leads to an automatic ban and skips straight to a 14 day suspension. Not sure when they made it that way because I know back in S4 and S5 people used that term left and right without any consequences but now I would avoid using that term or anything remotely close to it in the future to be on the safe side.","replies":[{"poster":"AndyBarrelRoll","date":"2019-12-12T13:20:18.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system does have it flaws, but I honestly rather get banned for something quite small (small IMO) than it being like CS:GO where you can write and say anything without consequenses. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Famous Gay Actor","date":"2019-12-17T23:34:30.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, you can use things like the n-word or tell people to \"kys\" without getting punished in CS:GO?
