It's really important to go over every single step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure all possibilities are ruled out.

However, ping issues did not go away. For the rest of the connection issues guide:\nSwitch to a wired connection: Same ping issues as before\nFirewall Troubleshooting: League is already an exception in my firewall\nConfigure your dns: I tried using both automatic DNS as well as the Google public ips, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4\nPacket Loss: ICSI Netalyzer Results http://n1.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/restore/id=369839a0-13394-6a558338-dc4d-4057-93a9/rd\nPacket Buffering: I was the only one on the wi-fi and no other programs were open, but there was still fluctuating ping\nPort Forwarding: I port forwarded the reccomended ports and nothing changed\nVPN and Proxy Usage: I do not use a proxy or vpn\nRelease/Renew IP and Flush DNS: For some reason I can not release or renew my ip, but I can flush the DNS, which does nothing.\n\nSome additional measures I took to fix the problem:\n-Turning off the Interrupt Moderation setting of my Local Area Connection\n-Changing the channel my router was on\n-Re-patching league\n\nI don't think this is an issue with the LoL Client because running a ping test from lolping.org gives around the same widely fluctuating ping results.\n\nI can get to a very good ping level at around 70 ms, but it just won't stay there T-T\n\nHopefully I can figure something out soon, getting quite discouraged :/","replies":[{"poster":"darlingg","date":"2016-11-04T07:03:15.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**I FIXED IT**\n\nNetwork and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings > Right click your wireless connection adapter  > Properties > Configure... > Advanced tab\n\n-802.11n Channel Width for band 2.4GHz and 5GHz: Changed from 20MHz only to Auto\n-802.11n Mode: Enabled\n-Roaming Aggressiveness: Medium\n\nMy ping is now 65ms for 99% of play time, with one or two ping spikes per game.

My ping bounces around from 90-200 even when other devices are not in use. I have pinged the League of Legends server on another PC in my household, and it is running with consistent 82-88ms. Could this just be an issue with my PC? The game is playable, but is not as fun when you have to aim your Lux ult with your jumping ping in mind. I've wondered whether I should give Hextech Repair Tool another shot, but I'm still hung up on the fact the other computer (without League installed) is communicating with the server better than this one (with League installed). Forgive me if I'm missing something, my knowledge of this subject is severely limited. I have also pinged other sites like Google and come up with consistent 48-50ms, so it's leading me to think there is something off with the connection between League servers and my PC. I would really appreciate some pointers.
