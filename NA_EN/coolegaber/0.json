Sometimes it can take a bit for those totals to update, and most of the time logging out can force it to update. \n\nIf you really think something is going wrong with your IP, there's also a small chance that someone could have been on your account and spent some of it =\\, in which case I'd suggest reaching out to our account specialists asap with our [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).","replies":[{"poster":"too numb to care","date":"2017-05-15T02:14:16.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening to me every time too. Its a bug for sure. I logged in today with 6177 IP and I played 3 games, and got 6448 IP. Tried to buy Rakhan and it said I didnt have enough IP. So I logged out and logged back in , and I seen it at 6448 and then it jumped back down 6177. The only time my IP actually sticks, is when I play a lot of games in one login session, and get a lot of IP.
