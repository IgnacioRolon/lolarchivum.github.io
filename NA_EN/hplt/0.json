Inspired by the following thread:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ghKQoeu8-how-to-unbind-your-enter-key-to-prevent-inadvertent-toxicity\n\nI wrote a self chat restriction script for League of Legends using Autohotkey. I've seen some threads requesting such a tool, but I was surprised no one actually provided a solution in the past. Compared to the method explained in the thread above, it enables a similar experience to the chat restriction implemented by Riot. You can define how many initial chat messages you want to have available, how long the chat restriction will last and how many additional chat prompts you get after the chat restriction timer elapsed.\nI hate being completely cut off from the communication but often find myself arguing too hard - Thus I personally prefer to be permantly chat restricted.\n\nYou can download it here:\n\n[removed by moderation pending more information on the legality of the script]\n\nI also added tooltips, thus you can see if it is loading/working correctly.\n\nWhat do you have to do:\n\n1. Download Autohotkey - https://autohotkey.com/\n\n2. Run the Script\n\n3. Start League\n\n4. Select a game\n\n5. Between champ select and Loading screen OR if the game is already running tab out and press the left mouse click once--> You will see a message that the Script successfully loaded at the tip of your mouse cursor (League of Legends.exe must be started but not an active window to start the script)\n\n6. Play the game :)\n\nIn order to load the script in a new game just du step 5 before every game (as long as the script is running).\n\nThe script doesn't interfere with the rest of windows. So you can tab out of a game and the system should behave normally.\n\n\n\nCheers Max / HPLT\n\n\n\nvirustotal scan:\n\n[https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/e67db90b37d4736ef2f62ee16b068f23e32250107c12ad103d383b43d59a5743/analysis/1539137476/\n](https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/e67db90b37d4736ef2f62ee16b068f23e32250107c12ad103d383b43d59a5743/analysis/1539137476/)\n\nP.S.

I found a response by a Riot employee for the unbind Enter key script but it would be very nice if someone can verify that statement also for this case.\nhttps://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour-en/WvoxQ6b7-perma-banned-for-disabling-enter-key?show=flat&amp;page=3\n\n> Hi there,\n> \n> NiceToMeatYou44 here.\n> \n> I'm afraid the Enter key cannot be unbound.\n> \n> Now, regarding the program, as long as you are not using Autohotkey to spam the chat (you're doing quite the opposite here), which IS bannable, then you should be able to use it without a problem.\n> \n> I ask that you would use the hotkeys responsibly, and as long as you do, then you should have nothing to worry about\n> \n> If you have any other questions, feel free to let me know!\n> \n> All the best,\n> \n> NiceToMeatYou44\n> \n> Player Support Specialist","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-10-10T13:12:41.520+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey!\n\nAwesome initiative.

You might write something, what you would not do typically and regret afterwards. The whole purpose of the script is, that if you have just limited chat resources you might use them for the most important things and don't start a heated conversation with your own team or the enemy.\nIf you look into the raw code, all it does is basically setting the enter key to sleep after a certain amount of presses.

It uses a very akward language and you cannot implement libraries. It is very limit in its use cases. I am currently working on detecting if an input between to enter strokes was done, in order to prevent that empty messages will lead to consumption of available chat messages. Even that is given me headaches because I also have to consider tabbing in and out. \nIt might be easier to have a list of inappropriate words, which prevent the message from going through. But than again, I don't want to get babysitted by the script. I don't think you will change your behaviour if a program just filters your innappropriate language - You need to have the will to reform.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenixdust","date":"2018-10-11T14:42:29.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are familiar with C# you can just use my code to make a better version of this.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/F59hE5io-self-mute-option\n\nIn theory it is possible to save the input between 2 enter presses, and you can inject backspaces in the input stream before the 2nd enter press happens (It would be ideal to directly delete it from the LoL memory, but that is against the rules, so injecting backspaces is the only viable solution here, i think O.o).

I am not a programmer but a materials scientist and just code a bit for fun :p. Unfortunatly I am not familiar with C#, but hey maybe (in the future) I will look into it to realise what it does. Problems with writing a real program - Either I post the source code and most people don't know how to compile it or I create an .exe and it will never get approved because I could hide harmful code in it. I mean theoretically It should be possible to also detect the input between the two enter strokes with autohotkey by using regular expression and then store this data and compare it with a list of innappropriate words and phrases, but this list would be stored in plain text and people would find easy workarounds like removing single letters to be able to still post the message. I think it would rather be a feasibility study than anything else ^^.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2018-10-11T08:39:55.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking about getting the outstream of the keyboard directly to analyze it. maybe with windows API.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenixdust","date":"2018-10-11T14:43:26.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was done, if you are familiar with c# feel free to extend it and publish a better version :)\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/F59hE5io-self-mute-option","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-10-11T00:00:36.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it would likely result in;\n\na) players who vent knowing it will change anyway just to release frustration could say something that might go through unintentionally and get baited into a ban.\n\nb) the fact they type the literal some phrases could alert bot detections.
