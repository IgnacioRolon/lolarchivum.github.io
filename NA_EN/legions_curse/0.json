Fps and ping are the same throughout the entire game but at random times, maybe 5-10 times a game i will get a 2-3 second delay in which i cant move or cast abilities, anything i do in that time will happen when the delay stops. Everything around me keeps moving (screen doesn't freeze or anything) then every action i took happens and everything is fine until it happens again. Any ideas on what may be causing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T21:00:45.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're describing sounds a lot like **super high** packet buffering or peaks in packet loss. Either can be caused by some local network settings or by issues along your route to the server. As a first step, I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
