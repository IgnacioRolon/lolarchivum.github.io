All of us?  \n\nI think it's pretty effective. In the case of Malzahar and Ziggs bottom lane, it's impressive that they seem to find some success even though people aren't particularly practiced with the champion in that particular role. That said, I think Malzahar's lane takes some getting used to playing against but once you understand voidlings it's not hard to counter them.\n\nHeard Caitlyn/Malzahar was a pretty deadly combination but... Caitlyn just about anything is pretty rough for most match-ups bottom.","replies":[{"poster":"Galeo","date":"2017-01-11T19:27:39.271+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sotere,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ea62cbJ1,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-01-11T19:16:08.484+0000)\n>\n...
