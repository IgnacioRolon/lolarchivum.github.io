So you basically have a 1 minute window to kill him. We then need to take into account he builds serephs and either RoA or Abyssal  (Sometimes both and maybe even Frozen Heart) so he's fairly durable.\n\nEdit: He also has 30% CDR on his sums, 40 if he takes CDR boots.

Everytime I play vs tahm I have to play a completely different play style. My play style is to go in and half hp or more someone as poppy jg (trin or titanic op). When I play vs tahm, I have to go on like every pick I can no matter if good or bad. If I just go for adc or mage he will eat them and the engage is done with them sometimes killing me. I have to play protect the carries more often than not to win vs him which is just stupid. The thing that janna and lulu have as counterplay that tahm removes is the ability to do damage to the adc (except dots on adc I guess). You can click or throw skill shots or w/e to do damage to the carry. I feel like if riot wants to be able to make tahm healthy and keep this protect the adc with swallowing him identity they need to change something about his w. I honestly do not have a good idea into how but it needs some sort of delay or charge to it. Keeping his w exactly the same with no real delays to it except being near him will always make people hate him. I think the charge thing should be similar to how it works on his auto attacks for the q stun and w charge except with his w on allies (tbh idk how riot would be able to make this even work but it's just an idea).\n\nSorry for the rant but this guy is the most frustrating support to play against imo except when you are the adc (even then it can be really annoying).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2018-02-01T09:13:38.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rexxiee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l3114pMx,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-01-31T22:47:07.556+0000)\n>\n> Tahm design is literally being anti-interaction.\n\nTahm should have a \"tether\" effect on allies he spits out so that they don't die right off the bat if he fucks up while also being able to exit at will. that way if you have a troll kench.
