Giving AP to specific champions restricts other champions that might have wanted to go AP.\n\nLike for example I'm playing Karma support and I don't get AP but Mordekaiser gets AP. It's kinda lame. Or maybe I'm playing some hybrid champions and I want some extra AP early, kinda lame.\n\nI do think he should have base stat increased but no champion should get free AP just cause. Getting stats from the new rune system is fine because you make a choice their and are choosing specific power out of a bunch of power you could get.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-09-07T23:12:44.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KoKoboto,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H9FTRhAs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-07T21:26:16.702+0000)\n>\n> \n> Like for example I&#x27;m playing Karma support and I don&#x27;t get AP but Mordekaiser gets AP.

His best builds focus on AP though. In comparison to other hybrids who spec into more A/S and on-hit items.
