Some of the other things that we need to make sure are that they can contribute to objectives (turrets, dragon etc) meaningfully in early/mid game, as well as scale up adequately with game length so that you're not gimping yourself if you take a melee bot into a ranged bot and lose when the game gets to 30 because they're able to take objectives faster. These are all just things on very long lists of problems we'll need to solve for it, but I'm excited.\n\nOh also, to your reply to me from a few days ago regarding nuanced decision making. This is one of the things that I didn't want to talk about then before this video, but this is one of the things that goes pretty hard in that regard (and that we're pretty excited about if we can do it). Taking a non traditional bot lane changes the way your entire team comp forms, the items you and your teammates buy, how you rotate around the map and all that jazz. I'll agree with your statement that at present there's certain aspects of it that are lacking, but as we investigate new runes and some of this meta breaking stuff I think we're going to get to a state that this is far more of a reality.

The problem are the melees themselves since they don't have reliable gap closers or escapes. Yasuo and Morde work on bot because(besides mordes xp passive) they have shields to negate most of the damage from poke. \n\nThey kinda have to rework the supports into more \"melee friendly\"- champs or more procteting champs who can provide help to melees in early stages which wouldn't work because marksmen would abuse it. They could also try to give more sustain to melees in form of items.\n\nNot sure what you think about it but maybe a different form of dorans shield which will act like a xin ult except instead of blocking damage it could reduce the damage in a certain range and become the full damage the closer you get?

That's probably one of the very _few_ things that Defense of the Ancients does better than this game because you don't always need a ranged carry depending on your team comp.
