He has a dash, now non-spammable Q which allocates a lot of his damage.  He kept the shield(and seemingly gained a gatling gun from what I remember),  but it seems as though a lot of his damage will be from short-ranged shotgun bursts that are instead situational and wider than Graves\n\nthough if you look even further, their ultimates have about the same range except that graves offers instant damage and if i'm judging properly, a slightly larger range compared to the \"death blender\" and its hook.  To vary this comparison even further,  Graves has an area of effect ultimate, but except for Urgot's new Q, urgot has to position in crazy manners to achieve effectiveness.\n\nIt seems like this will bare the same problem as fiora and gangplank, where when a player gets good, there is no escaping the onslaught of damage and the \"mini game\" instead becomes annoying as it distracts from the focus of the lane and the battles at hand\n\nAny insight on this?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2017-07-08T06:59:35.451+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive is supposed to have a similar feel to Graves' autos, but I don't think anything feels very similar beyond that.\n\nAs opposed to Fiora and GP, I think it feels less game-y after the lane ends, because he tends to turn on W early and put them all on cooldown pretty quickly, so tracking them individually isn't as important as it is in the lane. You can mostly just assume he has them when the fight starts, and doesn't a few seconds later. Individuals' mileage may vary, however, as far as how much mindshare it's taking up.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Azteryz","date":"2017-07-08T03:51:31.524+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"correct me if im wrong but does the champion model that urgot eats/execute disappear after? \ncause that would be incrediable","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2017-07-08T03:56:19.523+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe so.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-07-08T04:52:15.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"could it leave a pool of blood? or have a special death animation for champs killed by it","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-07-08T10:39:04.471+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play Vlad.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-07-08T14:12:51.145+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"How your post looked like\n_Good day sir, do you have time to talk about our lord and donor Vlad?_","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-07-08T15:58:51.797+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"All my posts are like that, even when I'm not talking about Vlad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-07-08T16:00:48.828+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this isn't just for the forums either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DorsalChicken","date":"2017-07-08T05:42:34.631+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The corpse vanishing because he ground it up is awesome.
