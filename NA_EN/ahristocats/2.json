Its like a journeyman laughing at a master trade crafter.  Sure, you might have a different way to approach the issues.  But it still makes the point that how they want the champ buff or they area it would impact is them expressing FREE good information.  Why don't you ever listen?\n\nSo here is someone that played EQ at the start.  Vumelin the necro (did complete all epic weapons and yea I saw there with the expension with a lot of XX's in all the names).  Then in WoW (our eq guild moved because of the awesome \"Operation Pansy Stomp\" happened.  Not with heavens of fire but was influential.  Busta my sham was the first to get Hammer of Rag on the server  (sure pissed a lot of people off but man pvp was fun)  Also had a lock (vumelin) / Pal (jmman) after a few expansion came out.  In Top ranked TN team for Halo invite to NY nationals, etc etc.  Now, I would be more than happy to help you verify any of this.\n\nMy point of this is I understand balancing, money, and fun.  As you can see I have had TOTAL changes in characters and how they work.  I have seen Multiple different styles and way games system interact.  They are all the same just a little different.  Sure I might not express or get the information across the way I have it in my mind all the time.  But Seeing all the down votes and post by red on things I feel I know 100% more than them on is heart breaking.  Sure I can't tell you about other champs really because I don't have 8 years in them as I do fiddle.  But how many fiddle questions have I been asked.... ZERO.  As an 8 year main why is my input or how I think about me have less barren than someone that has ZERO games on him and post a funny meme getting a lot of up votes.  (which I'm sure can be altered)\n\nPlus number don't tell you happiness or how you feel playing a champ.\n\nWhen a season 1 main post about his champ I don't tend to response because I now that person has a pretty good idea he know what he is talking about.  Sure the way to fix it might not be the best....BUT the area that needs fixing is usually right on.  I'm use an example.  See you nerf fiddle damage to minion.  (not getting into balance of it)  But then look what your going to do how.   Everyone lost -5ad, nerf wave clear for mages.  Now fiddle already had a bad time farming.  This also cares over to the jungle.  its just the way his spells work.  Instead of seeing how the wave clear changes and lose of ad works out you nerf him.  So once you nerf wave clear again this put a double nerf on a champ that already had a hard time with wave clear.  Does jungle wave clear..... sure late game.  The problem is you don't understand fiddle.  See he has high mana cost.  He isn't like other mages that spam for wave clear.  If you spam you need to only have 1 or 2 levels with does no real damage.  But if you do level it you have only have .75sec fear and a drain that only heal or do damage for shit.  This isn't a give him the minion damage back.  its I'm saying this is going to be a future problem with the upcoming wave clear changes (which I think needs to happen).  \n\nIn summation, If you want to nerf someone because of a high win rate and low play rate then nerf everyone with high win rates across the board.  If you want to nerf wave clear mid.  nerf it across the board not the struggling one and say Soon* on the rest.  If you say you want diversity don't nerf low play rate champs in other positions.  These are my issues.  Your are picking and choosing instead of a systemic process.  This leads people to saying Balance team doesn't know what they are doing.  And they are correct.  But without reason involved it becomes unreasonable.  My issues aren't fiddle was nerfed.  Its your reasoning behind it but leaving champs with high play rates and high win rates and saying they are just \"fun\" champs is honestly Bullshit.  Sure, I like flying a F-35 compared to a F-105D in a dog fight because its more \"FUN\" too.  Maybe you should have added more \"fun\" to the older kits or added less \"fun\" to the newer kits.  Fun = true damage, mobility, burst, safe farming, spelling doing multiple things.\n\nThink about what you said then think about all the time I've been down vote from red and people that don't have one single game on fiddle.  Because I look people up to see.  Now i'm just waiting for the \"hive\" mind to tell me how they know more than me on a champ they have never played.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TempName74814","date":"2018-03-25T18:36:07.518+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Je suis Rubick,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a4TqaAej,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-03-25T17:41:52.209+0000)\n>\n> I hit master tier every single season\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/G67Q7eY.png[]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cPmZC95.jpg[]","replies":[{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2018-03-25T19:05:38.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Early season probably.","replies":[{"poster":"TempName74814","date":"2018-03-25T19:24:53.460+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i guarantee it's impossible to drop to gold after getting master unless you're boosted or inting every game and somehow not getting banned","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dysnomia","date":"2018-03-25T17:44:27.422+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":12,"body":"They made it.
