Thing is, their melee, they have to get in range, it makes sense for them to become invisible to do so especially since they sacrifice safety and mobility for it, Talon for example has no way to get out of a fight once he's in unless he hops over a wall, if he hopped over one wall to get in, he also can't use the same one to get out, you know what that is? Counter play. \n\nA ranged champion with the kind of range that Twitch has, doesn't have to sacrifice anything for it, he can stay well out of a fight easily and unlike other stealth champions, you can't see him until after he attacks. With everyone else you can see them at least a split second before they do, rengar will actually reveal himself when he click on you with his ultimate, when he leaps out that gives you 1 second to react to him.

However, it still is more effective to play around the BKB, and once the 5 second duration expires, you hit him with CC and other stuns and kill him.

When AS is too strong Twitch is too strong and the versa.  He relies on getting off several procs and is single target.  He's prob broke in solo queue just because he has an Eve effect and Riot has been nerfing the fuck out of wards every season, but in competitive he's situational at best.  Kog tends to be better Twitch when you're in organized 5s since he has midgame powerspike and the range boost more consistently.\n\nBut you know when I read that title I don't think of Twitch, I think about how overnerfed Trist and Kalista are and how Yasuo is constantly rebalanced.  They don't know how to do late game right, you say there's no counterplay for Twitch and if you're weaker than him late its a bit of a stat check but he's an immobile sieger.  Often this design is the worst when it's applied to someone who's actually mobile since you won't even have \"CC them\" as an option since most ccs are skillshots and mobility makes skillshots weaker.\n\nHonestly I'd love if Twitch's powercurve looked like Lucian or Draven's, I can't pick this guy into hard matchups or games with strong assassins and I've mained him a couple years now.  His power budget is mostly in attack speed and his R which are scaling abilities.  Maybe if the passive was moved to E and he was given something as compensation I think a small rework could be justified for that purpose, but Riot is ok with making absurd early and shit late and the vice versa as champion designs.  \n\nI don't like hard counters or removing agency, but just because Twitch is above average one patch he gets called broken when there's has been and will be more problematic designs.

Twitch has NO counterplay? \n\nhttp://www.gifimagesdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laughing-hysterically-gif-1245.gif\n\nLMAO. You're telling me that an ADC with zero dashes, zero in-combat movement speed boosts, zero escape PERIOD, has no counterplay? His only self peel is a 25-45% slow. \n\nAn ADC that doesn't build _any_ defensive stats or items, that doesn't even bother buying {{item:3812}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3071}},  has no counter play? \n\nhttps://m.popkey.co/346298/v0Eg5_s-200x150.gif?c=popkey-web&p=mars&i=3musketeers&l=search&f=.gif\n\nHello? {{item:2055}} ? ASSASSINS? \n\nTwitch is the SQUISHIEST adc in this entire game except for maybe {{champion:96}} and gets popped like a fucking balloon the second he comes out of stealth. You have to be kidding me right? \n\nAlso you are comparing Twitch to FACELESS VOID. LOL. Last time I checked, Twitch didn't have a 5 second team-wide stun, a dash, an Ekko ultimate on his Q, or stun on his autos. BAHHAHHA. \n\nhttp://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/ftpuploads/bloguploads/laughing-gifs-jonah-jameson.gif\n\nTalking about no counter play when {{champion:105}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:11}} still around in their state?\n\nYou crack me up dude. \n\nOr maybe you could just let someone on your team actually play Yasuo so one W just blocks his entire ult\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-06-06T22:31:57.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PhantomAxolotl,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HKLEugdE,comment-id=0044,timestamp=2017-06-06T22:30:15.395+0000)\n>\n> LMAO.

Are you saying that Twitch should be weak in late game?  What would be the purpose of him then?  How would you change him?  Why would those changes fix the problem and why will those change not dumpster twitch?  Twitch is a very short range ADC that has one of the hardest times getting out of laning phase.  He has no escape save his stealth (which is easily countered by being close to him).  Twtich can only make one strong play and that revolves around the timing of his ultimate.  You want counterplay?  Keep track of his ultimate and when a teamfight starts be prepared to disengage at first then try to reengage after his ult is down.  I know that is harder to do then it sounds but it is doable.  It becomes much harder when a team is designed around a protect the twitch composition as Lulu, Orianna, and Karma all give MS boosts with their shields.  This is why team coordination is so important as you can do crazy combinations like that to win games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2017-06-06T11:39:55.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:236}} {{champion:51}} Usually end the game before Twitch even has a chance at doing anything. If you have (If you don't it's your teams fault, not the champions.) a champion on your team that can CC like {{champion:57}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:79}} then those are all easy kills. You shouldn't be so bunched up together that the rat ends up killing you all in a pentakill and if you're off by your own then . . . well I mean. Let's be honest here, if Twitch is at end game and you're off by yourself- that's just- well. You just didn't use your noggin. Twitch will end up killing himself if he engages in a 5v1. But what if his team engages? Disengage and find out where he is, put wards down and retreat- force them to come to you. It's end game- towers are either made of paper or no more towers even exist.\n\nThere is so much to do against Twitch. Why not just {{champion:67}} R+Q and 2 shot him? She would heal the first AA all of the damage of Twitches first AA and instantly kill him on the first AA. The bigger issue is that {{champion:236}} is in every single damn game, I'm starting to feel like a racist because of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-06-06T12:31:35.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subject 5,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HKLEugdE,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2017-06-06T11:39:55.833+0000)\n>\n>  Why not just {{champion:67}} R+Q and 2 shot him? \n\nthat's not counterplay, but counterpick\n\nto answer to you it's because vayne needs 4 items to be relevant, twitch needs 2 items to be relevant, after 2 items his damage will impact a teamfight\nvayne has no AOE damage and her single target damage needs way more to be impactful\n\nand then, if a twitch is dumb enough to be caught by a vayne instead of waiting that the teamfight starts to come from stealth to kill everyone then it's low elo not high elo\nand then, if he does what i said vayne cannot reach him with her range and frontline cc'ing her","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-06-06T12:33:53.387+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Janna X RubicK,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HKLEugdE,comment-id=000c0000,timestamp=2017-06-06T12:31:35.159+0000)\n>\n> that&#x27;s not counterplay, but counterpick\n\nits even worse. its basically saying counterplay him with a champion who has even less counterplay.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-06-06T14:10:35.493+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"that takes out a sizeable chunk of the roster, if you are fair and also state \n> [{quoted}](name=Irelia Bot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HKLEugdE,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-06-06T07:10:31.395+0000)\n>\n> And on the other end it should not be &quot;survive for 40 minutes and they fall off&quot; Isn&#x27;t that right Renekton and Panth?\n\nthen even more of the roster is gone or reworked.
