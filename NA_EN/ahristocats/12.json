Despite his presence, [his winrate is 45,5% over the entire spring season across all regions](http://gamesoflegends.com/champion/stats.php?id=119&tournament=ALL&season=S8&split=Spring) and [44,1% in top 5 regions).](http://gamesoflegends.com/champion/stats.php?id=119&tournament=ALL&league=TOP5&season=S8&split=Spring&patch=ALL&role=ALL)\n\n[And in soloQ he is bad as well.](https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/current/platinum/plus/champion/Gnar/Top/)\n\nNow, about Galio.\n\nOn 8.8:\n\n- {{item:3003}} gets nerfed (3% -> 1% max mana converted into AP, {{item:3040}} is untouched though (I would like to see like 2 or 2,5% though). That nerf is a nerf to basically every meta midlaner that is not Galio/Azir/Swain.\n\n- {{champion:163}} gets nerfed (532 -> 502 base HP, Q cooldown 9/7,5/6/4,5/3 to 11/9/7/5/3). Again, a fair change that slows down her roaming capabilities and gives more counterplay to Taliyah (= you can fight her), at least until level 9.\n\n- {{champion:13}} gets nerfed (E cost 40/55/70/85/100 -> 60/70/80/90/100). Hurts his laning phase a fair bit (which is fair, given the fact that he wins most midlane matchups).\n\n- {{champion:3}} gets nerfed (R cooldown 180/150/120 -> 200/180/160.). Let's be honest here, this will be a lot bigger nerf to competitive Galio rather than soloQ Galio.\n\n{{champion:50}} was nerfed on 8.7 (Q damage 65/85/105/125/145 -> 55/75/95/115/135, Q cooldown 5,5/4,75/4/3,25/2,5 -> 7,5/6,25/5/3,75/2,5) And we don't know the impact those nerfs had on competitive Swain because there are no competitive games that were played on 8.7.\n\nIt seems like that the god tier midlaner on 8.8 in competitive would be {{champion:268}} (I am not sure what the MSI patch will be though). Seems weird to me that he wasn't touched at all, since he will be the biggest winner from nerfs in 8.6/8.7/8.8.\n\nBetween assassin/ignite buffs, LeBlanc and Ahri updates, the midlane pool should be a lot more open (especially if Azir becomes a redside permaban). I still expect midlane to be full of mages, but except for Azir there should not be a clear cut god tier toplaner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-04-17T00:16:08.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Of course you dont get it... youre not a game designer.
