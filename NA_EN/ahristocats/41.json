I would say his damage is too high (and I'd say that for all ADC and their itemisation), but Jhin, at least, has that period of vulnerability where he cannot do anything.\n\nA Jhin wastes all his shots on the tank, then the enemy team commits? Prepared to be steam rolled by the enemy Vayne. Go in to assassinate when he's reloading? Deleted before he can burst you out.

I just checked on the PBE vs live, with the build I normally go it's like 10 extra AD to his passive and about 50 extra damage on his Q. The buff to his W honestly feels like it should have came on release. Just hoping he doesn't get too many buffs to the point where Riot puts him in the gutter. As for landing his W off ult, I don't think this will be possible, and even if it was, usually you'd use your W before ulting to stop them from moving for your team to catch up, then ult them. I can't see the point of using W after you've used everything else because by that point they should be dead. This may just be a PBE bug but his auto attacks feel faster despite having the same attack speed as before(or maybe I'm just not ever used to getting level 18 on Jhin), but I'm almost certain there's a bug rn on PBE that's making lethal tempo actually increase his attack speed for like a second. If you time it right you can get 2 auto attacks right after the other and it feels so amazing. Of course this doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough from my experience in practice tool.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2018-02-26T23:29:47.764+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-02-27T17:30:28.243+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"but how is jhin a counter to ashe","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FläshFourthShot","date":"2018-02-27T17:19:59.055+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well holy shit","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2018-02-27T16:05:02.249+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp back to pick/ban status lol\n\nJhin nukes coming back once again, though it'll give me a reason to put him back into my pool","replies":[]},{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-02-27T09:12:23.690+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now that is a bunch of unnessecery changes.
