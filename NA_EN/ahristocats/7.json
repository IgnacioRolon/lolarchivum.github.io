Nice seeing that you guys are looking at the botlane^^\n\nAnd i have question, a short while ago i found myself playing Ashe, i was doing moderately well for a casual but the rest of my team was doing very well.  And as i was hanging onto their backs for dear life and success i suddenly got jumped by the enemy Rengar. He and i were quite even but he killed my Ashe in under 1,5 seconds before anyone in my team even had the chance to react.  He died right after but it felt quite bad since i didn't really feel i could have done anything to stop him. And there are similar things with other assassins currently. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? To me the lethality buffs seems to have pushed the \"traditional\" adc's and builds like ashe and crit far into the back in favor of those who use it. Because anything else doesn't quite work in comparison.   It already felt difficult to play say Ashe or Jinx in the botlane due to constant and often huge harass from mages while also trying to farm without losing all ones health.  Now with the rising assassins and lethality users it feels ....very difficult to even survive a minute without something like a thresh or Braum hugging you. \n\n\n\nAnd please do something for malz, i am well aware that his old kit was very, very unhealthy in terms of counterplay but i can't even get his current one to work in the midlane anymore, and his passive discolors any skin that isn't purple except the snowday one.   My biggest issue was in a AOE heavy teamfight when my voidlings kept dying of random shots here and there which seems to cripple Malzahar's damage. I felt very useless and my damage in the end was among the lowest in that game.
