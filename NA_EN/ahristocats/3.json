Veigar counter are not only assassin but most mages can easily beat veigar in 1v1, he does not have a reliable cc to hit his combo and his low range (especially his ult) force him to do pedictable movement and that allows the other mages to burst him down thanks to their more relaiable CC. Veigar only get 1 ap that mean 0,6 more damage for his q, 1 for his w and 0,75 to 1,5 for his r. Veigar mymu surely encourage veigar to try and fight/poke but is bad early game make it difficult to win trades and so he still mostly farm while trying to get some q poke when he can, only when veigar q was targeted he preferred fighting over farming.

Everyone should have niches.\n\nBut this is just ridiculous. There was some LCS match a pretty long time ago, where a team composed of a 3 items Lucian, 2 items Twisted Fate and a full tank Nautilus went from outter turret all the way to the other team's Nexus in 40 seconds, or something like that. Cant seem to find it anymore though,mbut the boards had quite the reaction.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-03T19:55:04.464+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't even need the game, it happens everytime in my rankeds","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2017-01-03T07:08:04.698+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The start of the game is cancer atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxRinkyDinkyxX","date":"2017-01-03T06:43:00.938+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes because one outlier = fact.\n\nThese forums arent even discussion anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2017-01-03T12:26:28.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have they ever been?

Problem is losing doesn't bother me per say, losing bothers me when it's the result of agonising circumstances. In a lot of cases recently, one lane feeds, another flames them and then it all just spirals out of control from there.\nOnce it starts there is little you can do, sure you can say \"Hey, just focus on the match\" or something similar that isn't antagonising but you can't control people nor the shit they spout. The losses incurred over the last week of playing wouldn't be nearly as misery inducing if they had mostly been even matches....sadly that's rarely the case :P\n\nPeople are just addicted to being assholes I guess...","replies":[{"poster":"Meta Phyton","date":"2017-01-10T23:25:29.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok sorry, I was upset myself probably.\n\nPersonally I think it was a mistake to grant all kinds of \"rewards\" in LoL, like boxes, key fragments, grades, first tower gold, and stuff like that.
