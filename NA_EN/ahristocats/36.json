On the plus side, it does more damage on hit and heals more on hit but... the attack speed and active burst kind of gave it that nice niche spot though.\nWill have to test in game but it looks like a hybrid of new and past iterations of Bork, though boasting much better stats overall than previous iterations. \n\nThe real question now is... if it gets released like this, how much will it cost in game to purchase?","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-07T22:25:52.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, my fiora game needs this","replies":[]}]}
