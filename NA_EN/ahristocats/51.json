The \"reworks\" in consideration of classes were not made to fix broken things, but to enforce certain champion niches and uniqueness. \n\nLet us see what CertainlyT created or helped to create.\n\nDarius - A champion that was broken for long and had only 1 counterplay, Do not get close. His whole kit was oppressive, and even after rework it was oppressive, it was fixed only by properly nerfing his numbers.\n\nKalista - The biggest cancer of the league that has to have to be kept down in shit status because otherwise she is broken because of her kit.\n\nYasuo - Overloaded champion that while being a damage dealer has the BEST defensive utility in the game while also having insane mobility and damage. He had to be nerfed to shit tier not too long ago too,before getting buffed and becoming oppresive yet again, because of his overloaded kit.\n\nThresh - For the longest of times he was the BEST support in the game. He was the most popular and used support for a long time, why? Because his support kit offers too many tools. He is lacking only a good heal. Again, another overloaded champion.\n\nMordekaiser rework - He was the one who decided that mordekaiser should be a bot laner, we all know how that turned out. It turned out shit. Again, Morde was having an unfair kit by getting unfair exp boosts that allowed him to snowball, not because of skill, but because of an unfair ability. This had to be fixed and thankfully was fixed by other people.\n\n\nThe only balanced and non-overloaded champ that CertainlyT has created, is zyra, and she was one of the first ones. His kits and their overloading got worse and worse with every champion. He creates kits and champions that are fun to play, but hell to play against.\n\nSuch champions as Azir, Tahm, Bard, Illaoi, Kled, show that you can have unique and fun champions without giving them broken kits.\n\nCertianlyT is a good designer in consideration of creativity, but he is complete crap in consideration of game balance and counterplay.
