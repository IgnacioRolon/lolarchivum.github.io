Because Riot also makes a point of making ADC's one of the most team dependent roles. \n\nYet when we have itemization that allows us to build a \"Protect the carry\" comp, it's suddenly the cancerous thing ever. And I also find it Ironic, that a Tank choosing a more supportive and less greedy item, some how means Tank itemization sucks. And honestly, Tank itemization should mean more than raw stats. Having the best defenses in the world doesn't help the team if they arern't focusing you. \n\nAlso in my experience. Diver/skirmishers, really aren't meant to teamfight to begin with. If you picked the likes of Jax or Irelia in the Top lane, My expectation is that you were going for a split push strat, because you needed 2 or more people to stop you. And if your Jungle, your main speciality would be skirmishes and small catches, not large teamfights.\n\nNow if we had that problem playing Sion/Galio/Shen top lane, that might be a different story entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackstone01","date":"2017-06-22T18:05:09.188+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"ADCs shouldn't be getting their own protect the carry items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salson","date":"2017-06-22T18:02:03.144+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing inherently wrong with \"Protect the carry\" comp.\n\nBut currently there is nothing that breaks it.\nIf a comp counters some comps, but doesn't get countered by others it's too strong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-06-22T15:50:06.755+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"Tanks were killing marksmen in a time span of 5 seconds and taking very little damage under it though, i know i played Seju at the time just because of it.

Bruisers generally have tank busting abilities In their kits to shred armour or deal % health that really hurts tanks. They can do this because they are melee and have to get up in your face to do this damage. \n\nIf riot can get this right and finally decide to stop buffing adcs for a job they weren't meant to do then tanks feel they can do their jobs again too, and we won't have this terrible balance between adcs and tanks. (That's not meant to happen anyway) \n\nAnd that's not to say that adcs should do no damage to tanks, but that's what they have last whisper and Bork for.

Plus she has her stun and likely has a support peeling for her on TOP of her own massive utility. Remember that supports often take exhaust to deal with divers, and also that they will be peeling for their adc almost exclusively, so her utility becomes even more valuable as after the support has peeled off the enemy they cant escape because of the consistent slows.\n\nAnd you say more tha 10 seonds, but with the damage progress of the gam right now, that time is unrelaistic, its more along the lines of 7 seconds at maximum with 4 items. At 3 items it may be 10 seconds, but that is the defensive item spike and adcs SHOULD be taking the most time to kill tanks at this point. If they arent then they are op.\n\nSo as far as im concerned ashe should do significantly less damage than other adcs because of how rediculous her utility actually is when played right, which isnt true enough right now.\n\nNow when it comes to bruisers, saying shyv, who both has innate % hp damage, and an auto reset that attacks twice both of which apply onhits doesnt deal damage to tanks is just wrong. Vi does fight tanks quite often , and in fact its the whole reaso her w exists at all. Armour shred and % hp damage on squishies means almost nothing. Irelia is a strange champion at least where her true damage doesnt scale at all, but is realistically better at damaging tanks because its true damage. There are also other bruisers who are meant to deal with tanks like gp, mundo, trundle, olaf and many more.

It's the only reason besides her ulti that she is good. \n\nA really, really strong steroid. \n\n\nAnd no i am not wrong to say shyv can barely hurt tanks, its the same idea as corki, no penetration means no damage.  I know for i mained her for a rather long time.\n\nThe only way to succeed was to dive in and kill carries, because shyv isn't tanky enough to soak damage even with a tank build but if she grabs penetration then she dies all too fast.\n\nThus you go for those without resistance, the carries. \n\nAnd while Vi does have a good kit for dealing with tanks, has she ever been played for it?\nNot really i think, she is played when she can ulti in and delete carries with it.\n\nAnd Irelia's true damage is easily countered by health,  she drops like a rock in terms of effectiveness, hers was the original type of true damage as far as i know.\n\nGP is just a lategame hypercarry and is not a bruiser, he is unique and can kill anything fairly easy if he plays it right.\n\nTrundle is right, olaf......usually ignores tanks as far as i know?

Therefore irelia, Olaf and gp all have tank countering abilities. \n\nMundo has % hp damage poke which is never bad against tanks, and between shyv and vi both having insane potential damage against tanks I really don't understand what you mean.

They should just die due to their general safety when fighting literally every other class. A bruiser should take some time to kill an adc because they tend to have more powerful cc and overall utility. \n\n-----\n\nThe point is the job of the adc is to stay safe and damage whatever is closest.
