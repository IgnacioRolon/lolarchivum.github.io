Just because Riot hasn't specifically responded to your needs doesn't mean all top tier players feel that way.\n\nI agree it would be great to see some of those champions in top tier play. But top tier players in ALL games tend to pick like this: What is OP in this meta, what works with this comp/enemy, what has lots of options and can play around others, what do I have skill in.\n\nExtremely linear champions like Mundo and Fid will never be commonly viable in top tier play without being buffed to absurdity. Because even of Mundo had 25%-50% better stats than say... Fiora. Fiora still has actual tools. Mundo has one major tool to let him outplay enemies. That is super linear, and gets boring after a few games. It doesn't grant tools to express you are a superior player like, you know, Jhin. \n\nAlso a lot of top tier players are SUUUUUPER bias for their role or champion. Why wouldn't they be?

It's a way of playing the game, according to the collective community experience. Which means that certain roles/champions are considered to have greater chances of victory at that time, therefore seeing more play.\nNaturally, champions that meta champions somewhat counter are out of it, for a time.\nFollowing the meta isn't something that should be considered as bad. It's a great way of experiencing the game and learning how any why something works, at any given time. But it becomes bad when players simply play according to it, completely refusing to believe that other champions (that are out of the meta) even exist or won't accept them as legit picks, when they finally are about to be played.\n\nDarius bot is definitely out of the meta. But it may work. Mainly because he's just a champion that can take a lot of abuse and has sustain + absurd damage when he gets a fight right. However, you can't blame your team for not trusting you with that pick.\nEven if you're a Master player, you're playing with other Master players. They don't have, or are required, to trust you with such an unusual pick but one thing is for certain: they do not have the right to take away the role you were assigned to, if this is your choice for a champion.\n\nWhich means if they disagree with this decision, they can either play it out and report you if you're trolling them for a specific reason or queue dodge. On the flip side, if they are taking your role because they don't want to let you, you have a valid reason to report them, if you didn't agree to this switch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-02-04T23:27:14.594+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your opinion matters no more or less than anybody else's.\nYou rank is a badge, but it is a badge that comes with absolutely 0 authority.\nThat badge also isn't a demotion, and it shouldn't be some kind of scarlet letter either.\n\nThats being said, I appreciate that in the multitude of debates / arguments / discussions i have had with you in my times on the boards, you never pulled rank as an excuse / disqualifier (at least not that I remember) and that is a +1 in my book.\n\nGrats on the promotion!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DecimÃºs","date":"2017-02-05T17:13:40.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-02-04T18:58:24.045+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're a master in my eyes","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-02-04T19:00:43.454+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I'm _Bronze_.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2017-02-04T19:23:00.254+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"A **_Bronze Master_**","replies":[{"poster":"SchÃ denfreude","date":"2017-02-04T20:21:44.833+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that a roast or compliment?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-02-04T17:59:02.470+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Con-Fucking-Grats on Masters anyway dude!","replies":[]},{"poster":"RexSaur","date":"2017-02-04T23:46:22.578+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will agree that supports get better the higher you go and top lane gets worse.\n\nYou can go 20-0 as a top carry like riven and a 0-10 support can still point and click exhaust you the moment you try to do anything in a team fight and remove you from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-04T23:50:36.473+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RexSaur,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=woyzlNOE,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2017-02-04T23:46:22.578+0000)\n>\n> \n> \n>0-10 support can still point and click exhaust you the moment you try to do anything in a team fight and remove you from the game.\n\nmade me laugh so hard cause it happened to me today","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-04T18:06:55.631+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats on the promotion.\n\nIs the rest of yout post intended ti show us Silvers that Masters isn't all it's cracked up to be?","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-04T18:23:11.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TyrekGoldenspear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=woyzlNOE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-02-04T18:06:55.631+0000)\n>\n> \n> \n> Is the rest of yout post intended ti show us Silvers that Masters isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be?\n\nlike i said.... the more you climb the more the game is locked, i'm just warning people, \ndo you want balance in plat+ and enjoy the game? then don't expect to have fun while climbing except if you don't care about diversity and you're just an otp, but even then your otp can be nerfed for plat+ while you're climbing in high diamond\n\ndo you want the game to be balanced in master tier+? then you will have the joy of climbing and having a competitive game\nexcept that those who don't think they have to improve to win against some champions like darius will complain and leave the game\n\noverall, the first option is better for riot i'm just(and high elo players) a collateral damage of it","replies":[{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2017-02-05T00:05:30.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill just stick to norms :/ this game aint gunna last till starwars is reality....","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2017-02-05T06:15:25.865+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry DJSR, but Riot's \"focus on the high ELOs and Pro play' have ruined this game.

Because you are at a high enough level where almost all the players are at the top skill and decision making wise, the only variance besides specific in game mess ups is champion selection, so players obviously will contest and selectively pick champions with the highest chance of an advantage. \n\nThe main way to rise above meta dominance is to simply be marginally better than your opponent despite champion picks. This is why pro players are able to stream non meta picks in challenger, because they train much harder and have much better decision making than challenger players, which out weighs the small champion balance advantages of the other team's meta picks.\n\nGames are decided so early because at the highest level of play players don't make plays, they punish them and lock in that advantage. Early game is too decisive because once there is an advantage, it takes a mess up from the winning team to be able to come back, which rarely happens in top ELO. This paired with safety of meta picks and already present snowball supplying mechanics (objective control, wave push changes, vision dominance) makes the early game the breeding ground of the winner, and why jungle has been a touchy subject especially this season.\n\nI wish I could suggest a gamefixing change that would solve all this, but higher ELO has been like this for a while if you pay attention to analysts like LS and being someone in Platinum doesn't give me any credentials to know what it really is like playing at challenger level (aside from stray challenger players appearing in my normals). \n\nPersonally I think a lot of the issues are rooted in vision right now. You can argue champion balance all you want, but it will always be screwy because of how many variables are at play. Vision, however, is a simple mechanic available to everyone that can be capitalized in so many ways (preventing ganks, securing plays, gathering gold information, determining enemy jungle paths, etc). I'd like to see vision become more dynamic while maintaining all of its functions, so that you can utilize it more to press meaningful advantages instead of just getting dominated in a lane because of rules you can't control.

You can pick Renekton with ignite and i can pick Soraka with flash cleance and stomp you in lane does that make her broken and that she should be nerfed? no just because people cant play the game properly doesnt mean it should be balanced around their uselessness to compansate altho the game is popular and only 2% is actually high elo so yeh they will only lose customers so it will never happen. But bad people are just a money source for me anyway so keep it going till the game dies i guess right?
