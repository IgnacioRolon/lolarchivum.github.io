Right now 90% of Rylai abuser doesn't give a shit about Hp\n\nCongratz, you failed at brain logic.\n\n\nLots of DMG -> people (mages) die off fast\n\nLots of DMG -> Some way to bulk up for for example **400 HEALTH** , while not losing much of damage -> Mage survive\n\n\nThis whole \"Rylai rush\" is caused by players trying to survive retarded damage ADCs dish out.\nWant it gone?\n\n1. Reduce AP ratio AND price on Rylai (hard)\n2. Overall reduce damage ADCs do by 20%\n3. Promote OTHER items for mages they could use instead of Rylais.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-10-07T14:27:22.672+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one is rushing Rylais to defend against ADC, your logic makes no sense.\n\nThese Rylais abusers gives 0 fuck about hp, they are mid long range burst/dps mages who kites the living dhit out of you with perma slow from rylais and short cd dmg abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-10-07T15:09:37.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> they are mid long range burst/dps mages\n\nWho happen to be also squishy AF.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-10-07T15:33:45.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can easily kill an adc before the adc kills them in early mid stage of the game, they don't rush rylais for the hp.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-10-07T16:10:18.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"sigh..\n\nLook, if Rylai was bought only cause of slow & AP, then it'd have been spammed since season 0.\nBut for some **WEIRD** reason it begun being (ab)used second after Riot overbuffed damage.\n\nMages don;t build tank-items.
