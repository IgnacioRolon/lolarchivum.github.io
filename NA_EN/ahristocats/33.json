It isn't really that shocking either because jungler has probably been the most influential spot in the game since it was released and mid has always been the most popular lane as well.\n\nNow if I had to try to put into words what is really going on is that top lane play has had THE most changes in playstyle over the last few years despite every other lane getting the immediate focus of Riot.\n\nWhat used to be the joke everyone would say about toplane in soloq and in to pro scene? \"And here the top laners are at the 20 minute mark still on their island\" That is gone from the game. Top lane used to be THE 1v1 lane. If you were winning it you got to pull attention up to your lane. You made sure that the other team had to drop what they were doing and come stop you and sometimes... you still beat them when they showed up. That is pretty much gone now.\n\nThere are some advantages to this. Top laners now have more direct impact on the game early on and don't have to rely as much on their team to not just lose before they get to push their advantage to a win. That doesn't mean the lane doesn't play out different now though.\n\nNow if you want to win through top you have to do stuff that your champion was never designed to do. It isn't good enough to be able to win small skirmishes you have to teamfight and bruisers just aren't good in teamfights unless they are super far ahead and rolling over everything in their path.\n\nThat is why I think there are so many angry toplaners now. Riot took a playstyle that they liked and pulled it out from underneath them and now are saying \"You can still win.
