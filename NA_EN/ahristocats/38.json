I also had a high elo vladimir main telling me that vladimir was killed by riot but balance wise he&#039;s fine at the moment\nVladimir has 47% win rate midlane, and 48% win rate toplane and it&#039;s GOOD for vlad. Going MR penetration quints+red, then building AP makes him a monster. IMO {{item:3065}}  shouldn&#039;t be built anymore, vladimir can&#039;t afford to build pure tank items, Once you build AP+CDR on him you will see a very noticeable difference\n\nbut This thread is not only about how he is right now, but also about what should happen to make him perfect\nFirst as an other vladimir main told me, he has some annoying bugs going on. I didn&#039;t realise it but his W makes him unable to do anything for a few time while his enemies can hit him and destroy him during this time. (maybe it&#039;s intended=?)\n\nVladimir is a hypercarry. His damages in late game stand with marksmen and other late game champions, while in early game he is the trashest champion in the game. No other early game can compete with that\nHis damage is not only low, but he is slow and squishy his healing has been nerfed a lot against minions his E cd is now 13 sec at rank 1. His only way to survive is his W which has 28 sec cd and costs 20% of his HP, and {{summoner:3}} which is going to be nerfed soon\n\nThing with vladimir is that he needs to have this early game to be balanced, but this makes him quite frustrating to play because allies expect you to be strong in early game for no reasons and it leads them to not play safe against midlane roaming, start fights before you get items and levels ect..\nBut it&#039;s also frustrating because vladimir becomes unplayable against some toplaner/midlaner, literally the majority  of them can kill vlad easily without vlad to be able to do anything\n\n**how can this be fixed?**\nMaking vladimir able to go botlane {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nSeriously no one thought about this? Vladimir is like a marksmen in disguise. he is ranged, He has a very strong DPS that can match their DPS, he can&#039;t lane alone he just can&#039;t, Imagine {{champion:222}} laning against {{champion:58}}  ? it&#039;s exactly the same with vlad \nBut why can&#039;t vladimir go botlane? he&#039;s too much XP reliant\nUnlike marksmen. **he can&#039;t do anything before both his Q and his E are at rank 5** and it&#039;s because of his high cooldown on E before investing a lot of points in it\n&quot;but rubick, you want to give him an xp passive?&quot; no, i just want him to instead waiting 13 lvls+1 major items +boots , wait like 8 or 9 lvls+2 major items +boots\n\nHow? make him maxing E instead of Q first\n\nmake Q cd 3 seconds at all ranks\nreduce Q damage+heal from rank 1 to 4\n\nThus vladimir can lane in peace with a support without fearing to lack of lvls\nI don&#039;t understand why {{champion:82}} was turned to botlane, {{champion:8}} makes much more sense and way easier to do instead of giving him xp passive+drake passive+so much power into spells\n\nbut that&#039;s just my 4cents","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-03-03T18:52:01.108+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Oh boy, let's make another {{champion:82}} problem {{champion:157}} champion by trying to force interject them into bot lane for no reason.\n\nSorry, but I love Vlad, I have no interest in playing him bot lane.
