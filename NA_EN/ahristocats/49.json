His CC allows them to punish enemies who get caught by it quite harshly. His Unbreakable ability is basically a mobile Windwall. His E allows him to jump to Yasuo with his own mobility and provides him some good resistances. And Braum's ultimate is PERFECT for initializing Yasuo's ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-02T12:23:16.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tHanks actually, next time i see adc yasuo i'll pick braum","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-02T12:45:33.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imaqtpie climbed from diamond to challenger exclusively playing yasuo adc only... then a few months later GP.\n\nEven though he's a good player, it also lets you know the potential is there if someone put in enough practice.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-02T13:09:18.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"imaqtipie played yasuo? lol ok didn't know this","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2017-01-02T17:56:00.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is what he was designed for, and it has been many times the highest winrate role for him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rioyter","date":"2017-01-02T16:50:13.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try some Jayce/Vi (Adc/Supp) !

Great peel, more available knock up from Q, and I believe W still counts as a knock up, stun off of his new E, heals from his passive. \n\nThe biggest reason why I would still say that Braum is better is because he works better WITH Yasuo on engage and disengage, and it is harder to actually mess up. I have seen too many Alistar's fail their Headbutt + Pulverize combos and ruin an engage completely, or actually give the enemy a free escape. \n\nBraum just pegs someone with his Q and says, \"Go get that one! I'll be right behind you.\" \n\nAnd again, the ultimate synergy is orgasmic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yoshi2790","date":"2017-01-02T12:20:25.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}} +{{champion:157}} = **DESTRUCTION**\n\nSeriously, this is pure ragequit material, I faced it in flex queue and I just got towerdived on and on, support got mad and just left to roam.\nI'd pick this anytime, if you're comfortable with the champions and have a buddy, except for facing {{champion:81}}","replies":[]}]}
