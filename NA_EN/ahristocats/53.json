And now Ryze or Azir are the strongest midlaners for ppl that are not apes and know how to use them, due to it you can see which winrates their mains reach and we should not give a fk about the guy that is learning how to play Azir loses a lot of games while he's learning because that's what high skill floors champs means.\n\nLet me say it clear AZIR with 46% winrate is STRONGER than Janna at 54% winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2018-04-19T16:46:00.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL at your last statement.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-04-19T19:12:14.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give up, they see a champ with low winrate and without looking at the winrates that Azir players have they think he's weak.\n\n I thought the biggest crybabies on the Boards were the bruisers/juggernauts mains but it ended up being the mage mains by far, I was wrong there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-04-19T16:39:30.734+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I am more than willing to accept arguments if they at least do the following:\n\nA real attempt at a conversation\nLined with rational thought\nMake compelling arguments\n\nYou OP are using derogatory language to try and make your argument sound strong, \"the retardness of a class does not exclude the retardness of an other\", what does that even mean?\n\nYou also didn't do your research and see why people are against the nerf. \n\nMages right now are not performing any more differently then they have been for over a year, it's bot lane that has not only change but has had a major impact on the meta in doing so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akaviri","date":"2018-04-19T14:56:13.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How do you think this change will go?\n\nI'm of the opinion that it's a good idea to try and nerf the midlane strategy of endlessly waveclearing to essentially force an even lane while accelerating game pace with no-risk roaming.

In fact, now AD items are almost as strong as AP items which is sad.\n\nThis infinite mana problem that Riot and others are complaining about really started when Archangel went to 1400 max mana. Honestly they should just remove the 400 mana off of Archangel that they added, and maybe give it back 15-20 AP...then don't bother with this stupid base mana/level nerf. \n\nBecause it's sad if this mana gutting goes through because then everyone would have more mana than Mages do at level 18...Even ADCs and tanks would have around 200-300 more mana than the average mage would...\n\nOR better yet, they could just give a small nerf to the mages who are the worst offenders and not gutt an entire class for a select few.
