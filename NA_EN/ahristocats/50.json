Time bomb champions go 1 of three ways, you either:\n\nA) Kick the \"timebomb\" in before they can become useful. You play Riven, and Riven into Nasus is crippling for Nasus because he's so easily bullied by her. Even if he ignores to farm, the current lethality meta allows for Riven to snowball and start ignoring the defenses he builds to survive lane.\n\nB) Kick the \"timebomb's\" team in before they can actually help the timebomb get where they need to go. If the player doesn't have a team, like Veigar, he'll usually end up dying to a random assassin appearing from nowhere and taking a fat chunk of his HP away, and most likely will die in the process of peeling off the assassin to the assassin's team.\n\nC) You for some reason let the \"timebomb\" survive and continue to do what it needs, and it becomes an absolute monster because you LET it happen. All scaling champions, ADCs, Tanks, Mages, can be halted, the same is no different for timebombers. Shyvana is a prime example of this, because although she can be denied her free dragon stats, she's always going to have her monstrosity of a build path that lategame because not only annoying but frightening to deal with.\n\nI'm not just saying this because I enjoy Nasus, because I do enjoy him, but he has REALLY big flaws in his kit that are downright laughable compared creatures like {{champion:67}} {{champion:18}} and {{champion:96}} . Those champions should be considered less timebombs and more or less problematic champion kits, or as I can them, volatile champions, that simply will achieve their presence by existing eventually, not because they worked for it, but simply because their kit and item path allows it to happen regardless of the skill of the player. I've seen first time vaynes pull off quadras in lategame even when the opponent team made good plays because our support was good enough to peel for her even just a little and she melted the opponent team. \n\nSaying you're not a fan of timebombs is a wide statement because you have to be specific in how you address them. {{champion:75}} , {{champion:14}} , {{champion:45}} , {{champion:412}} these are all timebomb champions, because they need to fully achieve the activation (farm/scale), fuse (items and matchups), and detonation/placement (being able to enter fights and not be mowed down before they are considered problematic). {{champion:102}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:96}} should be considered volatile champions because it only takes one condition of them to be met before they become a monster, because their kits give them that power naturally to pop off at a moment's notice.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-07-23T22:30:46.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"tanks are forcing almost every jungler out of the meta tho \nand basically every meta support is a tank {{champion:412}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-07-23T22:34:20.269+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"are we talking about pro or solo queue?\nbecause in soloq highest win rate supports are sona soraka janna, with a high play rate\nthresh and braum are definitly strong in pro\n\nbeside rakan isn't a tank, and {{champion:117}} is still banned a lot in soloq+has a high pick rate,\nnami is good and is being buffed, so expect her to become broken\n\ntanks are forcing junglers out, which is why cinderhulk is being nerfed\nvow is also being nerfed, so this will hit tank supports","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2017-07-23T23:10:10.689+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought pros were in 7.14?
