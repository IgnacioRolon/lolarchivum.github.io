It's a high elo legend.\n\nDr. Sona X Rubick was a Darius ADC player. He was so powerful and so wise that he could use his favorite champion and influence the kappaclorians to create... a new meta.\n\nHe had such a knowledge of bullying laners that he could even keep the ones he cared about, from losing. The dark side of the meta is a pathway to many winrates that some would consider unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his lane, which eventually, of course, he did.\n\nUnfortunately, he taught a Lulu main everything he knew, then his apprentice bullied him out of lane in her sleep. Ironic, he could save others from losing, but not himself.","replies":[{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2017-05-10T15:30:52.329+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it possible to learn this power?","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-05-10T16:25:13.577+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"unfortunatly we can't know the answer now he's gone","replies":[]},{"poster":"Incursio1204","date":"2017-05-10T17:15:35.787+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not from a jedi.","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2017-05-10T23:32:45.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's treason then.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-05-10T18:21:36.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, Deja vu.","replies":[{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2017-05-11T20:00:40.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'VE JUST BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"OceanicEyes","date":"2017-05-10T07:57:19.232+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And gH God if I recall correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-05-10T16:42:47.246+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"He changes names almost as often as he changes mains.
