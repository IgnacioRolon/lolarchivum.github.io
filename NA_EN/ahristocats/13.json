I've got about 3k Rumble games on my back, but even I am currently struggling winning games with him. {{champion:68}} \n\nWhat I would like to see:\n\n- Give him back initial damage on his ult (many times you don't even get an assist, even though you landed your ult directly onto the enemy). With the many dashes we have nowadays, other champs can easily dash out of your ult, so a little bit of initial damage is needed.\n- Reduce Q CD at early levels. I really liked playing Rumble jungle, but since the Q cd at lvl 1 was nerfed from 6 to 10 seconds, it was almost impossible to clear your jungle fast enough to compete with other champs.\n- Increase his shield duration back to 2 seconds. Rumble isn't tanky at all, compared to other bruisers. He needs some survivability and his shield is his only option. I think it's only fair to increase the duration or atleast buff the numbers a little bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Axantucar","date":"2018-03-03T03:49:51.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was a dedicated Rumble jungle main before 7.12.

That's obviously too high.\n\nHowever; it also makes _no sense_ that a literal impact of explosive rockets deals 0 damage on impact. Especially with mobility creep. In it's current state; there's a real argument to not even take The Equalizer at 6 in some situations [Mobile enemy laner so it does nothing; and you're TP is down so you're not going to be fighting? Might as well take another Q for reduced c/d and more damage.]\n\nAlso; having no impact damage reduces Rumble's skillcap; not increase it. As Rumble's R currently stands; it's solely a zone control tool. When it did impact damage you had to balance the Zone Control and DoT with the impact damage. That sounds like a HIGHER skillcap to me; since you have to balance both uses and try to land the ultimate in a way that makes use of both.\n\nThe Equalizer could easily do an extra immediate tick of damage to any champions caught in the rockets explosions. Or even half a regular tick. So it could apply a ministun [0.5 sec] because; you know _you're caught in an explosion_.\n\nHowever; I'd still rather make Rumble's W an actual ability if one were to buff Rumble. As it stands it's an ability you _might_ take at Lv 4 and it might be useful then, but you're certainly not touching it after Lv 4, and mobility creep also makes it pretty useless pretty quickly at Rank 1. There's even a case for skipping W entirely for a 2nd point in E to aid lasthitting and harass [Which; since Swain's rework; Rumble is probobly the hardest champion to lasthit wit with the exception of maybe pre-6 Anivia.] Especially since spamming W can also overheat you quickly and mean you get less damage abilities out. It's pretty bad when a champion has an ability where it's a serious consideration to not put points into it until you are forced.

Hopefully 8.6. Not sure what the direction the buffs will be. Waiting for the investigation to get going.\n\nHave you guys ever thought of adding a better reward incentive for experienced Rumble players for fully utilizing the heat bar's potential?\nI'm talking about not simply \"increasing abilities' numbers by 50% upon reaching 50 heat\" but more utility for a champion that's really all about damage and slows. A battlemage champion with extremely little mobility and very squishy base stats for a melee champion. This leaves him very vulnerable in games in general(moreso when behind) with the little utility he has other than his slows and minuscule shield.\n\nHis kit is simply screaming huge potential among the sea of new champions that get various ways of overcoming some of their weaknesses if the player is skilled and experienced enough. However Rumble is starting to show his age with his outdated kit and very little room for outplay potential when this heat management we got going on doesn't seem to do much aside from just telling us to \"do more damage\". For a considerable 'complex' champion, I can't help but think he seems kinda close to being binary even though he's obviously not which is why I think he has so much more potential and deserves to get his passive buffed more than anything.\n\nAs for what OP mentioned about his Ultimate's cast time? I don't think that's a problem at all and will barely change a thing. If anything that's just a band-aid fix more than anything.\n\nThe last time you guys nerfed Rumble's Ultimate was when you made his Ultimate cooldown higher. I thought this was great personally, as a Rumble main. Why? Because I was hoping it would make you guys at Riot realize he's nothing but an Ult-bot past a certain point in the game and would consider getting a closer look at the rest of his kit that seems flawed.\nHe has the ratios to be an AP Carry and yet he's extremely limited by his range and his vulnerability to cc and with the cc-chain fests and everyone carrying extreme mobility these days, he's really falling out of any meta other than just being an Ult-bot for his team and let everyone else do everything else.\n\nI'm not asking Rumble to be some assassin or anything like that but give us more incentive to reach 50 heat because overheating right now happens way too quickly with very little reward for having abilities in dangerzone prior to overheating.\n\nI've wrote a lot of ideas here on the forums before but most of the time they've been ignored and downvoted(presumably from people that don't play him and dislike him).\nI really hope you'll look at his dangerzone mechanic's potential increasing his skill ceiling and ability to carry more and harder.\nAt this point I don't even care about any skins anymore. I just want my buddy Rumble to get a change that will reflect on my skill level to make outplays rather than my opponent's abilities to pick a champion that has every sort of utility and outplay potential while doing ridiculous amounts of damage while they are of a similar skill level as myself and stomping with less effort.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Rumblemains/comments/47i5ol/would_hp_damage_on_rumble_be_what_could_finally/\nThese are old ideas I posted before and while I have newer and better suggestions nowadays since then, I still hope this can kinda give you guys at Riot an idea of what to do with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaStapo","date":"2018-03-02T16:17:35.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5vEOhjW1,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-03-01T19:30:34.040+0000)\n>\n> Actually yes.

And given how awful Rumble is at CS'ing, a lane simply being a farmlane is a loss for Rumble. You WILL come out lower on CS if you cannot drive your enemy away.\n\nChampions such as Nasus are melee matchups that Rumble cannot win at all. Seriously; pick Nasus with Second Wind mastery against Rumble; rush a Cowl and just watch him cry as he throws healing fire at you and if he dares get close gets smacked by your cane. The only way Rumble beats ANY melee matchup where the melee has sustain is if the melee dosen't know the matchup and how to wreck Rumble; which is fairly common given how uncommon a pick Rumble is.\n\nNot to mention his lack of mobility and the fact his harass pushes the wave makes him gank bait.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Melon Nub","date":"2018-03-02T07:11:47.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a viktor/rumble main I hope you take more of the player concepts here than you did when you did this for viktor, both champions really only need quality of life buffs","replies":[{"poster":"Melon Nub","date":"2018-03-02T07:16:41.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me it feels like shielding a healing supports completely negate his ult, I think it needs something besides damage or maybe more damage, if I am play a champion that is almost fully based round his r it should feel impactful to hit a good R.
