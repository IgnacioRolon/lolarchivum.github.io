Champions like Zed and Yasuo exist who are incredibly safe and can get both in and out of fights easily while still killing somebody. But nobody what happens to Shaco, people still hate him just because he can go invisible. A skill which he can use to either get into a fight, or get out of a fight, but never both. Once he makes his choice, he's pretty well committed. But everybody talks about how much they hate Shaco, and not about all the other toxic champions that do everything better and more safely.
