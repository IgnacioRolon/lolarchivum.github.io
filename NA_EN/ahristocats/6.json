For right now, let us assume that one statement, \"Jhin's power is tied to lethality\" is true. I will demonstrate why this is at the end, but for starters we need to make the argument.\n\nNow, if we can assume that Jhin becomes stronger as lethality becomes stronger, and we can assume that Jhin becomes weaker as lethality becomes weaker, then we can also see an important point: if we simply buff Jhin's kit directly while lethality is weak, then Jhin may become playable, but if lethality is ever improved for another reason, Jhin becomes too strong. \n\nFor example, if Jhin is performing at 46% right now while building lethality, and we buff Jhin's kit so that he's performing at 50% while building lethality, that might be good for Jhin players. However, that would mean that if we buff lethality itself later because Talon or Zed is underperforming, then Jhin's win rate will increase above 50% while building lethality. That makes sense, right?\n\nWith that said, if Jhin is too weak and lethality items also look a bit weak, it makes more sense to simply buff the items knowing that that will buff Jhin because he primarily builds those items, rather than just buffing Jhin.\n\nNow for the second part. Why is Jhin's kit so directly tied with lethality, when Jhin has more critical strike components than anyone else in the game. There are a number of reasons for this, but the most important reason is that Jhin's passive, Death in Four Acts, has an execute on it. This execute is likely intended to help Jhin farm effectively with only four autos per reload, and also serves as an interesting harass pattern. \n\nIf Jhin attacks someone while he has 300 AD, that AD does not directly improve his % missing health damage component. It does help him get their health lower for the fourth hit, but the fourth hit itself will deal only 300 + 25% of the target's missing health. 25% is an extreme amount, by the way. Many assassins only get 8% of a target's missing health, Jhin has triple that and it costs no mana and has no cooldown.\n\nHowever, if Jhin attacks someone while he has lethality, that DOES increase the % missing health component, because it reduces the target's ability to resist the damage, making it closer to true damage. That's the reason why Jhin builds lethality and sees success with it. His % missing health damage in A Death in Four Acts is likely the largest amount of damage in his entire kit, and it has no AD ratio, cannot crit, and does not benefit from attack speed. So you build lethality. That's all there is to it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Martensitic","date":"2017-05-16T19:21:50.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"Because other than any other ADC in the game, Jhin does not profit from Attack Speed in any relevant way (Even Graves at least gets his reload timers shortened), sooooo, Genius Riot had another plan :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-05-16T19:25:33.797+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Martensitic,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FwzXcTnI,comment-id=00010004,timestamp=2017-05-16T19:21:50.050+0000)\n>\n> Because other than any other ADC in the game, Jhin does not profit from Attack Speed in any relevant way (Even Graves at least gets his reload timers shortened), sooooo, Genius Riot had another plan :-)\n\nHE GETS AD FROM ATTACK SPEED AND A MOVEMENT SPEED INCREASE WHENEVER HE CRITS BASED ON HIS AS. \n\nHOW IS THAT NOT RELEVANT?!","replies":[{"poster":"GGLineaR","date":"2017-05-16T21:36:37.476+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do me a favour and hit your caps lock one more time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-05-16T22:06:57.584+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"no.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2017-05-16T21:07:59.530+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sanji fanboy,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FwzXcTnI,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-05-16T19:00:04.441+0000)\n>\n> wait what?\n> LOL\n> \n> &quot;jhin is weak we might buff lethality&quot;\n> \n> WHY THE FUCK IS JHIN BALANCED AROUND LETHALITY????\n\nEXACTLY! jhin was intended to be a crit based ADC who scales very hard off of crit items because of the fact that he doesnt gain aspd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joxcab","date":"2017-05-16T19:05:44.607+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't get it either.\nJhin is just fine with crit.\n\nThe only issue I could honestly see is crit ADCs do better than him thanks to not being locked by attack speed.\nJhin can lifesteal back in bigger bursts, but crit ADCs do a hefty bit of damage too (around 2 autos deals the same damage as one of his), and they can attack a lot faster meaning they can _effectively_ lifesteal a lot faster.
