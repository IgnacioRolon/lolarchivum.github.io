But that thing about the same color souls I've had to deal with plenty of times. Half the time I think their thresh is stealing my souls.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BA Tetsuo","date":"2015-01-14T07:40:13.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to have the attack animation glitch all the time, back when I first picked up thresh from the store.
