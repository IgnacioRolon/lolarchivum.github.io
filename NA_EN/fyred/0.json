Are able able to swap your keyboard to see rule out possibilities of hardware issues with it?  Let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Fyred","date":"2017-01-04T22:30:28.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am not able to swap it out. or at least i'd have to learn how to swap out a laptop keyboard. All i know is that it is Leauge that causes the issue, or it will only happen once i have opened Leauge. i have updated my drivers, but it still happens. and i have to power cycle and try to get back in fast.  i still normally get reported. its not like every game. sometimes, it happens immediate, sometimes i can play all day before it happens. but if i dont open Leauge it never happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Fyred","date":"2017-01-17T17:23:17.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also i went back to the old client, and the issue seems to have stopped.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
