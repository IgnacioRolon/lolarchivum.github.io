First of all thanks in advance to the league of legends community, Rioters included, for all the awesome work!\r\n\r\nSo my issue here is that I bought a **TV Screen** to use it as a monitor for my desktop PC, since the previous monitor died a horrible death (cats{{champion:103}} ). However whenever I start a league of legends match, the game crashes just after the client dissappears and it tries to load up the game!!! I think this might be a resolution incompatibility, but all other resolutions than the default one mess up the image ratio horribly. **The default resolution is 1360x768** . Is this a compatibility issue? How can I play again?","replies":[{"poster":"Zerhathos","date":"2016-10-25T22:54:38.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, still not working, works with any other monitor through monitor cable but I havent been able to test with a tv and hdmi cable...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T23:03:37.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While your resolution may be a bit high, I don't think it would result in a crash.  The best way to rule out the possibility of your screen or cable would be to swap them for another and see if the same error occurs.  If so then you might be having some driver or other problem causing the game to crash.  I suggest going over each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to make sure your rig and game is tuned up and get you back in-game.  Let me know how that works out for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerhathos","date":"2016-10-23T08:27:05.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Went over each step of the game crash guide and still get the same crash. I however could test the game with my neighbours monitor and the game works, however it is a standard monitor cable, and not HDMI as I'm using with my TV.","replies":[]}]}]}
