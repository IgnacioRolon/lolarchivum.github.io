Then EVERYONE would hold it against the important guys when they contradict that opinion.\n\nAnd, Riot does occasionally reply to serious threads, but some of them, honestly, aren't worth touching. I am sure Rioters discuss a LOT of what happens on the boards internally, even though they may not post stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JC DarkOmen","date":"2015-01-29T18:57:04.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Downvote the haters!

Regardless if they are doing it to stop the Russians from reforming the USSR power house and wiping out the middle east's control, or in defense of their possible Ukrainian allies. Those of us in America can see that the oil industry is not healing due to the fact that items manufactured with oil products (such as plastics or rubber) still remain at a significantly high price. This shows that the raw oil is not being used in other economic sectors, displaying that the economy is indeed not deflating. If anything, the gas will rise back in prices if we don't start mining out our own oil.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rock Rockburgh","date":"2015-01-29T18:03:19.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obama doesn't have anything to do with it.
