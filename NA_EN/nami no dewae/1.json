But these are the ones I&#039;ve seen do really successful 85% of the time if played correctly- meaning they WILL win lane and get fed, even if the game ends in a loss. This is considering the enemy bot went a traditional adc/sup as well.\n\n{{champion:119}} +{{champion:89}}  is a guarantee kill lane. This duo is SCARY bc you can pick up ez early kills at lv 3 or even 2, giving draven a huge lead to snowball later on. Given the lane is not pushed towards enemy tower, Leo can land her E and Q, which starts the peel process. Then draven&#039;s E, Q follow up does major dmg and gives leo and drave extra time to aa some more. If there&#039;s a slight chase in this process draven can easily W. This can guarantee the enemy to flash/heal or die xD.  Enemy jg WILL (start to) camp a draven and leona lane. SO WARD UP. get draven fed and if the rest of the team does decent and not feed = gg. Leo bing an all in champ will most likely (almost) die in team fights for her initation but draven may get out alive, and or get kills. But I would just stick near the draven to protect him and not leave him at the back alone. But if he&#039;s already able to solo mid/top/jg in a 1v1, you can start helping others. \n\n{{champion:81}} + {{champion:111}} this bot lane is surprisingly good. Another kill lane. Naut and ez&#039;s Q both CANNOT bypass minions. But once Naut lands his Q on an enemy bot laner followed by his &quot;stunning&quot; aa, ez can successfully do a combo E-Q-W or what not. Naut should have his W up to allow his auto attacks to do even more damage for the kill as well. Add in his AOE slow and if the bot laner has no dash/jumps/escapes its a ez heal/flash burn or kill. \nEz and Naut&#039;s ult do very well together- Once naut&#039;s ult has triggered &amp;begins to knock up the target, ez will know exactly WHERE to land his ult for the kill. Personally this duo just does really really well from all my experiences, given each player knows the basics of playing their champ ez/naut. But I think if going against a LEO/Drave, this duo might lose early plays, just for the fact that leo can gap close through minions, and naut Cannot :( \n\nThe two kill lanes above have the potential to destroy sustain lanes for example a lane with {{champion:37}} or {{champion:16}}. Focus the sustainer b4 adc in fights. Rakas are F* annoying. but a smart raka will always be way back, ready to NOT get caught, which in this case, being a kill lane might be impossible. In a kill lane vs healer/sustain, attempt to kill the sustainer/healer while exhausting the adc. or just kill whoever is dumb enough to get caught out/be alone by themselves 4 a moment- sometimes a moment is just the right amount of time to kill them. Other than that kill lane adc and sup should use poke to zone csing.\n\n{{champion:40}} + {{champion:202}} is love. Movement speed for dayz while they&#039;re near each other. Jhin really doesn&#039;t have a gap closer or escape so Janna having great engage and disengage is the perfect sup for him. Get slowed of knocked up by Janna and Jin can easily land a stun. Janna&#039;s passive wiLL allow Jhin to easily escape or chase when needed. Janna&#039;s ultimate can be used for position when jhin is caught out, or push enemy back in to jhin Ult range.\n\nOkay, so I don&#039;t have time to write anymore, but what are some of your opinions and fav duo/matchups?\n\n\nO mommy I just had to add another one to our list!\n{{champion:202}}  + {{champion:111}} \nYOU CAN DO A DOUBLE STUN every 10 sec or so","replies":[{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2016-05-10T18:26:31.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch and Taric for the invisible stun","replies":[{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-05-10T19:15:56.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"abusive","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nami no Dewae","date":"2016-06-08T15:58:38.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GG LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2016-05-10T17:59:54.433+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:29}}  and {{champion:412}} \n\n{{champion:21}} and {{champion:89}} \n\n{{champion:236}}  and  {{champion:201}}  Probs one of the best lanes","replies":[{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2016-05-10T19:23:19.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana and jihn is really strong as well.

Leo is definitely one of the best engage and disengage tank. Even tho she has no escapes to save herself, her stuns will def peel for the team!

MF/Varus/Draven/etc all need engage kill-oriented support to get the scariest combo. Jinx Leo and Thresh also work. The absolute scariest that I love to utilize myself is Kalista Thresh. It is probably the scariest bot comp IMO. Long ago that title belonged to Varus or Jinx Leona. For comps like Leo Draven, if Leona misses E Draven will be focus fired and burn flash and Leo will apply Q late.\n\nIMO Morg Vayne isn't THAT good. It works though.
