It&#039;s good to receive complements back too sometimes!!! Am i the only one who feels supports are under appreciated esp at low elo... Peeling is something i pride myself in doing a lot. But like after the end of the game we win and the conversation with my adc kind of goes like this\r\nMe: you did rlly goood that game \r\nAdc: thnx\r\nMe: wbmeeeee, did i do a good job peeling the last few fights?\r\nAdc: u didnt do anything.
