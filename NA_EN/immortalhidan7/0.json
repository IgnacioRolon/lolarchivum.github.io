Yesterday, my game did that DirectX issue when playing in a group of 5 friends....fortunately a normal that time. I restarted my computer several times, and then turned of all program starts...and it worked. So I played some League and figured it was a Discord problem. Then today, hop on to play some games, start up a ranked game...but instead of loading into the game get that same DirectX problem. Tried a similar fix, to no avail. Plus, my league kept saying I was on an old version and it wanted to restart to update (and then do nothing), and still the game wouldn't load. So I went to look at the drivers...my card said I was up to date so I didn't know what was up.\n\nAs a last ditch effort I went to the driver download area on AMD's website. I find a download for a thing that automatically detects and installs the updates, and figured why not try it. I did and it said I was missing an update. Updated it (not the optional just the recommended) and restarted. Gave League a shot and it worked (in a custom game). Can't guarantee it will work (since I got it to work last time, and then it stopped the next day), but seems good so far. I'll update as I learn more.\n\nGot the AMD check thing here: http://support.amd.com/en-us/download\n\nSorry I can't guarantee it, but I hope it helps.\n\nEdit: I feel I should add, the site says it only works on Windows Computers.","replies":[{"poster":"Swordior","date":"2017-05-19T02:40:20.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was able to play a game today with no problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Swordior","date":"2017-05-20T16:03:41.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Today I got the DirectX error again, guess it didn't work.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T21:54:28.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running on AMD and recently had it updated?
