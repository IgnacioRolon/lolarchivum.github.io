The focus on the thread's path from the rising sun to Karma's delicate fingers was pure magical and spell-binding, and the sound effect it makes while it glitters and sparkles its way to the end added to that feeling. The soundtrack overall brought to life the breath-taking scenery of the environment and setting of the art. Finally, those subtle movements you gave Karma complimented her otherworldly beauty and graceful demeanor that this art intended.
