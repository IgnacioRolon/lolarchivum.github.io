If I’m walking to lane Ill be around 160 FPS and right when I dashed on Yasuo, my FPS would go down to about 20 and my screen would freeze and skip the animation. I tried making the quality of everything low but it would still be the same thing. Every time I attacked a creep or did something other than walking, my FPS would drop.\r\nCan anyone help me with this because I don’t know if ill be able to play another league game if this doesn’t go away.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T23:16:48.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it basically sounds like your FPS drops when you do almost *anything* in the game right?
