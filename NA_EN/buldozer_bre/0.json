A bad connection can cause you to lose sync or get left behind entirely.  While I understand you might be able to play other games without issue, you can still specifically have issues connecting to a specific server.  I recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, following each step to get this resolved.
