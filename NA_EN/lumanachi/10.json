Runes Reforged was something unnecessary that nobody wanted or asked for. It's apparent now that it is just a watered down combination of old runes and masteries to appeal to small brain players who don't understand how stats work.\n\nIt's unfortunate that Riot doesn't know how to say \"oops we messed up let's revert the system to when it worked well\" because they just keep making changes that make the game feel worse each patch. Honestly I'm done with ranked until they nerf damage because the snowballing is so volatile and makes players a lot more toxic since games become unwinnable because of what one person did wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MikeJ122O","date":"2018-11-23T20:15:53.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old rune styles let you pick a more variety of bonus stats, unlike what we have now for preseason (magic resist, armor, health, attack speed... no lethality, health regen, bonus gold, etc.)\nI used to get mana runes with lethality on old Urgot so I could play him as an assassin with the E,Q snipe combo and not build any mana items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rαy","date":"2018-11-23T19:13:48.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really do not get how Riot does not see they could slow down the decline of their game massively by just reverting the rune system and champion base stats.
