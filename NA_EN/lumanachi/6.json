I&#x27;m sure other people tell you otherwise, but you&#x27;re just meaningless after the first 5 mins of the game. Your job is basically to get your lanes a small lead and then hope they don&#x27;t int their faces off while you provide nothing in team fights. \n> \n> ADC is the god role right now after 15 mins nothing else matters at all, if you play better then the other ADC you will win.
