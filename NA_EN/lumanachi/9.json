There are other little things I like like champion voice lines, in my case It's for Jhin and Swain, I just love listening to their voice, the voice actors did an amazing job portraying both characters.\nAs the things I hate are I guess the mobility in game? It's sucks trying to catch or run away from someone like Akali or Zed If you are playing immobile champion. Or playing ADC in general (unless it's Jhin, but he is the only exception).","replies":[]},{"poster":"anatasjhsh01","date":"2019-09-18T20:29:51.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate high damage and 1 shots, I LOVE team fights they are the only reason I play league they are actually what got me into it in the first place.\n\nI also love the strategy in the game with the enemy team like choosing to give up turrets or Dragons for another objective or stopping split pushers of fighting for vision, I also love the small skirmishes.\n\nWhat about you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-09-20T10:00:04.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate Riot's bias and skin based balancing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"14daysuspensionk","date":"2019-09-18T22:39:12.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the universe.\n\nHate Mecha Rengar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrokenRayquaza","date":"2019-09-18T18:33:36.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the satisfaction of outplaying someone for the kill.
