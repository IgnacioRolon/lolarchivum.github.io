In the process, i got the icons for {{champion:55}} and {{champion:245}}, but i don't have the champs or project skins yet due to lack of funds at the time.\r\nSo if i buy them and the skins, do i still get the load screen borders or did i miss out?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T00:34:10.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and checked your list of icons to make sure you had the right ones, and you do so no worries there. As long as you have those icons, you should be able to purchase the Project skin at any time and have the border active!","replies":[{"poster":"Tamashii Kitsune","date":"2017-08-22T01:30:03.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noice!
