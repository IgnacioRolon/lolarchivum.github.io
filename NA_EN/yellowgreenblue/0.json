I tried restarting my PC, router, and relogging in. I tried to test if it was my internet connection that was wrong but my brother was playing the same server but had no lag issues. I'm just wondering if you guys did anything or fixed stuff that made my game this intollerable. Sorry for this but I never had complained about lag since the day I started playing, but guess what. Please I'm begging you to fix this. This turns off interest for many other players with the same issues as mine or even worse. BTW, I had normal ping and FPS during the game as Quinn. Please Please do not ignore this. Sorry for posting it here but I just don't know where to put it where it won't be ignored. Thank you Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Pandanater2","date":"2016-09-14T08:18:41.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here I had normal ping and fps but I was getting disconnected constantly while having major lag with normal ping.  When I tried to log back on the game it stays on the loading screen forever or doesnt load at all.  I checked my internet and that's not the issue, I'm able to get online just fine and I was still in voice chat without any hiccups. Oh and at one point when I was logging on the client responded with an error saying something like the server didn't respond so that makes me thing something is wrong with the NA server and are only effecting a few ppl.","replies":[{"poster":"1wolfpack","date":"2016-09-15T03:11:38.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the exact same problem this morning, did u figure out the problem?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arragoth","date":"2016-09-14T18:50:33.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have also been suffering through game breaking latency issues.

All these occuring when I had the regular ping and frame rate I had since then. It started after the patch though.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T15:56:34.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this was only affecting you inside the match, I suspect there are either problems with your networking adapter or there may be network settings local to your PC that are causing the issue. I recommend working through the steps inside our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a next step in troubleshooting this.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your connection to the match.","replies":[{"poster":"yellowgreenblue","date":"2016-09-16T08:14:20.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't only affecting me in-game. My client would hang like the clubs won't show since it can't connect but the client would work normally and there is no warning whatsoever. When I clicked the 2nd button on the lower right portion (the clubs button), it says there that it can't connect and I need to relog. I did relog about 3 times but it still displayed the same messages. Besides that, everything was normal until the game started. Again, this happened after the patch. \n\nPS: Sorry for the troubling discussion, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T16:01:25.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chat and club services rely on a stable connection to PvP.net, so I believe they're a confirmation that your issue is directly related to instability to the server.

Its a TON of people this patch. i had it really really bad last game dced for 6 min while my ping said 80-90 the whole time. i've had at least one person on my team experience the same thing at least once ever 2-3 games. this is a serious problem that started this patch. at no time when i was dcing(i dced 3 or 4 times that game) did i lose internet connection. This is VERY frustrating since it can happen at any time and it happens quite frequently. some times my game just freezes up and sometimes i can  run around the map but not interact with anything.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spellvamp Garen","date":"2016-09-14T21:55:38.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Taragons Blade, just a FYI  - I noticed quite a bit of lag yesterday and when I finished my game, I looked at my windows processes and noticed that Windows10 was pushing out some updates. That  might be causing some issues the next few days for some people.\n\nI'm not sure if this is even possible, but having a warning posting on the main page of the client that indicates new OS updates (like the notices for rank queue disables) would be super helpful. If I know that something is updating, I certainly would wait before playing a ranked game and causing hardship for my team.","replies":[{"poster":"Our Lord Trump","date":"2016-09-14T23:38:44.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still haven't said what the problem is.
