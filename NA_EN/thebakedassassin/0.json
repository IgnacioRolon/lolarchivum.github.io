I&#039;ve been playing League for about 5-6 years, and I&#039;ve always been fascinated by the care that goes into creating and tailoring the lore of each character. I&#039;m currently in my second year of university at Mcgill, and my passion for creative writing and world-building has never been stronger. If there&#039;s an opportunity over the late spring and summer of 2018, I would love to be a part of the process Riot goes through when introducing new lore/elements into the game. Unfortunately, I just don&#039;t know who to get in touch with to get more information. Would someone mind pointing me in the right direction? \r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!\r\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"efflam","date":"2017-11-17T22:16:58.122+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Daniel,\n\nI am probably not the best person to ask but I'm an artist on Worldbuilding /Foundations team, AMA :)\n\n\nAlso here are some links about behind the scenes on lore updates : \n[Forum post with player asking about Foundations ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/TL7LIR7y-riot-could-we-hear-more-about-the-foundations-team-we-dont-know-much-about-them-right-now)\n[Building Bilgewater (article)](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/building-bilgewater-pirate-renovation)\n[Talking Targon ](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/editorial/talking-targon-foundations-team)\n( There was also two podcast with the writers about Shurima and Shadow Isles, but unfortunately the links seems broken, I've reached out to ask what's up with that )\n[DEV: ON STORY HOOKS](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2016/10/dev-on-story-hooks/)\n[Reintroducing Demacia ( video )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxjiCFo0NZM)\n[Building Runeterra ( why Riot is putting a lot of efforts into making an IP )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN07nKVR-eU)\n\n\nThere should be another video (very similar to the Demacia one) about **Targon** coming out this weekend.\nEdit : [there it is ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VibL831dY-s&feature=youtu.be)\n\nHope this helps,\nFor anything else, AMA !","replies":[{"poster":"ZER0 2","date":"2017-11-18T01:02:11.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was the Demacia one?
