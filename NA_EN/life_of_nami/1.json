And overenforcing their new art direction that doesn't shape up with the previous design of the game.\n\nWe do have a poolparty female human champion, its Leona.","replies":[{"poster":"Rune Ocarina","date":"2015-07-22T01:40:30.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad. I knew of Leona but I meant of the ones released this year. \n\nAnd I'm also agreeing with you on them being more overly caution and think the feminist argument may have been too far - though the feminist argument could be a bit of a factor as to why they're overly cautious. The cigar for example, while silly, has nothing to do with feminists views but was included in the comment.\n\nEither way, this Fiora VU sucks ass.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Auditor","date":"2015-07-22T02:35:23.299+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I also think all this talk of feminism, cleave, etc. is just politicising and clouding a very simple issue: the update is bad on a fundamental level, and to such a degree that the whole art-is-subjective thing really doesn't hold much weight.

A _royal guard_ with a boob-window simply looks incompetent. The shade of yellow they used bothers me significantly more then anything else, it's super jarring and unpleasant.\n\nOverall however, Fiora is pretty much the only champ I'm fine with in terms of the window, practicality-wise; looking back on dueling, normal clothes were worn, or just pants only to prevent cloth getting into wounds and causing an infection. (I mean, a guy walked all the way home after getting stabbed in the heart in a duel... and _then_ died)","replies":[]}]}
