To be blunt, there's a summoner name I REALLY want. The summoner appears inactive but the name won't be available for a couple years. Is there any way I can get in contact, finding their email, or messaging them otherwise? I sent them a friend request but obviously they'll likely never accept it as they are inactive.\r\n\r\nThanks guys. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-19T22:44:09.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're eager for a name, but Kokua pretty much said it.  We won't be able to share info about other players or when a name would become available.  If you're using third party sites to check as well, it could be inaccurate.  Everyone gets an equal chances to claim a name, so we won't release a specific name to a player as well.  I know it's a tough game, sorry about that!","replies":[]},{"poster":"smethie","date":"2018-01-20T05:21:49.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunate :( That's okay. I suppose I'll just have to claim that name in games going forward.
