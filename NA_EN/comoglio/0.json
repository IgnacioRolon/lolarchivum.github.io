I really, really love how you did his cloak with the red beltlike thing laced in. I really love the armor part too, it's very stylish.\nMight I make a few suggestions concerning his mask? It would look even more amazing it was more scary. More smiling scary, with teeth, frowning. I'm thinking about Kalista's mask, but less gleeful maybe. Also MOAR horns, 4 to be exact. There's a place for them on his glorious forehead. Long horns, perhaps with the swirling pattern coming back in them as on his armor. Heck, maybe even qilin antlers???? Haven't seen those on Bloodmoon skins! Qilin are said to appear with the imminent arrival or passing of a sage or illustrious ruler. Well, Jhin kills these important persons. How ironic!\nAhhhh anyway sorry for the rambling I just want a proper skin for him, he'd deserve it so much, and I really like this concept. I hope I didn't come off as an offensive know-it-all or anything!
