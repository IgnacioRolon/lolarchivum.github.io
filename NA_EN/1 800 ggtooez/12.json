On ARAM however, the entire MMR system is inflated, in part due to bots, and a lack of soft resetting combined with a lot of people dropping in for 1-9 games.\n\nTherefore, MMR 1720 on ARAM is more like...

If you reroll or dodge if you dont get a good champ, then chances are pretty good youll get one.\n> \n> (Or shyvana. It constantly wants to give me shyvana)\n\nARAM is meant to be completely random. Getting a champion you own or don't own should not be any sort of factor at all imo. I remember before I owned so many champions I would constantly get ones who I'd never played, and some I would find out I enjoyed a lot, others I'd find out I didn't. It actually caused me to buy some champs back then. Now I've played every champion at least once I'm fairly sure, so it's not the same, but I still feel like above all, it should be random, whether you own or don't own the champion. The mode isn't meant for you to get your favorite picks all the time. It's meant for you to play a random champion in a 5v5 one lane setting.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RocketRelm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cIPE9jEH,comment-id=00070002,timestamp=2018-03-07T08:57:14.258+0000)\n>\n> To be fair, I think there&#x27;s this whole mythos of &quot;poke is king&quot; that everyone angles for. that just *isn&#x27;t true* for ARAM, and hasn&#x27;t been for several years. ARAM is actually #LeagueofTanks, specifically Engage Tanks.

I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way lol. But yes I definitely feel like supports are really strong in ARAM. I've constantly destroyed people with Nautilus even going full AP, they just can't handle it. Mages though I used to build like an AP bruiser style, before they removed some of the items I used to do so with. Not being able to die while pumping out consistent damage did wonders.","replies":[]}]}
