I have tried BotRK first, and maybe it just doesn't fit with my style as well but I always felt like I had less power.  I have well over a thousand games played with her, and have tried lots of builds over the years.  The one I find that I like best is usually not the most popular one.  \n\nIt's true you get sustain from BotRK, but you get more from BT.  And I find that I do better in lane trades with it.  I am not saying its \"better\" or even optimal in any math sense, but I find that I do better when I go with BT, PD, IE (With boots in there somewhere earlier on) and then get BotRK.  I do think BotRK is great, but it's power is even better later game when HP is higher.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-09-09T21:05:15.029+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"you know fiora was changed, right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Halo","date":"2015-09-09T21:14:04.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She does?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-09-09T23:59:41.325+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"the meta hasn't been 3 tanks for quite some time, Sated Devourer saw to that.
