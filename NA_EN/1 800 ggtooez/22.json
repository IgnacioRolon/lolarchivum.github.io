Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it should be changed to suit your opinion.\n\nHow exactly anything you said proves it? No the problem is you interpret one number the exact way it suits you. You automatically claim her having low winrate makes RNG fine and she's undertuned. Maybe... JUST MAYBE... She isn't undertuned but the low winrate is caused by the RNG factor.\n\nNot sure If you either don't remember it or you are that biased, but when Ornn had low winrate, first thing Riot changed was display of Masterworks to discourage players from buying them early. Not his damage. Not duration of CC. Not his stats. What concerned them first was that maybe what affects his winrate wasn't his power but the fact players misunderstood usage of Masterworks.\n\nSo, does it really take that much thinking to understand that Zoe's winrate may be affected by results of the RNG rather than her being undertuned. I don't think her burst is too big problem because she is a burst mage, but that burst is good enough. What exactly would you buff on her so that she is closer to 50% winrate? Mana costs? They're already low. Cooldowns? The only ability with crucial cooldown must have such cooldown, otherwise cooldowns are quite low. Damage? Her Q max-rank deals ultimate ability rank I levels of damage in base damage when charged, you cannot buff it or you'll powercreep one ability. And when it is combined with E it can shred 80% HP even when Zoe isn't that fed.\n\nShe is already decent at everything else. So it isn't us wanting her to change because we don't like that as you keep desperately trying to pain it. But If they want to fix her to change her winrate, I'd be more pleased If they actually solved her problems rather than powercreeping abilities that already have low enough mana cost, already have low enough CD, already have high enough damage.\n\nSo the problem is that while you think you are better because you adapt instead of complaining, maybe it's just that you don't have the wit to realize what is problematic on champion and what needs to be fixed. When Kassadin had his Kassawin phase, payers would be right to complain about it and point out what were his problems so that these could be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Gives No Lux","date":"2017-12-21T02:30:30.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Exactly, and Kassadin had a high win rate reflecting that, further proof that win rate matters.\n\nEither way Zoe is strong vs a single target but brings little to a team fight.

It can't, and it doesn't. In lane, the time between a random spell dropping to the ground, Zoe getting it, and Zoe applying it, is often far too small, and even when there is enough time, some effects simply cannot be outplayed (particularly since Riot has claimed in the past that they don't initially balance around summoner spells, namely Flash). Moreover, effects like Redemption or Teleport cannot be properly anticipated unless the literal entire enemy team is constantly observing Zoe at all times to see whichever effects she gets. Perhaps there might be an element of creativity at higher levels of play to the usage of her W, but as a baseline it mostly feels like each minion drop is a roulette roll for either a dud, or an active so good it can secure Zoe her lane and even snowball the game beyond that.\n\nZoe may not be at a high win rate now, but she is certainly not in a healthy spot either, and I would personally support buffs to her, provided that she were made significantly healthier. Her W may have been an experiment in RNG mechanics, but I think there's an overall consensus that this experiment has already turned out unsuccessful.
