Looking at your match history, you play 95% Normal matches, so you're more exposed to behavior in Normals than Ranked.\n\n2) I have played 2 Normals in the last 3 years. What's the point? It's like, PVP video games for people who aren't trying to win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-06-16T18:28:07.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't my job to change your mind.

Even if you can step away and think \"Oh it's just a game\" ranked applies a lot of stress and a lot of people take it out on others in the game. Sure normals can be just as toxic if someone is having a bad day or someone takes them as seriously as ranked but I'd expect more consistent stress and toxicity from a ranked environment.\n\nThough all of my evidence here is anecdotal. I would actually be fairly interested in seeing which queues have the highest punishment rates in them if they even keep track of that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Super Galaxy","date":"2019-06-16T12:52:26.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People in Normals don't even try, though. There is no objective priority or strategy. These \"edgy\" people are probably the ones that care the most and get angry when their teammates don't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OneAlmond","date":"2019-06-16T15:06:42.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would've said no, you're incorrect prior, but it seems that I've just been chat banned from a single normal game. The last line of text in the chat ban is me asking the person who's harassing me (and trying to friend me afterwards to continue the harassment) to \"please stop.\" Fun times /s\n\nI hope the devs put more effort into vs bots rewards such as borders, missions, etc. It's the only nice place to play it seems :(","replies":[]}]}
