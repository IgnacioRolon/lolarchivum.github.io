You don't even know if the player is fat or not, you're just calling people fat just because you can. That fact that calling people fat isn't considered offensive to you honestly pisses me off.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2020-01-08T03:16:41.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I enjoy playing thicc tanky champs - alistar, ornn, gragas... and as a morbidly obese player when they call me or my champion fat I cannot in good conscience be offended, as one cannot be shamed for what one does not view as shameful. I just laugh. I am fat, and I feel no shame. I'm just me. There are people starving in this world, but I have overcome starvation. I also drink alot, most of the alcoholic drinks i make have limes. I view this as successfully warding off scurvy. I consider myself lucky. As 'Fluffy' says, \"I don't wanna die sore, I wanna die full.\" YMMV.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-06T14:31:49.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"not my fault grag-ass is a fatass\nand sejuani is a ginger","replies":[{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2020-01-08T03:20:44.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gragas should market a non-alcoholic ginger-ale, with sejuani on the label...","replies":[]}]}]}
