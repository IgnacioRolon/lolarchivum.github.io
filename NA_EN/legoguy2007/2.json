With the reporting system being so whacked out when it comes to if it wants to ban someone for toxicity or not, people think they can get away with this shit with no real punishment.  **(ex: one guy could say fuck you r%%%%% and get away and someone else could say you're shit and should fucking die will get banned where both sentences are extremely toxic and SHOULD lead to a ban)**\r\n\r\nMy idea for a way to maybe remedy this is a system like CS has, where if someone is reported for toxicity, anyone who signs up and is approved with honor 3+ for longer than one month can choose to review a case and determine if there indeed was toxicity or not in chat. Names would be redacted obviously but I think it could work if it was given a chance. Also, remove chat restriction, that shit usually doesn't even work because people who were toxic once are typically going to be toxic again.\r\n\r\njust my two cents, lmk what you guys/girls think.","replies":[{"poster":"Mavëríck","date":"2019-11-17T00:25:00.366+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot is an SJW company that got woke.

Meaning people can get punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many games of mild toxicity. \n\nGranted People have different gauges on the severity of toxicity. Someone might think calling someone r%%%%% as super toxic, where as another person will think the same for gg ez. So the severity is Riot's secret sauce, but chances are it's actually the community that decides the severity, where if alot of people reported certain phrases from back in tribunal days, then the phrase will be deemed as more severe in toxicity. \n\nEducation is certainly a problem within the behavioral system (and you've proved it already by saying the system is out of whack and you don't know how punishments are handed out), but another problem is the clarity and transparency of things. \n\nIf people don't see others being punished, then they don't know where the standard is. When they don't know the standard, then they think it is fine for them to act the same way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xecks","date":"2019-11-21T14:51:09.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate to disagree, but I feel what promotes toxic behavior is the overbearing punishments.  I got a chat ban and my honor rank set back to 1 for being snarky.  Not swearing, not belittling, just being snarky toward two \"bad\" players over the course of hundreds of games.  You know what I learned?  Hit that report button asap to anyone that steps a single cm out of line.\n\nI didn't call anyone even so much as \"dumb\".  Instead it was like \"gee thanks\" sort of comments.  So yeah, losing hundreds of hours and hundreds of games of progress for not so much as a single insult, you better believe that leaves me in a toxic state.\n\nEdit: I'll explain a little further...\n\nBecause when someone is facing down a massive punishment, many people then will try to make it worth the punishment.  Instead of telling someone \"l2p\" they'll kick it up till they feel good about it, make the ban that \"l2p\" would have given them worth it.  So then they just pile it on, because might as well make it count, right?\n\nAnd yeah, very, very salty (and probably will always be salty) about losing my honor due to being snarky and sarcastic, not even insulting.

Or at least players could submit a request to have a \"jury\" look over the full game's chat logs. At least then, they could keep their automated system. The Tribunal didn't have enough people using it for it to work correctly. At least if they only reviewed cases that players themselves submit, the work load would be a lot less. On top of that, if people feel they are unjustly banned...I'm sure they won't mind waiting for that human judgement.\n\nAutomated system is effective in covering more cases, but treats them all the same. Tribunal was more personal, but didn't have enough persons. Lose lose, unless somehow they can be combined.","replies":[]}]}]}
