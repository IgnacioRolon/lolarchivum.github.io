If you have it enabled will it just ignore other players color-compositions or...?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to feel disadvantaged if people can change all of their skins and particles to red and green. There are still existing game elements which I wish were recolored such as fire particles or cait traps. I virtually couldn&#039;t see Caitlyn cupcakes before because of their coloring, it&#039;s a little better now... I think they were changed to be slightly more orange-ish in colorblind mode, maybe I&#039;m wrong.\r\n\r\nRegardless, would love to hear how this will work. Just a little concerned is all.

Particle recolors add an intensive, additional layer to the project and they often differentiate between what we’re trying to do with chroma packs and what we do with skins (especially in the murky realm of 750 RP skins and slick-looking chromas). However, if we just always leave particles as they are, we could miss out on tons of chroma packs that without particle changes wouldn’t hit our quality high-bar.\n\nIs that a newer reply (e.g. it was decided they will not include recolors) or are you just saying the current ones don't have particle recolors?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-06T22:50:18.038+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm referring to the current chromas. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2015-04-06T22:51:59.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for clarifying. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2015-04-06T22:13:50.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=ZvhTOeoN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-06T22:06:46.754+0000)\n>\n> Hey Vanthil,\n> \n> Particles won't be changing on chromas - these are simply color changes to the model. \n> \n> Chromas will be using the existing skin's particles.
