But now it has disappeared and when i try to switch to it in the pregame screen i cant find it there. I personally really like this ward skin and really want it back and i was wondering if anyone could send me in the right direction to achieving this. This would be much appreciated.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/muecE9V\nAs seen in the image above, riven (me) has just placed the gingerbread ward while my friend who took the screenshot because his ward was sideways is walking beside me.\n\n\n  {{item:3361}} {{item:3635}} {{champion:29}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-07T21:30:59.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and found that the Gingerbread Ward Skin shard was activated as a rental.  Activation consumes the shard and requires a confirmation, meaning that it's not possible to retrieve it after activation unfortunately.   Take heart, it's still possible to grab another shard through Hextech Crafting, or possibly through future sales/events.","replies":[{"poster":"Oxylis","date":"2016-07-08T03:11:13.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sure that i activated it fully because it did use essence and if somehow i am delusional, is there a way that i can get it for keeps. i really liked how it waved back at me D: and the chances of getting it again are very slim.","replies":[]}]}]}
