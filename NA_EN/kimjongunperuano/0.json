Now with the new client I cant do that and I dont know why, knowing it uses same ports and protocols. I contacted Tech Support but all they gave me was generic answers and solutions and they didnt even mentione what to do in order to make the new client work. I can play temporarily with the legacy client until the new one is oficially released and then, I wont be able to play lol anymore...\r\nI tried this solution: http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=495727 and it happens to open the old client but the \"launch\" button does never appear. The new client does not connect and does not even start. The proxy I am using uses port 8080. The vpn I am using is anyconnect from cisco.. My only problem is the new launcher, because during gameplay my connection and game experience is flawless, the vpn tunnels all traffic and it has no problems with udp ports.\r\n\r\nany help would be greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T05:08:09.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, League doesn't run very well behind proxies or VPNs, as your tech specialist has mentioned in your ticket.

I just want to know if there are settings I can adjust in order to play. I really find it odd that the old client works and the new one doesn´t. I can also ask my Uni if I can do something but they are gonna ask me for some details and all I know is what ports and protocolos the client uses, I don´t know if that´s enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-27T21:48:09.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked your ticket again and it seems you've received a reply from one of our techs.
