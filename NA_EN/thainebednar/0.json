Right now it shoots 5(Q)+2(RH)=7 projectiles when it was firing 5x3=15 projectiles.\r\n\r\n(1b) Runaan&#039;s no longer grants 10/20/30 charges for Statikk Shiv when attacking 1/2/3 targets.\r\n\r\n(2a) To reproduce buy RH on Ashe and auto a group of creeps, will only gain one stack per AA (100% replication). Once fully stacked activate Q and continue to AA, only up to 2 secondary bolts will fire as opposed to the previous 10 (100% replication).\r\n\r\n(2b) Buy SS after RH then AA a group of creeps, only 10 charges will be gained per AA as opposed to the previous 10/20/30 (100% replication).","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-19T20:02:42.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe Ashe now works like that on purpose because her Q no longer has CD. Likely so that she has a very static ramp up time. Her W no longer applies a stack either, it's only AA's, likely an 'on-attack' sorta thing rather than an on-hit. Rageblade is now the same way and as you noticed, the Energized attacks are on-attack rather than on-hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hangfire","date":"2015-11-19T19:56:34.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just played ARAM with Thresh.. couldn't buy Runaan's..  \"Ranged Heroes Only\"","replies":[]}]}
