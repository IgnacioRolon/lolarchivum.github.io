Whenever Wukong {{champion:62}}  was present, during that time, there was a feeling of &quot;instant-loss&quot; or &quot;instant-win&quot; depending on the team he was on. Why? Because of Duskblade {{item:3147}} and his W that allows him to go invisible. Not camouflaged. Invisible. Which means only True Sight can make him targetable again. There are only 13 champions that have the abilities to reveal anyone with True Sight. \r\n\r\n{{champion:51}} Caitlyn&#039;s Yordle Snap Trap and Ace in the Hole \r\n{{champion:105}}  Fizz&#039;s Chum the Waters\r\n{{champion:420}}  Illaoi&#039;s Test of Spirit\r\n{{champion:43}}  Karma&#039;s Renewal and Focused Resolve \r\n{{champion:240}}  Kled&#039;s Beartrap on a Rope and Jousting\r\n{{champion:64}}  Lee Sin&#039;s Sonic Wave\r\n{{champion:117}}  Lulu&#039;s Help, Pix!\r\n{{champion:76}}  Nidalee&#039;s Prowl Prowl\r\n{{champion:107}}  Rengar&#039;s Thrill of the Hunt\r\n{{champion:78}}  Poppy&#039;s Keeper&#039;s Verdict\r\n{{champion:412}} Thresh&#039;s Death Sentence\r\n{{champion:4}}  Twisted Fate&#039;s Destiny\r\n{{champion:143}}  Zyra&#039;s Rampant Growth\r\n\r\n10 of these champions can be 1-shot by Wukong&#039;s Duskblade combo. And I have to resort to abilities and not items because the Pink Ward {{item:2055}}  doesn&#039;t make Wukong targetable nor does the Oracle Lens {{item:3364}} . So if any testing is done in the PBE at all, then either this is a glaring oversight and needs to be hotfixed or Riot doesn&#039;t truly understand the ramifications of allowing certain champions to stay in &quot;fun&quot; game modes. I would lean towards the former since they removed Sona from URF way back when it was first introduced. They even had a funny little quote saying she breaking the gamemode in one way or another. Please, Riot, do not move at a glacial pace when fixing this issue or you WILL see a decline in player activity after this event. And I&#039;m not speaking for myself nor for anyone else. It just makes sense that people playing against this are going to get frustrated and quit the game altogether. I&#039;ve seen people leave for less. So, Riot, if you care about keeping your player base, as much as you claim, then I implore you to hotfix Wukong out of URF as you did Sona. {{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2018-06-28T22:35:12.786+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lawl, .. there are ALWAYS going to be champions that are \"too strong\" or \"too weak\" in URF. \n\nYou have to understand that mana and cooldowns are designed to be balancing mechanics. \n\nThe fact that URF drastically alters the way these mechanics function, .. or removes them all together means the game is inherently out of balance. \n\nI'm not sure if you were in the game back before they changed it to AR (All Random) URF, but there were always a handful of champions selected in nearly every single game because people quickly discovered who was strong and who wasn't.\n\nBecause of this, Riot would disable certain champions from play in those iterations of the game mode. \n \nThe 'All Random' aspect is honestly one of the best ways Riot could have \"BALANCED\" (and I'm saying this very loosely) this issue. \n\nSo, should Wukong be removed from ARURF? \n\nIn my opinion, no. The random aspect makes it at least somewhat fair through sheer luck. \n\nEither you/your team gets him, the enemy team gets him, .. or he isn't rolled at all. \n\nThere are definitely other champions who are just as oppressive.","replies":[{"poster":"H20Snake","date":"2018-10-07T23:58:03.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why are other champions removed from URF? Like Sona or Teemo? The of the post was to point out that if they aren't allowed to be in the game mode because they are \"too op\" then other champs that break the game mode shouldn't be allowed to either. In this case, Wukong, seeing as how he can kill anyone using only his invisibility and the Duskblade passive. Shaco can't do that and he's equally obnoxious with his invisibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2018-10-08T00:29:02.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure I saw both Teemo and Sona in ARURF last time. \n\nI know that previously Teemo was banned from URF because he could literally spam shrooms across every inch of the map. I believe they put some sort of cap on it so that he could be playable. \n\nI don't remember seeing anything about a Sona ban from ARURF, and I can't logically tell why she would be banned\n\nbut, to be honest, I don't remember. Your post was made 3 months ago. \n\nRegardless, it is intended to be fun. It isn't intended to be balanced.\n\nAs I said in my previous comment, throwing two of the major balancing mechanics nearly out of the picture completely is guaranteed to create \"too strong\" or \"too weak\" champions. ... That is just how it is. \n\nIf you can't accept that, .. don't play it. \n\nRiot keeps bringing this back because people enjoy playing it. \n\nIf nobody played it, they wouldn't bring it back.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheInfamousD","date":"2018-06-28T22:57:17.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"yikes this post","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-28T22:39:19.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"you make litterally \"too op\" arguments for any champ in urf... which is the point of urf.\n\n\nI swear people cry about the dumbest shit","replies":[]}]}
