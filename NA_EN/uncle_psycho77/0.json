I am thinking of buying  a PC or laptop  which i am going to use it for studying but mostly playing LoL and CS:GO. I dont want to waste a ton of money because as i said i am still a beginner and i dont need to play in max graphics. I want suggestions on what to buy and plzz dont tell me to make my own because i live in a small country  and you cant find all the pieces needed to make your own pc. In the link i found a laptop which suits my budget and seems good.
