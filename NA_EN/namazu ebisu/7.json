I am Mastery 7 on Lux and as many others do probably it wasn&#039;t such a big thing to predict she&#039;d become **TRASH** tier with the changes :\n\nhttps://puu.sh/zxR1m/ad5560f4db.png\n\n\nI called it, lots called it and despite that Riot just denied it. When it comes to skins she gets the sweet spots but gameplay wise she has had the biggest inconcistency for years and now it hurts her like never before. \n\nHer laning phase is bad. Her E costs 130 mana so more than her goddamn ultimate and it cannot even kill CASTER MINIONS. In fact Lux was and is the only mage in the game who strictly needs to use minion dematerializer in order to wave clear, which is insane. But that she cannot do anymore because her E cost is garbage and without Morello she has insane mana issues. Couple that with the fact that..you know..she can&#039;t waveclear and you get the miserable winrate she currently has and will have until they buff her. She can only burst something once in hope it doesn't have shields or anti-cc and then hide in a bush in shame until her atrocious CD are back.\n\n\nCan we finally have a real Rioters thoughts on Lux&#039;s state and WHY they allow her E for all this time to be this bad in both cost and efficiency?

You can only avoid it by standing really far back and accept being zoned off the minions because it's only dodgeable when it has the full travel time. So it can't cost less mana.\n\nHere's a reasonable option but I doubt they'll do it:\n\nRescale the mana cost to 60/70/80/90/100\nRescale the base damage to 50 / 100 / 150 / 200 / 250\nMake it more delayed. Maybe a 0.25s delay when it pops, or maybe adjust the travel time so that it starts out slower and speeds up so that mid-range it can be dodged.\n\nLux mains will downvote this post but I'm just telling the hard truth. A harass tool that good can't be cheap. It has to be a worse harass tool if you want it to be cheaper.","replies":[{"poster":"Namazu Ebisu","date":"2018-03-01T00:11:53.402+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I understand the statement but there are a lots of cases like this where they don't have as much early issues as Lux.

Ok she has range but at some point you can get poked by anyone and anything in lane. You can get poked by Orianna easily, E'd by Syndra too. Lux has no mobility so she can still be punished to some degree. This is more about scaling and early laning which drastically changed with AP itemization. Where other mages can still poke and farm comfortably, Lux struggles to even clear caster minions while running out of mana in barely 3/4 E cast. You have the choice to either poke or farm TERRIBLY and that shouldn't be the case. In late game she struggles to find a place in teamfights where she has too much cooldowns and low utility. It's why her winrate is so low and her early so bad.

But yeah he's pretty strong in bot lane but I think he's terrible in mid. I'm level 7 Brand and also I don't think he's ever been shown to be effective in mid in pro play.\n\nAzir and Xerath have really dumb harass unfortunately some champs fly under the radar for some reason.\n\nI just thought about it a bit more. I think they could probably give Lux a lot of help simply by tweaking scaling. The harass becomes a lot less of an issue midgame so they could probably reduce the cost at later ranks a little, increase the AP ratio a little, increase her stat growth (mana and mana regen). That would help her a lot without making her early harass really oppressive.","replies":[{"poster":"Namazu Ebisu","date":"2018-03-01T00:39:39.000+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"A good guy suggested down here that her E scales with charging which isn't such a bad thought to actually choose between poke and waveclearing.

Which is a big problem. \n\nGraves' rework gave him amazing waveclear. Quinn's rework gave her waveclear. Caitlyn's rework buffed her waveclear. Tristana's rework buffed her waveclear. Xayah has insane waveclear. Jhin has good waveclear. Statikk Shiv had its waveclear substantially buffed over the years. And that's just ADCs. Titanic Hydra has given an entire class of champions with bad waveclear significant access to it. Galio's rework gave him amazing waveclear. Poppy's rework gave her dramatically increased waveclear.\n\nI could keep going at this for a loooong time. That's not to say that every instance of this has been a bad design choice. A lot of those changes were great at the time, or still are great. But there's at least a few bad apples in every bunch.\n\nI understand your hesitancy to buff Lux's waveclear, but I think it's completely justified in the case of Lux. Because Lux, quite frankly, has a number of issues with her identity, and it's one of the few things you can safely buff without a rework  that shifts her identity. I think she'll have problems until she gets something between a minor rework and a full scale rework. But she's nowhere near troubled enough to deserve that sort of attention anytime soon. Which is kind of sad.\n\nHer W, Q, and E slow zone all seem to suggest she's more of a utility mage like Orianna, Morgana, Zyra, or Zilean, but her R, damage, and harass encourage her to play more like Vel'koz, Xerath, or Ziggs.\n\nI'm not saying she needs to perfectly fit into one box, but as it stands she's stuck with some of the weakest parts of two different types of mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2018-03-01T18:06:16.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree (regarding waveclear creep).\n\nWaveclear creep isn't so much a thing as easily destroyed towers has forced strong waveclear to be a necessity.\n\nAzir is P/B in pro play because he excels at defending a tower alone (he can take on multiple people and come out alive).

I second the other answer you got, the E charging up is definitely imo a path to look for if you want to close the waveclear issue without hitting on her poking ability too much. It enables the combo with her Q, where good Lux players could cage ennemies inside her charging E for more burst damage output. If the slow is an issue there, i would test out without it or reduced to see how it goes tbh.\n\n\nAbout that case, a lot of people think that Lux's role is still uncertain in teamfights and pro plays. As someone on this thread greatly stated, here's quote :\n\n> The main problem IMHO is that she isn't able to do much things despite trying to kill people and harassing midrange champs reliably. She has bad waveclear, long CD, mediocre roaming, mediocre teamfight, no escape, and even her burst can be cancelled by anyone with a trick/pool/invulnerability or simply a Zonyha/qss/cleanse/couple of shields from the support. Often when playing her I just feel like I can't catch and kill anyone either because he's to tanky or has one of the above, and hence can't do anything usefull compared to another mage.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this?

Something like that might enable you to add more counterplay with, say, a partial damage + slow that bursts harder if it cooks on the ground. Advantages here would be an increase in the vision utility over just the burst and an increase in Lux's potential zoning power, as well as a power boost to her E+Q reward, while making the E itself less potent as a harass tool without counterplay.\n\nMight be interesting to explore as an option that might let you bake more powerful/satisfaction into the rest of her kit, and avoid the frustration that might occur from a smaller radius on her set-up tool.\n\nAnother interesting bonus -- it would potentially give another passive proc to Lux players with good timing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-03-01T01:36:05.524+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OpOqkLXq,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-03-01T01:13:07.448+0000)\n>\n> As to her current state, general opinion is that she&#x27;s not great from a power perspective, and I&#x27;d believe it if she didn&#x27;t win big off the AP item changes.\n> \n> Lux&#x27;s E has been allowed to have its cost:damage ratio be so poor because the spell is pretty unfair from a hittability perspective.

Allow E to do more if you charge it up, or adjust her mana regen scaling to make up for the itemization changes.

They can harass you while you can't really retaliate. Against assassins, it can mean death.
