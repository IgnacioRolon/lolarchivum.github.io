I&#039;m your random folk playing league since Graves&#039; release and today i really wanted to share something with any of the Riot staff that will take the time to read it. I hope i didn&#039;t get this in the wrong section.\r\n\r\nFirst of all : **Thank you**\r\n\r\nWhat you&#039;ve been doing lately is amazing and i can&#039;t even imagine how tough it must be to coordinate all projects and plans that happened in order to satisfy most of the community lately (kill all the memes!). I used to main Lux back in season 3 and i have a friend that mains her even today. We were very happy and excited when the first leaks happened and it got bigger with the PBE shop one. \r\n\r\nWhen we saw the first videos yesterday, i was thrilled and immensely happy about the skin and the fact that it exists as it is. You probably will make great money for it, but i want to thank you for those smiles and good times like this that you provide. For a day and more, i was smiling and enjoying everything because in my mind, i had that picture of Lux you made and it would always erase all the bad thoughts i could have about my problems in real life. We spent time talking about it, laughing about it, theorycrafting about it and more. It&#039;s those things and moments that makes me grateful toward your awesome work. You might do it for passion or money, but i just want you to know how every second of your works can affect people even if i&#039;m nobody. Life is hard, but you provide entertainement and happiness and for me that&#039;s perhaps the biggest success a videogame company can hope to achieve.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"karesuna","date":"2016-11-11T21:00:02.433+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for reaching out to us and for giving us shout outs.

We're so glad you like her!

I hope a lot of people feel the same way as me and enjoy Elementalist Lux! I was surprised to see Lux as the most picked midlaner this season, that's a good sign! :D\n\nHad way too much hype to begin with, started testing the skin on PBE and gave too much feedback on the spot that now for some felt rude or innapropriate. But after a while, sorted all of it and i can finally confirm without a doubt that it took a lot of work to get there and i'm thankfull for it. I can't wait to play it on the live servers!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-14T18:37:37.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honest feedback is honestly the best feedback we can receive, and we absolutely appreciate it!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
