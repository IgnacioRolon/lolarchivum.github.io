A champion whom i stated i had a Love/hate relationship with. Why? Because i felt she was weak and just not worth playing.\r\n\r\nthe entire point of the thread was toi discuss ways with the community to make her a stronger and overall better pick.\r\n\r\nNaturally the first thing to go was her passive. Which i updated to include a MS steroid and wouldn&#039;t be turned off by taking a hit by a freaking minion.\r\nI improved her Q slightly nerfed her W and made some improvements on her e and R passive.\r\n\r\nNow then I&#039;m not saying my changes were perfect but they were done with the love of MF in mind. I WANT to be able to be proud to play my original Main, and Im not because she&#039;s just really weak.\r\n\r\nthis rework for her slaughtered her w, made her ult feel wonky and delayed (as well as do no damage) and nothing in it at all compensated for it.\r\n\r\nShe&#039;s immobile, and she doesnt hurt. She&#039;s the literal gameplay opposite of a champion like Vayne or Kalista. Now im not saying they&#039;re well designed, as a matter of fact i hate both of them in every sense of the word, but they have SO much to make them powerful. Miss fortune&#039;s rework was up for debate for so long and all we got was a nerf with minimal changes.\r\n\r\nher Passive is still awful\r\n\r\nher W does nothing significant. \r\n\r\nHer E can actually get you killed more than save you because you have to stop and wait a year to cast it...\r\n\r\nSeriously rito WHAT HAPPENED HERE? She was out for this rework for so long, and the ball just got dropped HORRIBLY. and the only thing we got was a New filter on her original splash art with a skin that should be her default.","replies":[{"poster":"Harryv","date":"2015-08-09T00:59:51.128+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate how minions can knock off her passive, it's so frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2015-08-09T01:27:32.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Harryv,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b8Nflv4N,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-09T00:59:51.128+0000)\n>\n> I hate how minions can knock off her passive, it's so frustrating.\n\nBuild bT, get the LS shield and minions won't deactivate your passive-this change was incorporated with the a MF update.","replies":[{"poster":"blacknerdtaku","date":"2015-08-09T02:39:28.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so in order for her innate passive to not be completely useless, you have to build a super expensive Lifesteal item that you probably WONT because BotRK is both cheaper AND stronger for this meta anyway, just for her passive to not suck?\n\nAnd NOBODY thought to change her passive from a pair of 800 gold boots, that's not all that effective unless you're a support to something more.... significant?\n\nI don't know about you but that's just bad champion design. You can be AFK for the first 7-8 minutes of the game and have enough gold to Buy Miss fortune's passive... that's a pretty shitty passive, and one Players were complaining about forever. And if you're only going to nerf a champion that's practically the Galio of ADCs, why do any of the updates at all?

Evelynn. Yi. Katarina. Karma. Ashe. TF. Ryze. (Old, not the new one)\n\nThose are actual reworks. Gameplay Updates, Trundle and Sej were amazing and most have preferred the current Nid over the Tree Trunk Spear Nid of old. Gragas's gameplay update was also amazing and Trist has come out better than before, plus Viktor's change is also incredible. \n\nCurrent 'Failures', according to the community at least, are Karma (Visual only. Many were pissed about the fans being removed), Cass, Ryze (Newest), Veigar, Taric, Olaf, Kassadin, Miss Fortune, and Skarner (Every gameplay update. Every one of them have had more more complaints than people loving it). That's the ones that were mostly hated, but Karma and Cass were Thematically considered failures by the community, not gameplay-wise. \n\nNow, the only TRUE failures in my opinion were Miss Fortune, Kassadin, Veigar, and Taric. All of which were more or less gutted rather than reworked.  Miss Fortune was turned into a disgusting hybrid damage ADC with no real identity or uniqueness outside of getting to lane faster and having the sexiest hip sway in the game. Kassadin because they said they wanted 'High Risk, High Reward', then gutted his bases, removed the AP ratio on one of his High Risk abilities (His R), and left his other 'High Risk' ability (His new W) weaker than both of his 'safe' abilities (Q and E). Veigar lost his stun, which was the only way he could get his W to actually hit and his W's drop time was actually balanced around landing the E, which is so hard to land now since people have to actually WALK INTO IT, so I consider it a failure because they broke the synergy in his combo. And then there's Taric who simply had his passive gutted and his W's AP ratio changed to a craptastic armor ratio (20% of his total armor, which is horrible considering even Thornmail is getting a 25% ratio and Rammus's passive gives him 25% of his armor as AD on top of his W doing 10% of his armor per hit and even Malph's E has a 30% and his W does 10% per AA).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Purodyuusaa","date":"2015-08-09T04:52:06.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, none that I can think of.

I would not define her change as a rework in the least. She did get a buffed E unquestionably, the slow is actually good at rank 1 now. I will agree she needs more work, currently she has no niche, and lacks an identity. If it were up to me I'd make her passive be her niche and turn her into a run and gun adc, or focus on impure shots and make her a wombs combo ADC again; I prefer the prior. I main MF and would love to see be more than a joke pick in a pro match with no significance, but who knows Riot doesn't seem to like her too much not do they want her used in a pro match-or they would do more for her.","replies":[]}]}
