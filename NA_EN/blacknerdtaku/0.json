If you're going to call an ally bad, at the very least have an optimal build for the situation..\nBronze players suck at builds, and counterbuilding... yes this can apply to me as well.\nbut let me tell you guys the things im tired of seeing in sequence to get my point.\n\nif you build a {{item:3085}} on any adc who isnt kalista or maybe twitch , **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nif you build a {{item:3146}}  on {{champion:55}} , **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nif you go AP tank and dont have a {{item:3029}} , **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf the enemy team has 3 tanks, and the ADCs build {{item:3072}} instead of {{item:3153}} , **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf you go support and dont have {{item:2045}} **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf at no point in the game you get a variation of {{item:3361}} {{item:3364}} or{{item:3363}}  **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf the enemy team is AP/CC/peel heavy and the Melee Bruiser doesnt go {{item:3111}} **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf you're a tank with a Health Regen or Lifesteal passive and you dont have {{item:3065}} **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf you build a {{item:3078}} Late game , **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf you (Supp, ADC, Mid or Jg) never Once buy a {{item:2043}} for dragon early game,  **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf you, the ADC (melee and ranged) knows you're behind and dont get a {{item:3093}} **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG**\nIf they have a {{champion:84}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:91}} or a {{champion:17}} and NOBODY on the team has a {{item:3364}} ... **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG **\neven better, if NOBODY on the team has {{item:3364}} and everyone has {{item:3340}} by the end of the game **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG **\n\n_________________\n\nThis list is filled ith things I commonly see in bronze, but what topped me over the edge to make this post was the Leona in this game\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1800328805/205526742?tab=overview She refused to buy a SS and replace her yellow trinket with a red lense, she refused to assist the team in vision and counter-vision, leaving me to have to get the lens for Teemo shrooms (which should be fucking obvious).\n\n\ndirect quote from after chat with her, when i try to relay the importance of sight stone \n> i honestly dont care about your mgame win streak with out a single ss in any of my support games so please complain moreatch history i was on a 6\n\n**_(im not even going to try to translate that.)_**\n\nListen, supports. You're Utility. If im a damage source, i do not appreciate having to pick up on your warding slack. Ive said this in my lack of warding post, but it needs some reiteration here. Buy a Sight Stone. if you as a support at no point buy a sight stone... and then have the balls to get mad when somebody asks you to **Please Uninstall. ** \n\nBut Supports arent my only call out. Know what else im tired of seeing? idiots build a {{item:3072}} against a tank comp, then get mad when they do no damage and get killed. I hear \"_OMG, SO TANKY AND OP, WHY CANT I DO ANY DAMAGE TO YOU? IM ADC_\" well, perhaps the problem lies in the fact that you only know one build... which is sub-optimal at best. if you dont have a {{item:3153}} as an ADC against a tank comp, then sir, go play some norms. this just means that one of our biggest damage sources is Obsolete. and if you're ahead early and wondering why you fell off so hard... it's not because we threw.\n\n- True story: had an ADC one game, get fed in lane, then get slaughtered. he wasnt Out of position or anything... the enemy team just lasted long enough to charge through and kill him. We all did our jobs and peeled and whatever. but at the end of the day, while he was doing more numerical damage, he wasnt doing anything effective with it.  Flat damage, is flat damage. He went Insane, and blamed the rest of the team \"_OMG TEAM SO DUMB, WHY DONT YOU PEEL_\"  and \"_Nobody does damage, this team sucks_\". The Kicker? he was using Bloodthirster and the enemy team had, count em, FOUR tanks and an adc. {{champion:106}}{{champion:32}}{{champion:31}} {{champion:89}} and {{champion:119}} When I ({{champion:201}} ) siggested our \"poor\" {{champion:15}} get a BotRK instead of a Blood thirster, she told me \"_dont tell me what to fucking build, n00b i won 2 games with this build_\". There was no reasoning, i gave up, simple. she was too concerned with blaming to see where she messed up. \n\n- Another true story i've seen many Katarina's building {{item:3146}}. As a Kat Mid Main, i know you should **NEVER** build this on her, and it hasnt been viable since what? midseason 3? Yeah, this is season 5. and worse yet? i saw people defending her when i suggested she change it. \"_but Kat can build it_\" at the end of game screen she sent me a link to a Mobafire build that was 2 seasons old, said \"_you're a n00b, ive been playing since season 2, dont tell me how to build_\" (mind you, we're both in Bronze. I'm a relatively new player that jumped in too early and fucked my MMR up recovered at the end of s4 and got thrown into B5 with season 5, whats your excuse?). yet again, She fell off toward the late game. \n\nfinal story... from last game post lobby screen\n\n> blacknerdtaku: jinx\n> blacknerdtaku: you build Botrk\n> blacknerdtaku: they had 2 tanks\n> JINX: you dont build bork you idiot\n\n**Notice how the scenario is exactly the same?**\nIn both the person is building sub optimally, and refuses to acknowledge it.\n\nThe moral of that story is simple, We're playing a team game. The least you can do to do your part, is build optimally for the situation. you can not just have a single build and assume every game will be good. you need flexibility, you need to know the items in the game and how they correspond to the champions you play. Above all, you need to know the key items that make that champ so OP. \n\nWhy do you rush {{item:3078}} on so many caster oriented champs? The answer is {{item:3057}}'s passive. If you're top and thats in your core build but you're being aggressed by your AD top laner then why not try {{item:3025}} instead?\n\n_**I leave you with this thought. Know at least 2 variant builds of each champion you take to ranked, and know the core items that make your champion work in the first place.**_","replies":[{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-04-20T17:51:20.180+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually disagree with quite a few of those items and \"you are doing it wrong\" comments on the first part of this thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2015-04-20T19:30:27.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you dont mention {{item:3035}}  against tanks. do you even adc?\nyou dont build {{item:3153}} on all adc's.\n\nI have seen {{item:3085}} on {{champion:110}}  to great success..\n\nyour \"you're doing it wrong\" list is too one sided.","replies":[{"poster":"blacknerdtaku","date":"2015-04-20T21:05:21.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1798247072/205526742?tab=overview\n\n**Yes**\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1794626563/205526742?tab=overview\n\n**I**\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1792519675/205526742?tab=overview\n\n**Do.**\n\n{{item:3035}} Is a core build item for most if not all ADCs. they build it anyway,\n\n> you dont build {{item:3153}}  on all adc's.\n\ni think you missed the entire point of this thread.... did you even bother to read it, or just skim and cherry pick? \n\nAgainst a tank comp, you do. doesnt matter the ADC, if they have 3+ tanks and you dont have BotRK then you're a problem.\n\n> I have seen {{item:3085}}  on {{champion:110}}  to great success..\n\nIt's a sub optimal item on him. the proc off his e (whichever does the stacking proc) just isnt worth 3 shots, and by all means any other attack speed item is just better on Him.
