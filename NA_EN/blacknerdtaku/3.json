She walked into my lane (Top) demanded i go mId, and when i told her to go back to her lane, she stole CS, and then proceeded to get murdered, this is after giving 2 kills to riven (who went mid). Every time she died she spammed &quot;I told you it was GG&quot; all game. She threatened to afk on multiple occasions, and made the game a living hell. if it were not for our jinx, we would have lost. and when a little bit of hope for the game came, she then began to call us all noobs, and verbally abuse the team for sucking, and not listening to her every word.\r\n\r\nWe asked to just report her for trolling us. the enemy team responded. We won the game, and guess what happened? &quot;well you won, so it doesn&#039;t matter.&quot; \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the deal: _**IT DOES MATTER**_\r\nWinning the game doesn&#039;t suddenly make all the shit this player put her team through A-ok. No, this person made it her mission to make the game a HORRIBLE, unfun, and frustrating time for everyone on her team. and we managed to pull through without much help from her. we had to pull her weight, and endure her horrible attitude for 40 minutes. It was so bad, the win didn&#039;t even feel good because we won, but because I wouldn&#039;t have to see this person again. and you know what? I can almost guarantee she will do this to others. \r\n\r\nthe reason we report isn&#039;t because of salt. We report because that person broke the rules of the game, and made another player&#039;s experience a living hell, and in this case, because i know that this person will do it again, and cost a LOT of MMR for innocent players, until somebody steps up and punishes them. \r\n\r\n**TL:DR read the title **","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-08-23T21:46:01.355+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":6,"body":"A player was toxic all game, but carried your team.

While what you list is also a problem, muting does not solve the problem - especially not 100%.  Muting is a response to a problem that has already occurred.  It's a reactive solution that forces the person or people being negatively affected to respond with.  Focus on that.  If you're muting someone, then you have already been 'harmed' by toxic behavior.  Muting reduces future toxic behavior via chat but it does not remove the toxic behavior that happens. \n\nPlease don't speak so harshly about something like this also.  \"a true sign of ignorance\" is a rather inflammatory statement and one that shows your own ignorance, if I play that card back at you.","replies":[{"poster":"WreckOnPorpoise","date":"2015-08-25T21:47:05.309+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":31,"body":"if you are so overly sensitive, id say the internet is not for you. maybe try the local preschool and see if you can stay up to speed. almost all \"solutions\" are reactive....they \"solve problems\", especially when it comes to social media/interaction. maybe blizzard did it right with hearthstones \"no chat\" \"preventive\" solution. as far as \"harmful behavior\", id rather have 4 good players that talk shit, than 4 nice, kind,  cuddly, and ever so friendly terribads. maybe they can make a separate ranked division for \"nice losers\".","replies":[{"poster":"RoboLions","date":"2015-08-25T22:00:07.136+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you are so callous maybe LoL isn't for you.

Both of which isn't something anyone on the team would want. If you mute a player, you can't hear him/her harrass you, but, at the same time it's makes it hard to plan a gank or a teamfight. If he/she isn't  muted, the players teammates will often lose morale. \nAnd though morale and kindness may not seem like important concepts in a competitive game like LoL, they certainly are. If you have ever tried tilting, you can feel the difference between playing a game when you just came back from a long break and playing a game when you just lost 2 games in a row.\n\nI'm ashamed that I, as a 14 year-old teen have to write to someone probably much older, but seemingly not very mature in this way.\nI really hope you'll read what I write, because if you don't care about other people, well why should they care about you?\nSomeone could write \"I hate you!\", but would you want them to do that, honestly?\nI don't believe that we humans or either good or evil, like in some D&D game.

Likewise, just because the players aren't playing all that good, doesn't mean they're bad players, it might be someone tilting them or they just had a bad day because of something or someone.
