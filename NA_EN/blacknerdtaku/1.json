If your text goes down too low it will overlap forcing the user to have to find a way to space the bottom of the text so it doesn&#039;t overlap.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YrxfEAg.png\n\n\n2: for whatever reason when editing a discussion that you posted the box becomes REALLY small and you cant even scroll down, meaning you have to scroll drag by highlighting.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/v6GgkU1.png\n\nnot only are these glaring issues that really hurt the experience of using these boards, they&#039;re new issues. that just RECENTLY appeared. plz fix, Riot.\n\nOn top of these i really wish that clicking EDIT wouldnt open the basic Html codes for each special character. why does the format change when trying to edit? it clutters the text.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2015-10-14T22:57:42.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the report.
