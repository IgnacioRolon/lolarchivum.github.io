Her entire kit is incredibly toxic. Again,** _not OP, but toxic_**.\r\n\r\nI noticed that I am not mad at all when killed by many of the newest champions, and most times I think &quot;I screwed up&quot; or &quot;damn that was a good play by him&quot; and I think RIOT has done an excellent job giving us clear counterplay to them. Then there is LeBlanc (and others, let&#039;s not discriminate) who just stat checks you all game long, and causes nothing but frustration to her opponents. Even when you kill her, you gain only a small bit of satisfaction knowing that it will only stop her for less than a minute, after which she&#039;ll be back to killing you every time you dare look at her in the wrong way. I&#039;m not trying to say she should stop being such a good assassin (someone needs to keep the Kog&#039;maws in check) but she just doesn&#039;t meet the current standards of the game.\r\n\r\nI want to hear your opinions. Don&#039;t just upvote/downvote but leave a comment, this is a discussion and I want to know other people&#039;s point of view.
