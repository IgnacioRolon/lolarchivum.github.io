There are several abilities that don&#039;t get reduced cooldowns later in the game, though, despite being ridiculously long. Zac is the prime example. His passive cooldown is a whopping 5 minutes, meaning you won&#039;t have it in a majority of fights come late game. I suppose it&#039;s a matter of opinion but I happen to think Zac&#039;s passive is one of the worst of these passives. It takes 8 seconds for the blobs to come together and with the new AoE Smite in Season 5 killing the blobs is easier than ever. I estimate I see Zac&#039;s passive actually cause him to live once out of every four or five times it procs. Taking into account all of these factors I see no reason why this ability remains having a 5 minute cooldown in the late game and why other very long Static Cooldown passives don&#039;t get lower throughout the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Di0","date":"2015-04-15T06:00:23.154+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"They could at least scale in 'respawn' time. 9/10 times if you die as Anivia or Zac with your passive up, you're just going to die again in those 8  seconds it takes to revive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-04-15T09:51:01.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Revive passives, particularly late game, are doubly effective within those team fights.\n\nThe most powerful defensive item for a single fight, is Guardian Angel.

When it's on cooldown in the super late game you can even sell it and purchase something else to use for those 5 minutes. Guardian Angel is leagues above Zac's passive in a multitude of ways in the late game. Yes, Zac gets the bonus of having his passive in the beginning of the game but it isn't like it's assured you will get great use out of it then, too. The change I would think needs to happen doesn't even need to be big. In terms of Zac specifically I would think giving him half a minute off the cooldown at level 9 and another half a minute off at level 17 (every 8 levels) would be at least something that the character deserves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-04-15T10:07:58.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Zacs isn't particularly good if the enemy jungler has Rangers Trailblazer as well the enemy usually don't have much else to use smite on then killing Zacs blobs\n\nLet's see for Zac's blobs to be able to survive smite and only smite he needs to have more then 4000 health and for the blob which is targeted by the smite to survive Zac needs to have more then 8000 health","replies":[{"poster":"Llanite","date":"2015-04-15T15:37:17.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Champion Skin,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r2JyvtZK,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-04-15T10:07:58.388+0000)\n>\n> Well Zacs isn't particularly good if the enemy jungler has Rangers Trailblazer as well the enemy usually don't have much else to use smite on then killing Zacs blobs\n> \n> Let's see for Zac's blobs to be able to survive smite and only smite he needs to have more then 4000 health and for the blob which is targeted by the smite to survive Zac needs to have more then 8000 health\n\nIt isn't meant to be a game changer.
