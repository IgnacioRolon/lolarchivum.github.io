His Q has high damage, and when the changes were proposed for PBE, it would’ve had no CD and could dish out continuous damage. I couldn’t test it, but decided to theorize and test with what I could. I had one match where the only AD item I built early on was a Death’s Dance, then a Dead Man’s and Spirit Visage, and still dealt good damage, not to mention healing a lot more. Granted, mileage may vary based on matchup and rank, but he still felt like he dealt good damage, especially in a meta where people just don’t build much defense.\n\n> What else you gonna say? Tell an AD to build njnja tabi and randuins?\n\nI’m honestly not sure what point you are trying to make here. Many ADs build Ninja Tabi if necessary, and Randuin’s is a good situational buy on champs that need the defense, particularly bulky builds like for tanks, Juggernauts, and some divers. The health and armor is nice, the Attack Speed slow is handy against ADCs, the slow active helps you stick to champs, and then reduction of crit damage. It’s a solid buy for a champ that may want defensive items. I would absolutely suggest defensive items to champions, especially one that helps them stay with their target.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-03-21T15:57:21.027+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a main of both versions, and honestly I like this change if it means more power can be adjusted to the kit at the sacrifice of a GA.

Those guys can cover Aatrox weaknesses through a team comp, but it's the ONLY way to do so. I've seen tons of pro Aatrox footage and it's staggering just how much help Aatrox needs, and how little help he gives in return. I don't for one second think the player is bad, I think it's an awesome player making a very bad champion \"do ok\" at best.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-03-21T23:21:06.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A very bad champion wouldn't be even picked on pro play, not even once as it happens to the actual bad champions.\n\nHowever, I dont have a hate boner for Aa trust me, I wish he ends up as reworked Irelia: a champ that right now it's average on soloQ and played time to time on pro play.\n\nReverting Aa nerfs just like that would make him busted again, he needs a major tweak, I dont know if what they are going to do is going to make him easier to balance, but sure it's a more creative try and has more chances than plain buffs or nerfs that wont ever fix his flawled design.","replies":[{"poster":"Mavëríck","date":"2019-03-22T19:23:23.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir Saltarin,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QHvwUg3s,comment-id=000d000100000000,timestamp=2019-03-21T23:21:06.467+0000)\n>\n> A very bad champion wouldn't be even picked on pro play, not even once as it happens to the actual bad champions.\n> \n> However, I dont have a hate boner for Aa trust me, I wish he ends up as reworked Irelia: a champ that right now it's average on soloQ and played time to time on pro play.\n> \n> Reverting Aa nerfs just like that would make him busted again, he needs a major tweak, I dont know if what they are going to do is going to make him easier to balance, but sure it's a more creative try and has more chances than plain buffs or nerfs that wont ever fix his flawled design.\n\nOld Aatrox only became busted because the meta shifted around him and happened to favor him heavily. When New Aatrox hit the scene his Q damage was simply too high. All they had to do to tweak him and balance him was reduce the damage on that Q and leave everything else alone. Champions having mobility is clearly not an issue with Riot or less champions would have it. \n\nPeople raged at Newtrox without thinking about what he had that was so OP. He was designed to fall off in the late game, but dominate early, and that's exactly what he did, but way too well. He was able to dominate early because of the insane damage on his Q, especially early. From what I recall it scaled pretty hard with modest AD as well. This allowed his E healing to leech off minions and monsters and he was oppressive. \n\n\n\nWhat's the correct balance decision there?\n\nTo a sane person you'd simply reduce the scaling on his Q and try it out. Make him have to work harder for that early game advantage he NEEDS to claim to shut down his lane opponent. Still a bit too strong? Reduce the healing on his E by a couple percent. Make it so he can't just Q you and a chunk of your hp bar is gone. Make him have to commit to an assault or think twice.\n\nThis is what Riot SAID they wanted to do, and they succeeded, just they as usual went too far and now he's fucking garbage. To them the \"correct\" balancing move was removing his mobility, his damage, and his healing while also reducing his bases across the board... what. the fuck.\n\nThere was no compensation or reasoning beyond \"We want Aatrox to not be played for awhile\". They flat out said on twitter this was the intent. This just leads me to believe they are incompetent more than I already did. \n\nPros picking him up is one thing, they are truly good players with team coordination. If people would REALLY look at pro play Aatrox games right now they'd be able to see how useless he is in team fights. If enemy teams were smart they'd fucking ignore Aatrox and instead they cower at a champion that can't take even one of them past lane phase... it's sad. Nobody wants to acknowledge the evidence right in front of them and they say \"Aatrox is fiiiiine\". Cept he's not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-03-21T21:07:20.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wellcome to 100%ban if that goes through....","replies":[]},{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-03-21T19:01:57.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, so he gets a free awakened dragon passive when he r's.....NO","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperTopLFBottom","date":"2019-03-21T12:49:40.069+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":10,"body":"Let's just revert aatrox so the people who enjoy him can have fun with the game. \n\nThis is a joke now.
