with 4 dragons will almost always win\" thats kinda the point. Its also a self fulfilling prophecy, the team that kills more dragons is more likely to win just because of map control required to take 4 dragons, the buffs are largely irrelevant to this.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-11-26T19:23:00.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They changed the goal of the game from \"kill the enemy nexus\" to \"take dragons\". \n\nThat's kind of a fundamental flaw with the changes.\n\nAlso, map control is rarely the leading factor.

They don't nerf Drake buffs or Dragon souls or Herald Damage, they remove gold from Drake, which is actually ONE MORE STEP to avoid comebacks.\n\nYou're buying all of their lies and you make a war of the poor between laners and junglers.\n\nIf they really wanted to avoid snowballs they would have made the opposite changes to the exp across the map and to jungle in particular. Make Dragons twice as hard to take so they're always a team effort and there is ACTUAL TIME TO CONTEST THEM. Reduce the exp gap between roles so anyone can fight anyone instead of relying on mid to do everything, reduction of solo lane exp would also reduce how much you behind if you get ganked and miss 2-3 minion waves. Nerf Dragon Souls, nerf Herald damage. Make the jungle slower, less safe but more rewarding so ganking really becomes a tradeoff.\n\nThey lie to you people!
