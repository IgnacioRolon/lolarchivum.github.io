If your connection encounters an issue on any node (hop) on the way to the server, it can result in packet loss or latency spikes. Local network configuration can also impact your connection, so a good place to start is by going through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your settings are compatible with League.\n\nIf you still see issues after following the steps outlined in the guide, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
