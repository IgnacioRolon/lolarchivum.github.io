I can't remember which patch specifically right at this moment, but the Victory Screen was updated to force people out after about 10 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"72952233DEL1","date":"2017-08-19T21:03:24.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really annoying though; the music doesn't reach it's epic climax before cutting off. It feels like the reward of victory is being taken away from me. If it's going to cut off, there's no point in having music there at all. Listening to the music was one of the most satisfying parts of winning. It's like, basking in the awesomeness of the game I just played. Now, it just abruptly ends and it sucks :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Flying Toaster","date":"2017-08-19T12:36:41.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is because of new honor system cuz if u didn't press continue then your honor time will pass and u wouldn't get time to honor...
