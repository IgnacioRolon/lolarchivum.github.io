I could copy-paste you my huge story about it that I sent to Riot already, but I don't want to waste your precious time ^^\n\nName of the Club: Onii-chans Little Sisters\nClub Tag: Nyanâ„¢\nOriginal Creator name: Kuroneko\n\nIn short; I created this club months ago, with a few 12~ people in it, then it disappeared some day (I thought), but later I found out some guy from the club still had the tag and I asked him HOW?! Apperently when a bug happened from riot's end, he claimed he was the only one left in the club somehow.\n\nHere's some proof of him saying it was a bug or something:\n \nhttp://puu.sh/szOL6/192264610a.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/szOPn/db5d2bf2a8.jpg\n\n\nSo, with a lot of back and forths, Riot Support claims, and I quote: \"After further investigation it seems that \"Input Username\" is indeed the club creator- therefore I am unable to transfer ownership without his request.\"\n\nHearing this was sad, since I created the club, so how can Riot claim that HE created the club? I assume that when the clubs went down or something, he was the only one left in the club for some reason (I don't know this guy, just invited him cos he liked the club tag and I'm nice) All MY friends were kicked from the club at this time as well. So I think he RE-MADE the club somehow? I don't know, but according to Riot Support I'm NOT the original creator, which is just not true..\n\nI'm sure you guys from the club team can see that the original creator was indeed me! \"Kuroneko\"\n\n\nRiot Support is REAAALLY * me in the butt. You're my last hope, they keep lying to me. Claiming that I didn't create the club.\n\nBut look here:\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rlsG5/5a4335d5a9.jpg\n\n\nThat icon was gifted on 23/09/16, and I was already in the club (see bottom left)\n\nRiot is claiming someone ELSE made this club LATER after that, how is that possible? Riot Support is lying to me or there's a huge bug that happened. I'm very sad and frustrated since I'm a very sincere person and I keep getting shot down by everyone from Riot Games Support.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T04:03:36.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Clubs issues that occurred over the last few months were certainly an inconvenience, and it looks like it was equally difficult for you.

This is the 4th time they tell me this bullshit, can you please pull some strings? These ppl don't read my ticket well enough or something, doesn't take a genius to figure out that I in fact created this club. I'm soooo pissed off. I can't stay calm anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroneko","date":"2016-12-07T04:35:47.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I appreciate the reply, but sadly Riot Support has made up their mind and starting ignoring my ticket. (it has been many days)\n\nI made a 3rd one today, but they're too convinced of their database (which bugged out last month), and are unwilling to look at the facts I provide.\n\nThank's for understanding my frustration. I've seen Riot Porocles help people out with clubs in this thread: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/oc7O5QIE-club-has-disappeared\n\nMaybe you could message him about me, he didn't reply to my post in days either :(","replies":[]}]}]}
