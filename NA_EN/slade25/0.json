Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the armies of Shurima to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity.","url":"https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/renekton/","image":"https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Renekton_0.jpg"},"up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, was reading Renekton&#039;s lore today, and in the second sentence of the fifth paragraph, it says invaders landed on the SOUTHERN coast and invaded the city of Zuretta. I decided to head over to the map and check it out; however, assuming the map is your usual top is north, bottom is south style map, Zuretta is near the NORTHERN coast. Is it an error or am I missing something?","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-11-27T23:33:17.081+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've been aware of this curious inconsistency for a while now. \n\nJust putting it out there, one of the conceptual/draft versions of the Runeterra map indicated a city called \"Old Zuretta\" which is in fact somewhere south-ish. But, and pretty big but, this hasn't been officially canonized yet. So its difficult to tell what Narrative's intention with this will be. At this time being it's definitely an error in Renek's bio.\n\nThere is a chance, albeit low, that sometime in the future Renketon could have his bio re-updated, just to fix any kinks or small inconsistencies that exist. As over the last year or two, a lot of new world building has been established and sometimes it doesn't quite align completely. Example: Ryze's bio was re-updated recently as originally it suggested he was witness to the destruction of Icathia, whereas now he wasn't even born until long after the city was consumed.

It would still technically be the southern coast of the river. Yes, this is not a great way to resolve the issue, but it's just the way I choose to see it until something is changed.","replies":[]}]}
