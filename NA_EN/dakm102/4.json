Much like Bakuryu I also have a few questions:\n\n1. Who is going to be playing what role (as Shiphtur/Scarra/Voy are all mid primaries with Dyrus/QT being Top/Jg, and including secondaries that still leaves us with no clear support of the group)?\n2. How much $ did it take to convince all of them to \"un-retire\"?\n3. Are they effectively going to be limiting their streams now that they're all on a team together?","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-06-02T21:33:47.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I. \nShiphtur - has to be the mid not because he's a god tier mid but because he's not that type of player that seems to peel, or create but instead is more KDA focus, scared, and really just a passive player.  We've seen him and QT play before on DIG 2014 and he was decent at mid but was more of a  ( hold tower, go even, don't die) I can't see him play anything else on the team. \n\nDyrus - Out of the group has to go top mainly because of this team actually wants to be more \"team focused\" he's the more team focused player between he and Voy.  Voy would just sit top all game and split push and in real LCS games, scrims etc that's something more times than not goes poorly.  \n\nVoyboy - Jungle, he can focus on him and gank whenever.  That type of playstyle fits Voy to the letter. \n\nQT/Scarra- Pretty obvious between the players on who needs to go where but Scarra support in my mind will be more around that AP mages(Veigar, Lulu, Morg) type of style the more shred and poke more than anything. \n\nII. -III.\n  And that's the real question here ain't it; are they just mercs for hire?  What is Echo Fox's plans on this, if it's just a \"scrim\" partners then I don't see much benefit from this honestly, teams go to Korea year after year and seem to get a \"tiny\" bit better, but overall doesn't really mean all that much and do they think it's going to make the current EF team be that much better ?\n  \n  I personally do enjoy this myself with the way Rick Fox is going with this also, and it goes hand in hand with the whole guaranteed a spot.  If EF are say 0-12 with 6 game series left, at least they can keep fans on their side with the whole Twitch fan followers of Dyrus, QT, Voy etc and 1 out of 2 isn't bad in the long run if they do become a bottom feeding tier team in which with their current roster they will most likely will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2017-06-03T00:00:53.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=III BAKURYU III ,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=V5AaKgGu,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2017-06-02T21:33:47.777+0000)\n>\n> II. -III.\n>   And that&#x27;s the real question here ain&#x27;t it; are they just mercs for hire?  What is Echo Fox&#x27;s plans on this\n\nPublicity, plain and simple\nThat's the plan\n\nCS was becoming useless for them this split because with franchising their CS team rostre performance wouldn't matter at all\nAt the top of CS, there is going to be a final push to get promoted by the few decent orgs actually in CS that would remain out of the final cut when franchising happen and being in a better position when Riot will review the applications for LCS franchises (either get into LCS or at least receive a relevant amount of money for being forced to give up their spot), and Delta Fox couldn't be part of promotion tournament anyway\nAnd if they finish at the bottom, it would just not matter because CS is going to disappear and be replaced by the \"Academy\" league made by the Academy/sister/back-up squad of LCS teams so next split they will be playing that league regardless\n\nIn Challenger this split there is almost no young talent playing, aside from CLG Black and some spare players, and they doesn't had enough young players to push through\n\nSo Echo Fox decided that they could use this useless split for them to justexpand their brand, and what better way than to recruit the most famous ex-pro streamers? Echo Fox just get in a ton of publicity through this deal, those streamers get to play in a semi-competitive environment for fun one last time, and they can get some extra tips on training (the main scrim partners will be their subs, aka the former Delta Fox roste + veterans mash and Feng, but some suggestion from former high level pros after some scrim here and there can't be detrimental)","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-06-03T00:04:49.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, I mean that's what I'm taking out of this Echo Fox idea to please the fans of the brand and to get attention.

Had DIG got LirA, they could have tried to challenge for top 4, but I do not have faith in their current environment\n\nThe things about Froggen are just wrong. There was that statistical analysis article/video that showed that Froggen was top 3 mid in NA, and he has been carried EF pretty heavily every split in NA to safety despite not good teammates\n\"even before joining NA he had 1 good EU split 2014 Summer for the bulk of his career\"\nLmao no, CLG.EU was a legendary team and EG was pretty decent too. Alliance was good for the entire 2014, it just peaked in Summer + the perfect game vs Koreans at Worlds before being Kabummed because of Wickd/Shook tilting off the face of earth and never recovering even after the rebranding in the subsequent split\n\nEF real problem was Looper that was really underwhelming, not being able to carry in lane and being generally bad in teamfight, BUT he seemd to do some small kind of improvement towards the end of the split, and improving some more would be enough for EF to not repat their struggles.\n\nI had EF 8th in my prdicitons, and I think they will stay there, with NV and one team underperforming ending behind them, and the only team I see in that range are either TL or DIG, and I think there are more chance of TL rebounding rather than DIG improving...I mean, their upgrade from last split is going to be...Big aka baby?
