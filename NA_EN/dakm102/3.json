As for me, while I don't mind seeing some competition, flaming another when you're a loser as well just doesn't feel fine to me. NA and EU, especially the teams, should really cooperate more - it seems that otherwise we won't ever topple the overlords.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-10-25T20:57:08.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say the top team from each region didn't do as well as they were expected.

That's a good sign really as it means a few things:\n\n1. EU and NA are getting on par with everyone else.\n2. The infrastructure of competitive LoL is rounding out which should lead to closer games for everyone in the future.\n3. Wildcard teams like ANX will continue to have \"surprise\" showings as they adapt the same infrastructure, which will always make international events more fun to watch.\n\nCombine that with H2K making it far into the tourney and NA having some really good games (despite not being able to close a couple key games out when they needed to) has made this year's Worlds a joy to watch. I don't think it's going to be 4-5 years before other regions can compete with KR like some people say, it's gap is closing pretty fast when you actually look at the metrics and analyze the games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSequelsRBad","date":"2016-10-23T15:02:16.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate NA vs EU.

I am interested in overall strength rankings. Therefore i have always viewed how far a region gets in a tournament. By that metric EU did better this worlds than NA. On last MSI it was the other way around.\n\nNow if someone cares more about the NA vs EU stuff, then yes, you look at head to head games (not at the tournament as a whole).","replies":[]}]}]}
