She wasn't reworked into being that strong, she was buffed into being that strong.\n\nTo some extent.  The way I see it, Riot released a Cass rework that was hopelessly undertuned.  Then they did a mini-rework on that rework, with a new passive design and a new poison enhancement mechanic on E.  That one turned out to be hilariously overtuned.  Since then, they made a further nerf and now she's reasonable.\n\nI think this clearly could have been handled better by the balance guys, but it's a B- sort of performance.\n\n> As to the high skill cap thing.. I disagree with your assessment, but I suppose that's an opinionated argument.\n\nIt's controversial.  Let me outline my view on it.\n\n1. Some champions scale better with skill than other champions.  This seems fairly clear -- a really good Garen isn't as much better than an average Garen as a really good Lee Sin is from an average Lee Sin.\n2. I want the game to be balanced for competitive play.  To me, if a champion is balanced when everyone plays correctly, but too strong when people make tons of mistakes, the solution to that is the player making mistakes improving.\n3. If a champion scales well with skill, and should be balanced in competitive play, we should expect them to be weaker at lower elos than champions who do not scale as well with skill.\n\nIn practice, you can see many examples of this pattern in the current game balance.  Some low win rate champions are just undertuned; often intentionally so because Riot regrets the kit design.  However, there is also a class of low win rate champions that are actually quite strong, just not in the hands of an average solo queue player.

Low elo players aren't so much unskilled as they are bad at strategy. \nAs such, the mechanics of a champion don't determine or justify their win rate as well as one would think. What is more important is the decisions that the player has to make. (Janna has a MUCH higher win rate in diamond than in bronze. She isn't mechanically intensive so much as she is strategically intensive though.) \n\nProfessional play brings this to an altogether different level though. Through communication, they are able to perform strategies that are not viable in solo queue. Similarly, strategies that capitalize on the enemy's lack of communication are not as viable.\nI believe that THIS is the reason that champions like Zed and LeBlanc have much more popularity in competitive play than their win rates in Diamond Solo Queue would suggest. Their ability to \"undo\" a mistake is invaluable, as it makes them difficult to catch out, even by a coordinated team. Similarly, their mobility allows for them to always follow up the plays that their team is making.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-21T02:40:22.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PentaJump,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tmm101QE,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-21T02:05:52.033+0000)\n>\n> First of all, I believe that statistics seem to disprove the idea that high skill-cap champions perform significantly better when played by skilled players. \n\nI need to clarify here.  I'm not talking about high skill cap champions.  I think skill cap isn't being reached, even by really strong players, and therefore isn't so interesting to discuss.  When I say a champion is \"high skill\", I mean that the marginal returns on increasing skill are higher than the average champion.\n\nFor example, Vel'koz has a high skill cap, but he doesn't actually scale with increasing skill all that fast.  You can totally do well with him without doing anything special.  Meanwhile, Fizz absolutely falls on his face unless you are using his kit outplay the opponent on a regular basis.  This is true even though Vel'koz probably has more skill cap in his kit than Fizz does.\n\nLet me mention that solo queue win rate is not so interesting to me, even high elo.  We don't balance basketball around pickup games.  It's also a noisy metric, because players are terrible at picking champions.  For example, Lee Sin has a famously low win rate across all elos, even in diamond, because many players pick him when they can't handle him.  That doesn't mean Lee is a low skill champion or that he's a weak champion.\n\n> Low elo players aren't so much unskilled as they are bad at strategy. \n\nThis is an interesting conjecture.  I'm not totally convinced it's true, but it might be.  I didn't really intend to separate aspects of skill in this discussion.\n\n> As such, the mechanics of a champion don't determine or justify their win rate as well as one would think. What is more important is the decisions that the player has to make. (Janna has a MUCH higher win rate in diamond than in bronze. She isn't mechanically intensive so much as she is strategically intensive though.) \n\nI certainly agree that there is much more to skill than kit mechanics.  Also, Janna is a good example of a high skill champion that nonetheless doesn't have a particularly high skill cap.\n\n> I believe that THIS is the reason that champions like Zed and LeBlanc have much more popularity in competitive play than their win rates in Diamond Solo Queue would suggest. Their ability to \"undo\" a mistake is invaluable, as it makes them difficult to catch out, even by a coordinated team. Similarly, their mobility allows for them to always follow up the plays that their team is making.\n\nI'm not sold.  I think the possibility of undoing a mistake is probably more valuable in an environment where more mistakes are made.  I agree that mobility enables more reliable follow ups, but I also think that players like Faker and Bjergsen draw LeBlanc and Zed bans primarily because of their solo kill potential.\n\nI think that Zed and LeBlanc simply have kits that scale better with player skill than most other mids.  Very few solo queue players, even in diamond, have the ability to get appropriate value out of these kits; but when you hit one in solo queue, you feel it very strongly.","replies":[{"poster":"PentaJump","date":"2015-02-21T15:30:24.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tmm101QE,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-21T02:40:22.932+0000)\n\n> I'm not sold.

For example, a couple enemies may be MIA. The engage is done off of the hope that they aren't able to join the fight within a very short period of time. Now, if they do join the fight, then the fight will be lost.\nIn solo queue, everyone is on a different page. Maybe the ideal strategy at this point is for everyone to retreat. But how do you know that your allies will retreat just because you try to? If your allies don't run away with you, it might be better for you to just fight until you run out of HP. \nIn the pro scene, everyone is on the same page. \"Retreat\" can be a team decision that is made in the middle of a fight. Because of this, champions that are actually capable of retreating are valued more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-02-20T23:35:31.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tmm101QE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-20T21:15:00.540+0000)\n>\n> Win rates mostly show whether a champion is easy to play.
