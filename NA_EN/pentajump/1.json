I'm not quite sure about the W change, but it probably won't be too much worse than Akali's E if you build a Gunblade. I wouldn't really build any other AD on her though.\n\nThe big problem here is that Lichbane doesn't apply spell vamp nor life steal, and Kat won't have any single target spells after they remove the damage on her shunpo, so the only thing that'll fully proc spell vamp for her is the mark on her Q. I'm not sure if that makes Gunblade worth it, even with the W nerf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-20T06:35:29.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, if they're going to go through with this, they'll have to change her W and R to do physical damage otherwise she'll just be another WW and Evelynn where they build AD and still end up doing more magic damage than physical.
