Majority voted a champion you don't like?

If you dodge twice and are seriously considering trolling if you won't get a champion you like, I suggest either getting a premade set up or playing normal SR if you can't handle the featured game mode that shouldn't be taken too seriously.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RawrAturtle","date":"2015-10-18T04:35:10.257+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand,\nI was playing with one of my friends, who was low level, and he really wanted to play ekko.\nHe got lucky with the lottery pick, however the others were complaining that they didn't want to play him.\nSo, during the laning phase, against ezreal, our team didn't do well except for mid.\nThey kept spamming surrender at every time they could. however i always pressed no because i was carrying, with a quadra kill.\nHowever after 30 mins in the game, they sold all their items for troll items.\nMe and my friend were basically the only ones trying, however my friend got tired of the trolls and surrendered, leaving me the only one saying no.\nIts just ridiculous how childish the match was and how we would of won if we worked together instead of trolling .:c\nHere's the match:\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1981391800/228693290?tab=overview","replies":[]},{"poster":"Owntrolf","date":"2015-10-18T03:49:03.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove majority rules\nI hate that crap and it makes me want to feed\n\nat least make it actually like a goddamn gamble of \n60%/40%\n60%/20%/20%\n80%/20%","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-10-18T01:04:14.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think I fell asleep while playing a game of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-10-17T22:44:39.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yup it sucks :/ ive gotten people that threw the game cause we didnt go tahm kench, like seriously tahm kench isnt even fun or good in the game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2015-10-17T22:59:49.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, with teamwork, Team Kench is terrifying.
