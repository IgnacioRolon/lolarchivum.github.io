This allows for some pretty lame gameplay where Ekko can hold off on leveling his ult until he gets into the thick of a fight, then immediately pop it. I think this is dumb, and I think the clone should immediately begin following Ekko (it should still be 4 seconds behind). \n\nOne person suggested that if the ult followed him 4 seconds, then Ekko could just walk up to someone, walk away, and then rank ult and detonate, but I think this is much less unappealing since Ekko:\n\n1. Has to go back to wherever he was. While the opponents will be taken by surprise by his sudden reappearance, it is unlikely \"back 4 seconds\" is going to be the best place for him.\n2. Has no guarantee that the enemy will still be where he was 4 seconds ago before ranking the ult, making his surprise ult useless\n3. Is guaranteed a way more interesting interaction with his ult (surprise, I&#039;m back in your face!) than just using it as free AOE nuke in a fight.\n\nI think the current implementation allows for a really lame interaction, something that I know Ekko was not designed to have, as the philosophy behind his ult being so powerful is that it is so difficult to use.\n\nThoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-23T04:48:59.612+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're with you on both the problem and the solution. Ekko's ult actually got changed to function that way (when you first level up the ult the time clone appears where Ekko was 4 seconds ago) a couple of days ago, so this won't be a problem once he gets released.","replies":[{"poster":"Matt The Hero","date":"2015-05-23T04:52:44.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Glad to hear!
