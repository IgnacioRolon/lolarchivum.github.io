(i hope i dont see \"dont minimize league\" answers)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T18:39:39.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't currently support 4K, and I could see alt+tabbing out of the game could scale your cursor to your desktop resolution.  The best fix for this may be to switch from fullscreen mode to borderless.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Artistlol","date":"2016-08-20T23:42:36.209+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well unfortunately, borderless mode covers less than 1/4 of the screen at 900p resolution.. is there any way to make it borderless and to cover the entire screen without having to drop the desktop resolution down? (as other games like overwatch does have borderless that covers entire screen even at lower resolution than what the desktop is)","replies":[]}]}]}
