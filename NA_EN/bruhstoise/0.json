Once I'd left, no reconnect option came up like normal so i checked my recent games and the match doesnt even exist, like its not there at all. Its just gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-03T17:08:18.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this recent or overnight?

I don't know if the game I was in ended, I tried to reconnect but there was not even a match record, so my guess is that the game is running? but now I am on another game :I\n\nEdit: the match never appeared. Another thing that was weird in the vanished match, is that when I used tab for checking on people's builds, it only showed the first teammate on the list but the rest was empty. I don't know that it has anything to do with the problem though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Makior72","date":"2017-05-03T16:36:01.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude same thing just happened to me, I'm sitting here wondering if I'm gonna get leaver bustered or something cause I left the game after sitting at that reconnect screen for 3 mins without reconnecting, to try to reconnect manually, but there wasn't anything for me to try to reconnect to.","replies":[]}]}
