Teaching hardstuck gold and plat players what it's like to be in high elo is the first step to turning bad players into good players.\r\n\r\nSee, in spite of Riot's claims that only 0.006% of all players have ever been permanently banned, that real statistic is probably closer to 15% of all current League players have been permabanned at some point.\r\n\r\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bt1kgr/poll_have_you_ever_been_banned_from_league_of/\r\n\r\nIt's not a scientific study, but it's a general survey of the active League community about 7 months ago. Accounting for some error, we can be reasonably conservative by saying about 15% of all players have been permanently banned at some point.\r\n\r\nBut what's the remission rate of permanently banned players? Surely only a tiny, tiny percent every get banned a secon- No, 57% of all permabanned players get permabanned again. Lmao. So much for players learning their lesson.\r\n\r\n2% of the entire league community has been banned on 10+ accounts. That's kind of funny. With 17 banned accounts I'm not even in the 1% at 20+ banned accounts yet. Yikes.\r\n\r\nWhy does Riot not show the actual statistics? Probably because it highlights just how toxic Riot's punishment system is and the fact that at any time, almost 1/5 players will have their accounts basically deleted.\r\n\r\nNow, why does this happen? Shouldn't players learn from their mistakes and see the error of their ways? Well, that's not how it works. You see. Riot employs a very, very simple bot that looks at your chat. Picks out restricted words and the volume of your chat (anything more than 5 to 10 lines of chat is usually enough to set it off) and then checks to see if someone on your team reported you. Key being someone on your team, because no matter how much you report an enemy, it won't do anything because you might be reporting them for beating you in lane.\r\n\r\nIf these criteria are met, then your account gets suspended. Most banned players usually don't find their bannings fair or rational in any human capacity. Usually because they're not and any normal human that is reading the chat logs in context would understand that usually the person getting banned is not at fault for anything. Riot is wrong to ban these people and they want vindication. So they turn to the forums for help, which the white knights of the forums who defend Riot to the death and will staunchly lynch anyone who has anything critical to say about their overlords and chalk it up to \"you must be in the wrong because Riot banned you\" and thus, resentment is born.\r\n\r\nResentment not only for Riot's flawed system and unjust bans, but resentment against the community of entitled children who covet grand delusions of a perfect company, conveniently blocking out the multiple harassment lawsuits or labor violations from employees. You know, anything that makes their perfect game developer look as bad as they really are. You can't cover up shit with millions of dollars in fancy songs and VFX and it not still be shit, although Riot is certainly trying.\r\n\r\nAnd so, that lad who thought that Zed simply needed to know how bad he really was, is now a beacon of toxicity who will make a new account or buy them (like a normal person does) and feels even less remorse for telling the next bad player in his game what he's really feeling. Each and every account compounding into a well-honed instrument of flame.\r\n\r\nHere we are. 17 accounts. And here's to 17 more. I'll have a little celebration when I hit 20 accounts and another one when I hit 23 accounts to commemorate surpassing the late, great Tyler1, may he rest in peace. Who's legacy bore the rise of 22 permabanned accounts over the years.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not some unreasonable, hellish guise of a man who sits on the internet borne only to spew hate and vitriol. I'm not known to be impatient or even generally a mean spirited or standoffish person. I don't search the waters to procure a list of grievances like a Boomer hunting for a reason to kick and scream like a toddler for a discount on their $7 combo meal from McDonalds. I'm not sad or depressed or even harbor any internal chagrin that influences my behavior. I don't hold grudges or even remember people's names or faces 5 seconds after meeting them, especially online.\r\n\r\nI'm just like anyone else. Someone you might even know. Hell, we might even be friends and you have no idea. Someone pleasant to talk to with a quick wit and sharp tongue who doesn't mind a bit of banter. But that's what scares people around here. They want to pretend every toxic person on the internet is some horrid, sad shell of a human being who lives their lives in a shadow of malice and spite, searching for any reason to belittle or mock someone.\r\n\r\nIn reality, me, like most other \"toxic\" players in League, are just quick to speak our minds. If we have a problem, we'll let you know and then we've already forgotten about it. We deal with our problems the moment their pop up and then we're done. We don't let you know in the nicest way all the time, nor are we obligated to. Sometimes we'll call you a \"fucking idiot\" and should expect you to have the common sense to understand what we mean. But the key point is that once we air our grievances, we already feel better.\r\n\r\nSee, the real toxic people isn't us, who get our problems off of our chest immediately and then let it go. It's the people like the bulk of the forums and twitter who hear these criticisms and latch onto them, letting them fester and grow into hatred. If I tell you to stop playing like an idiot, it's probably because you're playing like an idiot. You let these words consume you for hours after a game is over. And there's truly nothing more toxic than someone who holds petty grudges over criticism.\r\n\r\nThe person who latches onto every word or subtext and lets it build up into a festering cyst of malignant rancor. That's the truly toxic person. The toxic little shit who spams report on everyone who doesn't bow and praise them.\r\n\r\nAnd you will never, ever hear me feel sorry for driving away players like that. I consider it a public service and hope people continue quitting League because of me. Because if my flame offends you so horrendously, then maybe the memes about kids these days not being able to handle Xbox Live lobbies is right.\r\n\r\nMaybe you shouldn't be playing games online.\r\n\r\nMaybe just uninstall the game.\r\n\r\n- Pennywise :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-12-29T15:47:16.360+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As the OP has made it clear they're not interested in a genuine discussion, this thread has been locked.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation Team via:\n\n* The [**NA Boards Discord**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n* The [**Discuss the Boards**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) sub-board\n\n~ Ulanopo","replies":[]},{"poster":"ï¬‚oo","date":"2019-12-29T11:04:24.588+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why does Riot not show the actual statistics?

People are going to dislike each other because of different character traits. The hypocrisy of this whole situation is while you're insisting that you're getting demonized you choose to demonize others.\n\nThe opinion that you should be allowed to insult others in league games at your leisure is just that. An opinion.\n\nWhen you boil it down, the ultimate decision is with Riot and will remain with Riot. And there's nothing here that is likely to change that decision. If you can't accept their ruling, well, you're free to not play or accept that you might be held responsible for breaking the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"duvey","date":"2019-12-29T10:15:20.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VhAAKnVB,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-29T10:01:49.182+0000)\n> If you can't accept their ruling, well, you're free to not play or accept that you might be held responsible for breaking the rules.\n\nI don't recall ever begging to be unbanned or complaining that my bans were unjust.

League is not going to be less team-orientated any time soon so this isn't going to change. The negative affects of people acting like assholes wont change either.\n\nIn the end Riot is presented with people who are actively driving away customers with their behavior alone. Changing the tension of the game isn't an feasible option because it's the game type that makes it tense. Letting those players run loose unrestricted isn't an option either because that would just cause the game to hemorrhage players, many more than perma-bans would push away.\n\nSo once it gets to the point where Riot believes a player wont behave themselves no matter what punishment is issued, it's time to start encouraging them to go elsewhere.\n\nThe best method Riot has is to perma-ban the account, losing all progress and content accumulated on it. Does this prevent a player from coming back? No, of course not. But it does discourage some players from coming back because not everyone is willing to start from scratch yet again after spending a lot of time unlocking things, knowing that it can easily happen again if they behave the same way they did before.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-12-29T12:43:39.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you grow up a bit you'll realize what a waste of your own time this was","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrenchDragoon23","date":"2019-12-29T09:53:26.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"You can legit get 5 botted accounts for 10 dollars all level 30.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FrenchDragoon23","date":"2019-12-29T09:44:14.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"There is insults and there are times you just need to grow a thicker skin, feeling harrassed by mere words show how fragile you really are.","replies":[{"poster":"duvey","date":"2019-12-29T09:47:27.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Couldn't have said it better myself.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2019-12-29T11:02:27.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what are you trying to get out of this entire wall of text again?

When any little swear or criticism is met with uproarious spite and everyone immediately labels that person as \"toxic\" then you lump them into a larger collection of many groups of people. People they're now more likely to associate with since they've effectively become a pariah.\n\nThe person won't hate being called \"toxic\", they'll hate the person calling them toxic. And they'll take that spite and turn it into ownership. They'll command toxicity like a badge as much as I do because now they don't care about the opinions of the community. They're already outside of it.\n\nAnd once you, as a game developer, make your players stop caring about their community, that's when their inhibitions are dropped. That's the point where someone who just got heated during a game turns into a truly toxic player who honestly doesn't care about the other 9 players in the game.\n\nAn avalanche of toxic players because of a broken system that labeled them toxic in the first place. 2 or 3 toxic players in the same game have now bred resentment of the community in the other players in the game, slowly but surely their opinions growing more and more hateful. Then to the point where, without even being banned, resent the community as much as the toxic players do. And now they too have become toxic.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle that keeps repeating and won't stop unless Riot takes ownership of their failures and fixes their system.\n\nBut I kind of doubt Riot would ever do that. Riot has never admitted to any current mistake. They always talk about their \"mistakes\" in an abstract sense. Something way in the distant past but painting a portrait of how they're currently doing everything right.

You yourself are saying that only two kinds of people really happen on forums, the white knights and the people with problems, do you see how that might slant the numbers a bit?","replies":[{"poster":"duvey","date":"2019-12-29T09:51:25.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Again, you're ignoring the way people browse Reddit and yes, the way you traverse a feed is much different from perusing a specific game forum for conversations you want to join.\n\nIn Reddit, you can have any subreddit from any game or hobby or interest that you might have.

Sure, but the fact that there is a mix of both organically engaged people and people driven by some passion, means the statistics are likely much fairer there than they would be here. You have no organically drawn people here.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-12-29T10:26:23.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=duvey,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VhAAKnVB,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-29T09:51:25.328+0000)\n>\n> Again, you're ignoring the way people browse Reddit and yes, the way you traverse a feed is much different from perusing a specific game forum for conversations you want to join.\n> \n> In Reddit, you can have any subreddit from any game or hobby or interest that you might have.

You are right, I don't fully understand how Reddit works, but I'm fairly sure you have to search for a trail of thing that match your interest whether they are positive or not, and talking about one's punishment is USUALLY reserved to people either A. affected by the system at all, or B. part of the subreddit who happened upon the post as it was going by in their feeds. My point is on all sides, people don't really proclaim they are happy with things especially if it doesn't affect them nor do they not interact with them, sure people will chime in, but people aren't going to go out of their way to search for concepts that don't pertain to them, it was unlikely that that post you linked even made it to hot seeing as it only got 98 upvotes in 7 months, the numbers are gonna be skewed because of it, sample size is also kind of small, but meph?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
