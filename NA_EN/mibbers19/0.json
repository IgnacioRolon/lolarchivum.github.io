So many people in games triggered me so much and are so toxic and tell me to go kill myself. But i say go die into turret and get banned.  come on riot get permanently banned?admins this is actual bullshit. I spent 200$+ on my account and plan to spend more money on this game but i get perm b for saying go die in the turret.. This is not fair. Please look into it. I love this game and i cant afford to get perm ban for saying fuck you. This Game is off my PC and will stay that way. you just lost a good player . im 19 years old and i know how things work. but getting banned for saying go die in game as in feeding and i get permanent ban for saying that. Why? ridiculous. i don't feel like making another account. not happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-08T00:06:02.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spending money does not exempt you from the rules.\n\nYou'll likely get a better response if you head over to the Player Behavior boards and repost this with a copy of your chat logs and punishment history.","replies":[{"poster":"FNC kcal12","date":"2017-09-09T01:41:33.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Spending money does not exempt you from the rules.* ---> true, but in a way we are the investors of this game. and when you invest so much money in a company, you shouldnt be perma banned for word usage, even more when we mostly all live in a free speech country. imo be a man, suck it up and if you get *triggered* ( lol ), you can always mute. there are other ways to punish than perma ban. like banned from summoners rift, but not from aram or twisted \"does this gamemode still exist\" treeline {{champion:57}} . but i ain't in favor of those perma bans for speech abuse{{champion:37}}  .","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-09T02:47:28.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't come to League to see people flaming.\n\nI spend money on League when I enjoy the game.\n\nIf people are flaming me, I will not enjoy the game.\n\nIf I don't enjoy the game, I won't spend money on League.\n\nErgo, Riot has a vested interest in making sure the 10% or so of people who are toxic are removed from the game, so the 90% of the rest of us can keep enjoying the game.\n\nIf you can't follow the rules you agreed to (saying you could be permabanned even if you spent money), don't play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"FNC kcal12","date":"2017-09-09T10:50:34.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like i said i get it if someone is really rage-y and does nothing else but insult and curse and feed the whole time. like if he reaaaaaally puts himself in the way of hindering the game from happening. \nbut if its just a guy having a little argument with another guy for a play or two and just an insult or two are being said, and nothing else really, then there shouldnt be a perma ban","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T00:43:55.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not a whole lot I can do here from the boards for account punishments, but if you need more context on why that ban was placed you're free to reach out to our player behavior specialists in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
