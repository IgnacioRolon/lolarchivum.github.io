This is  {{champion:157}}  in a nutshell . What were you thinking? You create a &quot;luck&quot; base mechanic and a skill base mechanic and then create a champion that can throw all that in the trash. Plus u think his 600 dmg crits  at lvl 8 are balanced since he hasnt got directly nerfed this ENTIRE season. Actualy he has gotten indrectly buffed multiple times and I have not seen a enemy {{champion:157}} lose a game EVER.  I would to like know what makes you think he is fun to play agaisnt and how to play against him .","replies":[]}
