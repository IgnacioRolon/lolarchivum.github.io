Trying to reconnect issue on LoL new client","url":"https://imgur.com/a/2z6TC","image":"https://i.imgur.com/u3T7EGm.jpg?fb"},"up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error is pretty common by now, it happens to a lot of users from EUW and EUNE.\nThe fact that the error is pretty common speaks quite bad about Riot servers and its connection.\n\nThis error began happening on my client a couple of months ago, around september. In my case, this error happens just after i log in. I am describing now **Step by Step what happens** for this to happen:\n\n1. I open the client, currently updated with 7.20 version.\n2. I write my user and password and it begins to connect\n3. It automatically says that servers are experiencing a big ammount of logs and signs me on a queue to log in, but i am always the first.\n4. After a little time, the \"game\" loads and **the error is already there**. \"Trying to reconnect\"\n5. I wait some time like it suggests, and a couple of minutes later it changes to \"Failed to Reconnect\" and the only possible option is to close the client.\n\nI want to make notice of some particular things that makes clear that this error is caused by Riot Games service or client, and not my connection.\n\n* While I am on the client with the error hovering, and even for some time after I have closed the window I appear as connected for my friends; and If I close the window without waiting and they still can see me connected, I try to log in again and it keeps authenticating forever.\n* THE ERROR **EVENTUALLY FADES AWAY. If I reset this process over and over again**, at some point the error doesn't appear and I can use the game normally.\n* I have always used my current system for playing LoL, and I have not changed anything, and this kind of error never happened, even when i changed to the new client \"prematurely\".\n* **When** the light and the ancestor's spirits of demacia touch my system and **the error doesn't appear this time** I am able to play normally and I have 0 connection issues. Not even an extra milisecond on my ping or anything. Stable and strong.\n\n**EXTRA INFO**\n\n- When i close the client and the trying to reconnect time has not consumed entirely, the client process doesn't end and i have to force quit.\n- Restarting the computer doesn't fix anything :(\n- I am using wired connection, directly to my optic fiber connected router\n- I am using Riot servers DNS and I have the gates / ports open.\n- My default browser is configured to accept all the cookies (saw some users that used this and it got fixed)\n- If I reinstall the game and client, the error is still there from my first log in\n- I don't use any kind of antivirus / firewall, and the one that comes with the OS is deactivated.\n\nI am tired of seeing this same error happening to a lot of people and rioters trying to help people with their systems implying that it's a personal issue and not errors in the server. OC they try their best to help us, but idk how Riot doesn't take the bullet and accept it's a server/client problem when it is so clear. When an error happens to 10 people it may be their bug, when it happens to 100.000, something is wrong.\n\nI guess and hope this issue is being worked on actually, and that this post helps to find it.\nOver.\n\nEdit: Added some things I forgot.","replies":[{"poster":"JąČk JąČk","date":"2018-03-23T11:03:07.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same problem for almost 10 months.

This is because League is always online, and local settings or network instability can cause this as well as ISP issues failing to route to game servers properly.  To help offer some more visibility, though, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to your region's game server: 192.64.170.252.\n\nRun it for about 5 minutes, remove the IP on the first 2 rows, and let me know what you find.  This will give us a better overview of how you're routing and where the hiccup is coming from.","replies":[{"poster":"v0vvy","date":"2017-10-29T00:08:01.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't use the program because I play from Mac, but the problem seem to disappear these last days.\n\nIt doesn't happen anymore.\n\nThanks anyway, i didn't do anything but it is fine now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heimey","date":"2017-10-22T16:52:10.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a video on how to fix x\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UQPdFT2CMVY","replies":[]}]}
