If you want to be technical with that then every rank would be elo hell in that case. \nIts also not what you dont know what to build or anything its just how people dont listen all the time is what I was saying. Normally how I say it is like \"Hey ____ can you try following up more often on my skill shots? We might have an easier time getting this down if you work off the plays I try to make.\" Cause let's face it, everyone can make plays but supports do make some pretty amazing plays even in bronze. Just like how some Lee Sin can make amazing plays in bronze and do awesome but it just mostly comes down to their team and trying to convince them not to throw.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-06-26T19:13:36.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is if you don't belong in Bronze.\n\nThat's the main issue most of them face.","replies":[{"poster":"Ap Mid Burst","date":"2016-06-26T20:15:29.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EndlessSorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GTtyl5mE,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2016-06-26T19:13:36.155+0000)\n>\n> It is if you don&#x27;t belong in Bronze.\n> \n> That&#x27;s the main issue most of them face.\n\nNo, all you need it a good attitude, focus on csing and harassing, try your best to not die, and do your job every teamfight","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jesus Is My King","date":"2016-06-26T13:04:08.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no one blames anyone, tell them at the start to play safe and just dont die, and we will win. theirs no such thing as elo hell. as ive gone from B1 to B5. just to prove theirs no elo hell. i got silver today. it took about 4 weeks (work 3rd shift) \n\ntheirs no such thing as elo hell. your just bad. and thats the honest truth. you must carry yourself. and not rely on them to carry you.","replies":[{"poster":"dadimplayingrn","date":"2016-06-26T19:20:20.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The 1st Angel,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GTtyl5mE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-06-26T13:04:08.172+0000)\n>\n> no one blames anyone, tell them at the start to play safe and just dont die, and we will win. theirs no such thing as elo hell. as ive gone from B1 to B5. just to prove theirs no elo hell. i got silver today. it took about 4 weeks (work 3rd shift) \n> \n> theirs no such thing as elo hell. your just bad. and thats the honest truth. you must carry yourself. and not rely on them to carry you.\n\n\nsaying no one blames anyone is like saying the time noon is not most referred to as lunch time.... yes you can communicate with people on WHAT not to do. but it's up to them what they solely choose to do. i never said elo hell existed... >.>.. congrats on from getting those ranked, but that proves literally nothing. 4 weeks? so a month? you didn't read my post clearly. re-read it and you might get the point. but a typical one tracked mind thinking i'm just complaining about elo hell when never such was brought up till you talked about, and if i'm bad than i should have no friends that would want to play with when i can easily play with them and sometimes even carry them","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus Is My King","date":"2016-06-27T01:17:31.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your actually right, i didnt read any of it honestly. it says bronze life. so i assume elo hell, just mute everyone and do smart pings, a month is actually a decent time since i only played 2 games a day, cause i just got bored if i did more.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dowager Lewis","date":"2016-06-26T10:27:19.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love, if you get placed in: Bronze, Silver, Gold....etc. You are there for a reason.
