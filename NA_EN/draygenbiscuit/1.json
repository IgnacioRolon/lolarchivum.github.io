At first I assumed it was my internet so I upgraded it and it went from 60 ping to 53 ping, Although it did make my game run smoother, the weird lag keeps happening! Its completely random, and when it happens my FPS and Ping are the same as always but the game basically freezes and then speeds up and then I see weird stuff like minions with no health bars hitting each other while the rest of the lane is attacking a turret. Has anyone had anything similar or know what the issue is, because I would think, if It was a problem with the game, that everyone would have the issue. Also I know it isn't my computer, because I just bought a new computer 2 weeks ago. I went from 60 FPS on low to 150 FPS on high, so I highly doubt the issue would be my computer.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T20:21:47.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing those minions stick around after death to continue beating a dead minion is a pretty good sign that your connection is having some packet loss issues. Packet loss happens when parts of the data your connection is sending get lost or damaged along the way to our servers. Without all of that data intact, it can cause some preeeeetty weird stuff to happen. \n\nHit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) with the network logs from that game and let the tool scan it.
