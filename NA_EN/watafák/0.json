I'm running the LeagueClient.exe as administrator, my UAC is turned off. I also tried completely reinstalling LOL, I tried to install it to two different locations, but both times the result was the same. I also tried lowering my screen resolution, since I saw it in many forums. Any advices?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T22:01:33.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time when League won't load up correctly it's due to incorrect admin settings. Make sure to try right-clicking and launching as admin, and run through the other steps in the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) again just in case. \n\nAlso, check out something else really quickly. Launch the Task Manager and make sure all of the League processes are ended before trying to launch the client again. There might be a process leftover that's screwing with any new ones.","replies":[]}]}
