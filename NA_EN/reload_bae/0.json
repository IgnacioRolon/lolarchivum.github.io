I’m just wondering do people actually want to see some writing because I get the feeling that most of the people in the community want fanart? \r\nI really enjoy the league universe and I find it filled with space to create, I would just like to know if people would want to see some stories about their favorite champions that are fan made or if they find it boring if it’s not coming from Riot directly. I’m passionate for fiction and I love it dearly but I really want to do something for the community and not just for the people who read my writing on fiction site. I won’t give up even if the answer is no,I find twitter to be a good place to start. I’d appreciate some advice if there’s any. Thanks in advance ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"SkiptoMyLuo","date":"2020-02-05T18:28:01.621+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best advice is to write!

It won the Hugo award last year (transformative fiction category) and is growing at rapid speed. It currently hosts about 3,500 League fics.\n\nThe more popular of those can get tens of thousands of views/reads and back when my works were on it (RIP after the retcon) I'd get lots of hits (think my most popular one had 5k?), and even more surprisingly my work would get mentioned in the fandom occasionally, or get fanart every once in a while.\n\nOf course, Rioters themselves endorse fan writing. I suggest registering to Twitter and following Riot Narrative accounts. They announce flash fiction contests  once in a while, or bigger competitions, and winning one can get your work lots of weight and exposure.\n\nIn addition, there are fan-lead initiatives dedicated to fiction. The boards creative section hosts writing contests at least once a year. I suggest joining the [Concepts &amp; Creations Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/aUYGtfde-u-cc-discord-information-verification) for more info.","replies":[{"poster":"reload bae","date":"2020-02-05T18:45:57.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this reply, it truly gives me hope that I might one day work with something that I’m truly passionate about. \nI’d love it even more if I got a job at Riot as a narrative writer. \nI post all my works on the archives and it’s truly been my favorite site for sharing my writing. My current most popular work has around 3.5k reads and it’s about Jhin,it’s such a pleasure to write about him even if the complexity of him makes my head hurt.\nI haven’t seen many Jhin fanfics and that’s why I got soo motivated to write about him and share it with others who adore him just like me.\nI hope that one day that work will get even more reads but I’m happy as it is right now. I’m slowly coming to the 20th chapter,it feels like I’ve come a long way from the beginning of it.\nI’d love to check some of your work out. I love writing but I love reading equally. I will surely join the discord. Thank you for opening my eyes to a new approach to what I wanna do in the future.","replies":[]}]}]}
