Who thought these changes were a good idea?\r\n\r\nMost every single ultimate in the game helps in team fights in some way. Quinn? Herp derp, lets fly around really fast but not be able to use abilities!\r\n\r\nAwesome.\r\n\r\nSo what if she dominates early game? By mid/late she is useless for team fighting. Oh there&#039;s a fight at dragon! Better fly in at lightning speeds and.... do nothing!\r\n\r\nTime to baron fight! Better fly in really fast and.... do nothing!\r\n\r\nAt least right now she has potential to quickly assassinate a squishy target as Valor. After these changes she loses that potential and becomes a short ranged ADC with little escape ability.","replies":[]}
