Knowing this is impossible for a new account, I looked up to see he was previously Diamond ranked on that account... So really, that&#039;s not even close to a true unranked climb.\r\n\r\nA real climb would be starting like mid Silver and soloing your way out. I want to see THAT. Getting promoted to Plat 1 right out of the gate is boring to us that want to see a real challenge.\r\n\r\nImmediately he is going for a duo team as well, meaning he wants to make it as easy as possible to climb the account instead of having to struggle like the average player.\r\n\r\nHas anyone actually recorded themselves climbing from Bronze/Silver to Diamond/Challenger?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m really just interested to see where a top level player would get placed on a brand new account after completing their 10 games.\r\n\r\nNot on accounts that have previously been diamond or higher...","replies":[]}
