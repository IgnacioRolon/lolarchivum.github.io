And I mentioned Buhru separately, since most of the actual pirate culture in Bilgewater (and, to that extent, the Serpentine Delta) seems to have migrated from the lower ranks of society in Valoran, as have the people. They likely would try to keep their style of clothing and simply modify it for temperature as opposed to adopting Buhru clothing in an instant, as we can see from most non-Illaoi Bilgewater champions, similar to how Europeans tried to keep their styles when migrating to different climates and simply modified them for the heat.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-07-08T18:39:46.172+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} wears two pairs of underwear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supercharge","date":"2019-07-08T10:05:58.720+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"go to the teemo.gg model viewer and check for yourself haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-07-08T10:28:29.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon now has become great. :)","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2019-07-08T23:45:47.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SuicidePlank,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ywEb2oXq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-07-08T10:28:29.984+0000)\n>\n> Pantheon now has become great. :)\n\nhttps://pm1.narvii.com/5778/4dbfe57eb5183e99f389887f920c3e356cb167a2_hq.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2019-07-08T23:13:37.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost guaranteed they do.
