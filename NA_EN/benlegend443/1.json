Horribly.\n\nNo need to use font identifiers. Next time you would like to know what type of font is being used just right click the text and then click \"Inspect\" (Google Chrome). That opens the developer window of chrome and you can see on the right bottom window a tab called \"Styles\" which tells you what type of font is being used, what is the font size, color etc. etc. ","replies":[]}]}
