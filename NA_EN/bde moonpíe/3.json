But if you don&#039;t that&#039;s cool too. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\nhttps://YouTube/watch?v=yTpS-2jiTqU\r\n\r\nNow, onto the discussion at hand. The new game mode Clash. The new Clash game mode is a tournament style game mode that is suppose to be like your very own LCS experience. We get to use the same banning system as the pros do and we get to see all of our opponents rankings and champion win rates before the champ select beings, allowing us strategy time for champion bans and team compositions. WE can get into these tournaments by earning of purchasing tickets with our RP. Once your team has lost in the tournament, you can receive rewards based on your placement. This may include things like XP and BE multipliers, but who knows what else in in store for the winners of the tournament. \r\n\r\nThis new game mode sounds like one of the coolest things that has come to league in a very long time. Being able to compete with friends in an environment that is fun and will be able to give you awesome rewards. It honestly sounds like a better version of the ranked system in my opinion. With the addition of team speak, coming to the client in a few patches, communication will be even easier for the teams.\r\n\r\nThe one problem that I have with this new game mode is that it is not permanent. It apparently will only happen a few times a year. I can get that this will add to the &quot;LCS experience&quot;, but I personally feel that the game mode should be around permanently. The XP and BE bonuses that you can earn from playing in these tournaments are going to be such a sought after item in the game. Especially sense you can no longer gain BE from match made games. The fast leveling that you will be able to get from these bonuses ,will allow so many more players to get the champions that they want. At a much faster pace as well. The game mode sounds like a much more fulfilling version of the ranked system. Where no matter what rank you are, you get rewards that are beneficial for leveling. instead of borders and summoner icons.\r\n\r\nSo now it is your turn, Up-vote this article if you want Clash to be a permanent Game mode in League of Legends!","replies":[{"poster":"rcrc0526","date":"2017-12-12T02:36:24.672+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummm I'm pretty sure it's a weekly thing based on the article","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHGaming349","date":"2018-04-16T00:31:57.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only problem I have with this gamemode is the time for this.

I think \"constantly on\" would be difficult to maintain the queue for this mode, especially with the restrictions on who can join (only Honor lvl 2+ who have completed ranked placements, etc).","replies":[]}]}
