But to the point. I do not think that he should get a nerf. I like how some people say there is no counter play and build when all you need is armor and AP+MP (for mages) and armor and movement speed for other champs but if people practice playing against Yasuo, I bet you 10$ things are going to change in terms of win rates with Yasuo. Personally I dont think you can accurately measure win rates with a specific champ due to the game being a 5v5 most of the time and the win depends on the entire team as well as there level of skill and champs that they use as well. They should measure it with 1v1 situations. But back on the discussion at hand it has always been the items that Yasuo has on rather than him or his abilities. His baseline damage at lvl.18 without any extra AD is only 110. But the main build (not the new armor build) with his double crit passive makes him very powerful but still squishy if you gank him with a 2 or 3v1. And the extra magic damage that I get on my basic attacks with shiv makes it very easy to get farm and do some extra damage against champs both in solo and in team fight situations. So all in all the items the you get is what makes Yasuo so powerful rather than the base power of Yasuo or the abilities in his kit. Like how people think that the wind wall is OP but it only blocks projectiles for 4 seconds and you can walk right through it. And you can fire at Yasuo on the oposite side of that wall once you pass through. So really its a matter of placement when it comes down to that ability. Not to mention the cooldown on that ability is high even if fully leveled. And his Q is only a basic attack +100 damage once fully leveled. But the extra 100 does not get added in the critical strike that the Q can get. All the critical strikes Yasuo does whether it be a basic attack of a Q, they all get 10% reduced damage. And the E hardly does any damage without AP. And even if it only has a 0.1 sec cooldown it all depends if he has a target to do it on, and if you watch him carefully and get his movement speed impaired if you can there is no chance of him escaping. If he does escape use flash. The ult can't critically strike so its 200/300/400 plus 150% AD and ignores 50% of armor only to the champion hit by the ult and no one else. But that would not be anything without items. But I heard that he will possibly be reworked so who knows whats going to happen. DON'T F HIM UP RIOT.\n\nThanks for reading, leave a comment on your opinion of what should happen and why.\n\nGot the inspiration to talk about the items from \"Shadowfang TC\" ","replies":[{"poster":"Thales225","date":"2016-12-19T03:20:26.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I don't think that he should get a nerf, but much rather get hid abilities debuffed just a little\"\n\nI fell off my chair when I read this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-12-19T02:55:37.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm 50% armor pen?\nSo if you get ulted, armor is shit unless you have 400+ and losing 200 armor only means about 5-6% more damage taken.\nIf you have 100 armor that's 17% more damage you're taking.\nAlso with his 300 * 2.25 = 675 damage per attack and his Q which is another attack how do you actually beat him?","replies":[{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2016-12-27T20:35:53.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh people who don't know how armor works and trust riots in game number.\n\nEvery 1 point of armor increases your effective hp vs ad damage by 1%. So you would be losing 200% of your effective health increase if you lost 200 armor. On a tank with 4k hp that is  **8000** less damage they have to do to kill you.","replies":[{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-12-28T02:36:43.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm what?\nThe armor formula is [% reduction = armor / (armor + 100)]\nNot really sure what you're trying to say.

So 50 armor would make 1000 hp 1500 effective health. It is much easier than trying to calculate out a formula in the middle of a game to figure out if you can kill something.","replies":[{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2016-12-30T06:08:38.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But, even if the 50% of armor is ignored, you still would have to do relatively good damage to kill that champion, and considering that the damage Yasuo gives is the same as it was before the Ulti, the HP bar gets depleted faster due to the ignored armor, not him himself, and since Yasuo is a super squishy champ in team fights, 2v1ing him can cause real trouble for him in that situation, even if he lands the Ulti multiple players can get to Yasuo and kill him, and even if he uses his dash he can get far, just do a flash or stun if you have got one, so the 50% armor mitigation is pointless if he cannot do any damage to the enemy champion. But I have to say the doing a solo fight in that situation is bad news for you unless you dodge the 3rd Q and make it so the Ulti never occurs, trust me it can be done, and with the right timing you can gank Yasuo and kill him before you can say his name.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadowfang TC ","date":"2016-12-19T03:07:40.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Swegmec,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NMT39M0E,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-12-19T02:55:37.555+0000)\n>\n> Umm 50% armor pen?\n> So if you get ulted, armor is shit unless you have 400+ and losing 200 armor only means about 5-6% more damage taken.\n> If you have 100 armor that&#x27;s 17% more damage you&#x27;re taking.\n> Also with his 300 * 2.25 = 675 damage per attack and his Q which is another attack how do you actually beat him?\n\nIt lasts 15 seconds, and only procs on crits now. So early game it's garbage. Late game, literally just kite him and have someone exhaust and use some sort of CC on him.

His win rate PLUMMETED. It would have done the same with just the item change. It was successful on Ekko before Yasuo, and people just naturally tested it out.

Plus once he gets mallet hes tanky and that shield and PD passive and lets hope he doesnt get a tabi because if you auto as a champ you aint going to be doing much damage. this just makes him feel like he has a lot more resists than he does while having a pretty big damage output. Im pointing out a lot of oppressive things about yas because from what has been going around people have been saying lately its a dilemma of a champ being fun to play, but extremely oppressive to play against.","replies":[]}]}
