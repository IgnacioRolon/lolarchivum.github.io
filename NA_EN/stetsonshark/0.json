I&#039;ve been playing league for awhile now, but got bored with it for no other reason than I don&#039;t have any friends that play the game.\r\nIm looking for a few casual players to game with. I don&#039;t play ranked anymore, so mostly just normals drafts or blind pick and mostly play top but don&#039;t really care what role I play. Im on the east coast if that has an impact on anything.","replies":[]}
