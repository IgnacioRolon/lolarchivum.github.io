An error such as this can occur due to an unstable connection, or a 3rd party security program that is blocking League of Legends.  \n\nBefore we go straight at the throat regarding connectivity issues, there are some troubleshooting steps I would like you to try:\n\n1. Ensure your Windows Clock is synced - https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20201443-syncing-windows-clock\n\n1. Make sure that your IE settings are configured properly (while it may seem odd, IE is a dependency for the League of Legends Client) - https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/21931765-Windows-Settings-Troubleshooting\n\n1. Confirm that your IE is not in \"offline\" mode.  You can check this by opening the taskbar in IE, clicking on \"File\", and making sure Offline Mode is not checked.\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"KakiroShiro","date":"2013-09-24T12:54:32.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx bro , mmm well  It looks like it was # 2 . , really  thx so much â™¥ .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KakiroShiro","date":"2013-09-24T00:31:53.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"well  tried and tried and ... ... nothing  .
