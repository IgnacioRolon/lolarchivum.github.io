These texture updates are aimed at bringing older champions and skins up to date with the game's current art style - they are not replacements for eventual and higher scope visual updates","url":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/03/311-pbe-update.html","image":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M_ecJWWc5CE/Uizpk6U3lwI/AAAAAAAACLo/xyh6eQNRzzs/s640/sitethumb.jpg"},"up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like how the texture rebalance for Ryze removes the emphasis on his tattoos and his scroll. I feel like it takes away a lot of character and detail (actually i just don't like most texture rebalances for this reason, but this one stands out to me), by taking the focus off of his tattoos and scroll, which if i'm not mistaken is the key source of his power. Anyway, just my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2015-03-12T03:08:09.215+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only just hit PBE today.

But yeah unskinned Ryze basically just looks like he is better suited for a shop keeper or librarian than a champion now; like he could be sitting next to the fuzzy beast with the shopkeeper on SR and wouldn't even notice him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2015-03-12T05:20:19.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I like the TU work, but I really like Ryze's tattoos, and they're meant to be the source of his magical power.
