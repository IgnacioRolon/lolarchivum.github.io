Basically they're making recoloring of base models and skins 590 rp.  they should have done this for IP at least.  I've seen some streamers with 400K IP sitting there and some other friends with ip sitting in their accounts as well.  Other games have done this customization for free then Riot decides to make this RP?  I understand that the minority of the players with money may pay for these \"Chroma Packs\" but I don't believe this is it worth it for the majority of the players at all.  Riot should make these \"Chroma Packs\" influence points instead of Riot Points.  I don't know about you guys but I won't be spending money on these packs.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/introducing-chroma-packs.html#more","replies":[]}
