He does damage(a lot for a tank, think Maokai as well), he shuts down AD carries VERY hard, with MS slow, knock-up, AND AS slow. His only, and I'd definitely say his only drawback is that he can only gank with his ult up/his team should NEVER fight without his ult up.

He's really just flavor of the month, and after the Cinderhulk nerfs go through in 5.9, he won't be as much of a menace. His Ult is gamechanging when used correctly and that is really the only thing that I see is overwhelmingly strong. If they need to do anything else to Gragas, I hope it's just increasing the CD of his Ult. His absolutely absurd damage comes from what? He has low scaling and his abilities base damages are average. He only has his W for late game damage because it's percent health damage. Compare that with Sejuani who has %health damage and damage that scales off of HER max HP. She has more CC than Gragas and a passive that let's her stick to targets and gain bonus resistances. The only thing that Gragas has over her is his sustain in the jungle due to his passive (and this in turn allows him to apply more pressure early in the game). I guess you could argue that displacement is better than an AOE stun, but 1.75 seconds is a long time in league to be standing huddled together doing nothing with 2 or more of your buddies while a boar rider and her posse are charging at you. \n\nGragas hovers at a comfortable 50% winrate these days and people think he's more broken than any other champ out there. I know winrates don't mean everything but he's not a mechanically challenging champion. He only begins to show an above average performance at higher levels of play which might be reason for concern, but I don't think he's far off from being healthy (in other words, he may need a _small_ nerf, and the Cinderhulk nerf may be all he needs). I think people are seeing Gragas as the Lee Sin of tanks; he has pressure early, he stays healthy in the jungle, and he is incredibly safe. If Gragas is in trouble, he has his E, is Q and his Ult to help him get away. Just like Lee Sin has his W ward hopping and his low CD Ult to keep himself safe. This is what I think people really hate about Gragas. He's fairly slippery and annoying to deal with because of how surprisingly mobile he is. \n\nNow in all fariness. I don't think that Gragas needed the last few buffs I mentioned in the beginning. He was a good tank champion before they were added. People just didn't know how to build him since they nerfed his AP build. He can still build AP, yes, but he's much less effective than before due to his Q no longer being a safe way to farm minions, which is what made him strong. He could stay back and farm until he wanted to fight, but now he has to walk up or E into a minion wave to help clear it which puts him in harms way. However, when he builds tank, he doesn't have to worry about harass as much, so he can Q-E a minion wave without worrying about getting bursted down after his abilities are on CD. In the Jungle, he's even better because he no longer has the damage reduction on his Q, allowing him to farm camps early with ease. I think that the recent buffs to him were unnecessary, but regardless, he is a strong pick right now in pro play due to his very powerful Ult (not because of damage, but because of the displacement). Placed correctly, it can win you the teamfight and the game. Placed incorrectly, you successfully kill your entire team. I think Gragas is fairly balanced right now (possible reverts of the last few buffs and he would still be fine), but he is annoying as hell to play against and that and due to how popular he is, are the reasons that people hate him so much. aka the Lee Sin effect","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-05-03T14:43:09.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"a well placed gragas ult is broken \n\nbesides that id vote for good aoe champs","replies":[{"poster":"ARoninInDisgrace","date":"2015-05-03T16:42:56.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand.
