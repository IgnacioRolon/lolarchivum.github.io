I am low elo, level 22 and learning new roles. Riot keeps putting gold and plat players on the other team who are partied with a person at my rank and they just stomp the games. I dont understand how hard of a concept it is to not do that. Any explanation to this rito or do you not care about low elo stuff?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T16:05:18.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked MMR is totally separate from normal games, so matchmaking will need to adjust a spot best fit for you.
