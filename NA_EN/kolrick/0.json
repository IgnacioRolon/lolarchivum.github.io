I have tried restarting the client, uninstalling the game as well as restarting my computer. I got no more ideas on how to fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T16:55:54.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!  Did you recently update to Sierra?  There's currently a [known issue ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/bJx6P0hX-known-bugs-in-macos-1012-sierra)where item lists are not being updated on that OS.  The current workaround is to save a list on another PC if available, which should transition over.

It's to be expected new bugs along with any new updates. I'll try out that method. If it work it works. If not I'll wait until the next update. I'll just start writing things down like the old days.

If this is on Windows, there may be an issue with your config folder that would require a reset to resolve.  To set your config to default:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nOtherwise, let me know what operating system you're using!","replies":[{"poster":"kolrick","date":"2016-10-11T16:53:39.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the assist unfortunately I'm not running on a windows OS.
