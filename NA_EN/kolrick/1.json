He is running on Windows 10.0.14393, even having all the visual setting on low (He normally had it on Medium), turning off everything in the background (Used to run other programs or web pages such as Skype and YouTube) is still having this new problem. It kills his gameplay. He is stuck at 30 FPS while standing and hit unplayable lows at something like 2 FPS while farming. \r\nIs there anything that Happened in patch 7.14 that could have done this and is there anything we can do for his computer to run League normally again?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T20:40:29.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend had some good first steps by turning off any programs running in the background since sometimes your pc just needs a little more to work with to run League smoothly. I'd first have him check for any driver updates he might have missed, as that seems to be the main source of fps drops. After that, go ahead and run him through the rest of this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to check for anything else that might be out of whack. Test it in a custom or practice game and hit me back up if that doesn't help.\n\nAlso, what kind of glitches have you and your other friends been having? My first thought is that maybe some of those updated files were damaged in the process, so I'd try running a quick repair in the client options to see if that helps. If not, feel free to hit me back up detailing a little bit of what's going wrong and I can help more!","replies":[{"poster":"Nippledix","date":"2017-07-18T01:34:10.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this issue as well and it just started after the latest patch 7.14. Skillshots are being displayed as cast and they are going through characters and then the hit animation occurs later. For example, brand Q will fly thru targets but then a moment later they will be burning or stunned, same with jinx W, Jhin ult/snare, etc. Basically all skill shots do that. This lag issue is not based on ping and only started after the latest patch. Clearly something needs to be fixed because the lag/fps issue from this past patch is all over the forums/reddit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exsiuse","date":"2017-07-14T19:23:47.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything was fine until this patch came along and it sucks because i was so hyped for the new champion","replies":[]}]}
