Does the terrain on which the hit mech stands maybe make a difference? Examples if M1 was to move to the right (X=normal terrain, O=oil, M1=mech thats hitting the other mech, M2=mech that gets hit):\r\n\r\nX M1 O M2 X X (M2 standing on O)\r\n\r\nX M1 O M2 X X (M2 standing on X)\r\n\r\n_- MINOR SPOILER FOR MISSION 3 IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION -_\r\n\r\n2) The boss on mission 3 has a command card that deals damage to every mech in the bosses current map tile . What if the boss is standing on multiple map tiles at the same time? Will all tiles be affected by the card? Do we choose a single tile for which to resolve the effect? Do we somehow pick a random single map tile?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your answers!\r\n\r\nPS: Riot, you done GOOD! I was a bit skeptical when the game was announced since it is your first board game. While there surely are some things to improve balance wise, the quality is top notch! I knew this wasn&#039;t some cheap plastic crap the moment I held the game box in my hands! Well done, worth every penny! We had a blast playing the first missions!","replies":[{"poster":"LuckerNoob","date":"2017-01-03T22:25:27.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Sliding mechs push other mechs. All movement is treated the same in regards to pushing, etc. It doesn't matter what caused the pushing mech to bump in to the pushed.\n\n2) Pretty sure it covers all tiles the boss is on.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2017-01-18T20:55:54.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nickdec97","date":"2017-01-09T03:40:08.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree on the first one, the mech slides over on contact.\n\nNow the second boss issue I feel like you could go either way. If you want to be harder on yourself, you can effect all tiles, or you can leave it up to the rune die I would think. Whatever side the compass is pointing to is what tile takes the damage","replies":[]}]}
