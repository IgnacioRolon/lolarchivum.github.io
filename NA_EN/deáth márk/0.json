For example, the vision plant doesn't have the blue outline, it's just a blue cloud in the shape of a triangle. Another one is Katarina's Q ability. When it hits the ground, it doesn't have the red circle outline of where it's going to hit when I shunpo to it. It only has a dagger stuck into the ground. Is there any way to fix this? Those are the only two I know of at the moment, but please tell me how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T02:52:43.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are all of your **VIDEO** settings in-game set to?
