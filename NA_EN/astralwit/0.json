You built him for tons of raw AD, good OnHit, and decent attack speed.  The AD was amplified by his W's ratio, making each basic attack hurt quite a bit more while the lower attack speed meant that Kog could actually get some degree of mileage out of kiting.  Because his Ult also scaled with bonus AD, that meant you were vaporizing anything under half HP while having Mura to give you a decent mana pool.\n\nI ran this mostly on Dominion, so the build ended up looking something like- {{item:3043}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3104}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3142}}.

So just out of ranked so a safe estimate is roughly 75% of ranked solo queue players are not \"running comps\" in champ select.\n\nIf you want to say that the very top tier of players are \"running comps\" in solo queue thats great. I have no reason to assume they do or they do not. What I do know is a great majority of all 5v5 games, players are not drafting for a \"team comp\" they are either picking a champion they like, or they are trying to counter pick in lane. \n\nSo yes at the very extreme spectrum of solo queue, you are likely right. One assassin might not be enough. It is also unlikely that a ADC player is ever going to pick Kog'Maw into assassins in the first place. Probably much to smart for that. \n\nIn group queue same concept. A great majority of people still just pick what they like, counter, or what they read online as \"strong\". The great majority dont draft for team comps. They just hope it works out. Besides with how popular assassins and fighters (fighters have become basically unkillable assassins. They just dont have the escape) I find it extremely likely your team will have 2 champions that fit that category. Better plan just bring 4 assassins to blow up Kog'Maw. \n\nWhat you need to kill him? Will always depend on team comp. Most people dont think far enough ahead and 1 person on Kog'Maw is usually going to be enough. Yes there are exceptions.

His damage is sufficiently high that it doesn't matter if he doesn't have protection - he can 100-0 the enemy ADC before the enemy assassin can 100-0 him. Sometimes he can 100-0 both? He's still weak to CC which is keeping him under a 90% win rate thankfully, but he's really overtuned right now. He was over 50% win rate before his latest buff - there was no reason for it...","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2016-02-16T16:55:07.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree, his buff was way too good, actually having his AS on Q was a good way of differentiating good kogs from bad kogs because maxing Q was the way to go, the increase on the shred is... or was, Kog's prime mechanic for melting, people who maxed W were just either trying Kog or they thought that by maxing w he was going to reach his machinegun status inmediately at lvl 5, which is simply not true... or well... it wasn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2016-02-16T18:15:09.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HigeR,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mER6o8iA,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2016-02-16T16:55:07.347+0000)\n>\n> Yeah I agree, his buff was way too good, actually having his AS on Q was a good way of differentiating good kogs from bad kogs because maxing Q was the way to go, the increase on the shred is... or was, Kog's prime mechanic for melting, people who maxed W were just either trying Kog or they thought that by maxing w he was going to reach his machinegun status inmediately at lvl 5, which is simply not true... or well... it wasn't.\n\nYet for some reason games where Q was maxed first he had significantly lower win rate than when maxing W first, even before the latest change.","replies":[{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2016-02-17T00:18:54.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skia Asteri,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mER6o8iA,comment-id=0007000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-16T18:15:09.944+0000)\n>\n> Yet for some reason games where Q was maxed first he had significantly lower win rate than when maxing W first, even before the latest change.\n\nThe reason was simple. W max gives you range and lower CD so it gives you more uptime as well as safety. Maxing Q gave you none of those things but increased burst and max DPS. It was a clever way of gating his power from whoever designed Kog'Maw. Kog had to make a choice and Q max would only be better with insane peel.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Andrionar","date":"2016-02-16T16:17:46.065+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actualy I would law to play ap Kog mow.
