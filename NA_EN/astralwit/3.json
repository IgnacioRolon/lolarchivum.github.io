His clear is slow as hell and requires massive mana expenditure. He&#039;s either squishy or his damage tickles. His ult. has a ton of counterplay via knockbacks, dashes, or just warding. Without ult. he does virtually nothing. He seems like one of the most useless junglers in the game now and only seems effective if his team&#039;s already ahead (thus giving you a huge vision + item advantage). I have probably 250+ Fiddle games over the last few seasons and I&#039;ve never seen him in a more pathetic state. If I go 3-1 on most junglers, I feel like I have a chance to carry.

He stinks against Assassins with interrupts though.\n\nHe's SITUATIONALLY decent but hardly \"good\" and again it's mostly dedicated Fiddle players. He is REALLY bad vs strong ganking junglers and stealth is a big issue for him. I was vs an Ekko Mid as Fiddle and Twitch JG just kept coming and I can only place one pink after all. I was forced to farm under turret instead of keeping the lane in the middle with E spam. When Fiddle is pushed in, he will miss a TON of CS under turret. You can probably get 70% but not more so it's a pretty bad situation compared to many other mids. For example, if I'm Kassadin (great vs Fiddlesticks btw) under turret, I can get 100% of CS if I'm not zoned by abilities. It's really easy.  This makes pushing champions like Aurelion Sol quite hard to deal with because they'll clear the wave instantly and just use their massive map pressure to influence the map. If you do the same, you'll have half their CS.  \n\nBasically, I think Middlesticks is better than JG Fiddle IF the matchup is decent but it's still not a good pick.
