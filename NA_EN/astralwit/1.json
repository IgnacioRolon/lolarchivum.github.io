He had a bit of evil in him and a smirk to go with it. That&#039;s what I liked. Willump was a ferocious beast, not a cuddly teddy bear. Even Demolisher Nunu isn&#039;t scary or intimidating. The only Nunu skin I like anymore is Zombie Nunu but it&#039;s Legacy and I can&#039;t buy it.\n\nIf Riot is going to not just rework a champion but change everything about their personality on top of it, we need some skins with the old personality. When I play Nunu now, it&#039;s like I&#039;m in Frozen or some other Disney movie. Overly happy, sappy and whimsical... the opposite of what I liked in this particular champion. I don&#039;t want a gentle beast and a friendly little boy on a fun and pleasant adventure. I don&#039;t even recognize this Nunu anymore or Willump... it&#039;s like they both had lobotomies. \n\nHere&#039;s a bit of the old Nunu &amp; Willump:\n\nhttps://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Nunu_SasquatchLoading_old.jpg\n\n[Evil arrogant boy with a hellish beast]\n\nnew Nunu &amp; Willump:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/p4sYuKr.jpg\n\n[Impossibly cute Yeti toy filling in for absentee father]\n\n\nWhat's next, is Annie going to be cheerfully having a blast with her nice bear from hell?
