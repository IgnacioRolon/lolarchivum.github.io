It's still awkward though and dissuades some champions from those choices. It would be better if it just calculated your highest damage type on the fly but that might be too resource intensive.

It's always preferable for those to be magic damage because 1. it's harder to stack MR and base MR is lower 2. Corki gets 18 Mpen from Sorcs amplifying magic damage 3. If they were to massively MR stack such as Visage + Adaptive Helm + Mercs, Corki would either buy Void or, more likely, he'd try to attack the targets not stacking full MR (vs squishies, magic damage will always be more useful to you as Corki). Even if they had 3 MR stacking mega tanks, I'd STILL want it to be magic damage on Corki because I'd be doign my best to kill their ADC and Mid first while then trying to just sustain through the tanks. The whole \"HYBRID SO OP CAN'T ITEMIZE!!!!\" idea is virtually never correct. All the champions who have that damage profile fall off past mid game because penetration items suck on them (there is no dual penetration item). It's only useful mid game or vs squishies who can't afford 2 defensive items. Furthermore, Electrocute and others like it are not procced enough to actually alter your damage profile. It's not like because Electrocude does physical damage, my mid laner is going to need to build Zhonya's. It's maybe a 2-3% tilt in your overall damage to physical. I'm not trying to be rude, there are just some big misconceptions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-11-10T06:01:58.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well actually in the comps where corki fits in it's a bit more complicated than that.

At best, it's like their resistance is reduced, at worst, they're the same - if both the kha'zix and the cassiopeia are 2v1-ing the tank, or if it's an ashe + cassiopeia and there's only one tank on the enemy team they can aim right now safely.\n\nIf Corki had it so that his abilities all did magic damage scaling on AD while his auto attacks all did physical damage, and he could cast without interrupting autos (so his typical teamfight would look something like attack moving vs the galio while quickly moving your cursor to aim R at the rammus, DPSing both simultaneously), then you'd definitely be right.
