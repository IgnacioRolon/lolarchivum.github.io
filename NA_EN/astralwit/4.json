It merits some AP ratio but perhaps only 1% in that case. \n\nI'm not really sure how practical 160% total AP would be to use since E has a 16 sec. CD and they'd have to sit in it for 4 seconds. I think it actually sounds scarier than it really is. Still,  I'd rather make sure it's a low enough ratio that it doesn't have the potential to be a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-12-03T08:07:16.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think 5% would be fine.  1% would be a total of 16% which is pretty darn weak.  5% gives a total of 80% which is not only a fairly reasonable scaling for many abilities, but is a much nicer looking number.\n\nHonestly I think 60% would be the optimal overall ratio, but that's a kind off ratio to have displayed (3.75%).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2016-12-02T22:56:40.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i play corki i usually find it pretty easy to keep it on someone for atleast 3 seconds, 4 is about the time they realize their fucked XD And even then in a teamfight it's easy to keep people in it for 4 full seconds.

His AD ratios are far better than his AP ratios and he's one of the few champions who gets tons of magic damage without building any AP.

When he was strong, it certainly wasn't because of his abilities' AP scaling. It was due to having 1.1 AD scaling on autos with half magic and half physical. This made crit builds with Essence Reaver (back when TF had 20% crit. ) extremely effective vs non-tanks. I also think he was overrated and his actual competitive winrate didn't match people's perception of him. They looked at him laning well and bursting a lot of champions but didn't realize how relevant the lack of CC becomes later on.  \n\nCorki's got a decent winrate now (51% mid and ADC) but he's not close to being broken by any means. He's just OK and still suffers from a huge late game fall-off. Few play him and they mostly know what they're doing while their opponents probably forgot how Corki works. Moreover, Corki beats a lot of the reworked assassins, especially pre-6 so the meta fits him. Having a gap closer and being ranged is always hard for assassins.
