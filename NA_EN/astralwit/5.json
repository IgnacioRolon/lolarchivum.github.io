Even when he doesn't carry, he at least provides a bit of zoning and engage. He might be the most reliable jungler I've seen since unlike Amumu, he isn't weak early.","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2016-06-09T00:31:37.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Has anyone seen a Volibear do badly?\n\nYes.\n\nJanna counters him pretty hard, and she's my go-to support ATM. I've had a lot of games where I just feel bad for Volibear, because I know the player on the other end is extreemly salty via my lol nope plays.\n\nVolibear is a really simple champion. He overpowers things in melee range, but only has 1 MS boost to get there.\n\nAs long as you can prevent Volibear from sticking to things in melee range, he's completely useless. \nMost melee champions are at least somewhat useful if they can't stick in melee range. Nasus can shred towers, Yi has pretty potent ranged harass, Fizz only really needs 0.5 seconds to do work, but not Volibear. \nIf Volibear can't stick to an opponent for his Lightning and Frenzy to build up, a Wukong clone is going to be more useful to your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"japan hate acc","date":"2016-06-08T23:32:22.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:112}} absolutely shits on him, or at least the old one.
