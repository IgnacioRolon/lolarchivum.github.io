Both sides would offer her alliance, but she would refuse, too proud for anything less than absolute power.  She’d either wait for them to be exhausted from fighting each other and seize power or, in  frustration at not being able to take over the region, resolve to kill _everyone_, one tribe, village, and town at a time.\n\nAnd were Syndra about to be defeated, she would seek Malzahar and offer to tear open and empower the largest Void Rift she could, just to spitefully destroy the world she already hates.\n\nEdit: Definitely more evil than Xerath.  She wants to rule the world only to make everyone suffer as much as possible until she grows bored and then kills them all.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-06T23:00:33.595+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really interesting to me that a lot of people see her as pure evil, while others are like NO!

But they can always be a villain from someone else&#x27;s POV.\n\nNever underestimate the appeal—or importance—of having unabashed good and bad guys in your story.  They serve as universal protagonists and antagonists while also clearly morally contrasting every character on the moral spectrum between them.\n\nThe light that shines in Lux and bottomless abomination of Nocturne are both worthy subjects of writing.  Just knowing the right thing to do is difficult, much less doing it.  Her struggles are worth writing about.  Likewise, being the most terrifying thing in Runeterra is both nothing easy and tells us about our own fears.\n\nSometimes, characters are best left unsympathetic.  The experience of a emotionless, predatory mind that wishes only our destruction is a profoundly unsettling one, and it’s a fantasy common to many villains throughout literature.  We don’t always want to even try to understand the bad guy, and sometimes we want to play someone who has nothing for us to understand but the fear he delivers.\n\nLikewise, not every character needs a moral flaw.  A transcendent sense of moral duty and the courage and power to enact it are revered in history and just as common as the black-hearted villain as fantasies.  Admiring a champion for their selflessness, bravery, and determination, along with their relentless and clear-minded devotion to ethics, is just as moving as loathing their villainy.\n\nHence the need for wholesome champions like Taliyah, Orianna, Lux, Ashe, Braum, or Nunu; and also the need for complete monsters like Draven, Nocturne, or the Voidborn.  An out-of-control mage bent on destruction, especially as a foil to Ryze, would make an excellent character if explored, especially in relation to others and their environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-07T01:38:38.741+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you consider the Voidborn evil?

If they’re not evil, then who is?  Also, see Nocturne.\n \n> (Also, Draven is just a celebrity in a culture that venerates skill and strength - are MMA fighters evil? They beat each other up for entertainment and prizes...)\n\nI can actually talk about this, since I was reading about Roman Gladiators, the closest thing to Draven, on Wikipedia the other night.  They were celebrities only on-stage, but off-stage even the greatest gladiators had the lowest status of society, slavery, and were reviled by all.  They weren’t even buried with other slaves.\n\nEven in Rome, an expansionist military aristoctracy that venerated skill and strength and was infamous for the depravity of its imperial days, maiming and killing other people for entertainment was nothing to be proud of.  Indeed, gladiators themselves were often allowed to live if they fought bravely, both because sponsors wanted to save money and the crowd often disapproved of killing them.\n\nNow, just imagine Draven.  He’s not a gladiator—he’s an executioner.  He kills helpless people and laughs as he does it.  His only motivations are fame, money, and bloodthirsty sadism.  The regular, gleeful, spectacular slaughter of condemned prisoners before the cheers of a genuinely adoring crowd is something largely unheard of in history.\n\nPublic executions were usually done to frighten the populace, rather than entertain them.  Even when they were, they were reserved for objects of hatred, and usually by some mechanical means or by using animals.  And still, the executioners were so despised that they often wore masks and had trouble in their personal lives.\n\nThink of the inhuman depths to which a society would have to sink before someone like Draven could exist.  Its population would have to generally enjoy the sight of helpless people being chopped into pieces, not out of rage or hatred or indignation, but just because they can be, and vicariously enjoy doing it themselves.  There’s no contest to see who’s stronger or better, per Noxian culture, only the vicious exercise of power already had.\n\nThere’s someone selling tickets to those shows, and there are people buying them, implying that the following conversation would have to be common in Noxus:\n\n“Come get your Draaaaaven tickets!  Come get your Draaaaaven tickets—three executions today!  Free drinks, courtesy of _Drekan Drinks_ beverage company!  Come get your tickets!”\n\n“Dad!  Dad!  I heard that Draven cuts ‘em clean in half!  I wanna go see!”\n\n“Well. that’s not just up to me, sport!  Ask your mother, too.”\n\n“Oh, darling, certainly.  I loved watching those shows with my friends as a girl.  It’s worth every penny to see the smile—and the blood—on his face!”\n\nNone of its participants could believably have any redeeming qualities.  Any shred of decency, much less compassion, would render a Draven show unpalatable.  But these would have to be average Noxians rather than scum dredged up from the bottom of their society.\n\nSo the average Noxian would have to be essentially monstrous, with Draven just being the most open and accomplished of them all.  The pair of feet with the most heads rolling around it, if you will .  I don’t see how “evil” doesn’t enter the picture.\n\n> I&#x27;m always really wary of ascribing concrete definitions of morality to any character, because it is not universal and cannot be quantified.

I am _also_ cheeky enough to try to make you choose between defending the indefensible and opening that very door which I suspect you would rather keep shut.  \n\nMaybe even these thoughts alone, toward someone who’s taken the time out of their Monday to reply to me, make _me_ evil?
