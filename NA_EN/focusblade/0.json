One game I'm perfectly fine at 30 ping and 200-300 fps and the next I'm sitting at 250-300ping at 200-300fps. I double checked my internet and it doesn't seem to be on my side(TWC in Texas). This problem started about 2 weeks ago. Is anyone else having this problem or is there a bad connection to riot servers out there?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-21T00:16:52.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given you are trying to hunt down the exact specific issue as to why your ping is spiking so high, make sure to check out our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)!
