Running into some real jerks lately.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did I somehow land in low priority queue without knowing? The last couple of days, I&#039;ve been getting a whole mess of sore winners. My last 8 games have had at least one person in the game just seriously rubbing it in the face of whoever is losing. Its one thing if my teammate goes on tilt if your lane gets stomped hard or something, I can deal with that, but being a sore winner just makes you look like a petty loser who finally broke a massive losing streak.

Did I get reported a bunch of times for the champs I play or something? Am I just getting unrrucky with matchmaking? rito pls...","replies":[]}
