He then proceeded to try to steal every jungle camp I went too (and succeeded with most of them). He completely ignored his lane just to ruin everyones ranked match. My question is how is it fair to have this game count against me and my team when he obviously completely ruined the match for us? Should we not have this game deleted from our record so it should not be counted against us? \n\n\nHis name was something like [**Removed**]","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T21:45:37.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To put it plainly, this is definitely not ok and absolutely sucks.  As long as you and the rest of the team report this player, he will be identified very quickly and punished accordingly.  We don't have any tolerance for players like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2016-05-03T21:50:48.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not that it's a bad thing that this player is being punished, but the question here is really more directed at the ranked implications of intentional feeders (and disconnects etc). Is there any way for some sort of loss forgiven like system to be implemented in games which were clearly not competitive whether it be because of a d/c, an intentional feeder, or some other reason?","replies":[]},{"poster":"IAlphaK","date":"2016-05-06T06:52:06.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gross that the losers are not compensated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaVaGeStaNo","date":"2016-05-03T21:54:18.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"YET , NOTHING DOES GET DONE FOR THE PERSON WHO IS ABUSED.  Tired of this shit on my teams, not getting justice only knowing they got either a: a warning or b : temporary suspension or even c: banned. When smurfs are 5$ for a level 30 account, and leveling/runes are cheaper then ever you guys are promoting this type of behavior by not making it harder to acquire accounts and letting multiple accounts be registered under 1 email. '\n\nWhy not if riot finds a person guilty of tampering in ranked, not reward the players who lost, with some sort of compensation?\n\nIF PLAYER IS FOUND GUILTY \nGIVE BACK 3 LP to losing team or something even so small would help greatly.","replies":[{"poster":"IAlphaK","date":"2016-05-06T06:50:59.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. They call it \"The fields of justice\" yet are bad at applying justice in their own game. Absolute garbage that I have to suffer for something 1 person purposely did that was obviously not in the good spirit that ranked should be played in. Tbh it makes not even want to finish my ranked because it's trash anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
