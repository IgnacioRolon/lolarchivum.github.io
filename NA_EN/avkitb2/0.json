WINDOWS 10 UPDATE BUG","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys!\r\n\r\nI made a discussion earlier and someone from riot commented but it didnt solve my problem and its been there ever since. \r\n\r\nAfter the windows 10 (forceful) update, my league of legends doesnt seem to work anymore. As soon as I log into league, my screen starts to flicker and go crazy (not my entire screen, just the windows bar and desktop). My computer then slows down slower than a turtle and I can't seem to click anything within League. I have to close the league app by right clicking the windows bar because i can't click anything within. I tried repairing, uninstalling then reinstalling, but nothing seems to be working for me.\r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP! I HAVEN'T PLAYED LEAGUE IN A MONTH!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T18:02:25.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The recent update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing some really wonky interactions with league.  Try disabling that to get this fixed up.  Let me know if you still have any issues afterwards!","replies":[{"poster":"avkitb2","date":"2016-10-08T17:36:08.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried that earlier but it didnt work. I found a solution though! \n\nSOLUTION: I changed the compatibility settings of the League of legends App to Windows 7 and it works perfectly now! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
