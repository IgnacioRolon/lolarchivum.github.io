It's not my entire screen, but mainly the windows bar and my desktop. This all happens even before I'm in a game!! Due to this flickering, my whole laptop lags and I can't seem to click anything or even right click. I have to right click 10-15 times on the League of Legends icon on the windows bar to close it and after a few seconds my laptop goes back to normal. Due to the inability to click, I can't even play a game even if I wanted to ignore the flickering. This has been really annoying and I assumed it might be a patch problem but there is a new patch now and the problem is still present. The flickering seems like its just refreshing itself a lot. \r\n\r\nI've tried many thing from other forums including something to do with internet explorer as I thought the certificates were not being accepted, but that didn't work either :/\r\n\r\nMy Laptop specs are as such:\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-6700\r\nRAM: 16 GB\r\nGraphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX \r\n\r\nI CAN'T PLAY LEAGUE GUYS! ** PLEASE HELP**!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Verdande","date":"2016-10-16T10:04:55.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the same problem during login fase, but it stops a minute or two after. BUT - during game play the game starts getting lag problems and nothing can be found anywhere.... I checked router, graphic drivers etc - even reinstalled both game and drivers, but nothing helps. \n\nLooks like LOL is stacking my memory ! when I open the Task Manager to find the problem causing the ping in game. Frame per second isnt dropping - only the ping goes up to astra-levels like 1200 or even higher when worst.\n\nSeems to me the problem is LOL because other games dont cause trouble... \n\nBut I got some similarities to u:\n\nWindows 10\nIntel Core i7 Q740\nGraphic card NVidia GeForce GT 330M\n\nI would as well like to get help... its totally unplayable after I reach lvl 6 - 9 in game... every time !!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T22:14:32.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience, this kind of tearing usually happens with PC's that are just too good so I guess it's kind of a double-edged sword.  :P  To get this fixed up, go to your in-game options for some specific options:  Togle the Vsync option and select to cap your framerate.  Additionally, a recent Windows 10 update has caused some similar issues, and it's due to the auto-enabled with the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) that's not working properly for some players.  Disable that to help the cause!  Hopefully, that will get you all fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"avkitb2","date":"2016-10-01T15:27:25.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nFirstly, thanks for your reply!\n\nI can't change the in-game settings such as the vsync and framerate because I can't even get into the game :/\n\nI tried turning the xbox thingy off (although i never use it) through the .reg file.
