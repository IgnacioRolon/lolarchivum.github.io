Yet my argument is... Taliyah feels like she was literally made for vector cast. Viktor and Rumble may simply not feel rewarding enough to see the impact.\n\nTaliyah...\n... YOU WILL NOTICE THE CAST'S IMPACT. She will be fun with the vector cast and people will stick with her because of it.\n\nTrouble is, we probably won't see changes to the cast until the designer is no longer sitting on Taliyah and puts her in the hands of the rest of Riot.\n\n\nThe only real reason they wouldn't want vector cast is that it gates super-quick players from W+E, maybe, to keep her from being too oppressive?","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-06-22T19:15:39.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be honest, the self-silence on her w feels pretty shitty and a vector cast would probably solve that issue. No one uses the neutral knock up anyways, so you could get rid of it. I just don't think it's going to happen any time soon because it's a more \"feel\" mechanic than a balance one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Azereil","date":"2016-07-27T15:27:33.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fucking hate every single one of you for this thread.
