It showed that i clicked the app, but the client wouldn't open. I then shut of my computer and checked around 3 times. After this, I deleted and reinstalled the game. It was working for the rest of the day, until i exited and tried to open it again. After this I repeat the steps before ( shut down and check). I then delete and reinstall the game another time, and the exact thing happened. It worked for like 5 hours, then I exited and it did the same exact thing. Does anyone know how to stop this? Because it is getting annoying having to reinstall every time i try to play league.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T16:29:49.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble establishing a connection to the servers, which would prevent the launcher from opening.
