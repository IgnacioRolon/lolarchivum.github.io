I read that it may be my GPU overheating but I've felt it at the time it does this and its never even all that warm plus only League of legends seems affected by this or any problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for any and all suggestions or help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T21:40:25.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're describing sounds like heavy packet loss late into the game. Packets are the bits of information that tell the server what actions were taken and the ones you receive relay to you what happened with other's actions on the server. If these are lost along the way, it can delay actions that you see or prevent them from even happening.\n\nPacket loss is often caused by issues along your route to the server, or local network settings that conflict with League. I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this issue.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues after following those steps.","replies":[]}]}
