I was so excited... until I found out they didn't work on NA.. {{item:3070}}{{item:3151}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nIs there any way I can exchange this or transfer this codes to NA please &lt;3??? I have ways of proving I was the one that attended and not that I just bought them randomly on the internet.\r\n\r\nAny rioter that can help?\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n(Me and my girlfriend are exactly in the very same situation).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T20:37:18.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally, each region may have their own events and promotions which remains exclusive, so we don't transfer that content between regions.
