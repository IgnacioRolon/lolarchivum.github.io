The match-making during those games is one of the worst experiences one can ever have (from my perspective). \n\nI had the occasion to skip a few ranks before and I understand that it helps in maintaining a division representative of one's MMR, but it doesn't completely reflect the player's current skill level. A player may come back after a few months and have a low MMR, but still maintain their position, or is on a win-streak that has high MMR but low division. MMR is always changing and that is how divisions should work too.\n\n> Each division corresponds with a certain MMR bracket though.\n\nWhat I ask for is to have a ranking system based solely on MMR as a score. Each division would be representative of a percentage of the top players, or a bracket of MMR scores. Every time one loses/wins, they get to see how their MMR is affected, not an \"LP\" change, which is actually based on MMR.\n\nIn the end, I want clarity. The current system simply works based on hidden variables that, imo, would better explain the matchmaking system. People complain about fighting higher divisions all the time for example, ignoring the small difference in MMR they have and blame the system for \"unfair\" games.
