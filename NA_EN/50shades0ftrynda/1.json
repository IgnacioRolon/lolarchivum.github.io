In the old draft pick, you were stuck supporting 1/5 of your games generally. I queue as mid/support and support less than 1/5 of my games. I have been autofilled once as jungle.\n\nThe decreased queue times are definitely worth occasionally being filled to another lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"50Shades0fTrynda","date":"2017-02-15T12:42:59.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In adition : i never saw worser supports on ranked than those after autofil came to the  scene ... and whats the irony of it , supps were never easier , just look the gold income items ..not even to mention redemption and items alike \n\n\nunfortunately not many people wants to talk about  problems (rationaly), not only on boards.... people are weak in general nowadays :/\n\n\nits hopeless ... case closed :)\n\n {{champion:30}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tentacle Advisor","date":"2017-02-15T09:58:10.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lost me at...\n\n> ...supp role is just to feminine...","replies":[{"poster":"50Shades0fTrynda","date":"2017-02-15T12:02:19.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is your point?","replies":[]}]}]}
