And my ping stays that high for around 2-3 minutes. Now i have no idea if its the game cause it started around once the patch hit or if its my isp (Charter) And i have no idea how to check without going ingame then once the ping spike hits tab out and try a speed test or something. So how would i check whos end this is on? I should also add sometimes my ping spikes up to 500 and i just start attempting to recconect","replies":[{"poster":"Megagig","date":"2016-08-27T19:26:57.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if mines fixed or not but my first two games today had stable ping with only minimal packet loss.

I'm a charter customer and these lag spikes have been happening for a few days. It happens every game and around the start of lanning phase.
