I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so we can ensure there aren't any conflicting network settings locally.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Psychotic Jester","date":"2016-12-10T05:39:03.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If that were true, then you would assume that it wouldn't work on another device under the same network. My brother and I play together on separate laptops and it'll happen to me every other game while he is completely unaffected. He also hasn't updated to the new client so i believe it has something to do with that.. I've lost a handful of ranked matches because i was unable to reconnect after champ select. Sometimes it'll show up with a message saying retry or cancel and if i click cancel im able to click reconnect and get back into the game before my team remakes. Other times the message doesn't show and i'll reboot league or ill log off and back on, on my laptop and try to get back into the game before my team remakes... but then a handful of times already i wasnt able to reconnect until it was too late or unable to at all... I can log onto my brother's laptop and everything runs smoothly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cresylic","date":"2016-12-08T05:50:06.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing is happening to me its so annoying","replies":[]}]}
