If you're at the extreme ends of the MMR spectrum, either high or low, it can take a while to pair you up with others. You may want to try testing what your queue times are like depending on what time of day you play, as there may be more players online at your skill level during specific times.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
