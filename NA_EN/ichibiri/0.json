That shows two things:\n\n1. Nobody likes being called unskilled.\n2. You are, unfortunately, hypocritical.\n\n---\n\n> Anyways you replying to every one of my posts, I take it I struck a nerve in you because you know deep down its the truth.\n\nWhat is it that you're calling the truth, exactly? That all matches require one person to be a leader? That Riot's trying to quash your freedom of speech? That players with differing playstyles should be considered \"breaking the rules\"? Or, was there something I missed?\n\nSay what you will, but it's pretty hard to strike one of my nerves. It takes something obscenely irrational or plain ignorant to do that, and even then I wouldn't bother responding.

Do not spam it needlessly.\n\nI can say \"fuck\", \"shit\", \"damn\", \"son of a bitch\", etc. 'til the cows come home in a match, as long as I'm not saying things like \"fuck you\", \"you piece of shit\", \"you are the worst damn player I've ever seen\", \"you're a son of a bitch\", etc.\n\nWhich is my point:\n\n> That roughly means that there is stuff that players are allowed to do/say that may not be palatable to others. Cursing, for example.\n\nSome people may not like cursing, for various reasons. Some folks are perfectly fine with cursing, so long as it isn't in excess, and then there are people who are A-O-K with people using \"fuck\" between every word, using it as an article, a punctuation mark, and several other grammatical tools.\n\nAnd Riot understands that they can't prevent cursing, so they won't. They can't even really prevent harassment or abuse, either, but - as it's against the rules, they're more than willing to cut it down wherever it crops up.\n\nAlso, your analogy is strange. \"xyz\" has no ascribed meaning to it, but even still, as long as you don't direct it spitefully at anyone or spam it, you're generally free to use it.\n\nUnless, of course, you're using \"xyz\" as analogous to hate speech - in which case, regardless of whether or not you direct it at anyone, it is still extremely harmful and extremely toxic. Hate speech is its own category because it's derogatory speech used to single out and abuse, deride, and dehumanize people of various lifestyles or ethnicities. There is no excuse to use it.\n\n---\n\n> If you are scared of snakes, would you go to a herpetarium known for snakes? In normal circumstances, NO you would not. Likewise, if you are afraid a bad word is going to hurt your feelings or offend you, you shouldn't put yourself in those situations.\n\nLet me put it to you this way - my analogy of \"you shouldn't go outside if you can't take a punch to the face\" was said because in general, both the real world and League of Legends have rules. People and players of both are expected to abide by those rules.\n\nSome people can take a mean hit. Some players are generally unaffected by words. Some people can't suffer a punch, just like some players may be affected by other peoples' words. However, it is a general rule that you shouldn't have to deal with either.\n\nYou're not allowed to go out on the streets throwing suckerpunches at folks, just like you aren't allowed to go into the Rift and start harassing and berating people.\n\nThis isn't about \"fear\", this isn't about \"people's feelings\", this is about _**the rules we're supposed to follow**_.\n\nIf you can't follow the rules, then get out. Simple as that.\n\n---\n\n> I understand Riot policing words. But you can't just let users off the hook every instance.\n\nThey're not, and they don't. Riot has a set of rules that all players must abide by. Those that you say get \"let off the hook\" are people who are actually following the rules. The people getting punished are breaking the rules.\n\n> It is a two way street, they also know what they are potentially signing up for, even if that is not what Riot wants to be known as or what is common.\n\nThe reputation League has for having a toxic community is one of two things they know they're signing up for. The rules create the expectation that toxic players get punished. Players are signing up for a community that may not be the best, but one that Riot is actively weeding out for bad players.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-12-17T06:33:24.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Replace xyz with K.. except directed at no one. just used to vent frustration.
