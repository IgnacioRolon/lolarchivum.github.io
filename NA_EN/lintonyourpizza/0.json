This season, I'm just in bronze 2. But I've been really enjoying 3v3 lately, so let's say I drop playing 5s ranked all together, and by the end of the season, I'm placed in gold for 3s. Will I still qualify for the gold rewards even though I only did it on 3s instead of 5s? \r\nI know it's a dumb, weird question, but I'm just curious lol","replies":[]}
