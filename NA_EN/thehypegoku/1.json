I am now 5-1 because of that loss. Just curious if that's going to push me to doing a required 11 games for promotionals or if it will still keep me at 10. Also curious how much that will hurt me if it's my only loss out of all my promotionals. Thank you.\n\nAnd PLEASE respond. I'm asking kindly and just for clarity's sake. I know there's nothing you can do about it for me individually but I would love to know where I stand on these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-09T05:54:16.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were the player that triggered the remake then it will count as a loss in your placement matches. The known-issue listed on the [Service Status Page](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) shouldn't affect you after the first time you hit the *Reconnect* button. If you're continuously having issues connecting to games, then this is more likely caused by a poor connection to the servers, and I'd recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the potential causes.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you continue to see these issues after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHypeGoku","date":"2016-12-09T22:53:29.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So because a fix that another player found (which is to press cancel) did not help ME, it's therefore my computer's fault. Even though the original issue stems from Riot's side. That doesn't seem like a fair assumption you've put on me and others on this support forum. I understand you're trying to help, but when this is an issue that's being seen across the board, you can't honestly sit there and really think it's somehow our connection. Especially when this is the first time it's happened and we don't know the success rate of the 'cancel' \"fix\". Anyways, thanks for letting me know. I think a tip that would be helpful is that if you guys didn't have such generic answers and tried to not deflect blame to people who are obviously upset/salty about the circumstances, you would see a little more thanks from players.","replies":[]}]}]}
