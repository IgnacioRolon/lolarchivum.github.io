Thank you for the response. Some1 wanted to go mid soraka with exhaust cleanse (most likely upset and intending to intentional feed) so definitely worth the dodge lol!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-21T09:51:18.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like I'm repeating myself, sorry, but you (or others Reds, not sure) keep down-playing this...\n\nA dodge counts for MORE than a loss. As DTN said, it makes you lose completely your free win from Promo Helper. A simple loss wouldn't do that.\n\nGiven that a dodge in Promo Series was already more punishing even before Promo Helper (it was a full loss instead of just a -3 LP outside of series, and for good reasons, I don't contest that), maybe the **triple** punishment now that Promo Helper is out is a bit much...","replies":[]}]}]}]}
