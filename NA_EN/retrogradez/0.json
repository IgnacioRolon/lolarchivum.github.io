After fiddling with the graphics and not being able to fix it in game, with my regular resolution 1768x992 acting buggy, I decided to exit the game and change the resolution via the .cfg file. I changed the settings to 1768x992 and made sure there were no weird settings in this area, reloaded my game, but again as it hit the loading screen it automatically reverted the resolution back to 1024x768 and windowed. I tried using the repair feature to see if there was a corrupted file or anything like that but after the repair it was doing the same thing. I decided the last thing I could try was to reinstall the game, so I did that but issue still persists. It seems every time i set the resolution to 1768x992 and save that setting, even in game, when I exit and relaunch the game and hit the loading screen it goes into 1024x768 windowed. I don't know what else to try but if anyone else has a solution or an attempt at one it would be much appreciated\n\nUpdate: quick update on what I've been able to find. I changed the desktop resolution to 1600x900 to see if that would work seeing as that resolution wasn't giving me the strange graphics tear my actual resolution gives me. Well the issue was still there. It seems that when my desktop resolution and my league resolution are the same it causes some major graphic errors. I'm really not sure how to fix this HELP PLEASE!","replies":[{"poster":"The Dank Prodigy","date":"2016-10-02T04:25:05.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a similar issue as well, i have my resolutions in game and in desktop at both 1768 x 992 and in game the screen is zoomed in and very blurry. with 1920p  x 1080 it works fine but i am not able to see the gold,kills, farm, etc along with mana and bottom part of the map. and when i have it on my normal settings the mouse is diolated along with the blurry and zoomed in resolution. i tried deleting the requested files and still nothing. this all happened after the new windows update, is there anyway to fix this? i have uninstalled the update and the problem still exists","replies":[]},{"poster":"Superfloop","date":"2016-09-22T16:04:09.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mine doesn't even do that it just crashes for me and then I have to completely reinstall the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T23:59:55.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've seen this a handful of times, and each time it's been caused by unsupported resolutions. I recommend first setting your resolution to 1600x900, then completing a config file reset with the steps below:\n\nFirst, **log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n>Delete these two files:\n**- input.ini**\n**- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these two files, leave the match, then hop into another custom match to confirm the change went through properly. Let me know if this resolved the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"THISHEIMERHOOD42","date":"2017-02-14T09:35:40.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure roit gets this and patch it.Others are faceing the same problem.http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Jx09j6U1-full-screen-broken-resolution-issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"retrogradez","date":"2016-09-23T06:02:29.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Set my resolution to 1600x900 and deleted both files but issue seems to persist. I tried a few things on my end and all I can figure out is when both my resolution and the in game resolution are set to the same setting I get a graphics issue. If I set the in game resolution to any other setting than my own I seem to have no issues at all in terms of graphics. I posted a picture and hopefully this might help. It's not just the graphics but the cursor is way off as well.\n\n[http://imgur.com/PxdNx6O](http://imgur.com/PxdNx6O)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T17:53:30.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's super weird!
