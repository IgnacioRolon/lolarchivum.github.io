Thus, in the next game I have to rebind them. I have seen a few threads about it but no one seemed to post a solution and then it was solved but they never posted the fix. It never really bothered me, but now it kind of does. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-06T00:32:14.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This reset can happen if your config is corrupted, and not syncing to our servers to save.  A config reset should fix that up:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Noot","date":"2018-01-06T06:19:58.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, that seems to have fixed it! Such an easy fix and for some reason I could never find it, tbh I probably did not look hard enough. Regardless, thanks so much for your help.","replies":[]}]}]}
