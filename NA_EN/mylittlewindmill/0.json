I love classic games and their noises as well as their history and I don&#039;t know I decided i&#039;d share how stupidly happy the skin made me :p","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-19T21:14:25.010+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can I just tell you how happy this post made me?
