He can't disengage, every attack he has is a skill shot except for his ultimate, and he can't sustain at all.  If you have trouble with him, that's on you.\n\nThe only place Veiger is broken is ARAM, and no one cares about ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"MR KIMCHI SENPAI","date":"2016-10-15T13:43:18.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"?????\n\nI don't have any problems laning him???

You can purposefully walk into it, QSS, and proceed to spanking him with any champion.  If he blows his load, he's helpless for 10+ seconds, and his stun field has a massive cooldown that is easily negated by multiple champions and a 1300 gold item.\n\nGetting picked off by his scaling ultimate is all he really has, and you can even counter that with a {{item:3157}}.\n\nHe's strong, and can become a rift wrecking menace, but he's far from over-powered.","replies":[{"poster":"MR KIMCHI SENPAI","date":"2016-10-15T14:00:42.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"??????\n\nAre you serious??

Late game he becomes a 1 click monster, but early game he is bad. If you play champions like Swain, Leblanc or Orianna, you can counter Veigar pretty hard:\nSwain's high early game damage and sustain, as well as CC is perfect on immobile targets, like Veigar. Swain can shut the game down early, before your adc can feed him.\nLeblanc has very high mobility, enough that she can quickly leave his circle as Veigar is summoning it. Her dashes/teleports also help her dodge his other basic abilities. To top it off, her early game, and late game burst is crazy high, allowing her to dash in, delete, then dash out, preventing Veigar from getting kills.\nOrianna has very high and flexible range with her ball, which can help her burst Veigar from afar. Her ult can pull veigar or others into (or out of) the circle, helping your team get kills. Even if a fight goes south and you need to retreat, Orianna's W can help your whole team disengage.\n\nThe trick to stopping Veigar is to not only shut him down early, but the game as well. Split pushing top laners can help achieve the latter. Basically the true counter to Veigar is early game pressure","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2016-10-16T03:41:24.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you sound salty, I assume you lost to a veigar?\nyeeep, he's pretty op, people still deny it tho :I\nthey say\n\"dodge his stun\" bruh, as twisted fate its impossible to make it out of the circle and  even when not stunned, it's super hard to dodge it because of the radius, the damage is insane.and jesus crhist, point and click ults make me salty af(especially execute ones)","replies":[{"poster":"MR KIMCHI SENPAI","date":"2016-10-16T04:23:41.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I honestly think I ALWAYS lose when the enemy has a veigar...\n\nRegardless of what I play and how I perform in lane.\nBecause not all 5 people can dodge his BIG CIRCLE STUN that lands an auto kill if you step on it","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-04-20T15:35:14.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just take Cleanse in lane and consider him useless.
