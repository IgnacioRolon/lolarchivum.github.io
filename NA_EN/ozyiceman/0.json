You should see the stuff that's most likely to interest you right away, and you should have a lot of control over what you see. Threaded discussion systems do a pretty good job of hitting both of those goals.\n\nIn a chronological stream of posts, you'll have a few offshoots and side-conversations, but it's impossible to see them all together in context. In a threaded system, you can see the offshoots together and opt-in to them if they interest you. Combined with collapsing comment trees, it means you have a lot more control over the conversations you're involved in, and you have to wade through less cruft that might not be interesting to you.\n\nChronological forums rock, and they're especially good for smaller communities, but we think this platform works much better for a community of LoL's size.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2013-09-17T20:20:52.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow my first Red response and it's me griping about the new community style on the new community. >.<\n\nI definitely see the advantage, but I for one have always found it overwhelming to read the most popular comment and see all the responses to it and have to connect who responded to who in the branching tree of responses. And then you realize you only read like the first comment really. >.< \n\nI personally don't like the format, especially when the names and icons are tiny, so there's no real way to quickly identify if the poster is retorting from an earlier response or is the OP or what. It makes following these response trees more difficult, especially if you're looking for a specific poster's responses.","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-09-17T20:30:18.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're the perfect person to help us make this system better, then. We want to make it less overwhelming to players who aren't used to it, and we want to make it easier to follow who's posting what. We can't do it without you trying it out and giving us feedback. When you do feel something is or isn't working, post it to http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/c/beta-feedback. It'll help us shape this platform to be what works best for you guys.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
