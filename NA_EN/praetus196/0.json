Now whenever I try to reconnect the client just says Game still in progress and no option to reconnect. I have tried restarting the client and even my whole laptop but to no avail. I am certain it is not my internet since I played a few DOTA 2 games right after with no problems.\r\n\r\nP.S. I also got put on low priority queue because of the leave.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-08T22:43:42.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still run into problems reaching specific services, like our game servers, which may be the case here.  I recommend running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to clear up anything that may be blocking you along the way.  It's really important to do that and test it in customs so you don't get an escalated LPQ.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
