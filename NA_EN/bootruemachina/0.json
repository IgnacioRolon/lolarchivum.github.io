If an account related to the email is banned, will all other accounts connected to it be banned to? This question is because the email has a previous account banned for \"third party programs\" (we all know what that means), and I want to connect a new account to it. \r\n\r\nNow before I continue the discussion, this is not the account (obviously) and I don't want any \"haters\" saying \" Wow script f*g, get outta league f**ktard\" Yes. I admit to scripting. Not on this account. It's barely level 12 or some sh*t, lol. But I want to know that if I associate an email with a banned account, will it get banned, flagged, or can I not connect 2 accounts to one email?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-28T18:12:24.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, you'll be fine using the same email address.  Even if an account is suspended, we're usually okay with players making a new account.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
