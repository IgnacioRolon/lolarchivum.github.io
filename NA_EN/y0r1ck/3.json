Now LoL has seen its fair share of employee and company screwups. We had Sanjuro insulting T1, then we had the monumental women's panel only fuck-up and its fallout - cough jump in a jet engine cough. Aside from the women's panel,  the company has mostly avoided looking foolish, but Blizzard wants to remind us they can do everything better. Check out this video defending their decision, I've never seen such a sad like/dislike ratio on youtube. \r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/lwJgr-4j14E\r\n\r\nWill Blizzard bounce back from this, and should Riot adopt similar policies? I say no, Blizzard is not coming back from their recent string of disasters and if Riot wants to avoid something similar they'll stay away from the issue, or at least do their research before knee jerk banning.
