BM is to gloat/put down players in an effort to get in their heads. Harassment is just BM that goes too far. Where do we draw the line? I draw it at repetitive, targeted, and unwnanted BM.\r\n\r\nOne thing to point out is that all harassment is BM, but not all BM is harassment.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of BM. \"Uninstall, loser\"\r\n\r\nIt'd be harassment if it or something similar is repeated after someone makes clear they don't want to engage in that way\r\n\r\nNow that I've got that out of the way, I'll try to explain why BM is good. It increases the stakes of the game temporarily and thus people try harder to win, and provides a common enemy for the team to unite against. In a ranked game, you've got 20 lp on the line, but when someone calls you or your teammate a loser it's personal. Now you're trying to win for LP, and to shut up the guy who is BM. Your whole team is thinking \"fuck it, no ff now, we gonna lose but I won't lose lying down.\"\r\n\r\nIt's like someone plugged a pair of batteries into the team, they go quiet and focus. Then when they win, they BM the fuck out of the enemy player back. If they lose, they made the enemy team respect them by not giving up, and by making the enemy team work for a win.\r\n\r\nOften when teams BM each other, it's a healthier outlet than fighting within a team. Either way you're frustrated, but when people BM enemies it paints a target on their back and your team unites against a common enemy. You want to fuck up the guy who says your top sucks, more than you want to fuck up your top who sucks.\r\n\r\nThis is my experience playing this game and other sports.

Gloating - sure. But putting players down - or, rather, expressly putting them down - isn't precisely it. There's a difference between getting in a biting comment and ragging on someone's performance.\n\n> Harassment is just BM that goes too far.\n\nNot entirely true, harassment constitutes a litany of other behaviors beyond just excessive BM, but I suppose for the purposes of the discussion, it suffices.\n\n> Where do we draw the line? I draw it at repetitive, targeted, and _unwnanted_(sic) BM.\n\nThat is an odd line to draw, IMO. Wouldn't BM, by its definition, be unwanted? Since BM is just an initialism for \"bad manners\", I can't fathom any situation where people would honestly invite it.\n\nMinor criticism aside, let's keep going, shall we?\n\n> Here's an example of BM. \"Uninstall, loser\"\n\nAaaaaand you lost me. That's not an example of BM, that's harassment. That already fits two out of the four criteria that you define as the line between harassment and BM - for one, it goes _way_ too far, inasmuch as you're telling someone to _quit playing the game and uninstall it_ over one slip-up.\n\nAdd to that that _nobody_ would want to be called a loser or told to uninstall a game that they enjoy playing, and already I'm going to call it, that's the line between BM and harassment.\n\n> It'd be harassment if it or something similar is repeated after someone makes clear they don't want to engage in that way\n\nAs Hotarµ said, not everyone is going to be vocal in regards to dealing with trash talking. You can never truly know whether or not someone was off-put by your BM, implying that what you're doing actually _is_ BM and not harassment.\n\n---\n\nAs for BM itself being good for the game, I believe there is a place for it. I can't speak to whether or not it encourages people to try harder, but BM - done right - can create some game-to-game animosity that, in some ways, is healthy. I wouldn't say it brings teams together, but there's certainly that solitary satisfaction in bouncing back and flooring the guy who was all-too-cocky in the early game.\n\nThe issue is that, like criticism, which is _also_ a healthy part of the game and many learning experiences, _**people need to learn how to do it /right/.**_ And that is, unfortunately, a skill that the community lacks, in my experience, both in regards to BM as well as with criticism.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2019-03-31T20:05:11.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference is, when you're playing other sports, you're interacting with people in real life.
