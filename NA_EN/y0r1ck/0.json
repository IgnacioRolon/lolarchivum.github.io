It worked for a whole season without giving any permanent stats. I know the situation was different, it's not a straight comparison, but still. People too often and too easily dismiss Grasp when they can't reliably proc it in lane, when that's still a good Keystone just for the in-combat healing in late fights too.\n\nSo Aftershock versus Grasp basically boils down to: if you proc Aftershock, you'll take less damage while closing the gap (but you're not sure you'll be able to proc it) versus with Grasp if you manage to close the gap you're sure you'll get a heal (but you need to close the gap first).\n\nExcept the condition on Aftershock means you need to place a delayed skill-shot with a margin of error of something like 20 units, because you want them to be right on the wall to get bumped and proc Aftershock, but still be bumped back inside the wall, not outside. Your margin of error is half the width of the wall, and your opponents even have some time to react, and even with the slowest movespeed, that's still enough time to move 20 miserable units.\n**You're basically counting on them making a mistake right here, you can't seriously say it's \"honestly not unreliable\".**\n\nOn the other hand, the condition on Grasp is just \"walk at them\", and since Grasp needs 4 sec to be primed anyway, you may not even lose any time while gap closing. And you can get multiple procs in team-fights, whereas Aftershock leaves you dead in the waters.\n\nSo yeah, I didn't straight out say that Aftershock is useless, because you played it extensively, and I didn't.
