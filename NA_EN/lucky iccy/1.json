I mean it means way more games and who doesnt love more LCS? Plus, it makes thoses teams truly matter a bit more unlike now where we praise PAIN gaming at worlds simply for managing a 2-4 record in group stage","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-12-07T19:49:15.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if one of the wild card regions starts to show a well developed scene they will be given a full region spot. And by one of the regions I mean Brazil because they seem like they would be the first if any of them do. But I am just guessing.\n\nI don't think they will up the number of wild card spots in the overall tournament though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"daniellizard","date":"2015-12-01T23:00:19.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they are really weak and even their best teams - e.g. the winners of IWC tournaments, struggle to get even 1 win in the group stages. If they do, it is against teams that are already tilted and wont progress anyway in most cases. \n\nThe current format of the Worlds also gives some restraints. Having 16 teams is very comfortable for organizing the bracket - logically wise and especially time wise :) Not to mention money wise, because hosting more games costs more money, more booked venues - etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ale non Ã¨ male","date":"2015-12-01T14:20:19.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 Yes, sadly they are weaker and they have been historically weaker, that's why they are given few spots in international tournaments. They are getting better and better, but they aren't there yet\n\n2 Increase the number of wildcard teams is possible if you are overall increasing the number of teams in international tournaments and you are also rewarding the better regions in the process  with more spots (KR for sure, CN/EU depdending on the previous more recent performances)\nAnd no, not every wildacrd region deserve a spot. Maybe the better wildcard regions like GPL, Brazil or Turkey deserve it, but Japan, Oceania or LA has still to prove they can beat the other wildcard regions consistently before even thinking about receiving any spot in a major tournament\nWe praise pAIN because they ended up with the same number of wins of #1 NA team, and they are getting more wins than any other wildcard region in history, and these are the kind of performance that can suggest that wildcard region should receive a spot, because if it was for Bangkok Titans performance someone could even argue that wildcard teams should be screwed and even the actual spots for those regions should being removed","replies":[]}]}
