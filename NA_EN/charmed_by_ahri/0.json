It froze and when I opened process manager to end the client tasks. It says not responding. So just as I was about to end the client tasks to reopen the client and rc. The game becomes responsive and forces its self to load into the game. Luckily I loaded while everyone else did. We all make it into the game and was invading lvl 1. As the fight breaks out I Q flash for first blood. And literally get dc'd. It wasn't letting me alt tab it just said attempting to reconnect. Finally it allowed me to apt tab to check my internet connection. Working fine. I check my task manager and the process says not responding. And some notification pops up as I try to click the client itself, the window, and just as it appeared saying bugsplat it disaapeares and I had to force the client to end, via task manager. Well as I relog. The client said I wasn't in a game, but wouldn't allow me to join another. So I close the client and try another relog. When I relog. This time around it says reconnect. 5 minutes elapsed and of course says I died because after 1st blood I probably stood smack dab in the middle of the fray. Then every time I tried to tell my team about this odd DC when I would try to play out the game. The game kept making all my abitilies stutter so if I used Q. It was like a .5 sec delay followed by pings. Which I wasn't clicking pings i was clicking abilities. I check my bindings and none of them are QWER. I check my internet after the game and in game and it never DCD. The client was acting weird post game. So I restarted my computer and checked my firewall settings. All is fine.. \r\n\r\nI don't know what happened or why it didn't let me fill out the bugsplat report. Or why my abilities were doing pings or why my client didn't let me reconnect without first relogging. This is so frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"SirbigamEW","date":"2017-06-02T01:54:40.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep experiancing this gpt demote three times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T22:42:14.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really strange issue!  Are you still experiencing this?  It may have been during a period of maintenance we've had going over the last few days, and it's possible that matchmaking servers were going through some stress.
