Like big, bada big boom.  Your fps issue might be due to a driver or third party issue, so I recommend using a multipass known as the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to fix this up.  If you have Windows 10, you can also disable the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which was auto-enabled in a recent update and causing issues like this.
