The biggest hurdle for AP Bruisers is the fact that they can't **actually **deal sustained damage. Since their autos are relatively pitiful, they must mimic it by stacking CDR to spam abilities. So that's one stat they need; though it implicates spamming, so they also need mana. Being a bruiser, they're likely to be frontlining, so that's also health or defense. They're bruisers, not tanks, so also scale with and need ap. They literally need everything.\n\nA lack of any of these is too weak as seen by our current \"AP Bruiser\" itemization, but all of it together obviously breaks every mage. What I think is that CDR can substitute some of these stats similarily to how it substituted auto attacks to create sustained damage. If you allow these items to break the CDR cap like Hail of Blades does for attack speed, you can get away with them giving far less AP, which makes them less appealing to mages and hybrids that'd much rather one-shot potential. What I have in mind is an item slapped with a ludicrous amount of mana(1,000+) to burn that's a core item similar to Lich Bane, but, instead of triggering damage, it should increase armor &amp; mr for a duration and/or heal for an amount based on your maximum mana. \n\nBasing it on mana keeps glass cannons from becoming pseudo-tanky like Riven does with Death's Dance, and the benefits of additional armor &amp; mr can only be felt by users that don't die instantly, aka, champions that can survive burst, which means they're probably building hp. The concept forces users to tap into mana and hp.\n\nFollowup items should heavily value mana and CDR, offer no more than 60/40/30~ish ap, and have some decent amount of hp which is pretty variable. By doing this, excess mana becomes an important stat rather than useless though implications I see are mages going this route to spam CC and Ryze, Kassadin, and Vlad being their regular selves.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-07-22T00:22:38.100+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"No.\nWould be abused by every mage and they already dominate everything.\nNerf AP Items, then release new good AP Items.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-07-22T00:32:36.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Down with Deathcap tbh.
