I've had maybe 2-3 serious games. Still, after having lost so much, I still ended in Gold II, like a tier below my peak. You on the other hand, have a mediocre KDA and are, instead of being in the top 1.5% or so, in the top 70%.\n\nNow, for your growth. Your growth may be that large because you simply don't have skill. This is supported by the fact that your level is high enough to suggest you actually play this game as much as if you were streaming, yet your rank is really, really bad. I started placements in G4, and still had more growth than you seemed to have in bronze. That would suggest that the difference between my real rank and the one I was placed in initially, and your respective set of ranks are vastly different.\n\nFinally, I play fill as well. But like every sane person knows, fill doesn't equate to equal percentage for getting any role. Most of the time it's primarily support and depending on the meta, top or bottom.\n\nDespite all this, I could literally be wrong about everything said after my initial comment, which is unlikely, but I'd still be right about the cause of your winate - trash rank, low amount of games played.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-02-16T16:17:46.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's called different accounts.

Once you have a real good amount of games on that champ then you can go around bragging about win rate.  As of right now out of your season 9 41 Morgana ranked matches you average a 71%.

It has the same problems the old passive had. The ultimate has a 0.5s casting time and a 3s channel before stunning which is a lot of time to run away or kill morgana, they want to make it more rewarding to use a good one.
