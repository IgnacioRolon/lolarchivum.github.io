My league game had crashed while I was in my ranked game. When I tried to relaunch it, and it wouldnt run. So...I restarted my computer. I come back, and relaunch the game only to be greeted with a message saying that the launcher has been reverted to a previous installment, the patch will be fixed something something. Not only did I lose my game, but I am also given the leavebuster. If anyone can tell me how this is my fault please let me know, because honestly this is just annoying","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-15T22:05:27.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your game crashed and then said it had reverted to a previous stable build, it sounds like your client might have run into some corrupted files during the game which caused you to crash. Your best bet would be to let the patcher repatch and repair the client. Afterwards, you can grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with force repatch selected to make sure you have a stable version of the client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElvenKingDORYA","date":"2017-04-15T10:49:10.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it crashed again.
