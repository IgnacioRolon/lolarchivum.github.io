Each room offers new challenges, but the solution is always the same: jump. Jumping is remixed in dozens of different, exciting ways. Celeste is the very soul of simplicity, and that’s what makes it such a beautiful game.\r\n\r\nCeleste tells the story of Madeline, a young woman on a journey to climb the titular mountain. Madeline is in a funk: anxious, unsure, and struggling with depression. The mountain is more than just a giant rock. Climbing it is an achievement Madeline desperately needs. It’s a grueling task, but one filled with purpose. Madeline climbs up, and when she thinks she can’t go any higher, she keep going anyway.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/collection/free-games-collection\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHLizp8fARo","replies":[]}
