Look how pretty and wholesome she is. She would bring home the bacon and fry it up in a pan, literally. Indian women are culturally subservient.\n\nhttps://regional.pinkvilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Rakul-Preet.jpg\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/927150504974565377/73QgklkG_400x400.jpg\n\nhttps://static.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/de-de-pyaar-de-hauli-hauli-song.jpg\n\nSome people think Hyuna looks, good, yuck. No wonder she was kicked from Cube.\n\nhttps://www.allkpop.com/upload/2019/01/content/261758/hyunajpg.jpg\n\nhttps://www.allkpop.com/upload/2019/01/content/261801/524330-43111-1jpg.jpg\n\nhttps://www.allkpop.com/upload/2019/01/content/261801/524330-43111-2jpg.jpg\n\nCan you believe Hyuna is 2 years younger than Rakul? Rakul is almost 30, and she's still smoking hot. Rakul also hangs out with Alpha males like Ajay Devgn. \n\nhttps://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2019/05/05/820358-ajaydevgn-050619.jpg\n\nFor comparison this is Hyuna's boyfriend.\n\nhttps://kprofiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1536311980_edawn.jpg\n\nI'm not gay or anything, but look at this dude. Ajay Devgn just looks like someone who would be a good cuddler. No homo. The best part about Indi-pop is that they don't have English subs on youtube, cuz Fuck you westerners, you're not corrupting this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_h1qeUcCE","replies":[]}
