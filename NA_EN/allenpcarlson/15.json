It tasted so good.\r\n\r\nBut, uh oh, Mr. Stark I don't feel so good today. That's where Athletic Greens comes in.\r\n\r\nhttps://athleticgreens.com/us\r\n\r\nVitamins.\r\n\r\nWe all need them, but there isn't any one who's got time for that, Willis! That's where Athletic Greens comes in. First off, it tastes super good. One taste and you'll be hooked, I assure you. Secondly it's got so many vitamins in it, it'll make your head spin. Including Vitamin B12. As we all know Vitamin B12 is the most important vitamin.\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's more! It also contains enzymes which help your body break down the vitamins so your body can use them. Ever take a multivitamin and your pee turns neon yellow? That's because your body didn't absorb the vitamins. Just like I am, Athletic Greens is extremely bioavailable. Hit me up on the client, ladies. My DMs are always open.\r\n\r\nThen you've got the Adaptogens. Adaptogens are basically herbs and enzymes that make you feel good. Things like ashwagandha, rhodiola, and CoQ10. Some people call them nootropics since it helps some people think more clearly and recall information faster.\r\n\r\nNot only that it's got probiotics. What's a probiotic? Do a google search, bro, it's 2020 and you don't know what a probiotic is? What's wrong with you?","replies":[]}
