Gamers were manipulated into believing a new competitive platform, that pays more to developers for each copy of their game sold, is somehow bad for gaming.  \"We want fewer options! We want the devs to make less money! Every platform has growing pains at the beginning, but Epic is Evil!\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I can't imagine this is organic. I know there are a lot of people who believe very silly things, but man, this is just overboard. People weren't just sitting there thinking, \"Yeah, this company accepted money from another company. And now I'm pissed!\" This is totally astro turfed. I wish that loud minority would start thinking for themselves.","replies":[]}
