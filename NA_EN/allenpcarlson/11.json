The biggest reason to shower is so you can get the dead skincells and bacteria off of you. If you don't you start to smell bad, so that kinda sucks, right?\r\n\r\nI have this friend who's a huge nerd, but he's also alpha as fuck so we get along. He's an alpha nerd. As a nerd, sometimes he doesn't take showers and he smells bad, which sucks. We've told him about it and he comes up with some convoluted BS excuse, you know, cuz he's alpha. He's an entertaining BSer. Not sure why, but I think he's cool as fuck even if he doesn't shower very frequently. I can't smell it. All I smell is rancid gingivitis. Which is another topic to get into, but lets stick to one at a time.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not saying all nerds don't shower all the time. Also not saying all of you are nerds. Also not saying all of you don't shower. I'm sure 100% of the forum showers regularly and smells like roses. I'm just throwing it out there. I don't want to offend anyone. I just want to promote positive hygiene. It'll make you healthier and happier I promise you. After you take a shower it puts you into perfect homeostasis, so it even makes you play League better.","replies":[]}
