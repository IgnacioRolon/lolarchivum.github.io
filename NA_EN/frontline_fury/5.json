There are 3 reasons this happens. reason 1 is that the person typing the code didn't put a quotation or parenthesis in the right place, reason 2 is that the person who created the variable @F whatever coded the box to show the variable instead of the print statement, or they're using a language that doesn't ignore white space.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-09-27T20:22:43.661+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's very true, but for some reason, some people are getting this issue, some aren't, and as I've seen from at least one person, sometimes it happens, and sometime it doesn't.

I'm pretty sure that the cause for it is due to dropped packets. If it's only happening to some players and not all then the bug is probably on the data transfer side. I've had the \"@F\" bug too and I can say with certainty that my connection while stable does run into issues because my laptop overheats or I Alt Tab a lot - especially during load in.\n\nIn the past this has caused visual issues and rendering issues. So maybe it's during that initial load in that players are disconnecting and then the UI never fully updates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Anivia OTP","date":"2019-09-28T09:13:59.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's either a bad conception \"Spaghetti code\" , it always seemed to me that riot was not very fond of the KISS principle.\nOr a change in the back system that made this feature incompatible.\n\nThe later looks to be the most probable since their engineer are trying to fix the code from ground up , but are in a struggle because they can't just remake the game entierely, they have to work one part at the time.\n\nHey @Rito TDD aint a goiod way to program on a big scale.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2019-09-28T15:19:32.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see this everytime I log in.
