Yet he has distinct counterplay.\n\nYorick is like Illaoi - the primary strategy against them is \"outnumber them 4 to 1\". That's not counterplay. There's nothing any individual player can do. No strategy, no skill matchup, no champion pick.","replies":[{"poster":"Pupel","date":"2018-03-01T19:25:27.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Frontline Fury,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dzK3Emcj,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-01T16:47:29.088+0000)\n>\n> Nasus is the same.
