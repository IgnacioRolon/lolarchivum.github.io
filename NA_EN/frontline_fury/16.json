Heimerdinger is a burst mage / control mage / siege mage that just so happens to fulfill the entire list of &quot;unhealthy gameplay&quot; criteria that other champions have been gutted / reworked for in the past. He is not fun to play against, and he is not fun to play as.\r\n\r\n1: Non-interactive laning phase.\r\n\r\nHeimerdinger puts down his AUTOPILOT turrets, up to three of them, that automatically invalidates 90% of the champions in the game. Not only do these turrets provide FREE waveclear, they have NO downtime whatsoever and easily outranges even the majority of the marksmen in the game.\r\n\r\n2: Counterplay? What counterplay?\r\n\r\nThere is no clear counterplay for Heimerdinger. \r\n\r\n* Take down his turrets? He will freely spam his spells on you and basic attack you until you die.\r\n* Attack him while his cooldowns are up? Hah, not only are these cooldowns inherently extremely low, his turrets will also deal more damage than the entire rest of his team combined. Try again.\r\n* Poke his turrets down from a safe distance? Chances are you will have to use multiple spells or the same spell multiple times to kill even one of his turrets. By the time you manage to whittle it down, he has another one ready. You will also have to give up using your spells on minions to do this.\r\n* Farm safely under tower? He will happily poke you down even behind your tower. His spells not only outrange the tower, but also have a travel time that allows him to step under it, cast his spell and then back off before the tower has time to react. His basic attacks suffer the same issue - they travel so slowly he can repeatedly basic attack you under your tower without the tower retaliating.\r\n* Wait for your jungler to gank? Even if your jungler ganks at the very beginning of the game, BEFORE you are put behind, they will encounter the exact same issues you do. Numbers do not help much here - the autopilot turrets that fire at an extremely fast rate can easily even the odds.\r\n\r\nNow this MIGHT be tolerable if he fell off later in the game, similar to champions like Pantheon.\r\n\r\nBut Heimerdinger ONLY GETS STRONGER the longer the match lasts.\r\n\r\nLategame hypercarry that can easily delete tanks with half a combo, that can ALSO split push, tank towers and go so far as take down towers WITHOUT MINIONS.\r\n\r\nThe champion has no distinct weaknesses. It&#039;s literally just &quot;put him behind&quot;. On even ground there are extremely few champions that can deal with him, and none that can go even in the early game.\r\n\r\nA champion&#039;s counterplay should NEVER be &quot;the mistakes of the player&quot;.\r\n\r\nNow why isn&#039;t this champion popular, when he easily tops the damage, cs and siege damage charts across the boards even when behind?\r\n\r\nIts simple: he&#039;s not fun. There&#039;s no real skill expression because half his kit is on auto-pilot. The champion practically plays itself - which means when you succeed with him, it does not feel like that much of a success because you know half the work was done by the AI in the kit itself. Add the fact that you don&#039;t really interact with other players - all you do is push a lane and keep them away from your turrets - and you might as well have been spectating a coop vs ai game. There&#039;s very little actual fighting or dueling going on. Due to low cooldowns there&#039;s also extremely little decisionmaking - using your ult is almost NEVER the wrong decision, because it&#039;ll be up again in less than a minute. You feel like you dont get to show what you&#039;re good for because there are simply no champions capable of fighting you - and it&#039;s not because you are a strong player.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-26T01:44:34.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nick Valentine","date":"2017-10-26T01:10:57.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimer's teamfight is very weak if he is engaged upon","replies":[{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2017-10-26T05:52:01.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nefarious Nick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PdE7njyw,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-10-26T01:10:57.629+0000)\n>\n> Heimer&#x27;s teamfight is very weak if he is engaged upon\n\nIn theory.

He is one of the 10% that can actually stay in lane against heimerdinger.\n\nWith heimerdinger's new passive, catching him outside his \"zone\" no longer matters. All he needs to do is place a turret and enjoy the massive movement speed boost that will let him outrun any champion without a dash, or their respective dash on cooldown.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-26T01:47:40.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion, Syndra, and Viegar can do some pretty funny things to Heimer too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreamerP","date":"2017-10-26T00:52:52.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you came to these conclusions after losing to a Heimerdinger as Kled?

In Diamond, its easy to say \"dodge his skillshots\", but it's not that easy in practice. As the player behind the wheel is better, there are much lower chances of heimerdinger making mistakes. Even at level 1 his turrets lets him 1v1 a top laner and their jungler with ease. The ridiculous movement speed granted by his passive means he is literally uncatchable even with red buff.\n\nThe problem here is Heimer's strong laning phase. While you may theoretically be able to catch him out late game, in practice one of your players will be so brutally far behind after the laning phase that they may not have finished their first item until baron spawns. To kill heimerdinger in teamfights, at least three players on your team have to focus him - that, coupled with enemy support assistance and heimer's hourglass equals juggernaut-tier pressure from a control mage. \n\nMost of the time, you can't afford to focus him due to his teammates. At the same time, he provides so extremely high magic damage and lane pressure that you are forced to focus him or die to his turrets.\n\nStatikk shiv might be able to take Heimer's turrets down if you go even with him. If you build statikk shiv against heimerdinger, you will not go even with him. By the time you finish the shiv he will likely be one or two full items ahead of you, and laning has ended. Even one of his rockets easily deal 200+ magic damage after he reaches 100 AP, so building attack speed and crit means you can and will die to him or his jungler repeatedly.","replies":[]}]}]}
