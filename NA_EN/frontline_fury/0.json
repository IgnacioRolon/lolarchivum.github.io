Not only is this extremely frustrating because i like to honor/report those deserving, but there's also no local fix on my machine - i've tried reinstalling the game to a new location, i've tried repairing the game files, i've tried it on several different accounts across multiple servers - the bug persists.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T16:59:50.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have[ Close Client during Game](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) enabled, which can take a bit because your client is trying to relaunch.
