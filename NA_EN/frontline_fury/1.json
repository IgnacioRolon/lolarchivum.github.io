After playing one match, the next queue will usually take three times as long as usual before showing the \"Match found\" pop-up for a brief 0.25 seconds, then instantly closing it and claiming the player failed to accept in time. The only way to fix this error is to re-launch the client, which gets tedious when you have to do it 10+ times a day, every day, for several months.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T22:54:16.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a connection problem that's struggling to transition from matchmaking services to champion select.

A quick relog fixes the issue for another 1 to 3 matches. \n\nYesterday i found out it can ALSO happen if champion select is dodged repeatedly. After 3 players had dodged in a row, the bug occured again. It does not seem to be an issue with my connection, but rather with the client itself freezing up once it's repeated the same routine one too many times. Is there any kind of software required to run the client that i might need to update?","replies":[]}]}]}
