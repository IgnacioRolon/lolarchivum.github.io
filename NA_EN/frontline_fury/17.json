It encourages extremely risky play where you are forced to basic attack opponents after using a spell (similar to a sheen proc). As a reward for the risk you take, you have a chance to steal an item (but not really) from the player you strike. This mastery does not give any combat benefits, and as such picking it means you opt out of late game power in favour of (mainly) lane benefits. \n\nIt promotes a very unique hit & run strategy that at the same time does not snowball the wielder. I think this is exactly what keystones should be all about.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2017-11-08T09:01:57.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The consumables do give combat benefits depending on what drops. \"Extremely risky\" is an overstatement. Trading in lane is the norm. It just encourages you to cast a spell before trading in the case of non mages, and an auto attack after a spell in the case of mages.
