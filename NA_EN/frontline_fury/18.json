Most of the factions in league are either kingdoms, city-states, oligarchies, with possibly some more democratic froms in the middle.\nDemacia, Noxus, Ionia, Shurima, are all factions that have their own armies. In addition to them, Piltover/zaun is a massive city-state that surely has isn't defenseless (probably relies more on machinery than men). Bilgewater is populated by pirates, with a lot of them possibly working as mercenaries. The freljord is divided by three fierce tribes of northsmen, that can make for horde-like armies, or a supply of mercenaries for other factions. \nMt.

Like Noxus vs. Demacia for the obvious choice.  Or would you go straight to all the factions at once?\n\nWould you have it a single player game, or PvP focused?  Would it be a campaign mode with a story (where you follow one faction from beginning to end) or more of a randomly generated challenge (like Civilization where you pick a faction and try to beat the test)?  Or would it primarily be a PvP situation like Starcraft has become (even if it has a campaign/tutorial, it is not the focus).\n\nHow would we differ it from other RTSs out there?  What unique element would we bring that other games wouldn't have?  Would it be the setting alone?  (Because Runeterra is unique, but would that be enough?)  Would you play as a champion, or as a faceless leader controlling champions?  Or would you have no champions at all (just faceless armies)?\n\nHow deeply would you go into the economic side of the game?  Would you go big into creating factories or other unit generation?  Would you have some other economic element, or would you forgo that in favor of a more Total War style arrive-with-your-army kind of system?\n\nFinally, as a fan, it appears, of the differences between the factions, do you feel that an RTS, Total War style, would give you what you want out of the world?

It would rely more on a network of spies than actual diplomats, but even noxus can't make war with everything around it, some you fight, some you talk. Economically it would rely a lot on tithes from the defeated nations, and a bit less from commerce, though more than demacia I think.

Also, exotics creatures and magic (something that also noxus would do, but in a different fashion). Politically it would be pretty stable, at the start of the game there could be a lot of regions that would question the divinity of azir, but once they're claimed, they won't ever question the authority of the god-emperor of the sands. In terms of resources it would be unique, in that the emperor, together with other powerful sorcerers, could be able to create oasis from nothing, but without totally bypassing the fact that shurima is first of all desert, a harsh, unforgiving land. \n\nThe shadow isles would be very interesting, since they wouldn't be a living nation. Maybe you rule as the ruined king, or as a conclave of mighty undead (some of which we may already know). Either way, you'd have to manage the flow of the mists, you'd focusing on corrupting adjacent regions, your armies would be without number, probably the most numerous, but they wouldn't be able to exist at all outsides of the mist, save for some elite squads, and \"diplomatic figures\" (wraiths, banshees or necromancers).

Yes, there needs to be action too but not as much as in modern games like Skyrim, Witcher and other.\n\nThere should be very rich character customization. Not like in Skyrim that every possible build plays the same and the only true customization is how your character looks like but more like in Fallout where they are distinct (like each route you take is like playing different game). System of skills and perks should be very rich in order to make roleplaying deep and game's world responsive to them (immersion) while also increasing replayability. Character should be player made \"ordinary\" citizen and not some kind of a champion (as it ruins whole roleplay potential).\n\nGame world should be very responsive to what character looks like, which skills player upgrades, what perks he has, what statistics he has (like if character has 3 points only in intelligence character should talk like idiot and be treated as such by others).\nI'm not a fan of turn-based action so I would prefer it to be real time like in most modern games.\n\nGame of course should be singleplayer, should have an ending (though you should have an option to continue your journey if you want to).

Interesting.\n\nNow, popular media informs me that those game styles aren't very popular - I'd be super interested to hear the reactions of the folks on this Board (small sample size and all), because I rather enjoy those games too.  Especially when they're co-op playable.\n\nSo in this RPG of yours, Octahedron, do you imagine this being a small, personal story of your character - perhaps told within a single city or location (maybe more of a Planescape: Torment thing, though that was a HELL of a city) or do you see it more wide ranging and epic in scope, visiting varied locations (more like Baldurs Gate).  Obviously, this would impact the scope of the game.

Deep into the Ionian mountainsides?  Along a Freljordian chasm?  Gazing out over a Blue Flame Isles volcano?\n\nAlso, personal question - you mention you should have action but would you support a non-combat playstyle for the 'high charisma' players amongst us?  (Or the stealth players).  Usually that's something that RPG players wish for, but it is a huge restriction on the design.

These things are rarely seen in RPG games that are released these days as they tend to be very shallow to gain very large audience.\n\n> Now, popular media informs me that those game styles aren't very popular - I'd be super interested to hear the reactions of the folks on this Board (small sample size and all), because I rather enjoy those games too. Especially when they're co-op playable.\n\nI'm not surprised because games like that require to plan how to develop your character, have a vision of how to play this kind of character and not many people play game to read tones of stuff. They rather want to do some cool things. That's understandable as this type of game is just not for everyone, people have different tastes after all and different visions of what to do with one's free time.\n\n> So in this RPG of yours, Octahedron, do you imagine this being a small, personal story of your character - perhaps told within a single city or location (maybe more of a Planescape: Torment thing, though that was a HELL of a city) or do you see it more wide ranging and epic in scope, visiting varied locations (more like Baldurs Gate).

Do I want to share a story with audience that explores various philosophical themes/explores characters? I'll go with a personal one to make scope of things smaller to focus on proper thematic/character exploration (and not compromise gameplay by that as its really hard to build proper theme-driven/character-driven story in really big games) just like Planescape: Torment did. Or maybe I want to make enjoyable story that fleshes out setting? In that scenario I'll go with an epic plot-driven story large in scale. But in second scenario we deal with a problem that as you pointed out Fallout got away with. I would solve that problem with different story acts: each act would explore different part of Noxian Empire (kinda like Diablo 2 changed its environment in every passing act).\n\n> Also, personal question - you mention you should have action but would you support a non-combat playstyle for the 'high charisma' players amongst us?

If there is a way to not kill anybody I'm for sure going that route, that's what I love about Deus Ex series (especially Human Revolution) and in Fallouts. Yeah it's huge restriction for world design but would go well with realistic worldbuilding as having something interesting or something dangerous to fight with every 3 minutes of journey makes world not so believable and makes these points of interest not so compelling or interesting (and that's what I hate about Skyrim and Witcher 3). Another problem might be how to reward these types of playstyles: you get skill points for killing, sure but how to reward someone who doesn't fight at all? You can't talk with hostile wildlife or with some people because that is unrealistic (some people just want to watch the world burn ;]) so you won't get experience for talking them down all the time while people who kill stuff will every time. Lowering EXP of fighting class would feel like favourizing certain playstyles which can feel bad for some players. Maybe go with original Deus Ex and somewhat Planescape: Torment way? Unlocking skills from exploration, talking with right people, discovering world.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-06T20:23:08.527+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I kind of like the lack of compromise with your vision here.  I've come to appreciate games that determine that they have a niche, and don't try to water down their edges (holy mixed metaphors) in order to try to appeal to everyone.  They unashamedly say \"This is a specific game.  If you don't like it, that's ok - there are other games for you.\"\n\nIt's super hard to stick to your guns with that - especially big game developers/publishers generally want to appeal to as many people as possible (due to increasing dev costs, etc.).  I can appreciate a game that is more of a 'black licorice' sort of experience.  (Or Marmite experience, if you're familiar).\n\nWith a smaller market (an enthusiastic niche) comes a smaller budget - so you need to be smarter with what you're hoping to provide.\n\nFor example - it would be wildly unlikely for a game with a budget like GTA5 or the Witcher3, to be designed to appeal only to the sorts of players who play Factorio for example.  \n\nGoing with something that looks a bit more retro (like Fallout 1 or 2) could help.\n\nI am surprised by your focus on XP though - surely you could move to a breakpoint system, more than a granular XP system to help avoid problems with avoiding combat not providing XP.  For example, you could instead of having dozens of skills to choose from, you could have 3-6 decision points that dramatically change how your character develops - and as long as you get to that story point, you get to make your choice.  Doesn't matter if you killed a million wolves to get there, or shapeshifted into one and became leader of the pack, permitting your passage.","replies":[{"poster":"Dan Squared","date":"2018-02-07T13:32:12.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somewhat off topic, but I feel like Demon Souls kind of had that idea of sticking to its guns about what kind of game it was.\nWhile the initial fanbase was small, they became enthusiastic enough that via word of mouth the game exploded and spawned the Souls/Borne series and its ilk.\n\nNot to say its easy, it certainly is not.

League itself is a microcosm; we as players get to experience the world of runeterra through brief half-hour(ish) doses. Although new reworks and champs have much longer total voice actor recording time than ever, the rarity of some lines and the way dialogue takes a backseat to gameplay hardly do justice to the world y'all are building. \n\nLeague is an exercise in a fair-gameplay-first, multiplayer experience. I think the best compliment to it, for the lore-hungry among us, is a bid from the opposite end of the spectrum: a story-driven game crafted for an individual viewer. I think about the worlds-best-built, and I immediately land on RPGs, as in the Witchers or Mass Effects of the world. That said, I don't think there's a great way to play in Runeterra from the perspective of a single champion; to do so is to express extreme favoritism towards that  individual's story. \n\nI think this is the era of GaaS (games as a service), and I see value in updates/events, but Destiny/The Division felt the need to include mmo-characteristics, which may not be necessary. \n\nLong story Short:\n\n- First Person/over shoulder camera is more immersive than top-down and plays harder into story imo\n- RPG; goal of player > avatar self-insertion; don't want to be afraid from moral decisions, players should feel they can agree/disagree with different cultural perspectives\n- Open world, but progressive\n-- This is where the gaas thing comes in - as Riot's building a world and a story, so too can this world unfold. We could have an update that pushes military camps along a Noxus/Ionia confrontation, or some new encounter scenario with champs. Despite experiencing the world as an individual player, the gaas platform allows you to tell a controlled story that unfolds over a period of time, creating a shared experience for the players in the world you've created, despite it being a singleplayer game.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-06T16:59:29.094+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, Azure Ole - this whole comment chain is opinion :)\n\nWith you being aware of the 'games as a service' model, are you also familiar with the term 'lifestyle game'?  For those reading who may not be, a lifestyle game is one that you can consume as much of as you want, for as long as you want - it kind of becomes one of your main (if not your main) hobby.  Like how playing an MMO can be a lifestyle game, or how playing something like Counterstrike can be a lifestyle game - or like League of Legends can be a lifestyle game.\n\nNow the thing about lifestyle games is that - well - you can probably only healthily maintain one at a time.  I mean, that's kind of in the definition - if it's your lifestyle game, you're probably playing it more than any other.\n\nNow some people can treat games with an ending, as lifetyle games - like folks who wander in Skyrim without ever completing the main questline (oh hai) or who go back to Zelda:BotW even after defeating Ganon to find some more korok seeds or just to shield surf (oh hai x 2).  For the most part, though, games with an ending can exist alongside lifestyle games, because they occupy a different niche.  You play for a week or so, and then go back to your lifestyle game, refreshed.\n\nYour games as a service RPG there sounds like it would very much like to be a lifestyle game, am I right?  Now that's not a huge problem, but it's a good aspect to think about when spitballing these things.  How you expect a game to interact with a players spare time (and whether they have the spare time available) is always good.\n\nSecond question/point - you talk about it being a game as a service type experience, with the world changing and progressing over time with regular updates - do you fear that this would be in danger of undermining the player's agency?  With your off the cuff example, you talk of the front line of the Noxian/Ionian conflict moving with an update - but if as a player I had spent the last week going full Xayah on those dumb Noxians - killing every single invader that I could find - would it not feel like my actions had no consequences if the update added a bunch of Noxian encampments?\n\nWhere do you fall on the player-agency/consquences vs. authored content power scale?\n\nWhat if I killed (or saved) an important NPC for a future update?  What if I had built my player-made house on the field where Galio was due to be re-positioned?  Are some NPCs given plot-armor such that they may never be killed?  Is the ability for the player to impact the world strongly limited to a few designated locations that will never be affected by the updates?\n\nThese aren't impossible questions - they are simply difficult questions that result in compromises.  Which compromise would you go for?","replies":[{"poster":"Azure Ole","date":"2018-02-06T18:55:54.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha oh God - I got so focused on mechanical niche that I forgot about player niche. Maybe I'm just projecting that I burn way too much of my time on video games? That said, I'm familiar with SaaS for businesses; we don't really have something analogous to 'Lifestyle', as our end-users probably don't want to think too much about work after they go home for the day. \n\nI think that's a great point, and personally I'm not sure I can support an additional lifestyle game. More concretely, creating a lifestyle game is, in a way, competing at least a little for longtime player investment with League. This is a problem with a curated game like this but also the frequent RTS suggestion. Weirdly, though, Blizzard specializes in Lifestyle games; you would think additional lifestyle games would be contraindicated beyond the first.\n\nThe most compelling reason behind an ongoing experience for this hypothetical game is the relationship between Riot and Runeterra/Lore. This world has developed over the course of years, and I don't see a final, permanent world precipitating out any time soon. This isn't a bad thing! This is reminiscent to me of 'realms' in WoW; as a new region is built out, it can be added to the existing world. Not that I ever played WoW.\n\nI've got a take a second to bond over the hundreds of hours I've sunk into Skyrim without ever seeing the end credits! Unkillable NPCs did stick out like a sore thumb here, though. Why do these random stormcloak camps have immortals even after the civil war?\n\nBut let's take a look at narrative vs. player agency. I think these are frequently at odds, but don't have to be. Couple of key cases, imo: Skyrim has an enormous amount of agency, but the overall narrative and gameplay mechanics suffer for it. Even more hyperbolic: No Man's Sky. On the other end of the spectrum are the games that railroad the player through experiences but gain the cinematic edge (like, idk, Tomb Raider's reboot). Even games that create choice (or the illusion of choice) can snag this (Telltale Series, Mass Effect). Freedom is great, but game assets need to be either dumbed down to accommodate (minecraft) or risk duplicity (two versions of a Shuriman town: pre and post noxian occupation). This is just what I gather superficially, though. Are there better ways to handle this?\n\nI do think the Xayah v. Noxus hypothetical is moving in the wrong direction; I think the player can take part in an engaging narrative _without_ being the deciding factor in a war. Sure, Skyrim's civil war is 100% dependent on player involvement, but Witcher 3's Nilfgaardian army feels like a (largely) separate entity (I mean, I don't think the assassination plot is necessary to enjoy the game). Building allegiance to a particular nation can be its own reward (and add to replayability to see things from different perspectives). Ultimately, I suppose it could be collapsed into a Noxus endgame vs Demacia endgame etc. But this derails the shared experience idea, right?\n\nMaybe this is better befitting of basegame + dlc, rather than growing a living world, but I'd be excited about the opportunity of the latter. I was thinking about majority rules: the more players that attack Noxian camps, the more likely Ionia ultimately wins the battle, but I'm afraid of letting a player's agency get snubbed by other players (I'm not a huge fan of community events even in League), but leaving the options out there for the leader of Noxus to be Swain/Darius/Leblanc would be interesting.\n\nFrom your perspective, how would a player interact with Champs? Do you see a player squaring off against a Galio? A Jax? I didn't think much about NPCs and whether or not they'd be alive mostly because I don't see John Doe prematurely ending one of the top 100+ most powerful beings in the world early.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-06T19:30:34.214+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Holy comment lengths, Batman.  Both of us.)\n\nSo somewhere like Blizzard attempts to support multiple lifestyle games (I believe) by both A) trying to keep them distinct enough that the player-types aren't eating each other too much, and B) taking advantage of the ebb and flow of lifestyle games.  I believe that a lifestyle game is played _hard_ for a certain length of time, and then is healthily put aside for a while.  Some players then play something shorter and completely different - others move on to another lifestyle game - and yet others will return to a previous lifestyle game that they had burned out on.\n\nThat's how I think it goes, anyway.\n\nIt's possible that the play styles of a Hearthstone player is different enough from a WoW player, which is different enough from an Overwatch player (or a Starcraft player, HotS, etc.).  At the very least, Hearthstone can be played at times when you can't be playing WoW or the rest.\n\nSo if we were to follow what we believe Blizzard does, we should carve out a niche for our Noxian hypothetical game.  Lot of people in this thread have suggested doing the 'opposite' of League - a single player non-lifestyle story-RPG.  That's an attempt to appeal to a different player-type, ofc. but runs the risk of making a game for the people who DON'T know your world.\n\nThe example of this that comes to mind is Star Wars: Galaxies.  I adored SW:G - there was a lot of good lessons in that game, but one thng that I found personally saddening was the Combat Update.  Outsiders like myself felt that with the big Combat Update, SW:G changed its mechanics to such an extent that it no longer appealed to the type of player that it had initially drawn (mostly RP/Explorer types).  They had changed their game in order to appeal to players who enjoyed combat to a greater extent - but those players had already decided that SW:G wasn't for them.  They ended up (again, this is all my personal opinion, and I have only the greatest respect for the game) alienating the audience they had in exchange for an audience that didn't want them.\n\nIn our instance, we would have to take care that the game that we'd make for our Noxus game, isn't so unrelated to the types of games that League players like, that it has too small an audience.  For example, if we released... I dunno... an ASCII-art economics simulator for Noxus, then SURE some players (you know who you are) would love that jam!  But the majority of League players might feel a bit at a loss :)\n\nGreat news is that your typical League player, I believe, is a player of games first - and plays a wide variety of games.  A broad diet.  But it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nHow different is it ok to make your game, before you actually throw away any audience benefit that you have due to the IP/setting?\n\nI guess in other industries, it'd be like releasing a Bob the Builder themed forensics kit, and being surprised when it doesn't sell like hotcakes. (This is where someone points out that it exists and is a million seller, or something.  Reality is stranger than I ever can guess.)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lupus Dirus","date":"2018-02-06T16:55:01.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of the type of world League has to offer the first types of games I consider is Witcher 3/Skyrim. Open world, magical properties, ability to change its direction. BUT with League of Legends lore also playing apart in the game itself, I believe it could be difficult to make a game that effects the lore by allowing the player to make changes through their own game. \n\nThis gave me the idea however. Back in Season 1 Riot held a tournament that was between Noxus and Ionia to determine what new boots we would be getting. This player driven game effected League on a real level.\n\nSo what if we did a game like the Witcher/Elder Scrolls level of openness, the ability to pledge ones self to a faction (or not), monsters and bandits to fight, ancient history to explore, and the ability to interact with some of our favorite champions. But the greatest addition of all is having events that could effect additions to League. Ex. In Elite Dangerous there are several Power Factions, for expansion, ship development, going to war, etc. is all based on what the players pledged to that faction do. \n\nThe outcome I am thinking is that an action from this additional game could effect teasers to new champions, add lore to our favorite champions, add new items based on the player development of the world, special legacy skins. \n\nJust a thought.

Here's a question for you that might throw a spanner in the works.  Imagine if that game got made, and it did indeed influence the progress of the lore and upcoming League things - and lets pretend that people didn't abuse it for the lulz, or that we end up with 49% of players being upset that their experience didn't influence the future of the League universe.\n\nWhat happens if I come along, a year later (or even just a couple of months later) and play the game?  The unique selling point of the game has gone away - I am too late to influence anything.  It's like players today hearing about that Noxus vs Ionia match to decide the boots - we are too late to experience that, and it's not our fault.\n\nThe big decisions we make in the game would be slightly diminished if, say, we already know that 6 months ago, most players decided to go with A instead of B.  Does it even matter that I preferred B now?  Do I feel like it doesn't matter?\n\nI mean, it 'doesn't matter' in most RPGs out there - because it's exclusively _my_ story (I don't care if you sided with the Nords or the Imperials in Skyrim, because it has no bearing on what I did).  Does FOMO mean that I would all of a sudden be a little sad?\n\nOR, maybe, you're thinking about it as a long term (or as is discussed elsewhere, a game-as-a-service type) game?  So that even if I missed the opportunity to influence A vs B, I manage to get in in time to have my decision count for X vs Y vs Z?\n\nProblem with it influencing a game as a service thing is that, I guess, around 45%+ of the time, the game is going to disagree with what I chose.  Unless the choices are so biased that they were never really a choice at all.\n\nA neat thing to check out is the graphs at the end of Tell Tale story games that show you how your decisions matched up to the average of all players.  Sometimes it's wildly skewed (You and 94% of players let someone die) and sometimes it's pretty even (You and 46% took the cookies).\n\nImagine if you were the player who always picked 'wrong'.  If every decision you made in the game, every group you backed, or whatever, was the 'wrong' one.

I also realize that modern video game design for these types of games has radically changed as our capabilities have increased.

So in different games, the different 'smartness' of AI imposes a limit on how many enemies you can have active at any one time.\n\nA game like Dynasty Warriors has AI that is almost as dumb as rocks.  They probably only have any kind of intellegence in the closest 10 AI around you - and even then their AI is probably simply \"If near player, attack.  If not near player, move near player\".  The AI further away from you probably doesn't even have that!  Probably it's so dumb that all it does is check to see if it's near an enemy AI and if so, play an animation that looks like fighting.\n\nBecause its AI is SO DUMB they can have hundreds of them active at once.  Heck, they're probably so smart with how they made their characters, that I bet the enemies behind you, off screen, aren't even active so they don't use up precious computer power!\n\nHowever, the AI in a stealth game has to be MUCH smarter.  It needs to walk around the environment, listen for the player, watch for the player with a realistic sense of vision (can't see through walls, can maybe see through bushes if it's close, can maaaaybe see you if you're poking round a corner).  THEN if it spots you, it needs to decide if it's SURE it spotted you, or if it's just rats.  (Always with the rats).

I dislike strategy and micro-management myself, favouring squad-scale front line captaineering (à la Riven’s lore) as a «regular soldier» with exceptional intelligence (due to a human being behind the wheel, hopefully more flexible than artificial intelligence.) and of course gruellingly demanding combat relying on skill, practice and reflexes.\n\nI remember a few games who pulled this concept of correctly.

THEN if it spots you, it needs to decide if it&#x27;s SURE it spotted you, or if it&#x27;s just rats.  (Always with the rats).

I dont care for button mashers like the recent Batman games or the shadow of war games. I personally feel like the combat in Skyrim can be a bit basic but there have been mods released that make it so blocking is more necessary and that poorly timed blocks or attacks can be punished harder. I think for me it is more that I want a combat where I feel that my choices matter. With button mashers it gets boring because you are just jumping around swinging and dodging. With combat more like Skyrims, the combat is usually easier to pick up and the fights dont drag on forever. You win or you lose and it is determined quickly.

So, a singleplayer game where you create your own character and the game actually has an end.\n\nIf Riot makes a game where the player only controls one (or a few) champion, then, many players would not be attracted to the new game because they dont like that champion in LoL...

No harm in it, right?\n\nI think the biggest thing we are lacking in the league lore is immersion. While the idea of a RTS is very interesting and fits the current theme of League... I think that's exactly the problem with it. We need something that changes how we look at the world of Runeterra.\n\nI would love to see something more akin to GW2. It is a changing game based on how the lore progresses and exemplifies story through landscape. What Runterra has a lot of is diverse landscapes and diverse people. I don't want a game that focuses so much on the champions of League but how we as people would fit into the world of Runeterra. This is what originally made me very sad about the summoner retcon. Being a summoner is what made you feel a part of the world and I would want something to bring that back.\n\nGameplay should be secondary to experience and story. We already have a great game for gameplay advancements. The story and the feel of Runeterra should always be in the mind of the player playing this new game. And between those two experience would be something more important. The story for the game would be important and should be good, yes, but if it detracts from the world that part should be cut. There should also be a good deal of hidden lore in the game little tomes to read, scraps of burning paper that depict a husbands last hopes when Noxus invaded Ionia, the xer'sai drawing of a child in shurima. Little extra hidden parts that make the world feel alive.\n\nIn short, the world needs to be primary to anything else in a game set in Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-06T18:56:48.973+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"(I'm having trouble keeping up with the comments.  'Pologies.)\n\nSo you say immersion would be key - that the gameplay would come second to the sense of place.  What about a so-called walking sim then?\nFew games can beat them for immersion and environmental storytelling, after all - but many people find that they go too-far along the spectrum of game/story for their personal preferences.  Where do you stand?\n\nGW2 = Guild Wars 2?  Just making sure I'm not mistaking another game for it.\n\nYou also talk about being a person in Runeterra - what fantasies would you want to support?  For an extreme example, some people might want to run a potion shop in a sleepy Demacian village (like the Atelier series, or Recettear).  Others might want to explore Shuriman ruins, Tomb Raider style.  Yet other players might want to live the fantasy of running a vicious Zaun gang, controlling territory and dealing in Shimmer.\n\nSome games try to let you do a little bit of everything, usually resulting in each individual mechanic being quite shallow or clunky - breadth over depth.  Would you, personally, want to see that style, over possibly going deeper on one specific fantasy?\n\nMost folks in this thread who want an RPG seem to fall into the usual trope of \"You play as an adventurer, go on a fighty adventure, get XP, get loot. Repeat.\"  Don't get me wrong - I too love a dungeon bash or a high fantasy adventure - but there are a lot more player fantasies out there, so many different ways to immerse a player in Runeterra.
