So, assuming he has fully stacked Unflinching as well as Legends, %55 x %30 x %15 x %45 = %85 Tenacity. Considered to be virtually Unstoppable, but Steraks is a bit wonky (you don't really have control over when it procs) and this assumes a fully stacked Unflinching, which doesn't come up often without Smite.

If it did it wouldn't actually be that hard to get over 100% tenacity and become completely immune to crowd control. It works multiplicitively. Here's how you calculate it:\n\nMorgana's Q is capable of rooting someone for 3 seconds at rank 5.\n\nYou have {{item:3111}} Mercury's Treads. Its ability lowers this duration by 30% meaning only 70% of that 3 second root applies (which is 2.1 seconds)\n\nOn top of Merc Treads, you have a fully stacked Legend: Tenacity rune. This lowers the duration of the remainder of the root by another 30% as it is a different source from the Merc Treads meaning the root will now only last for 1.47 seconds. By contrast if tenacity were additive then the root would last for 1.2 seconds instead.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out how this works, too. Like armor, additional sources of tenacity give diminishing returns and as such there isn't really much point in stacking all the sources you can get your hands on unless you're having a MASSIVE problem with the enemy locking you down with all of their CC. If you're, say, {{champion:122}} Darius, then Merc Treads and {{item:3053}} Sterak's Gage should be all the tenacity you need (With an Elixir if those two are still not enough).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Judah Bot","date":"2019-08-11T00:11:51.360+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any champion can get %77 Tenacity from mercs, Legend:Tenacity, Elixer of Iron, and fully stacked Unflinching.
