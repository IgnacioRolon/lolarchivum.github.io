I'll watch it, but I worry about experience that teams will get. \r\n\r\nAt worst, a team will play two games and go home.  Showing nothing of what they can likely do.\r\n\r\nI think of group stages as Two Game Round Robin (Each team plays each other team twice). This is like a mini-mindless playoff before the actual playoff.","replies":[{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-03-05T19:35:08.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree it should've been a two game round robin. Then we could've seen who were the better teams more accurately.
