It's their brain from when they were human, likely from their original body which is likely badly damage or possibly even recently dead. \n\nAnd no they are not the same thing as robots. Their thinking, decision making, personality, everything comes from their human brain, which is directly planted in their new bodies head. \n\nI do believe in the project world magic is not a thing, and instead is all about science. Kat doesn't use magic btw, that's only in game. Looking at it from every cinematic, every skin, every everything she uses her daggers, her wits and her skills, not magic.
