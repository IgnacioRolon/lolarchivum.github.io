Because of this I can't play league of legends so my cousin said to  install league in my usb at his house and bring it back to my computer then copy and paste the copy of league of legends. The fact is will it work? I'm not sure if it will work. I'm going to try this very soon can someone advise? \r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T22:24:30.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could very well work, but there's also a chance that some of the files don't transfer correctly or get damaged along the way. I'd suggest trying to let that download go overnight if you can to be safe. If you do try the usb method keep in mind that something may not work correctly, and if it doesn't I'd try using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a repair!\n\nThat might be a little confusing, but I wanted to make sure to give you as many options as possible ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Tennouji","date":"2017-05-15T15:39:27.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, okay I'll be willing to do anything to get this to work. Hopefully this works without any bug splats unlike like time I tried :(","replies":[]}]}]}
