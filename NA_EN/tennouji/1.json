I'm reaching out to my fellow community in hope that they can assist me with the issue that stands. I have a speed around 400-500kbps and using wired. If one needs some more info like a batch of logs I'll be happy to provide them. \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Scented CandIe","date":"2017-05-13T01:56:26.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tennouji,\n\nSince you followed the Permissions article, I assume it still persists if you right click the league shortcut and select \"Run as Administrator\".\n\nYou are certain that you do not have any protection other than Windows Defender and Windows Firewall?  If so, I might recommend scanning your PC to see if any malware is present on the system and interfering.  I'd suggest running JRT by Malwarebytes and then running a full Malwarebytes scan afterwards - Then reboot and try patching again.","replies":[{"poster":"Tennouji","date":"2017-05-13T16:14:56.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, I have set it in the compatibility settings to run as adminstator, I think no other protection is running onto the computer. Unless windows 8.1 has some hidden protection software.  I ran the JRT it just found a few junk files and the malwarebytes didn't find anything suspicious/malware. \n\n\nI'm going to try to install league on my USB using my cousins laptop then once i get home I'll run the league installer to install all the registry files and then copy the installation of league into my riot games. Do you think this will work? I was suggested by my cousin to try this out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-12T18:56:15.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which article did you try?  The issues that's you're reporting here are usually security settings with your OS or some other software that's blocking your game files from scanning.  You'll want to specifically go over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to get this fixed up.  Make sure to go through all those steps to rule out possibilities, and I know it's going to require some work but it will ensure League is added as an exception.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Tennouji","date":"2017-05-12T19:56:44.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey porocles, I did the patching issues connection issues and permissions guide step by step.
