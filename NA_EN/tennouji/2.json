We'll now attempt to repair the affected files.\"\n\nWhat is this issue and what Is causing this? I have now formatted my PC and then changed from windows 7 to 8.1 and tried to play league. \n\nThis is a step by step on what happens sometimes, but sometimes it doesn't I'm not sure why.\n\n1.  At champion select then league crashes to desktop with a bug splat error\n2. You will get the error here on the league client *Included photos*  http://imgur.com/a/UT1OL\n3. It'll repair then go back into games.  http://imgur.com/a/4hwWr\n4. Remake then report and leavers.\nor at num 3 when I try to go back it'll fail and try to repair again and it won't work it'll just keep crashing after champ select then try to repair again. \n\nI have no Idea what the problem is, I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice now and the error still persists. I've been getting this from ever since I've tried to play league on this computer, I've made tickets and they say It does fit the requirements to play league so no problem there. I have also tried the connections issues KB article and the Game crash Article, both didn't fix the issue. I have all firewalls and anti - viruses disabled like windows defender. I have another user playing league in my house fine so it cant be a connection issue. I have also done the permissions KB article. \n\n\nCould this be a case of defective hardware on my computer such as RAM? Would I need to replace my Ram sticks? \n\nPlease can you help me!, I've tried everything and all I want to do Is play league of legends but I can't :( This is really frustrating and has been going on for months now\n\nIf you require any more Information or Logs of some sort, Feel free to reply down below!\n\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Crocodile DZ","date":"2017-10-02T13:56:15.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"GLASS JAW RAT","date":"2017-09-13T15:53:11.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got the same problem, after updating newest patch.

It really sounds like your League installation is running into some corrupted files and just can't seem to get repaired successfully.
