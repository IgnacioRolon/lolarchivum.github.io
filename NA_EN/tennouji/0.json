Loading bars give good estimates, but isn't always 100% accurate.  You could be having an unstable connection that's causing your network to backtrack and grab missed files while updating.  Wait this out and let it finish patching, and go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your network for future patches.
