My time limit is up to 20 min now just because either the game bugs out and wont connect me to the game or my computer freezes on me and I cant do anything besides trying to restart the computer. \r\n\r\nAt this point I don't want to play league anymore cause I have to wait 20 mins for something I cant control and if it happens again, ill just have to wait even longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T20:13:21.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow yea, it really sucks when your game crashes and you end up getting hit with a leaverbuster for it. We need to make sure to address those crashes first before queueing up for any more games, since crashing even once means it could happen again in the next game. \n\nIf you keep getting errors when trying to connect to the game, but you can get through champion select just fine, there's probably something blocking your network from being able to reach the game servers. Try flushing your DNS and updating some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as well. Make sure to test those changes in a custom game to avoid anymore LPQ's.","replies":[]}]}
