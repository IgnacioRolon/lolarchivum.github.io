It skips the post match screen where i can see the scoreboard and stats and chat with people. is this intended or a bug ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T04:06:43.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh.....well that's pretty odd. It shouldn't be making you skip the post-game lobby just for skipping the Honor portion. Does this happen if you *do* honor someone at all? I'm almost inclined to think this might be some sort of awkward connection issue, so do me a favor and check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) really quick as a precaution.\n\nI'm also curious to see this in action if there's any chance you could grab a video of it!","replies":[{"poster":"70815577DEL1","date":"2017-12-18T02:43:59.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only noticed it when i don't honor, and when i'm playing a draft normal game that ends after the draft queue get's disabled ( EUNE )\n\nI repaired my launcher and after that i haven't seen any issue so it might've been some corrupted files or whatever. \n\nBut the other problem is still there, when i play a draft normal game that ends after the draft normal queue gets disabled, as soon as the game ends i get a popup saying '' Your team has been disbanded due to a technical fix '' Or something along those lines. Other than that it's no issue. But i love looking at the graphs / stats after a match but i can do that in the browser anyways so i'ts no biggie !","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T02:59:16.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweetness! Glad that repair was able to help, actually still really curious as to what was going on there though....hmmm ah well.\n\nThat other problem kinda sounds normal to me, as weird as that is. If the queue you were playing in goes down while you're playing, the lobby may not be able to pull any data since the queues were currently down =\\ . Still kinda sucks regardless, graphs are fun!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
