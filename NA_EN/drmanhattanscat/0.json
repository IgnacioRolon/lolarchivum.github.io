But I'm afraid I'm way to bad to play with other people who aren't newcomers/backcomers, can I somehow start over with the same account and just select a diffrent groupe of people to play with? (When you start a new account you can choose if you want to be matched with people with diffrent levels of experience or total newcomers ect.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T21:00:07.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm starting a new account in League doesn't let you choose the skill level of players that you're matched with, so it may not actually be beneficial at all for you to start a new one. If you were playing ranked, that rank will most likely have been soft reset by now as well.","replies":[]}]}
