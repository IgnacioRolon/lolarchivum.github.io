Might as well lower your surrender times because it doesn&#039;t make sense to have them deep into late game.\n\nEdit: Whether you like the changes or not doesn't make the game any less snowbally. It sucks being on the losing end and (personally) it's unsatisfying being on the winning end because of the unfair damage I am doing. ADCs needed a little boost/variety, but this is not the change we needed.","replies":[]}
