However today after i downloaded and installed macOS Sierra, my game is acting kind weird in the sense that i have these small periodic FPS drops that happen constantly like for an entire game. They're not like hard fps drops, so that i have to restart my client or mac but they just happen in quick succession and they're constant. The FPS in the top right corner does change from like 140 to 120 to 150 to 130 in a course over like 5 seconds, really weird. I tried lowering my graphics settings but that didn't affect my FPS or the drops. Usually when my fps drops i just tab out and back in and its back to normal, but it doesn't work anymore. I hope theres a solution to this or that riot is working on a fix. {{champion:74}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T03:25:00.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS fluctuations are actually pretty normal when you play with uncapped FPS, especially if there are spells or actions being taken. I'd strongly recommend capping your FPS to whatever your display's refresh rate is, which is likely 60, so try capping your FPS at 60 to see if you enjoy this setup more. You can change your FPS cap in-game under the **VIDEO** settings.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Hamilton","date":"2016-12-05T13:17:40.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I capped it to 120 and that did the trick, its stable now. It's just that I have never really experienced anything like this and just after installing the new macOS.. Thought that it couldn't be a coincidence, but all good now. Thanks a lot for the help! {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]}]}]}
