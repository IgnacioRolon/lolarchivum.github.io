I haven't heard anybody complain about it. It feels and sounds awesome to have the theme play when I walk on up in my lane. It fills me with a sense of power, which is how players should feel when playing The Grand General of Noxus. \nI also feel like it's a missed opportunity. Maybe add an option for players to check off whether they want it to play or not when they enter game as Swain? Kinda like how Dj Sona has her own thing in the tab menu. \nThis way if anybody dislikes it, they won't have to listen to it ever again, rather than just sometimes. And the people who do love it get to hear it ðŸ˜Š.\nAlso I have also not heard Swain's theme play for probably over a week now. Although that would total to only maybe 10 - 20 games ðŸ¤”.","replies":[]}]}]}
