I know that when I go into a game it won't be exactly this. I would get about 80-95 ping and I was okay with that. But recently my ping started to constantly be 128 and over. I'm lucky if it goes under 130ms. I've reset my pc uninstalled league and its still high. I can manage this just fine but it is extremely annoying.\r\nAnother thing is that today I have been getting some extremely jackass freezes in game. I can see everyone moving in real time. I switch to my speed test app and the ping is 60-70. I couldn't move at all. I had to painfully watch as the enemy team just walked up to me and made food out of me. I had also been getting lag spikes in game. This is a different problem from the freezing problem. Because when I was freezing my ping was the usual 130-150 I have to now bear, miserably. But when the ping spikes to over flipping 700ms I can move just fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinneee. Minus the lag of course.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T01:07:55.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like you're getting bursts of packet loss and high packet buffering, along with your high latency. Most of these issues come from either local network settings that conflict with League or issues along your route to the server.

Make sure to run both a speed test and a ping test to Chicago, where the servers are located.\n\nIf the ping is very high, you should contact your ISP about the issue.\n\nNo one is reporting any server problems, so this should be on your end.","replies":[]}]}
