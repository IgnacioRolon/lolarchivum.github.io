I suddenly got disconnected from a game and could not reconnect. I got a leaver buster. I went to support. They even had the message in bright red saying that they are aware that players are being disconnected from chat and when I type my message during my 10min wait to queue up, (My leaver is currently 20mins because someone dced while I was afked because I was called by my parent and the game started before I got back. Remade in my face, too.), got an e-mail saying that I would have to wait a while. \r\n\r\nFew days passed and today I checked (again) and I got a bot telling me:\r\n\r\n\"Greetings eks-hamster(not my name),\r\n\r\nThe LeaverBuster system targets players who have a tendency of leaving or AFKing in games, whether it was intentional or not. For this reason we will not remove a leaverbuster punishment on an account. Keep in mind, a leaver or AFKer can have dramatic impact on the game; even leaving for a short duration and coming back to complete the game results in a period where a team has to play 4v5.\r\n\r\n_We understand that emergencies can occur outside of our control which may take us out of the game, thatâ€™s why Leaverbuster is designed to only take action after a series of incidents have been observed._\r\n\r\nIf you're having regular connection issues, I'd be happy to assist you with those. I'd just need the following logs to investigate:\r\n\r\nA Process List: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980#wq3\r\nNetwork Analysis: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980#wq1 (This report no longer works in Chrome.

Good service on your part. Never again shall I question your more than perfect servers. Especially when I see a message on your support site saying people are frequently having dc problems. :p","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T00:02:33.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't receive a bot response, and actually the specialist who helped you out is a pretty awesome person!  Taking a look at the ticket, it looks to me like you got the context necessary for your issue.  To clarify, we don't remove [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)penalties regardless of intent.  These leaves still cause others a negative experience, and the only way to remove it is to resolve whatever is causing you to have an issue.  This also only occurs after multiple leaves and not just one game, meaning even if there was a server issue you wouldn't receive a penalty unless you have a history of leaving.  Widespread server issues would also result in a [loss forgiven](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753014-Loss-Prevented).  \n\nNA was not recently having chat issues, but they are also a separate system that wouldn't interfere with your own game server.\n\nIf you continue to experience any issues, be sure to reply to your ticket and he'll be happy to help.  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2016-08-19T13:45:53.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well any way I shall just let this pass. I want to know.

Hmmmm?)\n\nBut never mind that. I did have an issue with with some afks yes. That has since stopped. In this game I went to base and got a reconnecting to game dialogue. Randomly! I checked the rest of my internet-using applications. I checked my ping my net speed. All of it. The only thing that wasn't connecting was the league client or my game. My LB is over so I don't care too much about that now.\n\nAnd as I said I went to the site and it said _you_ were aware of issues of chat not connecting. With that fact and the knowledge that I could reconnect and also had a dc in my next game, yeah, I can see how the issue is on my side. Well have a great day. Hope I never have to deal with you again. Don't take that as an insult. I simply mean I never have any issues plaguing me again.\n\nGood by and thank you for your help. You solved _all_ my problems.

You're better than full magic pen Yi support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-08-19T01:45:17.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you think it's Riot's servers, you don't understand how the actual infrastructure of the internet works in any fashion.","replies":[]}]}
