The problem is that we can only make it there on Sunday and since we will fly in early in the day we will not have a hotel room ready for us. Basically this means that we will have nowhere to store our luggage. I am here asking if there would be any way to have you guys hold it for us in a room during LCS so that we can still enjoy the games. We would really appreciate it!! We just want to make sure that we can have somewhere safe to put our luggage during the games. \r\n\r\n Thank you for your help ^.^\r\n\r\n Novax","replies":[{"poster":"PwnLove","date":"2015-05-18T22:26:36.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Novax! Right now, we don't really have a space to store luggage at the LCS studio but your hotel should let you check your bags even if your room isn't ready yet.","replies":[]}]}
