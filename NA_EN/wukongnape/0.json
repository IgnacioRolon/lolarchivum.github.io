So i restart my launcher and then it says \"Sorry! We've detected some possible data corruption in your installation. Would you like to repair the affected files?\". So i click fix files then it works again but then it will happen again after a couple of games. I uninstalled then reinstalled league and still same problem, ive even restored my computer and now it does it again. I really need help so if any of u have suggestions or know what to do please tell me thanks. And its really bs cause i lose lp cause of this like i don't even want to play ranked because if this happens ill lose lp. I was one game away from going into promos, but I got bugsplatted and after that my \"files got corrupted\" and got a 20 min queue. This is bullshit because I have a custom made pc and I run at 70fps.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T23:29:32.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats and continuous corruption of your game assets are typically an indication that there's something going wrong with either the installation of League (not default directory) or with your hard disk (failure).
