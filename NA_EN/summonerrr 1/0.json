You ALWAYS need more vision, not only Sightstone gives you infinite wards, but it also frees up your trinket slot to get something like a Sweeper to help map control further. All the AP or AD in the world won't matter for shit if you can't see whether or not they're all piled into a brush waiting for the first dipshit to move next to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-07-22T21:59:45.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The W vision thing is just ridiculous. You can check a bush, but you can't see if the enemy is attempting dragon, or doing baron, or invading, or flanking, or ganking, etc. You have to at least be expecting an enemy to be somewhere to check it with W. Wards are to prevent you from being surprised, when you don't have any expectations of enemies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-07-22T17:22:35.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The W vision comment is laughable.

ONLY if you're playing a support that can snowball into a force to be reckoned with would I ever even think of suggest buying an upgraded stealth trinket instead, but the situation should never come to that.","replies":[{"poster":"TotN Titan","date":"2015-07-23T05:21:53.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to this, it's impossible for you to keep your ADC safe and fed if you don't have full vision of the area around you. You need to know where the enemy jungler is or if the mid-laner is roaming down through the river to provide a gank for the other team. I don't care if you are using 225 gold every time you return to base just to get 3 new wards, but you need to have that vision to do what you're supposed to do. And the sightstone provides a very cheap way of roaming and placing down wards to help out your other lanes too.\n\nAlso, even as Morgana, who can really carry a game herself once she gets a Zhonya's, I would still have a sightstone until the end of the game. I might have to sell it 50 minutes into the game to buy a Rabadon's Deathcap, but even if I did, I would purchase an upgraded stealth trinket before I left base to still provide the vision we need to keep ourselves safe and also keep an eye on important objectives.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-22T22:04:10.482+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"A support without SS and sweeper is a fail support.

Given equal levels of competency on both sides, the team with the better vision usually takes the first lead. It allows your teammates to make wiser decisions and less mistakes. It will improve their skill shots and consequentially their damage output, positioning and overall play. Also ADCs rely on auto attacks to deal damage. They cannot deal damage on what they cannot see. If you ward dragon you can converge on the enemy team mid dragon and either steal it, kill some enemy champions or both. All for the cost of a measly 800 gold that becomes a very wise investment. Always buy this item.\n\nAlso if Thresh is burning his lantern as a vision spell frequently he is gravely misusing that lantern. His ADC now has less mobility and that lantern can be used to fake a jungle gank. Thresh will also run out of mana much faster which will lower his ability to hook and flay thus lowering his presence in lane. The times you use lantern for vision is when you KNOW something is in bush and you're all out of wards. Like after you killed the ADC and the enemy support is going into a bush to buy time on their cooldowns so they can take down either you or your ADC with them. Thats when you use lantern so as not to lose sight of them and remove that fog of war out of the equation. Frankly put, the player behind that Thresh is indeed an idiot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zoar","date":"2015-07-24T00:35:59.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can make it to level 9 as support without buying 7 green wards then yeah as long as you make use of the extra combat stats somehow.

If the sightstone was that good as many claim, there would be NO good reason to not buy it on EVERY champion. People who turns aggressive against a support with no sightstone should just buy one.\n\nVision is GREAT, don't get me wrong, I buy asap a {{item:3361}} on every champion I play no matter the position and make sure I use is as often as i can. However.\n\n1) There is other way to gain knowledge of you opponent position. You can apply a sane pressure on your lane so your opponent at least have to stay at his lane. You can predict better the movement of the opponent based on the information you had.\n\n2) There is a cost linked to leaving your lane to ward anything else then the bush in the river (which could be covered by level 1 trinkets). You lose exp, you lose gold, you lose pressure. Again, i'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying you can't hope to make anything close to 75g ward per minute without also expecting your adc to have to pop a hp pot or two every time you leave him like this.\n\n3) There is several case where a well chosen core item on a support is superior then the ward and hp generated by the sightstone.\n\nWhy people swear sightstone is so good is a matter of visibility. Wards are visible you can see and feel how much they gave you, 100% mana regen, not so much. And that's what cause a sever bias toward flashy items and summoners spell.\n\nTL;DR: If you think the ss is SO good no support could possibly think about another item, well you have to explain to me how the hell it's not the case for the mid laner ? The mid laners is in the middle of the map, he have to roam twice less to make a proper use of all those wards. Why wouldn't they have one if it's so good ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2015-07-23T09:35:43.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vision is everything in this game......you can't do anything safely without it.
