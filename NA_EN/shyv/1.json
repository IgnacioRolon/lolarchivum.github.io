Just saying Sona is the only type of support of her kind, as in her kit is special and different from the others.\n\nExcept the problem is that Sona is not the only of her kind, more like just one of three of her kind.  Her kit isn't special and it's nearly identical to at least 2 other champs currently.\n\n{{champion:267}} {{champion:432}} \n\nTime for a history lesson:\n\nPatch 3.14, the entire support class got \"reworked\" which ended in nearly every support receiving nerfs without suitable compensation.  As a result, this ushered in the dawn of mid-laners being played as supports as they didn't suffer those nerfs because they weren't considered supports at the time.  Of the supports that took the most severe nerfs, were Taric and Sona.  This directly pushed Sona out of the meta and pro players stopped playing her and began playing: **NAMI**  She had more pre-6 CC, stronger mobility, superior sustain, greater damage and a better ult.\n\nFor a time, Nami was played as THE go-to sustain support, being specifically picked into Morgana and Janna lanes, while trying to avoid Braum.  This continued until one day, a new face entered the fields of justice: **BARD**  While to this day, people remain constantly skeptical of him, he emerged on the pro season immediately after release, even before his first round of buffs.  With blatantly higher stats, a more versatile and longer-range ult and a stronger kit with potentially infinite scaling, he continues to make his appearance known on the rift in the professional scene.\n\nNowadays, Soraka has taken the top spot of sustain supports, but she lacks the mobility and low-cooldown **single-target** damage of generalist supports.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-01-13T06:47:06.357+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I think she is one of her kind because Nami and Bard don't have everything she has, and she doesn't have some of the things they have, so that makes them all different.\n\nLike whoever said it on my hugely downvoted for no reason thread, they said that Sona is the only one of her kind because she brings a whole lot to the table, and if they delete her they would lose the teamfighting capabilities and stuff that she brought, and would have to replace that, so its in the game's interest to keep her.\n\nThat was what I was trying to say. Sona has her own unique traits and abilities that most don't have. Some are similar, but still different in their own right.\n\nTo me, the Bards I've gone against/played with, only a handful have ever been good. I don't watch the pros much, and any videos I watch are the funny streamers like brofresco. So I don't know how well Bard does, but I still think he's not that great of a champ to me.

As I already mentioned, patch 6.1 is NOT kind to her and brings yet more indirect nerfs.\n\nWith the FQC nerfs:\n\n* Her mana problems return.  As one of the hardest mana-gated champs in the game, she could only just get by even with +150 mana gen and she will once again go quickly OoM in prolonged situations.\n* Her poor CC yet again becomes a hindrance.  As the only support without reasonable CC outside of her ult, ghosts were the only thing barely keeping her from being instagibbed every other minute.  Even her ult does an unimpressive mediocre job at this and once again she'll be burning its unusually long cooldown on enemies literally already on top of her.\n\nWith the Ferocity buffs and Precision nerf:\n\n* Non-supports' damage increase, while her's decreases.  She gets it from both ends with this one, pressuring enemies less whilst she feels the weight even more than before.\n\n---\n\nWho knows though, maybe Meddler will see her these indirect nerfs and raise her some direct ones of his own, as he's already threatened.  If we're lucky, this'll cause a few bleating sheep to take off their blinders and realize what the players of yesteryear already knew.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yuzuki Yukarin","date":"2016-01-13T03:29:05.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeolian Melodies,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2tNhNF4M,comment-id=00050001000000000002,timestamp=2016-01-13T03:22:30.926+0000)\n>\n> He's \"the best Sona player\" because he plays her mid lane, which equates to high amount of kills and CS, which are stats that lolskill values a lot when calculating \"skill\" - however these are 2 things support Sona does not strive to achieve.

However, for a very long period of time, he was one of 2 of the top 4 Sonas actually willing to still play League and even then the only one willing to play ranked.\n\nWhile you and Codesave seem to be back in the game again, it's pretty clear your per game averages' aren't nearly what they used to be pre-4.13, even despite struggling against the inevitable and leaning on the crutch that is Artificial Damage.

And once teams start to group up, if there isn't another source of magic damage in your team, you'll be screwed.\n\nThat being said, it's \"just\" off-meta and not a complete troll pick. In the right team comp, it can be very effective. Think Jana support, Ezreal ADC, Nidalee Jungle, Mundo top, and you have an horrible poke comp, with a lot of sustain and disengage possibilities, and a good mix of damages (maybe a bit too much magic damage, but still a decent amount of AD with Ez and Mundo in melee range).","replies":[{"poster":"MissMikasa","date":"2016-01-13T16:15:54.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing she has over other mid laners is that she can heal the poke back up that she receives and then bam hit them back.
