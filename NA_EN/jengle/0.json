I go to the store, and it says I don't have enough RP/IP to buy zed. I clearly have enough IP, yet it won't let me purchase. I've tried restarting, waiting awhile, and it still doesn't work. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T23:03:19.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your IP may not be showing accurately if you're on the updated client.  Try the legacy client instead to get sync'd up:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"guiguichameau","date":"2016-12-16T22:10:40.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i bought 3 champion shards in the store with my ip and they dont appear in my loot yet my ip is spent","replies":[]}]}
