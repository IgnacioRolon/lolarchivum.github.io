A popular proposed idea was to give 3 new refund tokens every season. The logic behind leaving it at 3 refund tokens for life is that eventually, you will get all the champion content anyways, and you should be trying champions out on freeroll. Yes, you may not like your Karma purchase, but if you keep playing and get all the champs anyways, why would you need a refund token?","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-10-21T17:56:30.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"because skins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kyanasan","date":"2016-09-22T18:43:33.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but umm lvl 30 is the maximum and lvl and I agree there should be more refunds but  I think we should be able to buy them with IP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gandalf the Dark","date":"2016-01-27T14:32:27.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just thinking myself it should be 3 refunds every year/season (guess it's the same thing). I know I made a rash decision on my second ever day playing buying a champion with RP, so I refunded. I didn't know the game as well then as I do now even as much to know you earn IP and can use that. Either way, for whatever reasons, 3 refunds for entirety is not right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"manuel100","date":"2015-03-23T16:32:22.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot needs to make like every season they give u more 3 refunds","replies":[{"poster":"Gym Leader Yaki","date":"2015-06-02T16:05:06.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=manuel100,realm=EUW,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Wu14Fr7j,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-03-23T16:32:22.276+0000)\n>\n> riot needs to make like every season they give u more 3 refunds\n\nAgreed!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-10-21T17:55:49.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what happens when you reach lvl 30?  will you not get any more refunds?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Someone360","date":"2014-05-31T14:33:36.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dear god riot please give out more refunds it makes no sense giving 3 refunds for life please give back more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goldenfishy","date":"2014-10-21T18:02:11.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I also want a refund on my 3 year old laptop.","replies":[]}]}
