I have no way to reset it (for the same exact reason, can only move via grey bar and it&#039;s off screen). It seems to persist between computers, so it must be part of some server-side or persisted_settings.json or something. The *only* way to solve it in-game is to be able to change to a higher resolution so that the chat window grey bar is visible and move it to where I prefer it. However, I can&#039;t do that when I go from higher resolution screen/computer to a lower one, hence the problem.\n\nUnfortunately we can only move the chat window by clicking on the grey bar while in chatting mode. If I could click ANYWHERE in the window and drag it, problem solved, because I can see at least part of it. If I had a way to &quot;reset&quot; the location while in game, problem solved, like reset to top corner or bottom corner. Unfortunately, neither of those are possible.\n\nI am playing on Macs, but this isn&#039;t related to Mac, it&#039;s related to settings being persisted server-side that are used when changing machines/screens:\n\n* I have Mac Mini connected to a Projector (+ Screen) that is 1080p or 1920 x 1080\n* I have iMac that&#039;s 2560 x 1440\n* I have a MacBook Pro Retina which is 2880 x 1800 (but I downscale it to 1920 x 1200 usually)\n* Sometimes I play on external monitor that is 1920 x 1200 I believe\n\nAs you can see, because of all those resolutions, most of the game interface is fine, except, the chat window, which I tend to like near top of screen out of the way (in corners), but that seems to be the problem.\n\n**ALSO ONE MORE COOL SUGGESTION:**\n\nWhen in chat mode, put a thin line around the entire screen, can be something dim like a #777 or a #555 but enough to be visible or subtly noticeable. How many times do people realize mid-fight that their chat message is \n\"EQEEWWERRRRRasdfFFFFFasdfasdfqwerqwer....\", sure it doesn't happen as much for experienced players, but it's definitely not Visual Obvious that you are in chat mode until you're near dead or well dead.","replies":[{"poster":"bluefyr3","date":"2016-05-26T18:38:23.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure that last suggestion would help newer players a ton.
