Is he not strong enough without it? Is a million little void creeps he spawns, the AOE silence and the single target suppressing ult that only the suppression is QSS-able (not damage) not enough?","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-07-21T02:44:19.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a unique way to allow him to be in range to do damage. Vlad has his sustain, Lissandra has her ult and her e for getaways, Karthus has his passive to do extra damage, Malz has a passive that ceases to exist after a second(1/4 of one this next patch). It is not that powerful, just aa him when the jungler comes in for a gank or pick a non-burst person to counter him.","replies":[{"poster":"bluefyr3","date":"2016-07-21T05:18:07.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's had a ridiculously high win rate for a few patches in a row, I think it's just one thing that could be taken off of him","replies":[]}]}]}
