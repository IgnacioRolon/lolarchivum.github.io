I think anything Warhammer Space Marine inspired would look incredible on Mordekaiser, his armor is almost asking for it. My specific idea is a [Space Marine Chaplain](https://i.imgur.com/wGTfaXY.jpg), who are somewhat of the Chapter's spirit and soul. They are very skilled in melee combat and almost always have hammer-like weapons to pound the hell out of any heretics or mutants they come across.\r\n\r\nWarhammer just seems like a no-brainer as far as Mordekaiser skins go and I'm suprised he doesn't have one already.","replies":[{"poster":"Silvarspark","date":"2019-07-01T09:09:52.489+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dreadnova Mordekaiser then...","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-01T01:40:34.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Morde doesn't have a Warhammer skin because Riot doesn't own the Warhammer IP.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-07-01T09:13:43.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't have to be exact copyright infringing stuff.
