No exact ETA on fix yet, but hopefully that helps isolate your issue. \n\n>If you're looking to queue up and have additional questions, please see the FAQ: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ\n\n> **NOTABLY**, placements this season will take into account what you placed last season and does not default you to silver unless you were also unranked last season. **TL;DR** - Diamond is still diamond from last year and can't queue up with Silver.\n\nHi Guys -\n\nWe&#039;re noticing some players aren&#039;t able to get into game when they hit the Find Match button. Reports are saying that some pre-mades aren&#039;t allowed to match.\n\nWe&#039;re working on getting it resolved. If there are other match making issues where you can&#039;t get into game, let us know what they are and what exactly is happening. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Real MVP","date":"2018-01-22T21:27:23.670+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is this thread marked as resolved?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhia","date":"2018-01-16T22:06:30.336+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Goodluck on the fix!
