Even though it can't be viewed, rest assure that your games are still being logged and no data is lost here. We're still working on the issue, but as of right now, we don't yet have an ETA. I'll update you as I we find out more.\n\nSome further updates may also appear [here](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na).\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Mr Sope","date":"2017-04-06T07:02:46.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Update] Match History should display previous matches again.
