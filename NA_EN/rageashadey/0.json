Ip boost removal","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot removed the ip boost for one real reason. It takes away the amount of money they can make on people buying champions. If there is a choice between buying an ip boost then farming bot games to get enough ip to buy champs to play ranked and spending money to buy champs to play ranked, which do you think people would rather spend money on?\nIt costs at the cheapest about $55 to buy the 8850 rp points needed to have enough champs to play ranked. \nIt costs about 16,650 ip to buy enough champs in order to play a ranked game.\nGiven the fact that the amount changes from beginner and intermediate and also what lvl you are I&#039;ll say what it takes for bots on intermediate from lvl 20+\nSo intermediate bots 20+ minute game at lvl 20+ gives you (minus the first win bonus) 45 ip.\nSo. That means *mumbling 16,650/45 carry the one. add pie *mumbling* a^2+b^2=c^2*mumbling*\nHOLY!!!\nSo that means you would need to play 370 intermediate 20+ minute bot games.\nWhich is about 124 hours of gameplay. \nYou would have to win everyone of them too. (cause there are botters that just farm ip regardless and they are shit in game.)\nSo. 124 hours of gameplay or $55? \nWhich would you choose?\nAlso I would like to mention that that is from lvl 20. It&#039;s not including how much time it took to get to lvl 20 in the first place. so yea.\nThe reason i&#039;m not including that is cause if you wanted me to I&#039;d have to include the costs of buying runes to actually be good in ranked as well. \nWhich I could. Then I&#039;d have to add the xp it would take to get to lvl 30 from lvl 1 since all of that would play a part in that. \nIt looks like things are broken up in xp and ip depending on lvl.\n1-9\n10-19\n20-29\n30\n\nAs a quick overview if I was to calculate the amount of extra time you would have to spend without any boosts to get to lvl 30 with enough ip to buy all the champs and all the runes you would need I would need some things.\n1-9 ip/xp amounts for 20+ minute games\n10-19 ip/xp amounts for 20+ minute games\n20-29 ip/xp amounts for 20+ minute games\n30 ip amounts for 20+ minute games\n\nAverage cost of each tier 3 rune\nMark\nSeal\nGlyph\nQuintessence\n\nI already know the minimum cost of the amount of champs you&#039;d need to play ranked with.\n16,650\n\nI know how much xp you need for each level too. I will list them at the levels that ip and xp changes.\n10 (  2,074 xp)\n20 (  9,163 xp)\n30 (21,389 xp)\n\nAfter typing and looking all this up I need a quick refresher on my goals. Determine How long would it take to play ranked starting from square 1 with no boosts whatsoever.\nTotal xp needed 21,389 xp\nTotal ip needed 16,650 ip (not including runes cause you don&#039;t NEED runes to play. you just need them to win. Unless you get carried.)\nTime it takes to get to either one which ever takes longer. \nThe only information i need is :\n1-9 ip/xp amounts for 20+ minute games\n10-19 ip/xp amounts for 20+ minute games\n20-29 ip/xp amounts for 20+ minute games\n30 ip amounts for 20+ minute games\n\nBut yea. so let&#039;s just go on technicalities. This will not be accurate but put a bit into perspective. \nFor the sake of calculations I will say that at all lvls are the same and go off one of my recent 20 lvl games. \nI&#039;ll play a quick 20+ game and continue editing this.\nAlright so time to do this.\n20:39 minute game lvl 21 earned me 94 xp 32 ip\nAlright lets do this.\n21,389/94\n16,650/32\nhmm. i feel my early math was off. \none moment. \nIt takes 20 minutes to get 94 xp and you need 21,389 xp to get to lvl 30 so that means how much time is needed to get to lvl 30? What formula to use?\n((21,389/94)20)/60 right? 76 hours for enough xp it seems... Not sure why that feels off but whatever. math hasn't failed me yet. XD \nNow for ip. \n((16650/32)20)/60. ahhh there it is. 174 hours. yep. \nSO!!!\nIn conclusion. Without xp boosts we would get to lvl 30 before we would get enough ip to buy the champs required to play ranked. So by taking away ip boosts and allowing us to get to lvl 30 faster that just increases our desire to buy the champs with rp. It's focusing more on making money than anything else. ","replies":[]}
