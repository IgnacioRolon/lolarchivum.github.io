Prior to this patch these issues didn't exist.\n\nI'm using a EVGA GTX 750, which I know isn't a super high end card, but I'm able to run max settings at about 70-80 fps consistently. Since 7.24, however, even though my frame rate seems to be stable (in the upper right of the screen when in game), I'm getting HORRIBLE frame skipping/stuttering. To be clear,  it will say in the top right (50-60) fps, but it feels like I'm getting less than 10.\n\nUnsure of what might have been causing this, I reformatted a computer I had lying around (decent specs... very similar to previous computer) and popped in the GTX 750. On a newly formatted computer with all different hardware (aside from GPU ofc), I got the SAME issue. \n\nI turned back to the previous machine, popped in my R770, and the game ran smooth as butter.\n\nThis mean's the issue is almost certainly the GPU and the League client. To be clear, the GPU runs flawlessly on other games, so its definitely not a faulty piece of hardware. I've also uninstalled and reinstalled the video card driver so it's not the driver software. I also ran a GPU diagnostic tool and results came back perfect.\n\nFor sake of thoroughness, I also experimented with turning on/off various graphics settings in game, as well as movement assistance, and nothing worked.\n\nPLEASE ADVISE RIOT. Game in its current state is unplayable. I don't want to resort to using my R770 because I do lots of other things with the machine than play league, and the GTX 750 is a better card.\n\nEDIT: Clarity","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T18:36:36.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I'd like to try toggling off some options to see if that might help here.  To start, see if enabling Close Client During Game in your client settings might help by reducing some PC stress.  I'm also curious if Snowdown assets might be causing some of these issues, what happens if you disable those assets via in-game options?","replies":[{"poster":"Wreckless","date":"2017-12-17T03:26:08.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither of those things worked. \n\nTo follow up, my CPU usage in game is sitting at around 12%, my GPU usage is sitting at around 36% with constant 60 fps (on low settings).\n\nAs someone who has worked as a Systems Engineer in the past, I'm almost certain this issue is caused by a conflict between the League client and my GPU (or nVidia software). Its really strange because before 7.24 rolled around, there were no issues whatsoever. Was there an update to the rendering engine in 7.24 that could be causing a problem?\n\nIf you want system logs I'd be happy to provide. Might be easier if you get someone who's responsible for dealing with stuff like this to just e-mail me directly.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-19T21:25:50.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be good to get more info so we can investigate further!

It running in the background cause alot of stuttering. Was trouble shooting Then I remembered that corsair cue caused battlefront 2 to crash and not launch at release so I checked out how the game will perform if I were to uninstall it. Completely fixed it for me.  For those of u who say it might be because i have a potato pc, I dont, I have a freaking gtx 1080ti and 7700k so it sure as hell wasnt my pc lol. Dont know if you have a corsair mice (I have the scimitar pro)but if you do. try deleting the cue software.
