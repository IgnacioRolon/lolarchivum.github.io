The level 2/3/4 melee stance early kills don't work when you're up against an illaoi or quinn or any melee damaging laner (that have brains). Especially quinn, she straight up does 2/3rds of morde's hp in 3 autos and a vault at level 1, even if he has shield.\n\nI never play morde top in ranked because of this.

Frozen Heart is less optimum than, say, Dead Man's Plate. :)\n\nNashor's Tooth is really good on Morde, as the Q doesn't go on cooldown until the last hit is spent. You will hit 6 Q's with Nashor's in the same time as a Morde without Nashor's is about to activate Q for the second time.\n\nTry Rylai's sometime, as well. It's a very decent item on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-03-04T00:14:27.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually started with a Rylai's in my early builds but didnt like how it felt.  Yeah the slow was there and it gave some AP and HP but it just feels...lackluster.\n\nWhile I respect your stance on Frozen Heart compared to deadmans I just cant give up that CDR.  Being able to spam my spells after 2 full items feels way more powerful and the extra 40 armor is very noticeable to me when trading with the enemy Marksman.","replies":[{"poster":"Azrael Jiraco","date":"2016-03-04T09:40:54.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's up to you, of course, but I would ask you to consider the health gain as well. Resistances and health scale together, not to mention the effect health has on your passive.\n\nIn theory, Frozen Heart can be a good pick, but when you consider how much gold is being spent on it... The other issue is that you're spending all that gold to counter AD. AP champions aren't stopped by armour at all, so it'll be like going without any items at all vs them, but health can help out, here.\n\nThe movement speed passive on Dead Man's is good, too. You can split a wave and come back to your team very quickly. And the CC on your first auto of the teamfight can lead to an easy front line ghost (or ADC if you have flash up or they're badly positioned).","replies":[{"poster":"Azrael Jiraco","date":"2016-03-04T09:44:23.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On top of this, I'd buy such and item 5th or 6th. Morde needs to be building at least some form of damage from the start of the game, and there are lots of good bruiser items to choose from. For AD, I rush Seeker's. 1200 gold for decent armour and semi-decent AP. Much more cost efficient than Glacial Shroud on Morde, and you don't have to finish Seeker's into Zhonya's.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-03-04T17:33:30.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not that I dont value HP, I'm just opting into it in a different way than items.  HP per level seals and the strength of ages keystone make my first buy feel better than it normaly would be.  I feel you on glacial shroud, its not good to rush so i try to buy wardens mail and fiendish codex on first back.\n\nI agree 100% that frozen heart doesnt help against AP.  However, because we are talking about Morde it does actualy have some defense due to his shield paired with 20% CDR.  \n\nDeadmans plate is a good item and its in my alternative items tab just incase i need to worry about flat true damage.\n\nOnce more I agree with you, he does need some damage to get going but its an easy work around by keeping focus on objectives and denying the enemy marksman farm with proper use of your W.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Backup4now","date":"2016-03-03T23:55:18.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can not, for the life of me, understand why so many people want to pick nashors on Mordekaiser.\nCdr is good, AS is good, the little bonus damage is nice too. \nHowever, it has several innate problems. The bonus damage is only good with lots of ap, which you cannot attain with a nashors build because doing so would render you too squishy to survive. Building it first means your q is all of your burst. Building it last means you got to late without it and it won't help. While having this item makes your Q burst good, you have to rely on getting in range for it. Getting in range isn't good because it leaves you vulnerable to attack/kiting/focus, which is bad since you're squishy since you built nashors.\n\nDo it if you find success in it, but I would avoid it at all costs. AS runes are better for that purpose imo.\n\nAnd the deadmans is good advice.

People who run Nashor's, including myself and certain other diamond Morde mains, do a tankier build. We include Rylai's and Stormraider's in our kits so hitting Q's is easy. We build around surviving enough to hit lots of Q's in fights, whilst building as much damage as we can get away with without going pop at the start of teamfights. Usually, it involves two of the following items: Seeker's, Abyssal, Rylai's or Sterak's. Then Nashor's, one more of those bruiser items, then a full tank item, such as Deadman's.\n\nFor your playstyle, which there are also diamond Morde mains who follow, I would not recommend Nashor's for the same reasons you have spoken against it. That playstyle does not revolve around Q's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-03-04T00:14:58.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pick it to mitigate the double cooldown worked into his Q.
