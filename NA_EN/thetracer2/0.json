I never played you much, i played you enough though to enjoy you. I had you rank four. Fun to play but it was hard to stick with you. nailing your EQ was was awesome. Full AD was strong but not op. You were balanced. but you&#039;ve been replaced. \r\nThis.... Robo... grill...\r\nYou need two abilities for mobility dmg and ccing someone and get attack speed, She only needs one.\r\nShe has a double auto attack reset, the second one doing max health true dmg, you have, an armor shred poke stick.... with a longer cd.\r\nshe has a aoe slow that gives her a permanent sustain, a heal. you have an aoe slow that gives temporary sustain, a sheild, and hers does dmg.... sorry.\r\nyou have an ult that does dmg, thats something you have she doesn&#039;t for once. but alas her walls are truly inescapable, and hers makes her untargetable....\r\n\r\nSorry Jarvan your outclassed, but you&#039;ll be reworked soon... because your actually useless nowadays.\r\nBut i still care for you man keep your chin up. Right riot, YOU&#039;LL MAKE HIM UNIQUE AGAIN HUH?\r\n\r\nRIIIIIGHT RIOOOOOT?!?!?!?!?","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2017-03-31T21:23:46.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's generic, but I'd rather see Camille nerfed. What I tend to think about for Jarvan is replacing his w with an ability that blinds enemy champions facing him for 1-2 seconds (level scaling, of course).\n\nActually I'd rather Camille remade, because she's a ball of stats. But I don't think anyone actually likes the champion's design, either, so maybe just delete her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2017-04-01T04:54:55.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Camille can't destroy a whole team in one dunk or knock up people in a line. As much as people want to say J4 is getting outclassed, those seem to be all the people that don't understand what the point of one versus the other is.\n\nCamille is a duelist, and while her catch potential is high, she still doesnt have the group engage or the utility J4 has. Jarvan utilizes Black Cleaver incredibly well, something Camille doesn't do well at all. Her assassination window is good, but there's more counterplay. You can potentially kill Camille if you're still in her ult, waiting on her Q 2nd proc. J4 can kill you from full HP before you even hit the ground on his knockup.\n\nPeople that are saying that J4 is outgunned... His gun just serves a different purpose. The Max Health W buff will help him as a fighter. Personally, I think it should get turned into an auto attack reset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nick Da Chip","date":"2017-03-31T22:43:49.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jarvans W buff should put him in a better spot. I think it's a buff at least, I always max W first because it's secretly OP so hopefully they are keeping with the shield stacking depending on how many champs you hit. I've heard both ways, and don't have a pbe account so I can't make sure on my own.\n\nJarvan always gets a reputation for not being very strong, which is kinda true, but he can still be quite formidable. A change to the way his ult works so not every champion can just escape would be  a nice buff. ( Flash obviously would still have to let you escape.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-03-31T21:32:22.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they're buffing his Shield on PBE to be based on his Max HP which is nice. Also, build J4 as an assassin. Full lethal runes and precision. This allows you to delete anybody with your R alone and since they made his ult do AOE, he's able to delete multiple carries at once. \n\nHe still has his nice and I find a lot of fun with him. The only thing i wish is for them to buff his Ult Terrain's Wall size so Vayne couldnt just simply tumble out of it and depending on how fast your target was moving , they can simply walk through it because of it's small collision box. Had that happen to me a few times.","replies":[]}]}
