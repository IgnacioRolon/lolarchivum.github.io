So I followed through with his update. At one point the update got stuck so I decided to just press the casual \"x\" on the top. As followed my league would no longer open. I decided to redownloaded it and now whenever the old launcher comes up I press the big yellow button saying \"LAUCH\" and the launcher goes away and the game doesn't start up.\r\n\r\nIve tried deleting the launcher and patcher files. Ive tried quite a lot of things , but honestly if you have any suggestion i would greatly appreciated it . \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"M1ghtyMime","date":"2017-08-03T01:21:59.471+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found a fix for my mac= finder>applications>LOL>right click show-package contents>MacOS>RiotMacContainer\n\nClose app then reopen","replies":[{"poster":"tigertay","date":"2017-11-02T08:41:24.026+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is no folder titled MacOs when I show package contents, only a folder that says Contents.

What fixed it is the DNS servers. After reading what @Porocles said, I realized I've forgotten to use the 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 DNS servers for my connection.\nTo do the same do this:\nClick the Apple icon in the top left > System Preferences > Network > Advanced > DNS > Where it says DNS Servers: look down a bit and locate the + icon, then add these:\n8.8.8.8\n8.8.4.4\n\n7.
