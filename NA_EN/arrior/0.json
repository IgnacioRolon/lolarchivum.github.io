The ones that were bugged had their bodies are shining in a bright color and it only applies to Syndra, Ezreal, and Miss Fortune. Ahri and Soraka looked fine so I was just wondering if the team noticed this and if they have, wondered if they are going to fix it. Thank you for looking into this!! btw love the skins thank you for doing such a great job!! &lt;3\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} \r\n\r\nThese are screenshots of Syndra, Ezreal, and Miss Fortune\r\nhttps://imgur.com/hvVvs81\r\nhttps://imgur.com/Z3Sa9Uj\r\nhttps://imgur.com/kM4Wie6\r\n\r\nScreenshots of Ahri and Soraka\r\nhttps://imgur.com/BMFjWri\r\nhttps://imgur.com/vFQwC16","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-11-02T21:33:37.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Arrior! \n\nI'm checking everything on PBE (which is what'll be going live next patch), and I'm not able to repro this issue on my machine.
