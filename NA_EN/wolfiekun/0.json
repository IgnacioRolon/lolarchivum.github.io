He's fucked by mobility and long ranged cc, and those have never gone out of meta. It never will either. Old Skarner actually dealt with that better because he could at least lock someone down if he caught up to them or if they had to go through him. New one doesn't do that nearly so well. He's not going to magically come back into the meta some day unless the game undergoes massive changes.

You can't even argue that it's worse than his old E because you didn't even level up his old E until you maxed out your other two abilities.\n\nIn terms of dealing with mobility, old Skarner had a really hard time getting to his targets. New Skarner made that so much easier because instead of having only one chance to jump on your target, you now have two. Skarner's Fracture gives him another potential initiation tool that he did not have before, and that increases his reliability.\n\nThe difference between Old Skarner and New Skarner is reliability: Old Skarner was incredibly feast or famine, while the new one doesn't snowball too hard, but doesn't fall behind nearly as hard as the old one did.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-10-24T03:34:45.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the standard slowing skillshot. In fact, it's the very basic, uninteresting, generic as hell standard skillshot that almost no one actually has because they can all get nicer mechanics. Almost every other slowing skillshot either has a more interesting mechanic, or it serves a much more useful role in the champion's kit (like Karma's standard slowing skillshot doing actual damage as a poke mechanism). The new E is a narrow, slow, skillshot that only slows, and it is a high duration but a low uptime.  The only thing it has going for it is sheer numbers. That's not valuable to me. Getting close is more gated by my sustained mobility, particularly since the E is very easy to dodge. Yeah, it's technically better than the old E, but that means absolutely nothing because I don't compare it to his old E, I compare it to his old slow. The old slow was interesting to use, and this one isn't (and no, I'm not saying permaslow has to come back. That's a different argument altogether). Besides, I liked being able to max out on utility by level 12 and then scale purely in terms of damage and tankiness. There was nothing wrong with that paradigm. I didn't care about not taking E early.\n\nI never found myself needing another initiation tool on old Skarner. The main issue was whether or not the enemies had mobility skills and if I can exploit anngles of attack. If I got in, I was highly rewarded. I preferred that. Now, I'm not rewarded nearly as much. That's boring.\n\nTo make this clear: I think Skarner is a crappy initiator. He was before, and he is now. He has a potential for a really good ult initiation, but the actual cases where it is highly effective are low. I never used to play him as an initiator, and I still don't now. Because of that, I don't value the new E as an initiation tool, because the assumptions of the enemy not using CC on you, not using mobility to get away, and not just hurting you until you stop all have to still be met. When I do initiate, it's much more often with a flash than with the E, and it's on timeframes where even stopping to cast the E could let them use escape skills.\n\nThe reliability difference is overstated. The old one could always turn into a peel-bot with tanky items if behind. The new one does that job just about as well. You're more likely to be ok instead of slightly behind as the new Skarner than the old one, but you're just as likely to be so far behind you're useless.\n\nTo me, Skarner is just the generic autoattacking bruiser archetype right now. Nothing really special outside of the ult, and that can't carry the entire kit. The old Skarner had a zone of extreme threat thing going on with the permaslow and resetting cooldowns, and he had highly positioning-rewarding gameplay. Those were fun. The only thing I really find more fun about new Skarner is that I'm stronger than on the old Skarner. It's fun because it's easier to win. Not really because of anything else. That's my problem with the kit. All of the new elements are boring.\n\nReally, if you like him, more power to you and don't let me spoil your fun, but I mark him as a rework that failed to meet my expectations. I played with the new kit and had about as much fun with it as I had with Yorick. It's just dull. It's also worth nothing that since he's the fifth lowest played champion despite being objectively stronger than the old third least played Skarner (which for a major rework is a lack of popularity growth matched only by Cassiopeia's, and she's just weak), this isn't exactly a rework that many people are enjoying.\n\nI'd be happy to see him get another rework in the future. Then he can be the only champion with more reworks than skins.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"097Aceofspades","date":"2014-10-23T01:43:14.415+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"What happened to Cassiopeia really saddens me, since she was one of my favorite champions in the game (Just didn't feel good enough to play her in yolo queue.)

Maybe seeing me on Cassio puts them on tilt so to speak. I know I get scared when I'm against a one trick pony on their main. \n\nHowever, on another note, and something that a lot of people are ignoring, is the fact that the new Cassiopeia does more single target damage at almost every point in the game than old Cassio regardless of her AP because of the Twin Fang resetting on cast. \n\nYou can have 60 AP with the new Cass, and as long as you have your Tear or Catalyst and are maxing Twin Fang, you trade better than old Cass did because even though her ratios are lower, you get out considerably more Twin Fangs. \n\nThe only thing the new Cassio sucks at that the old Cass decent at is being able to max Q and poke. If you try to max Q, then your Twin Fangs won't be doing full damage until level 13 I believe. You basically HAVE to max Twin Fangs. If you don't then you will not be relevant until they are actually maxed.\n\n\nI've said it before, but I'll say it again. All the rework needs is an adjustment to the stack milestones. For a lot of people it is difficult to space properly (which is huge now on Cass because you get max DPS at full range unlike before) and take advantage of that to get easy stacks against the enemy laner. Making the last reward a bit easier to obtain will do a lot I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-10-24T04:19:42.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were stomping a lot of games being in an MMR that was way too low for you.

Champions that are only effective against weaker opponents skill-wise are the only champions that would cause you to hit a wall like you describe. Cassiopeia (and Diana as well) do not fit that category. I would argue that Mordekaiser and Miss Fortune would fit that ticket though.  I think as long as I play my best I will continue to climb until I reach the point where I'm playing against people that are simply better than me regardless of champion. I don't think my choice in Cassiopeia will inhibit my potential at all. She isn't a champion that relies on cheese or uneducated opponents to excel. If she did then I would agree with you that there would eventually be a point where my opponents are simply too good at the game to basically trick them/use their poor play to win.\n\nAnd no, I don't think that data is coming from Cass mains in Diamond because I know most of the high elo Cass mains and the only ones playing her non-stop are me and couple of other people. All of us are having pretty decent success with her. I would argue that most of those games are from people trying to figure her out and failing at it. She isn't an easy champion. Certain not one you can pick up in a few days.\n\nPerhaps the only reason I'm having so much success on Cass right now is simply because of the amount of games I have on her and people respecting my capabilities with her.\n\nMy point is that she's REALLY close to being balanced and she doesn't need a huge fix to make her viable. A few small tweaks to make her late game easier to reach is all that she needs from a balance standpoint.\n\nFrom the thematic standpoint, maybe there could be more work done, sure. For me, this isn't a huge deal, but I can totally understand how it is for others. \n\nTL;DR: Balance wise, Cass only needs minor tweaks to help her late game become more accessible.

Q did pitiful damaged compared to old cass and I was getting out dueled by champs like Orianna and a freaking Veigar in the early game.  \n\nThen I took some of King Cobra's advice and tried her E max and going tear or Catalyst first and focus on positioning to get the max amount of Es in on each Q/W I landed.

I cant sustain that harass with such high costs and non-Diamond-1kcassiogames-mechanics, not many people can. The difficulty of the mana management does not weigh up to the advantages, in fact her late game feels like a gratuitous overcompensation;  like a neglected child that gets a playstation.

To excel with the reworked Cassio early game you have to be very cognizant of mechanics like mana management, lane spacing, cool down awareness, etc. While a lot of players may excel at some of these things, not too many are able to do them all at once (for me it's just become natural after playing so much Cassio). In my opinion, Riot could lower the mana of early Twin Fang levels to help out players in the very early game. Once Cass has her Tear/Catalyst and hits 75 stacks, laning because significantly easier and thus I don't think her later mana costs need much adjustment.\n\nI have had huge success with Cassio top lane. Against champions like Nasus and Mundo (who are melee, don't really want to fight, and don't really die), you can easily stack a Tear and your passive and scale super well into your hypercarry position. Against these kind of champions, I've found myself with 400 stacks around 18 minutes. She is especially good against Ryze (who is extremely popular right now). He outrades you in the early game but once you have Catalyst and level 4-5 Twin Fang, he loses every single fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-10-24T17:31:42.824+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Playing Cassiopeia has become impossible for me, **I haven't won a single game this entire week** no matter how well I did in lane.

Decrease cooldown to 10 seconds at all ranks.*\n**E:** *No change. It is better than before the change, but it should not be the entire focus of her kit. Too damn binary and severely limits play styles.*\n**R:** *Increase cone width close to Cassiopeia so that close range stuns are easier to land. Also, remove cast delay. It takes too long to wind up and execute, and while some might scream \"counter play!\" I disagree. There are plenty of ultimates that have AOE CC and are not limited by a cast delay. In fact most are instant, and leave no room for counterplay other than \"not being there\".*\n\nHer passive is incredibly stupid. I mean stupid...stupid. While yes it does have a free death cap, it takes forever to get it, and then the power spike it far too pronounced. I say we do this with the stacking since we know that they aren't going to get rid of it:\n\n**Passive: ***Increasing Potency* (Name Change)\n\n*As Cassiopeia damages champions her poisons become more and more potent, providing stacks that increase her lethality. She gains one stack for poisoning a champion per second. Cassiopeia does not gain stacks from poisoning multiple champions. Upon reaching the stack limit, Cassiopeia becomes more deadly, gaining increased Ability Power, Cooldown Reduction, True damage, and Spell Penetration.*\n\n**50 Stacks:** 5% Additional Ability Power, 5% Cooldown Reduction.\n**75 Stacks:** Cassiopeia's Twin Fang now heals for 6/8/10/12/14/16 (+10% AP) at levels 1/4/7/10/13/16.\n**100 Stacks:** 5% Additional Ability Power (10% Total)\n**125  Stacks:** 10% Cooldown Reduction (15% Total)\n**150 Stacks:** Casting Twin Fang on Poisoned Targets now deals an addition 5/7/9/11/13/15 (+.05% AP) true damage at levels 1/4/7/10/13/16. \n**200 Stacks:** 5% Additional Ability Power (15% Total), 5% Addtional Cooldown reduction (20% Total).\n**250 Stacks:** 5% Addtional Ability Power (20% Total), 5% Additional Cooldown Reduction (25% Total).\n**300 Stacks:** 10% Spell Penetration.\n\n\nSo at 300 Stacks it would look like this: 25% CDR, 20% AP, True Damage, 10% Spell Penetration.\n\nBy removing the ability to gain stacks by last hitting minions with Twin Fang it encourages Cassioepia to constantly harass her opponent in order to increase her power. Doing this also allows us to cut the maximum stacks from 400 to 300, which will more likely reach a 25 minute power spike versus a 35 minute power spike. Adding True Damage (albiet at a low ratio) makes her Twin Fang more satisfying to use in the mid game, and although its not a lot of true damage, every little bit helps. By removing 10% additional ability power, it allows us to add spell penetration instead, afterall nothing helps a late game mage melt tanks like Penetration. This also makes her feel a little bit more powerful. Yes, seeing 900 something AP seems cool, but why not have 850 AP and dish out more damage?\n\nOverall I think these changes will do a world of good for Cassiopeia by not only providing a little bit more early game damage for her harass, but it makes stacking a much more achievable goal by providing more milestones that are easier to reach. The QoL buff to her ultimate will increase her feel and make her less wonky to use. Adding a little base damage to W makes it a little easier to wave clear, and actually provides an incentive for a champion to not just stand in it.\n\nWhat do ya'll think?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essorance","date":"2014-10-23T11:14:02.417+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cassiopeia too weak to be used in worlds?
