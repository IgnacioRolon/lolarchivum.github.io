I recently had a game where my team played well, but our top Lane opponent got fed pretty well and got insanely tanky. What can be done when your team is simply out tanked? Damage was decent on our side cc was good but we couldn&#039;t kill garren and therefore couldn&#039;t win a team fight. Even dives to the back line we&#039;re getting shut down. Thanks in advance for your advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2017-04-12T07:37:34.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, to kill him in a fight, you need to counter-build his tankiness.\n\nSo that means your physical damage dealers need to get items such as\n{{item:3071}}  (AD fighters and their ilk) and {{item:3036}} or {{item:3033}} (marksman) to counter their armor. Basic attackers such as marksmen and champs like {{champion:39}} and {{champion:5}} (Basic attack focused fighters) can get {{item:3153}} to counter his high health (% dmg v high hp).\n\nYour AP/magic damage dealers should be getting things like {{item:3135}} and {{item:3151}}  (to counter high MR and high hp respectively).\n\nBeyond that, Garen's lack of dashes means he's susceptible to being kited. That is, being slowed down/stopped by CC and kept from getting into range of your squishy damage dealers. To this end, using your CC abilities to keep him off of your squishies is vital to beating him in a fight. Moreover, there are some items that help with that, already mentioned {{item:3153}} for the % dmg, but that also has an active slow. {{champion:86}} break slows when he activates his Q, but that has a moderate cooldown, and he is completely vulnerable to being slowed anew as soon as he's used it. So other items, such as {{item:3143}} and {{item:3146}} also provide active slows, and there's {{item:3022}} and {{item:3025}} which provide basic attack and and spellblade passive born slows respectively.\n\nFinally, in the event that he still managed to reach your important squishy damage dealers, active shields and heals from items can keep keep them (and the rest of your team) in fighting shape. Items such as {{item:3190}}, {{item:3107}} and {{item:3222}} all provide a way to heal allies or protect them damage with a shield (the first two are AoE, and so are quite helpful against {{champion:86}}'s AoE physical damage from his E).","replies":[]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2017-04-12T07:24:49.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way I found of dealing with Garen is focusing on killing his team first and turning on him last. The idea is that it takes forever to kill him and if you're caught doing that, the enemy team can off-load all their damage on your team while you guys are focusing him. You don't want that. That is what champions like Garen are good at....just a huge damage sponge to distract the whole team.\n\nAnother great counter is to pick Yi and get fed....gg Garen. Yi si by far the best tank killer in the game, second only to Vayne.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-04-12T00:28:40.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you said garen right?\n\n{{item:3165}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3102}} \n\nand it will likely take a collaborated team effort to stop him because garen is actually not a tank, but a fighter. he's just a really really good figher since he does true damage and has massive healing.","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2017-04-12T07:05:45.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The term you are looking for is Juggernaut.
