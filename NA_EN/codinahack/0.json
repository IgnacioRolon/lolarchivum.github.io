This is the problem I had with riot yesterday, and their response is that I did receive it.... Why would I waste my time making the report to lie?\n\nNot only that, but this initial report was about the reporting system. I tried to report a bug through the gui button in the client and the ticket was never created. I tried go through different steps on the website to create a report about the reports not going through, they didn't even address that issue. \n\nThat is a serious issue! I remember trying in season 5 and season 6 on a different account to create reports through the client and I never could get it to work. I finally find a way to tell them their reporting system is broken and they don't even acknowledge that part of the ticket issue.\n\nAnyone else reading who did receive a \"Glorious Champion Capsule\" and got to open it, please just tell me whats so special about it.

It granted you a new Legend emote that you can equip on your account!  If you have any questions or concerns, Mama Meep can help you out in your ticket.\n\nRegarding the bug report, it should open a form but the [bug report boards ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)is also a great place for QA to review issues.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
