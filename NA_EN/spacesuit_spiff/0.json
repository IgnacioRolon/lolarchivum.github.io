But if you forget that for a moment, it's kinda interesting to picture him with Bard.

Nunu channels his ult, which lasts 3 seconds. If they time it decently, there isn't much the enemy team can do about it except for the few champs with instant hard CC.\r\n\r\nNunu runs into the middle of the enemy team, pops Zhonyas, and just before the end of the Zhonyas, Bard ults the enemy team. I assume that his ult won't proc on Nunu while Nunu is in Zhonyas, meaning that he can freely charge his ult from the middle of the enemy team.\r\n\r\nWe haven't seen whether his ult can end ally channels yet as far as I know, so it's possible that Nunu could start his ult in the middle of the enemy team, then Bard could ult, and the channel would continue through the duration of Bard's ult. I kinda doubt this will be the case but I wouldn't be surprised if Riot did something about interrupting ally channels, since there's already been a lot of crying about Kalista stopping Velkoz ults and the like (even though I'm fairly sure she can't actually do so).\r\n\r\nI hope antijungling becomes a thing again so that this can be a legitimate strategy (although maybe not enough to be seen in the LCS, otherwise soloq will be flooded with Nunus that just afk farm... again...)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-25T08:41:49.659+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard's ult will interrupt channels in progress, whether by allies or enemies.\n\nAs far as Nunu goes that's a combination we've tested a bit during Bard's development.

To what degree, would you say, were you guys hoping to encourage this kind of meta-breaking gameplay when you made a Roaming Support? Roamers used to be fairly common back in the day (having played since beta I've seen the metas come and go) but it hasn't had a strong presence in some time. Now, with the addition of things like the Poacher's knife and Bard's design, are you hoping to actively encourage these new strategies and comps, or is that just a side effect?\n\nFor example, I could see this starting to encourage different team comps with bot lane having champions who specifically flourish in 1v2 lanes, rather than just hoping your \"standard\" ADC pick can make do. If Bard is a hit, do you think we'll see more of these meta-changing designs?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-25T08:59:33.116+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of our goals when we first starting kicking around ideas for Bard was to create a support that offered a distinctive style of play to his team, let them do some different stuff both in terms of team comp and strategy.

I do actually like that champ. I suspect you're extremely good with him and you can make him work, but I imagine we'd agree that compared to how he was in previous seasons his risk is a lot higher and his reward is a lot lower. Mostly because buffs have zero impact outside of maybe Fiddles, and changes to the exp algorithm for jungle camps means that you can't just kill the enemy jungler twice and expect them to be 3 levels behind for the rest of the game. And the wolf ghost, and spawn timers, etc etc.\n\nOf course, he has the funny soloq attribute of nobody knowing how to deal with him. Last time I counterjungled the enemy mid missed about 4 waves while chasing me through both jungles. I was useless for a while after that, but you can guess what happened in midlane afterwards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-02-25T16:19:26.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a bit curious about a concept where the support aids the jungler instead the adc.\nBard could follow the jungler around and help him/her clear the camps and grant vision while gathering his chimes and gaining exp. He might even gank or pressure a lane (mid lane most likely) while the jungler is clearing easy camps. Only down side is that he might get a bit behind... awesome chance to buff the inspiration mastery right here.\n\nThe adc has to manage on his/her own against enemy bot lane though.\n\nZilean could also be turned into a \"roaming support\" with slight changes to his passive.

Nunu isnt bad at all. Hes got extremely strong objective control, has a really strong buff to apply to your adc, can tank extremely well, and his ult allows you to create a massive zone of control for your team.

Theres a reason you see Nunu played a lot in the LCS. If he was pretty bad right now you wouldnt be seeing people in the LCS play him repeatedly.\n\nOk I'll rephrase, he's bad in soloq. In LCS, people don't just let you pick an aggro early jungler and cheese out 4 kills + dragon in the first clear, which is easy to do in soloq. I've tried Nunu, and farm junglers, in soloq, and it always ends up with the enemy Vi going Legendary because laners usually forget the jungler exists until said jungler is pounding their face is. You play Nunu and you're mainly impacting the enemy jungler, but the current meta ones can just ignore you and win the lanes while you take camps. LCS laners might actually deal with this properly, but soloqers sure won't. And that's assuming they're not just losing on their own.\n\nHis objective control is excellent, but it's already easy to sneak dragon as most of the earlygame junglers because people stopped warding it after the Panth nerf. Sure he's amazing at stealing it, but you can just kill the enemy botlane and then 1v3 him when he tries.\n\nBasically from what I've seen as him, if you do everything absolutely perfectly, you'll be a massive pain in the ass to the enemy team. Other junglers can just do whatever they feel like and probably contribute pretty well too, and if they play as well as the perfect Nunu, they're probably a lot scarier (I've seen maybe 2 smurfs playing Lee and the impact they had was unreal). Is this the case in the LCS? No. But LCS isn't soloq, where complicated strategies tend to fail and the winner is the biggest cheese.","replies":[]}]}]}
