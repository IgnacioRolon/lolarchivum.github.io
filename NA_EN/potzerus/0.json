Noxus has been trying to annex them, but the city has been turning away their ambassadors and traders for years. A single legionary arrives at the front gate, and just walks right in demanding to see the mayor.\n\nWhat do you do? If you turn him away, he will be sent back with 10, or 100 more of his comrades. If you have him killed (which is absolutely possible, because he's \"only\" a single, armoured warrior) then you have basically just declared war on Noxus, and you can expect the full force of the empire to be leveled at you in response.\n\nSo, the mayor lets him in. He says \"This place now belongs to Noxus. I have conquered you in the name of the Trifarix. Here is a plan for how we will transition your governance to the empire.\"\n\nWhat do you do now? I can't think of any option but to agree, and try to make the best of this new situation... :-P\n\nSo yes, people might often look at members of the Trifarian Legion like they don't belong... but if you're going to give them grief, you'd better be strong enough to stand against the ACTUAL full might of Noxus.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-09T16:29:36.653+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only Shurima had some sort of huge, powerful military force... and an emperor with the will and strength to stand against Noxus...\n\nOh, wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Gold Light","date":"2018-08-09T16:45:49.104+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, on that note, how would Noxus feel about the return of the Ascended?
