After that i rotated top and killed darius. TWO KILLS IN 3 MINUTES LITERALLY THE PERFECT TWITCH GAME. But they remade... arent you not allowed to remake after someone dies?????

Think that's how it worked, because I've seen rekmakes happen even after FB has been determined.\n\nI mean, if I'm on the losing team and someone RQ'd because of first blood, I'd rather not want a loss because of that ragequitter. *And* additionally someone who never connected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-14T05:06:48.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the Lux or their jungler dced before you did that?","replies":[{"poster":"DU Talavin","date":"2016-10-15T00:21:00.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lux was fighting back.
