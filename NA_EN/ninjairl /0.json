Your numbers LITERALLY make a Rank 5 Vayne W take 200 seconds to recharge. For comparison, a rank 1 Karthus ult cooldown is 200 seconds (and he can actually itemize cdr) and teleporting to a tower is a 240 second cooldown. You want her basic ability to take 56-200 seconds to actually be reliable. You want her main offensive tool to gain 12+ seconds to reach 4 charges every time you level it up. You want her main offensive tool to be the new highest cooldown barring some summoner spells in the entire game, for a basic, not particularly strong ability.\n\nSo again, I am unconvinced Vayne needs her W to be gutted to the point of nonexistence. With your changes she can't safely use it in lane most of the time (which while making her early game 'weaker' is a short sighted and asinine approach) or late game (because lategame she recharges them faster by suiciding and being dead for a minute than by actually waiting). If you want to remove Vayne's W just say that instead of putting out guttings of her steroid she pays for because \"I don't think people should have true damage\".","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-22T15:28:46.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You make a valid point.\nTherefore I have changed it. \n\nShe has % true damage which has no counters, really.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-09-22T15:00:27.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my eyes are bleeding from reading this {{item:3151}}","replies":[]}]}]}
