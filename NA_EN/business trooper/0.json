Sometimes it happens twice in a row in the same minute, sometimes it only happens at the very end when the nexus is about to explode.\n\nI've tried closing all other applications while playing, disabling all non-Microsoft related background apps, tried pressing the mouse 4 button, updated graphics drivers, disabling the Office background task handler registration/logon thingy that has been suggested a lot, disabled antivirus and firewalls, made the League Client close while in game, and made a custom game where I click literally everywhere on the screen to see if it has effect. \n\nNothing works, I'm losing games because of it since it takes me about 5 seconds to re-focus the game. Last option, playing borderless or windowed, but those make camera- and mousemovements feel very stuttery for me and cuts my fps in half.
