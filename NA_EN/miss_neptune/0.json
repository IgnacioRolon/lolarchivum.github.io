If you are the support then it is your job to protect your ADC and that includes protecting them against Rengars that might jump out of brushes. The team who wards more commonly, efficiently and effectively are usually the ones who win because you can't see opponents in the jungle unless you ward within it. There might be an ambush waiting there for your whole team and you wouldn't know. Junglers that are coming to gank will be spotted. Objectives in the jungle and river (dragon, Baron, blue buffs) might be being taken and you could steal it, etc. \nOver time you will notice patterns in how the junglers and generally, everyone else walks around the Rift and you can use that to your advantage when it comes to vision control. \n\nIf you you buy a {{item:2043}} (last forever until killed) at the start of the match and place it in the brushes that no one in the enemy usually walks into, it will last really long. These brush spots are:\n\n•The brushes in between the mid lane outer turret tower and the blue buff (for both sides of the map). No one walks through there early, the jungler is too busy trying to clear so he wants the quickest and most efficient path and that's not the right way. \n•The two single patch of circular brushes in the rivers are also good pink ward spots. Its coverage is really wide.\n•The tri-brush between bot lane outer turret (blue side) and dragon and the tri-brush between top lane (red side) outer turret and Baron Nashor are good spots to ward depending on which side of the map you are in. The blue team usually has easy control over the tri-brush near bot lane so the blue team should pink ward it. For the red team to reach that spot they would need to overextend, it's more unsafe for the red team to contest vision. \n____\nAfter buying a {{item:2049}} you should sell the {{item:3340}} that you bought at the start of the match and buy a {{item:3341}} to destroy any wards that the enemy might have. {{item:3341}} is also useful for Teemo shrooms and Shaco boxes and those are always good to take down.","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Neptune","date":"2015-09-28T22:27:41.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really helpful!

You could in theory jungle with anyone with enough practice but I would try to get runes before you go to crazy with that.\n\nAs for support you have a couple options on what type of playstyle you want to do do you want to be a tank and soak the damage for your adc maybe {{champion:201}}  or {{champion:89}} could fill those roles. Do you want to have decent disengage or have a decent heal or shield so your adc can stay in lane a little longer maybe {{champion:40}} or {{champion:16}} could work for you. And finally you could try to either poke the enemy adc out of lane or burst them down so your adc does not have to do all the damage maybe someone like {{champion:1}} or {{champion:76}} could work for you. Also in theory if a champion has something in their kit that allows them to keep an adc safe they can go support, I usually run {{champion:111}} bot do to his large amount of cc and tankiness.\n\nAs with any role or position its down to preference so what I would recommend you do is try a champion out and see if they can fill this position if they do a decent job and you like how they play considering maining them. This game is partly trial and error if you fail you can always try again and see if you can do better.\n\n Hope this help.","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Neptune","date":"2015-09-28T12:45:20.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really helpful, I took a screenshot, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-09-28T14:21:56.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free to play champs are also really nice. 10 new champs you can play for free each week.

The announcement for the next 10 free to play champs is also every Monday. Riot has a pattern with things.

Then move onto champs like {{champion:5}} {{champion:62}} to practise to farm and see how to either camp a lane (ganking one lane constantly-every few minutes or so.) Make sure then to watch some videos or read some guides before moving onto harder champions that can have a better gank style that fits you. The hardest champs to jungle with would be {{champion:60}} or maybe {{champion:64}} if you're looking for mechanics. \n\nFor supp, there isn't much but {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} both make a good choice if you want to pull enemies in. Try blitz first then move on to thresh, since thresh has more to do with utility and making sure you land your hook right and know when to go in. When you want to be a tanky, damage absorbing wall for your adc, then go for {{champion:111}} or {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}}  and possibly {{champion:44}} . As for very utility based, skill shot champs, try out {{champion:432}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:143}} . Good supps to poke enemies down to low hp so your adc can kill easily would be {{champion:76}} {{champion:1}}  . For a more defensive and heal champ, go champs like {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}}.
