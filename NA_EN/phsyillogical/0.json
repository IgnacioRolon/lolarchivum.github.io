I do not know if this is a result of my annoying ass family, Canada, full storage, or opened tabs, but will someone please give me an explanation on why this is happening and/or how to fix it. \n\nEx: \nWhat I want: Ahri (me) uses spirit rush + flash to a q,e,r combo on an ulting Vel'koz, and uses the remaining two charges of her ult to swiftly escape from the approaching Shyvanna.\nReality: Ahri (me) flashes with a delay of 2 seconds and does not cast anything, thus ends up getting killed by Vel'koz and the approaching Shyvanna. At the grey screen, a barrage of 4 or more turret shots appear.\n\nCurrently, I am using League's newest client, Version: (idk but its the new client) \n\nAftermath: A raging {{champion:103}} _seriously_ considering deleting League and downloading Overwatch.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T23:19:00.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be having a network problem like packet loss, which means that information betwen you and the game is getting delayed or lost.

It sounds like we're making progress but there's some instability in your connection.  The Log Reader is great at finding issues, but I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to really tune up your network.  It may have some steps that the log reader already provided, but it's important to go over each one to rule out possibilities.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
