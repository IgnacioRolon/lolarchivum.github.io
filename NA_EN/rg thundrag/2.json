(325) MS\nHealth pool is some of the lowest in the game for a melee at level 1 he has the 2nd lowest (525) just ahead of yasuo and the 7th lowest of all champs at lvl 18 (1766)\nLowest armor total in the game at lvl 1 (20) for a melee and quite below average later in the game (83.8).\nWhile you could argue his shield can offset some of this it really doesn&#039;t since for some reason he still has high hp costs even though he doesn&#039;t build {{item:3146}}  often anymore with it being unable to be built alongside {{item:3152}} .\n\nBut what I&#039;m really addressing here is his atrocious movement speed, with swifties {{item:3009}} being nerfed over the months from 65/60 and to now 55 on the PBE morde just can&#039;t offset his weakness of kiting enough even with rylais. Stormraider&#039;s does help with being kited but only if you can reach a target to proc it. \n\nHe could probably get a small boost of 5-10 ms and maybe slightly more armor per lvl","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2016-05-19T17:59:49.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the 5 MS is not bad at all...","replies":[]}]}
