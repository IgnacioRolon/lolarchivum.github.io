So many champs that have unplayable designs would so greatly benefit from a full scale update. \r\n\r\nSo far we have Aatrox, Akali, and Nunu, where if we followed the VGU only plan they would release in June, July, and August respectively. That means we could fit a possible 3 more VGU&rsquo;s for the end of the year if we continue the already current 1 big release per month. \r\n\r\nJust for some inspiration, I think that {{champion:36}} is a great contender for a September VGU for multiple reasons.\r\n1. He&rsquo;s just a huge stat check for the enemy team. We saw this when Riot tried to buff him and he was annoying as all hell to fight for two weeks. \r\n2. His model is super old, and his playstyle is the epitome of running over the enemy, even more so than Singed. Of course, I think this playstyle should be kept as his identity, but I think it could afford to be fairer for the enemy.\r\nAnd 3. Mundo getting a VGU would also mean a huge lore update for Zaun. If Nunu wasn&rsquo;t getting reworked, I would 100% be putting Tryndamere here, but Nunu will bring a huge Freljord update. That and Zaun is one of my favorite regions in League lore.\r\n\r\nNow, for an October VGU, one of my personal favorite champions in the game, {{champion:9}} good ol&rsquo; Fiddlesticks. It&rsquo;s a character that I fell in love with when I first started playing back in 2015. His design was just the epitome of spookiness and awesome. But, his playstyle was and still is so horrendous that he&rsquo;s now a Support champion and no longer a Jungler. October is the month of Halloween, the month of Spooks and Spectres, and last year we got Evelynn who also fit that bill. And just some reasons why Fiddle deserves this VGU,\r\n1. His kit is completely counterintuitive. Fear pushes people away while Drain wants them to stay close; his E is arguably the most powerful spell he has with the possibility of silencing an entire team, but it&rsquo;s RNG tends to ruin it. And while I love Fiddle&rsquo;s ult, he&rsquo;s just so squishy and everyone nowadays has some sort of dash to get out of it.\r\n2. He&rsquo;s holding a scythe yet has a ranged attack. I can&rsquo;t be the only one who finds this dumb right?\r\n3. Like Mundo, Fiddle&rsquo;s model shows it&rsquo;s age, as well as his lore. He currently doesn&rsquo;t even have a region he lives in, he&rsquo;s just killing random people. And his voice lines still speak of the summoners, something we all know doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is already super long so I&rsquo;ll end it here, but this was just me giving my opinion on what VGU&rsquo;s we could get this year. While I do love new champions, VGU&rsquo;s are basically entirely new champs with drastically different play styles, and the amount of Champions who need them is large. So I&rsquo;m just hoping that Riot will dedicate the rest of 2018 as the year of the VGUs.","replies":[]}
