Halfway through my game, a most horrible and unthinkable tragedy befell my family. For 10 years, my grandfather with Alzheimer&#039;s has lived with us and we have cared for him and his every need in order to make what would be his last days his most comfortable. About 5 minutes into the game, I heard pained cries from my mother downstairs. I instantly knew what had happened. We have been fearing this day for awhile now, but never did I imagine it would happen in the midst of one of my most favorite games.\n\nI did the only thing a reasonable person would do and explain to everyone in the game why I was performing so poorly. I wanted to go console the rest of my family and be with them, but my mother vehemently denied that I should go downstairs and see the dead body of my own grandfather. I did my best in the game, in spite of the circumstances, and all I wanted to do was quit, but the game was the only thing keeping me from tearing my way downstairs in spite of my mother.\n\nThe reaction my teammates had was absolutely disgusting. My team started joking that they had been the ones to kill my grandfather, and even going so far as to make sexual remarks about one of the most important people in the world to me, who was lying dead in a bed downstairs.\n\nReporting them was completely forgotten, however, as I ran downstairs immediately following the game to be with my family.\n\nThe purpose of this story is to bring to attention that though you are not fully accountable for everything you may say or do online, the repercussions can do far more than just put someone on tilt. I encourage anyone who reads this post to remember that the people on the other side of your connection aren&#039;t bots or soulless league playing machines, they are real people with active emotions.\n\nI would also request that Riot, if possible, help me with an attempt to report these people whose words were so poisonous, so abominable, that it made me never want to play League with the community again.\n\nThe names of the players in question are not posted here as name shaming them would be immoral and against ToS.","replies":[{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2015-12-22T03:55:17.108+0000","up_votes":98,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really sorry to hear that man.

Most of the media and pop-culture that references the Technological Singularity indicates that it will be this catastrophically negative decline of humanity, and the rise of superior machine intelligences.  That sounds exciting and dramatic, but that sort of scenario is unlikely.  \n\nWhile hostile AI like HAL, GLaDOS, SHODAN, SkyNet, AM, and Ultron are possible; a far more likely alternative are machines like Marvin, C-3PO, R2-D2, BB-8, Jarvis, and advanced versions of existing technologies like Eugene Gusman, Siri, Cortana, Deep Dream, and Watson.  \n\nAn even more likely scenario is humanity becoming indistinguishable from artificial intelligence, and evolving alongside it.  Think of current prosthetics.  When original human parts fail, replacements are created.  With the current rate of technological growth, human bodies themselves are becoming obsolete.  Exosuits, while overall still currently in prototype stages, are allowing industrial workers to do far more than they can do on their own.  Eventually this technology will reach a point where it is more efficient to simply modify or replace the biological component than it is to augment it.  The same applies to mental components, though this technology is even farther away.  \n\nThat said, most of this is still theoretical, regardless of whether you see the end result as positive or negative.  It is an interesting topic to think about though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iamthegoatofwar","date":"2015-12-22T06:02:57.704+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"hey Elduris a while back something similar to this happened and one of the reds decided to look into it personally...Think it was wookie...you mind bringing him here? joking about dead relatives is too far for my tastes and I enjoyed wookie saying justice had been done.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heretic Lunari","date":"2015-12-22T05:30:26.142+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"May {{champion:86}} bring them to Justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultraboomer","date":"2015-12-22T06:49:39.483+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"if garen can't catch them put up a bounty. {{champion:21}} \nif mf doesn;t take the job, send {{champion:19}} and {{champion:119}} \nif they can't catch them send {{champion:254}} \nif vi can't catch them... there are other options. {{champion:98}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:85}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Bedl44m","date":"2015-12-22T08:26:14.442+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"dis made me smile","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2015-12-22T04:19:35.073+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the game is still in your match history you can open a support ticket with a link to the web history page and state which of the players were involved.
