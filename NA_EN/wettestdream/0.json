MUST READ!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"First off, I am not another random that thinks they're stuck in \"elo hell\". I am not another flamer that thinks I am the best, and that I NEVER make a mistake. I am not that \"Mid or feed\". I am not that GG at first blood. Most importantly of all, I AM a team player. I have competitively played video games for about 10 years now. I started off back in the counter strike days. I have heard and spewed my fair share of toxicity. That being said, Riot, please take my interpretation seriously. This is how the challenger silver and gold players are being treated.\r\n     I really enjoy LoL and seriously believe the development team has done an absolutely one of a kind job in establishing an incredible MOBA experience. What you gentleman, and ladies, have done in five short years, is undoubtedly, amazing. I only game in a competitive spirit. I do enjoy playing for fun, but most of all, i enjoy a good clean team oriented experience. I enjoy being \"rated\" on my skill. The new league system is phenomenal. The only problem is the numbers behind the \"rating\".\r\n     My in game is S1NSaTioNal. I have a 2.9 overall KDA and I main AD. I have never once been banned, warned, muted, or had any disciplinary sanction enacted against me. I have played THOUSANDS of ranked games. Currently i am sitting in silver 1. I reached a plateau of gold 2 this season and have fallen ever since. I have read countless posts of \"you deserve to be where you're at\". I will be the first person to tell you that i can improve every time i click that solo/duo button. Since July, I have seemingly had the unluckiest, unfortunate, and to be cliche, toxic teams that any one player can endure.\r\n     What bothers me most about sitting in silver 1, days away from the end of the season, is that there's not much i can do except roll the dice and pray for teamwork. I am the most positive player in every circumstance that comes my way. Sure everyone gets frustrated and speaks their mind occasionally, but i rarely ever say so much as PLEASE don't play ranked again. I do everything in my power to calm people, help people, teach people and befriend people. Yet, at the end of the season, my MMR or, skill level is set at silver 1. I easily could be mid to high diamond. My MMR is in such a way, that i lose 20-24 LP a game, and win 9-15. Check your database if you think i am exaggerating. How is a very talented player, with an incredibly good attitude, mechanics, game knowledge,and teamwork based skill set supposed to be able to reach their TRUE skill in such a rating system and community? I am not another negative preschooler that blames, flames, and afks. Though i get that 7/10 games. It is amazing to me that 70% of the time, when i do my part (And more) for the team, i have to win 2-3 games to make up for that ONE game i couldn't pick up the trash. It has been this way since July.\r\n     Riot, you guys are awesome! I know you are doing your best to keep everything as balanced and fair as possible. I know it is hard to weed out the ignorance and the venting you get all day everyday, from actual constructive feedback. Its guys like me that can help the community given the chance.I do hope you take me seriously and reach out to me. I have a lot of team skills, competition experience, creative ideas and thousands of hours on the rift dealing with all of the problems that need addressed.","replies":[]}
