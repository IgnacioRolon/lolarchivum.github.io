People that are annoying like typing gg/ff 15/next is not toxic. There is a fine line between these two things and the fact that the annoying people are punished more than someone that says &quot;your mother dies tonight&quot; or &quot;kill yourself&quot; is ridiculous. I think that anyone that says this should be immediately chat restricted instead of the people that are punished for saying simply next. I&#039;ve been in numerous amounts of games where someone has been TOXIC and had gotten no punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-11-12T06:50:38.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I see some citations of people getting punished more often than people who tell others to Kill Themselves? Considering the fact that its one of the keywords that the IFS can detect pretty damn quickly, I'm going to need to see some prove or something. To an extent i agree with you, but making baseless claims like that leaves us nowhere. Then again your definition of toxic and riots seem to differ","replies":[{"poster":"JahsehOnfroy 666","date":"2018-11-12T06:53:08.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I don't screenshot every time someone says something like that. Most of the time it's said after game ends and that person just flames persistently throughout the duration of the match. I'm sure almost everyone here has experienced this and then once they say it they actually get punished unlike the people you play with.. idk just a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-11-12T07:06:27.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But still you are making a claim without any evidence. You can look on these boards and see people do get punished for telling other to kill themselves, or using racial slurs/etc. I've yet to see someone who was ban solely because they said gg in a match. Now granted there is a huge different between saying this once, and repeating it (Spamming it) in chat, thats against the rules, especially when you give us, because more often than not this also means the playing is usually AFK (or faking it why staying at base/fountain) which again helps their case of breaking the rules.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JahsehOnfroy 666","date":"2018-11-12T06:54:03.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I'm just a bad teammate but the fact that people are that toxic and don't get punished when I report for verbal abuse is absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-11-12T07:03:20.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you know they arent punished? Remember not only is there a Tier system for punishment; meaning that if you did report them and they were punished, more than likely they got a chat restriction which you would never know about because they can still play. But also because even if you do report you wont get the notification of said person being punished. And while that might be good for some people, we sadly have no way of knowing if our reports are actually doing something. But if you been on these boards for a long time, you would see people do get punished (especially with what you are claiming as not being punished) for breaking the rules.\n\nYes we all can agree Riot needs to give us some way to show that we are being heard, but until that comes we can only hope!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-12T07:39:25.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"kYS\",\"kill yourself\" \nare all instant trigger words for bans.\nyou are dreaming or claiming without backup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-11-12T07:06:02.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, that is true.\nBut negativity is about as frowned upon as toxicity. \nBecause not everyone wants to give up just because one player is having a bad experience. Which can lead to griefing, then that leads to toxicity due to the negative influence. Someone suggesting on FF'n isn't toxic. Everyone does it. But you have to work together when it comes down to the choice if the team wants to give up. If they do not, then don't try to ruin their experience if people want to continue to play by not playing. \n\nAlso realize, just because you don't see a toxic player punished doesn't mean they weren't. \nEach report counts as they will count as a flag. As these flags stack up, they then lead to a penalty. Every toxic player eventually gets penalized. But the IFS detects two categories; Severity and Consistency. Players do have bad days and lashes out. Doesn't mean you shouldn't report them, because you definitely should. But don't expect a penalty right away. Because the consistency will play its part and give them a penalty from the number of flags. \n\nIt's a team game and you have to work with the team. For better or worst.","replies":[]}]}
