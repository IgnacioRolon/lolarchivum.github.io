Details and reasons below.\r\n\r\nIn a recent patch, We got {{item:3205}} and the new {{item:3207}}, whose passive is about dealing DoT to the jungle monsters without problems that DoT items would cause. We have another item that can be good on a jungler, {{item:3068}}, which actually has some problems. I know there were a couple of threads about Sunfire, but I just want to put my thoughts here...\r\n\r\nFirst, I write down the Sunfire's problems (which I know) here.\r\n\r\n* Kills {{item:3117}} by damaging monsters and minions.\r\n* Accidentally steals Buffs.\r\n* Draws turret aggro while split-pushing.\r\n\r\nA small fixes would reduce these problems to some extent. Here are the changes I wish to suggest.\r\n\r\n* **Only deals damage if the champion is already in combat**, so it won't kill the Boots so often.\r\n* **Does not finish monsters**, so it won't steal Buffs or Conservation gold triggers. Also leaves small monsters for counter-jungling, where you want to leave one small monster.\r\n* Sometimes, these are not enough, so **has an active that temporarily \"turns off\" its damage**, so it won't draw turret aggro that easily. To \"turn on\" the damage again, activate it again or harm a champion or a neutral monster. This would also help when you are running and trying to go out of combat (with Mobi Boots).\r\n\r\n...and, as I searched the forum for Sunfire change suggestions, all suggestions I could find are about *giving it a toggle*. I don't love those very much. As a not-so-skilled player (read: noob), I would often forget to re-toggle Sunfire on. And if I were good enough, I would sometimes dislike having to press a hotkey twice when most of the problems could be solved easily...\r\n\r\noh, of course this changes have some downsides. Those which I thought of are, that the changes themselves would take some time for coding and debugging, that they would *kill the downsides of Sunfire* (is it a problem? the downside is *not being a late-game item* and its *gold cost!*), and that they would make Sunfire less powerful on {{champion:17}}.\r\n\r\nSorry for the huge wall of text, and probably bad English (not my first language). Thanks for reading!\r\n\r\nI would like to hear your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-07-14T19:32:06.947+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Toggles aren't great because of the really high chance to just leave it off forever on accident.

I'm so excited.\n\nI'm not a game designer in any sense, but I'm aware of \"negative synergy\" or side effects, where an item kills/nerfs another item or a champion with *outside a slot and gold*. Something like, an early {{item:3077}} on {{champion:75}} makes his last-hitting more difficult, and too much early Attack Speed on {{champion:22}} may drain her mana more quickly when played carelessly. But they are, and should be, rare cases and easily avoided.\n\n{{item:3068}}'s negative synergy is achieved *too easily* and kind-of hard to avoid. Even with the \"passive turn-off\", it still draws turret aggro and last-hits minions (when used on a sitter). I actually don't like the \"active turn-off\",but it would solve some more of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cronovey","date":"2014-07-15T05:45:21.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Toggles aren't great because of the really high chance to just leave it off forever on accident.

Maybe I shouldn't.\" Not saying it's a GOOD line of reasoning, just one that's possible with items.\n\nThe problem I have with this is that \"Don't buy this item combination because yeah\" just doesn't feel good. If I'm playing someone like Nautilus who needs the speed from Mobility boots for ganks (his farming isn't the best, faster movement is stronger map control with his high power ganks) and want to build a Sunfire Cape, this limits me to either wasting time skirting jungle camps (in other words, wasting the points of Mobis in the first place) or running through areas where the enemy team will spot me in lanes or across river wards. There's always the option of \"Grab Randuin's instead\" but wasn't the point of item changes to allow versatility in item builds? It seems silly to lock someone who is already so invested into CC with their kit into an item with another active CC that they should honestly never need if they play their champion properly, especially when an item like Sunfire Cape makes his farming and dueling much more bearable because of the long term damage investment made when you buy a Sunfire Cape, not to mention the lower gold cost for jungle champions who are already on a much more limited gold pool than a laning champion who is farming even half decently.\n\nI just personally don't think \"Don't buy it\" is really an acceptable idea. If player choice is the issue in the \"don't leave it toggled off\" category, how is making the player choice \"don't buy the item\" any better? There's something aggravating about split pushing with Shen, Shyvana, Renekton, etc only to have someone walk nearby, get a tick of Sunfire on them, and ruin your split push by inadvertently walking near you while just trying to clear the wave behind you because you can't sit around tanking the turret all day, even if it only has a small amount of health left.\n\nIs there any chance we may see a toggle added one day that provides something to you while toggled off (for example, 20 extra armor, health regen) to give you a defensive bonus while off and an offensive bonus (the current passive) while toggled on? Make it an interesting choice for players to have to make; do you want that extra damage while split pushing, or do you want that extra armor to tank up a turret shot during a dive? The damage during a team fight, or the defensive bonus to tank up that little extra bit of damage? It would obviously require at least a short cooldown (think around 10 seconds or so) to switch between, or even a short cast time that could be interrupted instead, but I think this would make Sunfire a more interesting item, allow for effective use of Mobis and split pushing without randomly ruining your plans, and also allow it to really compete with the current Randuin's Omen, which even while nerfed is still widely considered the best armor item in game right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Autinique","date":"2014-07-14T20:18:58.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't agree more with you Phreak.\nBut if you think about some more things:\n\n* ** Stealing red/blue buff** => Other player gets mad, either mid or someone else (for example jungler promised to give the buff) = players flaming. This could be prevented by implementing some changes mentioned in this thread.\n* **Killing mobility boots**  => That is just not good, there shouldn't be any item in the game that kills another item. Because this basically means you can't get as much use out of the moblity boots as you normally could if you are using sunfire cape. If you ask me that is something that should not happen, because people might want to use mobility boots but instead think \"nah I will just get something else since sunfire cape kills it anyway\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-07-14T21:11:23.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ancient Golem's passives are kind of worthless outside of the jungle.
