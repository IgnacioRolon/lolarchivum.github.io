I can't get Ashe added for you, but Garen is actually one of the 3 \"promo\" champs you can essentially get for free. Doesn't feel good for me to send you away to try to claim it, so I just went ahead and got him added for you ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"rice bulgogi","date":"2018-02-02T01:42:36.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw I was actually only hoping to get Ashe because I don't really play melee champions, but thanks alot for the help! And what do you mean by the one of the three \"promo champs\"? Aren't the three champs Ashe Garen and Brand","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-02T01:48:00.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeeell you're right about the new levelup system granting those 3 for free, but take a look at this promotional content you can get too!\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202083184\n\nIf any of those don't seem to work, feel free to pop back over here and reply to me letting me know!!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
