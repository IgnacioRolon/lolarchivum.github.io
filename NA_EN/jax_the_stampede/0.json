I'm having no issues with the legacy client. I tried accessing alpha by both my desktop and toolbar icons. My mouse icon will get the circle to indicate that something is loading, but after a few moments it goes away and the client never begins to do anything. I'm not exactly sure what to do about it? Does anyone have any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T04:45:11.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you try launching the Alpha Client from the shortcut inside your League Installation folder?
