But here, since Toxicity is such a \"serious\" thing since a bunch of teenagers can&#039;t handle a bit of verbal abuse from your typical jerk or intentionally do bad just to see if your teammates get mad enough to yell at you and report you. Riot will never understand why banning someone over toxicity is pointless. If Riot really wanted to help the community on this they could of done it already.\n\nBtw thanks for banning me for 2 weeks Riot, appreciate it when LoL is the only game that runs on my crappy laptop anyways.
