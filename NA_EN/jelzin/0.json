It can happen around 10-30 minutes in the game. But after the first time the problem continues after I have restart the game. So the problem is like this:\r\n1. I hear like a pop-up window sound.\r\n2. The screen goes black and says \"no signal\" OR the screen goes light blue.\r\n3. Most of the time league of legends and the sound continues like normal while the screen goes black. BUT the screen goes light blue sometimes and then the sound is freezing. \r\n4. I have to restart the computer by turning the power off on the computer. \r\n5. When I come back to the gamem, the same thing happens after a few minutes. \r\n\r\nI have tried to reinstall windows. \r\n\r\nThis problem seems to happen at random time in the game but after the first tiem it continues and I have no idea what the problem is... \r\n\r\nI'm glad for every help I can get.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T21:33:53.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a driver or hardware issue that is failing, and preventing you from seeing the game despite hearing it.

The problem is only in league of legends. I have also tried an older version of my graphic card drivers and had the same problem. \n\nDo I need to install any extra windows updates that don't came when I installed league of legends? Because I just reinstalled windows and my \"windows update\" doesn't work, so when I need windows updates I need to download them first and then install them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2016-12-28T01:21:35.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it goes black and says no signal there might be a loose/wiggling HDMI cord. \nMine does that and I gotta slap the cord in further :/ (Not literally slapping though)\n\nThe light blue screen may be an entirely different issue idk anything about.","replies":[{"poster":"Jelzin","date":"2016-12-29T19:59:57.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I have tried 3 different monitors, both hdmi and dvi.
