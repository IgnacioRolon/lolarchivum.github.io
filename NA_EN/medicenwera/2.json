We always have a healthy respect for the ability of the community to share knowledge around the teasers, but we're really taken aback by the passion for this one.\n\nI can only speak for Ed The Conqueror and myself when I say that often it feels like we're hermits in our little sound caves. Doing what we love for a game we love. So when we get a rare moment to step out into the daylight and a message like this is waiting for us, *man* that makes us smile.","replies":[{"poster":"MeDicenWera","date":"2016-01-08T05:23:39.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No thank yous accepted, I'm only trying to be the voice of the (I'm sure) multiple gamers and art enthuasiasts that watched this trailer and got blown away by it.\n\nAgainst my own social media honor rules, I began to share it across FB and twitter between some friends and on my college faculty's facebook page and it got a great response, and acclaim from people who couldn't believe that what was being shown to them was a tiny piece of a teaser of an online videogame. It shows that content in it's whole it's as powerful or more even than it's intended purpose.\n\nCongratulation on the great work, honestly, fantastic way to start 2016!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-01-08T05:07:09.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a very excellent teaser. Little things like this give a bit of insight into each champion, even albiet unreleased ones. Some of these things really are great, like \"a good death\" for kindred.
