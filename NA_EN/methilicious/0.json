This issue appears a bit recent to me so I'd like to troubleshoot this with you and see if we can get it figured out.  My first instinct here is that there might be third party programs involved and getting in the way.  Do you have any running like lolrecorder, overlays, or play.tv?  They tend to cause problems, especially after a patch.  Removing them could fix this up.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Methilicious","date":"2016-09-10T23:14:53.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks  for  the response, nope I don't have any of those nor even  used it.  Like i said  League worked fine till i updated it today and by  looking in the  support /help  thread  thier  seems  to be othier people experiancing  either  the same  error  or  some problem.  but  yes im willing to try to work this out to get this fixed and help  othiers who may have  the  same issue.  Just let me know what i need to  do  or what you  suggest to do.  Thanks again {{champion:18}}\n\nUpdated:  I restarted my laptop and  logg in. and was able to play a game.. so far  no error.
