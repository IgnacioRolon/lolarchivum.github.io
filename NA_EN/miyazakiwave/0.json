As you've bought the skin, 1820 RP is subtracted from the bundle price, leaving you with 731 RP to buy all the icons with.\n\nYou didn't actually get swindled out of money. :x","replies":[]},{"poster":"Libranite","date":"2017-04-07T07:44:17.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why'e you complaining lol its cheaper","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T04:55:09.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bundle prices are discounted based on what items you already own. For instance, the god fist lee sin bundle can be a cheaper price if you already own the champion and icons, but just not the skin. That bundle price is the discounted price that you are seeing, not the normal price.","replies":[]}]}
