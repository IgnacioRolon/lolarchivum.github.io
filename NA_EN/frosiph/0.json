An iOS version will absolutely be developed in the future.  \r\n\r\n**Google Play:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quadrastats&amp;hl=en\r\nThe source for the app as well as details regarding app usage.  \r\n\r\n**Website:** http://quadrastats.com\r\nThis provides a visual overview of what the app has to offer. There is a chance the site won&#039;t be up because it&#039;s not setup to handle a heavy load. The site was made mainly as part of the application approval process.  \r\n\r\n**Getting Started:** Once the app is downloaded, open it and click the &quot;No account yet? Register&quot; text to move to the registration form. Fill out the form and hit register. Afterwards, a code will pop up. Replace the name of one of your rune pages with this code to verify ownership of the summoner account. Wait a few seconds, hit submit, and enjoy the app.  \r\n\r\n**About:** QuadraStats is all about comparing ranked stats between players. For those who may not have a group of friends to compare stats to, there is always the ability to compare yourself to the pros. I believe QuadraStats holds value to all ranked players whether you seek to improve your game or simply want to brag to your friends about how much better you are at dropping wards.  \r\n\r\nPlease try out the app and share any comments or concerns.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-09-30T00:44:29.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have no idea what this is, but I am staying away until I see a Rioter say it's alright to use without risk of being banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosiph","date":"2016-09-30T02:10:51.546+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's simply a mobile app to make comparing stats between you and friends, pros, etc. much easier. The idea came to me when I realized that having 5+ op.gg/lolking tabs open is simply annoying and not doable on mobile.
