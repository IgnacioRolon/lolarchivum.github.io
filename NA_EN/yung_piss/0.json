I don't know what caused it and I've tried recovering my pc to a date before my ping increased, but without any luck. It's not like my game freezes and stutters like usual lag, I just feel a delay between my inputs or sometimes my inputs just doesn't respond.\r\n\r\nI reckon this could be a problem caused by any 3rd party program or my internet provider, but considering I don't experience this in any other game or while browsing the internet and I tried recovering my pc, my last guess would be the connection between me and the Riot servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T20:59:57.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that small of an increase really shouldn't be effecting you too much at all. I did notice that you're on EUW, which a lot of players have been reporting a lot of packet loss. The problem hasn't been narrowed down to any specific ISP, but it seems like certain nodes your connection travels through could be the main issue. Check out the steps in this [**sticky thread we posted**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/uxE7avEp-622-connection-issues-on-eu) on the matter and let me know if either of those options helped.","replies":[]}]}
