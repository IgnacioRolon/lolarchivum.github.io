You mostly see invades happening by the likes of Lee Sin, who is guaranteed to win any early-game 1v1 against all but a very small number of junglers, so instead of \"an interesting 1v1 fight in the jungle\", being invaded by him tends to be more \"I got invaded at level 2 by Lee Sin, since he's an unbeatable duellist, I'm either dead, or blew my flash and lost my buffs.\"\r\n\r\nCounterjungling is similar; you get someone like Udyr, who is almost impossible to catch, running into the jungle, taking buffs, and then running away.  He's less like to murder you, but his combination of tankiness and damage means that most junglers can't punish him for invading since he will also win a 1v1, and if the laners try to collapse on him, he can usually just outrun anyone and get away.\r\n\r\nWhat this tends to mean is that, instead of an interesting 1v1 interaction, you get one player (the one with the strong duellist jungler) making life a complete pain for another (the one with the weaker duellist jungler), and often effectively removing that player's presence from the game.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just me, because I tend to play junglers who are not the handful of top-tier duellists, but I don't find this particularly fun.\r\n\r\nAre there plans to add something else to help support the junglers being invaded, so they have a chance against these strong duellist champions?","replies":[{"poster":"SPIDER FIESTA","date":"2014-10-10T19:16:12.128+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":6,"body":"No, invading and counterjungling are absolutely not fun.

It punishes a team that decides to not pick a single champ that is not good at level 1. It rewards a team that works together and plays outside of the ordinary way. Its risk/reward.

Do you find aiming a skillshot at an enemy champion fun? I feel that most things that are 'fun' don't seem fun anymore when viewed objectively.\n\nEven if counterjungling/invading isn't 'fun', there are still reasons it should exist. For the same reasons that getting killed is unfun yet is still a necessary feature of the game, jungler-jungler interaction should also exist; invade and counterjungle are two examples.\n\nIf someone is naturally a better duelist than you, then why shouldn't they be able to leverage their advantage? If Syndra can abuse Fizz in midlane, why shouldn't Lee be able to abuse Sejuani in the jungle? If it's because Lee is able to do everything Sejuani can but better, then that's because Lee is broken - not because counterjungling is broken.\n\nThe vision counterplay to invades is also now more robust. First of all, Crab and Wolf grant areas of vision control: Crab controls a river chokepoint, and Wolf is capable of scouting an entire quadrant of the jungle. This means that, if you're afraid of the enemy jungler, you have the power to pick the proper jungle rewards to stop them. You can also use green trinket defensively for where the Crab and Wolf don't cover. If anything, you have more options than before against invades.","replies":[{"poster":"Capitan Rick","date":"2014-10-12T10:23:08.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the bigger problem is all the junglers being used right now are strong duelists/ single target dmg, and they buffed those junglers with the item, its not opening play, but buffing the buffed.

Sneaking into the jungle and stealing a blue buff when you see the enemy jungler in another lane is interesting, with risks and benefits.\n\nThe problem I have with counterjungling is when it's done by champions who don't care.  Champions who can come in and take a buff, and don't care if the enemy jungler finds them there because they have no fear of dying to the enemy jungler.  Udyr is the most obvious example of this (even if you catch him at your buff, he can usually tank you, and often even another laner, for long enough to get away.)\nHecarim and Shyvana used to be other examples of this (though I don't see those jungling lately.)\n\nI think that the important thing here is *risk*.\nIf the enemy jungler is taking a risk, where if they don't do the invade/counterjungling properly, they can lose, then it's interesting.\nBut when you have one-sided situations where the invader is almost guaranteed to get a kill (or a Flash), or the invader has no real fear of being caught for their counterjungling, then it's not fun.  It feels like you've lost because of champion choices rather than because of skill, which never feels like fun.\n\nOn the side of invading, if the invade will only succeed if you get the drop on the enemy jungler, but if they have warded and seen you coming, they can turn around and surprise you and kill you instead, then it's interesting.  If your champion is guaranteed to win the fight even if they surprise you, then it's not.  It's losing based on champion picks.","replies":[{"poster":"wolfax","date":"2014-10-11T15:13:18.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How exactly do you stop it though?

For those that don't jungle then yea, it'll probably be harder and less forgiving but it'll emphasize the difference between a good jungler and an ordinary jungler just like how lanes are played. I've played many matches where I have gotten ahead of the enemy jungler but because of team fights the difference has turned out negligible.

Late game, being killed can cause you to be out of control of your champion for upwards of FORTY SECONDS-Riot nerfed 3 second hard ccs for exactly this reason. Why not remove dying entirely, resulting in 100% player agency in order to win games? \n\nOn a more serious note, I feel like you're missing counterplay that you actually do have. Even currently, let's say i'm laning as a tank, vs a Lee Sin. What I'm going to do is start with my warding trinket, and start at the opposite buff from the traditional configuration (for instance, start red as Amumu). Then, after I finish my leashed buff, I place my trinket in the bush on the far side of the camp, and I head up towards my blue buff. If by some chance the enemy team invaded me, or Lee Sin is psychic, I have red buff and I go and make an unexpected level 2 gank on an enemy to burn a flash/get a kill and snowball my friendly lane. If not, I will spot Lee Sin heading to my (gone) red buff, claim my doubles before he has a chance to, AND I have the knowledge that he is on the opposite side of the map so I can enter a lane and be super aggressive in order to get a nasty gank off. Lee Sin loses a huge chunk of his early game threat, I'm safe and secure in the knowledge that I scale infinitely better than him, I got off a really solid gank and my team knows exactly where he is, and it was almost zero risk to me. \n\nand, to add on to that, I think you're forgetting the counterplay they're adding in to the new strategies they're creating. That wolf smite bonus is going to be quite powerful when combined to the already available counterplay you can get through warding and communication. If an enemy enters your jungle to counter, and you spot them with a ward, advantage goes to you 100%-you know where they are, and you have the choice of either popping into their jungle then ganking from a really unexpected angle, or just going and hammering one of the enemy lanes.\n\nI get it.

In S3 when it was prominent, I played both very strong early game junglers capable of counter jungling, and very weak early game junglers who were very likely to be counterjungled. This interraction between junglers made the matchup most of the time, and my knowledge of how to properly counterjungle and avoid being counterjungled made jungling more dynamic. At this time, junglers for the most part only interact in a counterganking scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"TenSlashTen","date":"2014-10-11T18:31:34.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 buff turns into 2 buffs.. 3 buffs etc.\nDragons.\nEvery exp lead they get matters.\nMeans he gets six first.\n\nSix is a huge powerspike.\nGenerally you can do wierd things like ask your support to play zil if you think you're gonna get invaded often so at least you can stay even on exp somewhat.\n\nBut you're right, over the years riot has kind of nerfed invades pretty heavily already imo.\ntheres not much exp difference between clearing 2-3 small camps as apposed to clearing your buffs now like there was in s1/s2 area.\n\nThey spread it out around the jungle so you're still somewhat able to keep up.\n\nIts funny to see people saying invades are that bad now a days.\nBut its still bad as in you miss alot of early game exp that puts you out of having a quick level 4/6 to gank with.","replies":[{"poster":"H3lla Moneys","date":"2014-10-11T19:17:26.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> 1 buff turns into 2 buffs.. 3 buffs etc.\n> Dragons.\n> Every exp lead they get matters.\n> Means he gets six first.\n> \n> Six is a huge powerspike.\n> Generally you can do wierd things like ask your support to play zil if you think you're gonna get invaded often so at least you can stay even on exp somewhat.\n> \n> But you're right, over the years riot has kind of nerfed invades pretty heavily already imo.\n> theres not much exp difference between clearing 2-3 small camps as apposed to clearing your buffs now like there was in s1/s2 area.\n> \n> They spread it out around the jungle so you're still somewhat able to keep up.\n> \n> Its funny to see people saying invades are that bad now a days.\n> But its still bad as in you miss alot of early game exp that puts you out of having a quick level 4/6 to gank with.\n\nI'm sorry, but if you're letting the enemy jungler get all your buffs and snowball that into dragons ect. you deserve to lose. losing 1 buff isn't as devastating as people seem to think with the xp boost for people who are underleveled. The only single buff that can put a substantial dent in your clear is if you lose your first one. Invades are still good, but trying to stalk the enemy jungler to keep them underlevelled is just a poor allocation of time.

They want full control of their lane instead of having the possibility of being doomed by their ally.  \nBasically, they know how a full team think, they know how the jungler think in a gank situation (probably, some people don't). They don't know how a single player work and don't knwo how to have a constant lane against 2 players.\n\nThis is coming form a mainly suport/adc player btw.

IN the pros counter jungling is a joke because of the coordination. If your in the other jungle and spotted, the lanes collapse, and your dead 8 out of 10 times. In solo queue, however counter jungling is viable because laners have their faces so far up their asses counting cs numbers that they forget the rest of the world exists. Its gonna be the rise of nunu and warwick and other stong duelists just screwing over the other jungler xp wise. If they have successful ganks in lane, and they steal your buff, its not so bad. Unsuccessful ganks and no farm to fall back on? its a horrible snowball situation for a jungler on one team to become entirely ruined from some bad luck.

The current jungle and jungle items are the cause. They are gone next season, hopefully leading to more viable junglers. It was all in the red posts. Try reading them.","replies":[]}]}
