I know that when a human reaches the peak of Mt. Targon, they can be chosen by an aspect and be given godly powers. Or I think they become vessels for the aspects themselves. Does the human then lose their personality or \"soul,\" becoming an empty shell for the aspect or is it two minds sharing a body? Who has control? Or does the human have full control and just receives guidance or just the powers and a will to fulfill?","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-11-07T10:55:32.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the aspect.\nThe original Aspect of war took over the personality of the human(so pre-rework pantheon was really a human body that was controlled by a godlike force), though the human regained control over his body, when aatrox killed the aspect.\nBut the aspect of protection, that inhabits Taric, doesn't influence him at all, because he thinks that taric is already perfect the way he is.\n\nMeanwhile Leona feels the emotions of her aspect, so she must remain vigilant to not get influenced by it.\nDianas case is not very well known, but its possible that the aspect influences her during battle.\n\nAnd Zoe gets indirectly guided by her aspect(like the aspect limiting her portals), but she has otherwise free control over herself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-07T04:30:33.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the aspect and vessel, it can be any of those, including the two influencing eachother.","replies":[]}]}
