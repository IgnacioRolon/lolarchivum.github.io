Animation - bullets kept shooting while recalled at base (not near turrets).\r\n2. 1 of 3 turrets remained active throughout the entire time {{champion:74}} was at base (not in the area).  This was confirmed by going back to the turrets, 2 of three were inactive and 1 remained active.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-20T10:58:58.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If one just lasted a few seconds longer than the others, he could have simply been recalling within range of that one.  If it remained active for most of his walk back, it's probably a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"GhostFaceKoala","date":"2016-08-10T15:49:58.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would agree, but he was out of range long ago.  The turret yellow circle indicator spun down and the turret was still \"stuck\" in the active position.","replies":[]}]}]}
