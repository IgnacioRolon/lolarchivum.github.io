My keyboard stop working in game occasionally sometimes happens multiples times in one game. It didn't work even outside the game I couldn't even open task manager (mouse works fine) but this issue only starts when I am in game. Sometimes it happens towards the end of game and after game my keyboard was still not working both in game(chat) and outside(when I try to type using chrome or anything). The only thing I can do is shut it down and restart. I have no idea if it's a incompatibility problem or the game's problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T03:57:02.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your keyboard is impacted *outside League* as well, I'm not confident this is caused by League.
