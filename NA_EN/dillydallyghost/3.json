A problem such as this trickles down from the very top and this is a problem for the boards administration and moderation. \n\nThe Curator, the biggest heathen and hooligan of\nthem all, continues to be apathetic of this pathetic state these boards are in. This is due to inconsistent and bad moderation with rules created randomly to \njustify poor responsibility management and authority \nabuse, rather than simply apologizing and moving on.\n\nI also blame the other hooligan, Keyru. She has vowed to fix these boards multiple times only to \nfurther send this section into a barbaric state. She owes this entire board section an apology, as does the Hooligan known as The Curator. If you do not apologize, I will be forced to blacklist both of you. \nYou&#039;ve been given an opportunity to fix this. Remember, failure is not an option and if you elect to make it an option, it will be your fault.\n\nYou have been warned.","replies":[]}
