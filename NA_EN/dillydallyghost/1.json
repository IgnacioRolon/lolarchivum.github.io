You delinquent hooligans are like an apple in a child&#039;s hand, representing the downfall of society, except down scaled and readjusted to the spectrum of these very boards. You are to blame. You did this. This is your fault.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is not too late to atone. Admit that you were involved in foul play by jollying up rules on the spot to justify negligent, if not downright target selection, moderation. Renounce your sins to the community and pledge to do better and reshape this boards section into something your long term committed community, or what&#039;s left of it, can be proud of. Consider giving many posters new, clean slates because we all know aside from a very few, the reputation and track record of this moderation team over the last year isn&#039;t good. In fact, the rule changes have been so frequent that it&#039;s impossible to rightfully say any single poster was subject to a fair set of disciplinary actions. \r\n\r\nIt is to time for you to take responsibility, hooligans. Boards administration and moderation, I challenge you to become better. I challenge you to embrace the community you have here that still want this to be some place special. And I challenge you to do it fairly and justly, not with personal vendetta, bias and corruption. You&#039;ve been given an opportunity by me to fix this. Don&#039;t drop the ball.\r\n\r\nYou&#039;ve been warned.","replies":[]}
