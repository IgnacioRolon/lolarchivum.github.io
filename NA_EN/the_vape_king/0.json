Also in order to carry a game u need to be a perfect zed and hit all ur abilities clean while other less difficulty level champions counter u\u0010 very easily such as yi jax etc  .and even if u go late game u don&#039;t do much just take the adc . Riot please its obvious that u destroyed this champion , its a mostly mele champion and he should  do more damage have less cooldowns since you miss your w e q then you are dead .","replies":[{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-08-06T17:23:55.844+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a troll post right?","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-08-06T17:38:51.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Loki1987,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fV9KNmB0,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-06T17:23:55.844+0000)\n>\n> This is a troll post right?\n\nhas to be","replies":[{"poster":"The Vape King","date":"2018-08-06T19:50:33.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no its not do you play zed ? and whats your opinion about my manner ?","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-08-06T20:38:52.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Vape King,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fV9KNmB0,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-08-06T19:50:33.440+0000)\n>\n> no its not do you play zed ? and whats your opinion about my manner ?\n\nHis W>E>Q +electrocute does like 75% of your HP from a safe distance.
