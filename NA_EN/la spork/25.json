I am a diamond 3 midlaner who has experienced every single elo over long periods of time and knows which champions always seem to end up dominating the most. These champions will get you to diamond if you put in the application.\r\n\r\nPrecursor: These are champions you should avoid at all costs when trying to climb.\r\n{{champion:64}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:203}} \r\n\r\nNow, let&#039;s get started!\r\n\r\n{{champion:154}} \r\n\r\nThe optimal jungler, in my opinion. Zac can just plow into a teamfight. He is relatively easy to play, he is very good at ganking. You have no idea how many high elo zac mains I know, and most of them aren&#039;t even that good at the game. This champion literally carries people on his back to diamond.\r\n\r\n{{champion:113}} \r\n\r\nSimilar to zac, except even easier to play. Her engage is very easy to follow, she can do a lot of damage even when you are stacking health and warmogs. She also fills all teamcomps and all roles as a jungler, which is rare in the field of jungling.\r\n\r\n{{champion:84}} \r\n\r\nIncredibly strong solo laner right now. She is underestimated by a lot of people, and i&#039;m not fully sure why because she can tear apart entire teams by herself right now if played properly. She is very easy to play once you get the hang of it, and will snowball you right to diamond.\r\n\r\n{{champion:85}} \r\n\r\nThis little guy is the definition of oppressive. With protobelt, he can single handedly destroy whole teams. He has relatively short CD&#039;s, and is pretty easy to manage. He even has a good laning phase. It&#039;s amazing that he hasn&#039;t been nerfed yet.\r\n\r\n{{champion:127}} \r\n\r\nSee: Kennen. Literally the same exact thing; oppressive, easy laning, an explosive engage, impossibly high damage. You can&#039;t go wrong with this pick. She also has the added bonus of having few to no bad matchups in lane.\r\n\r\n{{champion:122}} \r\n\r\nThere is not a toplaner who i&#039;d rather have on my team in soloqueue more than Darius. He is just incredibly powerful and pretty easy to play, so I know my laner won&#039;t fuck up on him. Even if he does have a bad time in lane, Darius&#039; rediculous ability to turn bad situations into good can help bring him back.\r\n\r\nOh, and avoid botlaning in general if you want to climb. Botlane is inherently weak right now especially with all the dive comps. You will have very little impact in the game as either an ADC or a support relative to other positions, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","replies":[]}
