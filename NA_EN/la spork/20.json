This combines the other two points. When you pick up a piece of pizza by hand, you&#039;ve already ruined your hands with grease and pizza sauce, so you have to finish it right then before doing anything else. With fork and knife however, you can eat at your own convenience.\r\n\r\nHands:\r\n-??????????????????????????\r\n\r\nGo ahead and argue, you know i&#039;m right. Try it.","replies":[]}
