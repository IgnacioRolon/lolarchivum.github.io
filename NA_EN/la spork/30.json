If we say the curve is someone&#039;s every day life, they go on their little tangent at some point on the curve and follow this tangent line. This concept is completely sound.\r\n\r\nWhat they did wrong:\r\nA tangent line extends indefinitely, as modeled by the following picture.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/7612ed011e27ad6c2e19d8b29ac0081e.png\r\n\r\nNotice an issue? You cannot follow the tangent line for an infinite amount of time, as time will ALWAYS be a definite time interval. Unlike space, we can mark a start and end to time, where the start is the big bang and the end is the exact moment that is occuring right now. The only way this rule would break is if we could manipulate time via time travel, as time travel could extend infinitely into the future, but for now we know time only as what the present is, and it exists over a tangible interval. \r\n\r\nIt takes a scientist to defame a scientist.","replies":[]}
