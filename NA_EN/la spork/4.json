Then it happens, again. I just sit there guys, sweating literally profusely, red face. You know, I get a headache as always again too, but why does that matter, its just exhaustion. Its my psyche thats really taking a blow here, I can take the actual exhastion/ effort but something more is wearing down on me. I keep expecting to change, for it to go away so I can move into this world being a calm, collected person with good social skills.\r\n\r\nMy professor must know something is up with me because I score the highset on all of her essays and tests, and she constantly asks me about what my previous education was. I feel like i&#039;m letting her down in many ways, but this isn&#039;t what causes my issues with this. I don&#039;t know what causes this stuff to happen, its usually the minute details.\r\n\r\nI just want it all to stop now. I&#039;m losing my mind here, some advice would be nice please.","replies":[]}
