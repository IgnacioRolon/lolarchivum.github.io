I have found a temporary fix in WTfast but that's a paid service. I'm using the free trial right now and hoping it gets fixed by the time its over as I'm really not intending to pay to fix this problem. Think i'll just switch games until the problem fixes itself, that usually works for me (happened before)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T18:07:32.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ISP may have changed how it routes to the game server and resulting in a ping increase, but there may be more local issues as well.
