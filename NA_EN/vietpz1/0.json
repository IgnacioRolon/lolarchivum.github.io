Everyone tries all the so call \"fixes\" and its just a waste of time as it doesn't work. After every game played it gets disconnected and will not load the result window and you have to skip the results or restart the client. Hextech repair tool? Useless. Reinstall? Useless. Try all methods of \"fixes? Useless. Fix the client. I'm sure there will be a lot of people that agrees to this.","replies":[{"poster":"23thCleaner","date":"2016-11-29T18:39:54.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must agree.
