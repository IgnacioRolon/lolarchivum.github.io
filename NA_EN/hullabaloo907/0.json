A lot of time i will hit a q and unless i have a good chunk of health missing, it will seem like nothing really happened.

More practice needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2014-10-02T01:24:38.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it isnt an easy skillshot to hit.  Im  ok at it because it is pretty similar to a maokai sapling, but soraka is slightly harder because the target has a warning.\n\nI think what i was getting at is that i want to feel like it did something when i hit them and my health is full already.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-02T23:27:50.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use it for the psychological effect. If you've trained the ADC and support to avoid your Qs during laning phase, use that in teamfights to make them subconsciously reposition away from an area, much like your E. It may not work all the time, but if it fails, hey, you got health back.\n\nYou can also use the sweet spot in the centre for a slow. Works best if some douchebag bruiser is diving your carry and you can cast it near you for faster travel time. It will help your ADC kite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightBae","date":"2014-10-02T15:09:36.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just surprised Vesh or some other Red hasn't spoken up yet.

Currently experimenting with spellvamp- but, tbh, It would be another stat in the LONG list of stats new soraka needs. She is so annoying to build right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2014-10-02T01:19:12.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spellvamp wont work that well i think because its aoe and it doesnt really do much damage.  Some guides have suggested Rylias, but im not sure.  Right now i build {{item:3092}} and {{item:3504}}  first, but after that i dont know too many items that really give me bang for my buck.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-10-02T03:14:54.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rylai's is a bad idea. You dont wanna build hp on her, as it makes her heals less effective on her q, and her w will cost more. She is supposed to be built as a squishy ap supp right now. Lots of different ways to do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2014-10-02T03:32:51.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the hp isnt a great idea, but i really have no idea what would be better considering that the Rylias has the utility and  a good amount of ap to make up the inefficiency of the heal.\n\nwhat do you usually do?   Mikeals might be good for the active, and same with Twin Shadows, but i really want something that makes me feel good about buying it.","replies":[{"poster":"OdixEo","date":"2014-10-02T04:09:05.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can always max q on lane and deal huge chuncks of dmg specially on a well placed q. You wont get the nice sustain from W though. Innevitably soraka q dmg falls late cause it has terrible scalling on its dmg, the good thing is that with a maxed w u can still get pretty good hp back (usually hitting several enemies).\n\nI prefer to go for {{item:3069}}  path since it adds a loooot of sustain to the laning fase and u get ms that is extremely helpful (also using ms quints) And the active adds on top of your Usain Bolt capability. \nStill having a hard time with the rest of the items. {{item:3222}}  is mandatory if u want to spam q and keep that health up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
