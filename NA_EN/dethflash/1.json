It looks like you can heal the missing HP with  W but you cant, and even if you die you are missing that hp. Its not just a visual bug, you actually are missing that HP. It also makes using your W deceptive since you visually cant tell how much you are actually going to heal (it shows actual heal amount plus the 200-500 missing HP that you cant heal). \r\nI reported this bug several times on the PBE  forums before Nexus Blitz went live, but is still there on live servers. This bug NEEDS to be fixed, missing200-500 hp as an assassin really sucks.\r\nWhen you are playing an assassin you only have around 1800 hp, and missing 500 hp is a pretty large percentage.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2018-12-13T00:29:11.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can report Nexus Blitz bugs by replying to this [post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/E5FEJLVP-report-your-nexus-blitz-bugs-here).","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-13T00:31:50.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeyItzSteve,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=qmWJABM1,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-13T00:29:11.590+0000)\n>\n> You can report Nexus Blitz bugs by replying to this [post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/E5FEJLVP-report-your-nexus-blitz-bugs-here).\n\nThis particular bug has been reported in that thread by multiple users already (including myself), so we should be all set.","replies":[]}]}]}
