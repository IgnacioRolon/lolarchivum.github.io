There was a maintenance earlier today, and we're still ramping services back up.  There's an issue specifically at the moment with match history, so you might see a delay in those stats or replays becoming available.  We'll be posting updates on our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page for now.  Hope that helps clear things up, and that the replay gets in your hands!","replies":[{"poster":"Dethflash","date":"2017-06-07T21:49:14.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :) so the replays should be available later today or this week?
