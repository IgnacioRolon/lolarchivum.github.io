The bubble for  Mord ult is big enough GP can easily run away and with just the movement speed from his oranges he can easily just wait  it  out. Its not like Camille ult where you are just locked down but anyone on either team can help, its a true 1v1. Im not sure if QSS can remove Mord ult but i dont think oranges or QSS should let you just  escape Mord ult thats really dumb. Ive even seen several big LoL youtubers say the same thing, Oranges shouldnt counter a 1v1 Mord ult. i know im not the only person who believes this.","replies":[{"poster":"Polaris I","date":"2019-06-16T19:43:03.271+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"An Orange a day keeps the death realm away","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-16T20:08:41.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"QSS should, but Rengar W, and GP Orange shouldn't.
