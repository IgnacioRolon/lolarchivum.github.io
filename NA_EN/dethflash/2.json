And Holy Crap there is SOOOOO many bots in co-op vs ai games, im not joking when i say 8 out of 10 games me and my friend have ATLEAST 1 bot on our team if not more, i even lost one game of co-op vs ai because there was 3 bots on my team just running down mid lane killing themselves non stop, and try as i may its pretty damn hard to fight 2v5 when ALL 5 of the enemy bots have ATLEAST 10+ kills on you, and the only other real person on my team is really new to the whole 5v5 team fighting and laning concept.\nIs having such a large amount of bots in the lower level player base really healthy?\n99% of the time i can easily farm ahead of the enemy bots and carry my friend and team to victory, but when i started playing league in season 4 i dont recall seeing many, if any at all in co-op vs ai games, i only remember seeing bots a lot whenever i tried playing the 3v3 map, and for a short while rarely on summoners rift.\nShould i be reporting all the bots i have on my team? if so what do i report them as? using third party programs and intentionally feeding?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-08T16:24:55.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually report them for cheating/3rd party software and feeding, then add a line specifying they're farming bots.
