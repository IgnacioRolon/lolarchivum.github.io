I mean they have Runeterra that can be used as a map, they have over 140 champions that they can use as heroes (not all have to be used), and they&#039;ve been recently changing some of the champions lore so the champ will also have a backstory. Who wouldn&#039;t play an MMO where there&#039;s your favorite champions that you can play as.  They can use regions like Ionia, Noxus etc..  and also have clans/guilds. I think  that if Riot came out with a new game, it should be an MMO revolving around LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-10-16T16:36:00.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would love that.\nLet me be a young inventor from Piltover, building his own hextech devices!\n\n________________________\n\nAnd the possibilities would be endless and so awesome...\nImagine if you could pick the Void as your faction and instead of the classic MMO, you play something like Evolve!\nYou start as a Void larvae and have to kill small creatures in the Void environment to get \"bio mass\".\n\nThis bio mass allows you to evolve your creature with different alternatives.
