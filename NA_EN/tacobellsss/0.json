I tried unplugging and replugging my router because sometimes that is the problem, but all other devices in the house had wifi and after that, I didnt make it on time to the game. I received a leave for that, so Id decided to go into a normal game instead. I had no problems at all for two games in a row, then the sane issue happened again in the third normal game I played. This time I couldn't even open the game, and when I did, the launch button was gray and it was basically disconnected. I don't know why this is Halle omg, its never done this before! Does it have to do with me playing at the same time the next patch is coming out?","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-26T11:14:04.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The servers were taken offline to deploy Patch 6.15.

I took a look into this for you, but it looks like you were the only player experiencing an issue staying connected to the game server.  In cases of potential server issues, we try and prepare players beforehand by providing updates on our [server status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
