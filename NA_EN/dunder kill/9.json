Worse than Panth or Teemo. Right now it isn&#039;t played much because AP Nunu has trash waveclear and is very ult reliant in team fights. He&#039;s also very gankable. But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that when you&#039;re alone with him in lane he dominates everyone. All he has to do is spam E then auto attack for his next free empowered E. You can&#039;t trade with him because he just consumes your damage away then presses E and walks away.\r\n\r\nBut now he&#039;s going to get a metric shit ton of extra AP for free making him even more oppressive. Please Riot we don&#039;t need ANOTHER champ like this top. We don&#039;t want another champ that is brutally oppressive where the only counterplay is &quot;wait for a 2v1&quot;. &quot;Just survive while you get absolutely shit on with no counterplay&quot; is a fucking awful design.\r\n\r\n40% is too much for the early game even if it&#039;s capped. Nunu coming back to lane with a NLR in addition to his dorans ring will give him over 100 AP with just rank 1 W. Please consider drastically lowering the W cap at earlier ranks so he can&#039;t just max E while still getting tons of bonus AP","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-01-12T17:56:08.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind that very soon his E will draw minion aggro, which will make his trades a bit less one-sided.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-01-12T18:02:18.322+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it won't.
