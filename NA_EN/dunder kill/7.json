Abilities scaling with AD, AP and other stats. This leads to very problematic relations between certain champs and items. This leads to huge problems when item balance is changed, leading to several champs being screwed over or others suddenly being broken. Then again you'll change champion balance and suddenly certain items become problematic and need to be nerfed.\n\nBesides the different design philosophy I feel like this makes League balance more problematic. In Dota you have a few more options to change their hero balance. For example: If the Dota balance team feels like a certain ranged champ is too good at kiting and never letting melee heros participate, they could just adjust the character's turn speed and they might already have balanced the hero. The lack of AP and AD scaling also makes it easier to finetune hero abilities without having to fear an item change destroying the whole hero's stat balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-23T16:54:01.524+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"comparing dota and league is not a good thing, of course they're different\n\nthe point of this discussion is that icefrog (there is no balance team in dota) balances the game around pro players only, only and only pro players he looks at what happens at majors/high competition events and see the stats not only win rate alone but pick rate\nMirana had for example on 100 games 86% pick rate and 56% win rate at ti, this clearly means that she's broken because on a very high sample her win rate goes to 56% instead of 50%\nthen when this is done, he goes and see the gameplay in the pro scene, and proced to do a balance change either increasing the strength of a hero to buff, or increase the counterplay to a hero to nerf (never the opposite)\nthe balance of the game is done around pro players for the sake of competition but also for the same of balance\n\nif you balance the game around low elo AND at the same time high elo, you will never achieve a perfect balanced game\n\nlooking at dota2 pro scene+last patch (7.01) dota is almost perfectly balanced, as in 7.01 there was like a league level of patch instead of a normal patch (all heroes changed)\n\nleague's balance team does so much different works and say so many different things i don't understand them. 2 years ago meddler said that they wanted to nerf riven without nerfing her core strength, then in the same patch he literally gutted the shit out of kassadin's strength","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arya Riven","date":"2017-01-23T18:12:28.755+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree in general.

You get a 70% win rate from first tower because your \"team\" got first tower). If that makes sense?

The actual effect that first blood tower might have on the game could be a 1% or 2% increase to your chances of winning, but because your team or a player on your team is making the right calls, and should continue to do so most of the time for the rest of the game... you'll continue to secure other advantages around the map, and that's why you end up winning 73% of the time with a first blood tower... \n\nIdk if I can actually convey the idea on my mind in words right now, lmao... \n\nBut yeah, RIP, :p \n\n(All that is just me thinking about stuff, league, and statistics... and why they're not showing us what they appear to be showing us most of the time).

With the current fortification, the team that initiates a laneswap needs **TWICE** as long to take the first tower, that's plenty of time for the enemy team to take a free drake, or push the inner tower or even try and defend their own tower.\n\nThe there is another imprtant fact: winrate of first tower was ~69-70% befor towerfirstblood already. The S6 vision and towergold changes are on of the main factors for snowballing. With how limited vision is since S6 mapcontroll from other sources like towers has become way more imprtant and impactfull, and the overall increase on towergold means they give your team a sigificant god advantage even without tower FB ontop of the mapcontroll.","replies":[]}]}
