Second pick locks in teemo and calls \"support or troll\". The other team picks lucian away from our ADC, who then begins to rant and spam in chat during champ select. Knowing the game is virtually lost at this point, I dodge. Only to find out that by dodging during my promos, it automatically counts as a 'loss'. No pop-up warning or anything, just a flat out loss.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of bullshit and backwards system is this? Trolls have all the power during champ select and can ruin entire promo series on a whim. Why should I be punished for opting out of a game rife with trolls knowing that it would be a 20+ minute waste of my time and do nothing but frustrate me?","replies":[]}
