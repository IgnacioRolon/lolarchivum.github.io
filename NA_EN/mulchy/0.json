My Wukong said, ok we'll remake. Stay at the base til 3 minutes because if anyone dies we can't remake. I was already at the Blue buff but i decided to listen to him and go back to platform. I'm not taking any chances doing anything that would stick me in yet another game where i'm miserable all the way through because the odds are way against me having 0 fun with no escape.\r\n\r\nSo i stand at the platform. 3 minutes pass. I vote YES on the remake.\r\n\r\nNow i have 5 low priority queues for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nHey RIOT, try this one. If i voted on the remake, i'm NOT AFK.\r\n\r\nI have had low priority queues and wasting 20 minutes i'll never get back because i was mad or whatever and rage quit is not an experience i want again. Oh great now I'm being punished for something i didn't even know was an offense.\r\n\r\nI just want to climb out of bronze and get better. But i'm losing my patience and i'm extremely close to just washing my hands with league of legends because of this irritating, constant punishment. Losing 7 games in a row because the enemy were clearly some kind of korean smurf making my life a living hell then getting punished thinking i get to use a system that's been put in place to STOP bad games and to STOP wastes of time has actually wasted my time far more than if i had just played a losing game!!!\r\n\r\nIs there ANYTHING i can do about this?? I have tried just waiting out the timer and leaving the QUEUE but apparently, that doesn't count, i have to PLAY to get rid of the massive waste of time that is leaver buster. I'm at the point where a twenty minute wait is not worth it in any scenario, your game isn't THAT fun. How the hell am i supposed to play my favorite time killer like this?\r\n\r\nIt really seems like you'd rather see me quit than continue playing!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T21:23:42.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Per the [/remake](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) guide, it's important to keep participating in the game even if there is a leaver.  There's not guarantee that the remake vote will pass at all or if the leaver returns.  Make sure to keep participating in the match!","replies":[]}]}
