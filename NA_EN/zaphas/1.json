It's especially great for when I want to search threads about my main, say {{champion:161}} this guy for instance.  If I search all boards for Vel'koz, the top search result is 'When will Vel'koz available' from 7 fucking months ago.\r\n\r\nOr lets say I want to find something I've posted in in the past, or see if anyone has said my name in a post (unlikely, I'm pretty unimportant on teh Boards), so I search Zaphas, and it actually tries to find shit similar to what I post, so I end up seeing, ofc, the most popular old threads in shit like 'Champion Design', where people came up with champions by the name of 'Zeph' or 'Zaphos'.  So I say, \"Dear search function, I didn't type that shit in.  Don't fucking bring it back as an acceptable result, because it's not.\"\r\n\r\nI think I've made it abundantly clear how garbage this searcher is, and I don't think any decent community, or Riot, should accept it in its current state.","replies":[]}
