So i decided to buy and then I completed the mission. But when completing the missions, there was one that requires you to complete 4 Worlds Missions. I have done all 6 available missions, but it only gave me 3/4 progress on the mission. Is this a bug or did I do something wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T20:46:08.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! It looks like you might have completed two of the missions at the exact same time which might have messed up the recording. Check your missions again and it should be completed after those missions correctly record their progress!","replies":[{"poster":"H Jinn","date":"2017-09-27T02:17:12.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing here, so please come up with a solution asap, I've been stuck at 3/4 for a week already, please fix!{{summoner:3}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elviira","date":"2017-09-26T14:14:55.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Broporo!\nI have the same problem and i'm still stuck on 3/4 missions since 3 or 4 days...
