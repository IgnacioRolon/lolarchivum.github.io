I live in the middle of nowhere so these are the only options I have, that being said, I had 70 ping consistently on DSL, unless someone else got on the Internet then it would up to around 140 and begin to jitter and lag a lot. So I switched to satellite and my ping is around 43 at its best but will not last there for long and constantly fluctuates from 43-150 non stop. The satellite service has much megs(I think that's what it is called) but seems to work worst than the DSL  because of the fluctuation. Was wondering if any of you guys had sattellite Internet and experienced fluctuation or someone knows a fix for this, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-25T16:53:18.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Satellite can be unreliable due to factors that can interfere with it, like weather.
