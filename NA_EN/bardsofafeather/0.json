Unfortunately, I play none of the champs with Elderwood skins :^)\n\nSince I am a {{champion:10}}  main, I whipped this out of my ass because it seemed like a nice idea. Also this is my first _&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;concept&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;_.\n\n**The _&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;concept&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;_**\nI noticed how all the Elderwood skins have a more or less specific theme to each of them and I thought the whole rose-thorny thing would fit Kayle for relatable reasons. You know, angel of judgement. Pretty but can also _hurt you really bad_. Stuff like that. \n\nHer armor colour scheme is based off of [what rosewood trees look like when sectioned.](http://essentialoilslondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/newly-felled-rosewood-tree.jpg)\n\nUpon further doodling and letting the ideas flow, I realised that this would be quite the 1350rp skin right here ⁽ʳᶦᵍʰᵗ ʰᵉʳᵉ⁾\n\nIn the image she is with her E active, so the idea is that instead of the flaming flames of justice she gets normally, in this case she gets thorny roses on her sword and for that crown thing. \nI also imagine her ult to look like thorny vines engulfing you safely into a thorny ball of &quot;eff y&#039;all&quot;. \n\nI yet have no idea what her Q or W would look like, because, as previously stated, \n> I whipped this out of my ass\n\n\n\nAnd that&#039;s it, I guess. Had fun designing this. \nCurrently having an idea for Ascended Sivir but that&#039;ll be way later lol.\nkbye","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-07-20T22:26:28.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is beautiful!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2016-07-21T17:33:41.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/Blackthorn-Morgana.jpg\n\nYou dare Challenge me over dominion of the thorn sister?","replies":[]}]}
