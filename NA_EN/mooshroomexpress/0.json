Plays their 'champion death' quote at normal volume for everyone but the champion, which is slightly louder than usual. Then, the killer says their 'killed champion' line, normal for everyone but the one who died, which gets every other sound lowered so they can hear their killer's requisite pun. Mind, DotA's announcer doesn't have a normal 'enemy has died!' or 'ally has died!' callout, so that might change things.\n\nAnd I don't think that first blood is necessarily that weird, assuming that the first blood quotes have some substance. Most FM quotes in DotA have the words 'First blood' in them and they don't seem weird so long as they have actual character to them, like fire mage Lina's \"First blood! This one's gonna be a scorcher.' or ice mage Rylai's 'First blood, and it's already icing over!'. Or, the one you're guaranteed to hear in, like, 99% of pub games in my experience, 'First blood! Have I got juice on me chins?' These all play after the 'First blood!' announcement for your announcer.\n\n(look I just really thing these sort of quotes can add a lot of character. DotA uses them mainly for puns and jokes, which is fun, but not what I want. I still miss Dawngate; these sort of death and kill lines were done masterfully there.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adalore","date":"2015-09-05T09:50:34.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the least I want to have character comments for Ace and Penta kill that are global, but what we can do is...\n1.
