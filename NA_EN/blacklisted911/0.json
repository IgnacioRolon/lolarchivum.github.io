Yesterday when I was logged in though I did see a global message that riot is aware of people unable to connect to client. Is this an issue on riots end or will we have to re-install the whole game after they do a fix?","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-16T21:17:42.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are specifically getting the Patcher Kernel error, this is usually caused by some sort of weird OS Permissions Issues.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to launch itself, but the OS is blocking it from doing so.  Make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Permissions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104), which should get this resolved completely.\n\nGive me a heads up if you are still experiencing these issues!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pailidin","date":"2016-05-16T15:45:35.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't access the patcher without it crashing and giving me a RADS error.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Secret Serenity","date":"2016-05-16T15:43:00.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am getting the same thing.","replies":[]}]}
