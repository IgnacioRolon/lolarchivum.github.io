I queued as normal, I decided today would be a day of hilarity with Kalista and Jinx in bot lane. The game proceeded as normal until about 17 minutes, when Kalista ult'ed my dying Jinx to safety. This would prove to be a fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nAs Kalista's ultimate went off, the entire game froze like Buffalo, NY during the Holidays. Nothing was moving but my cursor, and the ever enjoyable Summoner's Rift background music was looping the same second of sound. During this dramatic moment of sudden freezing, the voice client I was using continued to function normally; and my allies (from the opposite side of the country) could be heard with unrivaled clarity. This led me to believe that this was indeed another infamous LoL malfunction. \r\n\r\nUpon hard restarting my computer, it was brought to my attention that the Kalista ALSO suffered the Great League Ice Age of 2014 at around the 19 minute mark. The Kalista had to suffer through five minutes of haggling with Task Manager in order to close the horribly confused LoL client. We both desperately tried reconnecting, but as our Ship of Endless Struggles limped to the finish line with rats leaping off either side, our team surrendered the game. This immediately deposited ourselves and our hopes and dreams into the Post-Game screen.\r\n\r\nTo add the icing to this terrible fruit cake, I received the delightful message that I was banned for a few hours for being \"AFK\" during a game. If \"AFK\" refers to being forcibly ejected from a burning ship, to which I clung to with desperation, headed straight towards a black hole like the recent blockbuster hit Interstellar, then I absolutely deserved that ban. However, if you have been reading this thread, you can understand that my intention was NOT to leave the game and abandon my allies. In addition, my ally, Kalista, received no ban. Where is the logic, Riot? Where?\r\n\r\nSo what's the point of this thread? Partially a cathartic release of my intense frustration, but also to let League know that something went horribly wrong. Was it Kalista's ultimate? Possibly. But I have been Jinx and ult'ed by Kalista and the game continued to function as normal (including not dying, seriously try Kalista support). Most importantly, the ban was unnecessary and falsely applied. Use this information as you see fit, Riot, but please adjust this horrible malfunction. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAnother Disgruntled Jinx","replies":[{"poster":"Thiend","date":"2014-11-21T22:52:43.968+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, since saying \"it's your computer that did it so you deserved it\" is apparently a thing, I was the Kalista.

We played about 60 bot games. She rage left one (it's a bot game and I'm like 40-0, who cares honestly - though I made it clear to never rage quit in a real game or at all if possible) and was immediately given a warning (one leave out of 60.. in a bot game?).\n\nWe continued to play for the remainder of the night and continued the next day; probably about 6-7 games after the warning. She black screened at the loading screen (4.19 common error) and was stuck at the reconnect screen for the duration of the game. Immediately suspended for 4 days. Kind of silly how harsh it is, in my opinion. Getting suspended from 2 leaves out of ~70 CO-OP VS. AI GAMES? Silly.\n\nI don't know the statistics for \"playing:leave/afk\" ratio per game, but I feel like ~70:2 isn't that bad (especially taking into account client errors/lag and not every game being an intentional afk).

Most of the time if a program is acting up you can just force quit it with Command-Option-Esc.  It's much faster than rebooting.\n\nDoesn't always work. There are always processes active that the Force Quit dialog doesn't see. It doesn't mean every active process is a problem (on the contrary, many are essential to how the OS works), but if you've quit LoL (by choice or otherwise) and you can't re-open it, you've probably got a LoL process left open since a crash; probably the Launcher. Find it, quit it, try again.\n\nFor this, you'll need to go to **Activity Monitor** to get rid of it. You can also do it via the Terminal, just don't ask me how. They're both in the **Utilities folder in Applications** (shortcut cmd-shift-U). Quit any process related to LoL, try starting the game again.\n\n--\n\nAlso, the system shouldn't ban you for a single instance of a leave, so either the new system is really eager to jump on fresh leavers and dish out quick bans, or you've left games before.\n\nI had a couple of games with a Kalista today, no crash. Post a bug report in the bug reports board, along with your computer specs. See what that leads to. In the mean time, have a look at Activity Monitor so you're familiar with it for next time this happens.","replies":[{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2014-11-22T00:10:57.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Mac user, this.
