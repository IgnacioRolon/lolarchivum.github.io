I'm just making a support ticket because I am very confused why I am banned. I looked at the chat logs and recognized the game in which I got banned from and it happened to be a ranked game from yesterday morning. In this game I was playing Miss Fortune adc and I had a Janna support. All was well until she started playing very aggressive and started flaming me for not. We were losing the trades so I wanted to farm but she got mad and called me bronze and started flaming me a bit. She then died and went top. I was very upset as this is a ranked game and she literally trolled in it. I was trying to be cooperative with her but she just wasn't budging, so I tried admitting to her that I should've being aggressive and played along with her but still no budge. She even admitted to the other team that she wasn't gonna help our team in fights. So I tried reasoning with her, then Kayn started swearing and getting mad at her and I tried to calm him down but he just wouldn't. We almost won the game but unfortunately lost because she provided no help in fights. I was very upset but kept my cool all game, until the defeat screen when I typed my last message. I know I didn't swear all game, even in the chat logs, but the last message, It was very uncalled for but compared to what the Janna did and the way the Kayn was acting, it was light. Well if there is something that can be done about this because I want to climb to gold this season and maybe even higher but this delays me and honestly, I find this a bit unfair. The Janna received no punishment even though she trolled in a ranked game. If there is something that can be done about this I'd greatly appreciate this! Thanks Riot, get back to me whenever :D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T00:36:57.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From some of the other previous chat logs, it looks like you've had a bit of a history with arguing with your own team which might have been what led to this punishment.
