Makes sense, right?\n\n* Zed can just ult, E and AA and do more than enough damage to kill most mids or any squishies.\n\n* Kha doesn't even need Duskblade to two shot people, but we're going to pretend it's all his damage.\n\n* Kayn can literally two shot with just W+Q, no Duskblade auto needed.\n\n* Nocturne has been one shotting people for ***YEARS***, but Duskblade is now his only means of existing, right?\n\n* Talon has also been instakilling people for years, but suddenly he&#039;s just so dependent on Duskblade.\n\n* Wu has always either one shot you or done nothing.

They were close to fine before it (not going to deny at some point AD assassins were all but unplayed), and they didn't receive compensation nerfs when the item was released.\n\nThe damage creep of the game does need to be reined in, and assassins should require their entire kits, or close enough to it, to drop an opponent from 100 to 0 unless they have an *extreme* lead. Instead we see AD assassins killing people with often no, or next to no windows of counterplay with only half their kits after a single item.\n\nA suggestion, if i may; Assassins are intended to deal take out either unprotected or weakened targets, but not a single assassin in the game has a bonus to hard-cc'd enemies, aka 'weakened'. I would much rather see improve their team-play potential through this kind of pattern than simply raise their damage freely up to the point where they can simply shred any non-tank to 0 after a few kills. To make Duskblade still viable and promote counterplay, why not let it trigger only on hard-cc'd enemies?

Champion's like zed get lower damage in return for an escape after going in ( think leblanc, zed, katarina ).

Give three items to an AD assassin, and 3 AD items to a mage. Assume both sides hit all their skills, and the mage needs a defensive item to survive the assassin guaranteed, while the assassin needs no such tradeoff, their built-in survivability is plenty enough.\n\nI don't mind so much that assassins can instakill, i mind a lot that they're much too hard to instakill themselves, especially early on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2018-03-10T01:06:11.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh no!
