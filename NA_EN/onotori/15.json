This isn't about equality in this case- the golden rule of the boards is to be respectful of the community and fellow members, staff, and etc. The idea that rule exists in the first place is saddening, but it's more saddening that I have to point out that, that is what is happening. OP might not be out right saying he hates anyone, nor is he saying he thinks less of anyone either, or that they shouldn't be accepted. However what he is saying is he posted X about a group of persons asking for whatever it is they are asking for, telling them that they shouldn't be doing such from my understanding of the situation. \n\nIf that's not some kind of implied \"you're not welcome here\" talk, then what is it? Because it's come to blows suddenly it's a social/political matter that he didn't even think to bring up until it got to this point? If it hadn't been something like retaliation we'd be having a different conversation, however from what I'm seeing that's exactly what it is.

So what point does the whole organization have? \n\nI think you're overlooking this part of their statement when coming to your conclusion. LGBT organizations make sense when working to obtain equal rights and helping others who feel the same way as them find a community they belong to. Outside of that focus, particularly to an outsider, these movements can indeed feel excessive and vain. \n\nIt's hard to believe someone's \"representation\" argument when they're not arguing for better representation of all people/ways of life, only one particular type of people/way of life. As an example, when was the last time you saw someone in film/tv/games who was devote to their religion that wasn't portrayed as crazy or in the center of some supernatural event? Just a run of the mill average believer. To my knowledge, the only religious person in League is Illaoi, but since she's literally got her God's tentacles at her command she falls in the \"supernatural\" category, not a regular believer. Average believers make up a significantly larger portion of the world's population than the LGBT community, but I haven't seen anyone demanding they be represented. \n\n-----\n\nAnyway, we digress.

Maybe a side story at most.\n\nwe have varus' story, but just interactions, stories/backstories, comics etc like that for multiple characters. stuff thats already been done, but having LGBT to the character. Not hard, and it's actually something unlike just saying \"lol that characters gay, have fun with them\".\n\nEdit: Just adding to this, an example is Tayliah. She's canonly bi, but no interactions reflect that. I think she has a voiceline finding ekko cute, but representation is as simple as something like that but with a girl.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-05-22T16:24:39.506+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not placed in a pedestal, not shoved in the closet, just a natural aspect of a character like anything else.

Someone like Taric as he is, except he's got a joke where he hits on Ezreal or something. It doesn't have to be on repeat or ingrained in their voice over at every other word. His exact VO as it is on live - with just a few flirts for males when he uses his joke or taunt interaction near certain champions. Like how Illaoi's flirts with Braum and Gangplank don't actually have any affect on her VO outside of the jokes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-05-22T23:23:06.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're being a lot more reasonable than that first person.\n\nI agree that the discussion should certainly be available as I think all relevant discussion should be allowed.  I don't think diversity in sexuality should be forced upon the characters for the sake of diversity, but I do agree that the discussion of the topic should be allowed.\n\nPersonally I'd be fine if all references to sexuality of characters was removed so long as it is not relevant to the characters (for instance Xayah and Rakan have to remain attracted to each other).  Having most characters completely ambiguous actually seems best to me though.  The information is irrelevant, and plugging it in will only serve to alienate parts of the playerbase.\n\nEdit: Looking at some of the other comments, interactions like Zoe's little crush on Ezreal are nice, and could be added to more champions.  I still think most should be ambiguous, but having it mentioned on a few gives interesting variety.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thee Pie Man","date":"2018-05-22T06:03:17.939+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":28,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Onotori,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=KE35jRNu,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-22T05:56:48.555+0000)\n>\n> How I feel about someone&#x27;s decision on where they stick their thing is none of anyone&#x27;s business.\n> \n> LGBT is a political movement, however, and has no place on this forums, as per the official rules.\n\nFor one thing we're celebrating diversity of people such as those with an event and a basically free icon. If it was actually a political movement then wouldn't the Rioter's post have to be taken down as well? Pretty sure your posts got taken down due to controversial reasons based on whatever reason you had for posting them to begin with- which was 0 since what they do doesn't effect you as I'll reiterate here.\n\nAnd another thing LGBT is a group of people falling under \"Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans\" Labels, there are social movements that have to do with those peoples, but \"LGBT\" itself isn't some political swaying device as much as just an overall term for those that fall under the category as a community of persons with different from what once wasn't commonly accepted, but now IS with the legalization of gay marriage in the USA and what not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
