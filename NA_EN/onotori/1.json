They either go against literally everything you preach about, or were massively overbuffed and then ignored. They&#039;re &quot;anti-fun&quot; which you like to throw around, they have no significant counterplay, and a lot of them are statchecks (which you also say you hate). \n\nYou wanna talk balance? Then actually balance the game. If you can&#039;t nerf the champs to make them fair, then gut them until you rework them.\n\nThough we all know you don&#039;t give a fuck about balance, since balance is stagnant and not lucrative. You&#039;ve even admitted on several occasions you keep certain champs broken because they make money, or you balance around the spotlight, and so on.

There are too many OP champs, and quite a few mismatches once you get in lane. There needs to be somewhat more of a reasonable expectation that more champs can have a decent laning phase against any randomly selected opponent. Not all matches are terrible against those champs, depending on who you picked, but especially now as the game is inordinately imbalanced, the number of bad matchups far exceeds the 'fair' ones.  If I were Riot, I would change this the way they usually 'balance' (can i even call it that right now??), by changing the mana cost and cooldowns during their first 6-8 levels. \n\nYeah its frustrating, picking a champ that gets chumped because you're just plain outranged. Or, you picked a mana-gated champ into a resourceless opponent. (Gee, I fucking wonder riot? durrrrrr)\n\nA couple of things:\nYou aren't always there to win the lane, just hold it and do your own thing to scale up. Some champions have a window of effectiveness, they might be good early, or good late. \n\nIts a \"team game\", so sometimes you pick a champ that complements the team. I love and prefer playing Kass (Tier 3 riot by the way), but if we don't have anyone else on the team that has CC, then I feel forced to go Veigar, Syndra (Like, garbage Tier probably, thanks again riot)...something with a strong stun, because it will fare better after laning phase is over and the team fights begin. \n\nIt also wouldn't hurt to learn how to play Riot's favorite buttboy champs, {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:11}} etc. You know, the ones that get constant buffs without cause or need. Try looking at OP.gg to see what is \"Tier\" at the moment. Then try playing just that one until you get about 400k mastery points on them. You'll see that {{champion:142}}, is one of those at the top (FU riot).

But, I think some smoothing is definitely appropriate for many of those champs. \n\nJust as examples Zed - needs a less safe Pre-6-8, longer cooldowns during those levels, or less damage. \nXerath - that range is fucking toxic stupid, and should be traded off with some damage reduction, pre 6-8. \nFiddlesticks? Again, what the fuck is that range?\nXin - too strong too early, tier for a reason. \nYi - One-button wondertrash on Q. Now, just worse. \nYasuo - There is so much broken there to work with, from windwall to crit to resourceless, to safety, this has been an unresolved hot topic for the last year, its just gotten worse not better. \n\nFor the most part though, I'm just looking for some early game smoothing towards a little more equilibrium.
