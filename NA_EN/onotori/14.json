I can afford Sakuracon, but I need another what, $800ish to pay people back. \n\nThing is, I absolutely fucking loathe my job. I got a job washing dishes at a casual pizza place, but I&#039;m treated like shit, I work the hardest and earn the least, I get teased all the time for being quiet, and I honestly can&#039;t stand the work itself or the people there -- like, I have no issues doing dishes, but doing nothing but doing dishes for 6-8 hours a day 5 days a week is just too much. I come home soaking wet, with 2-3 new bruises or cuts, my fingernails falling apart from being soggy all day, my eczema acting up from my hands being so dry, a nice (horribly itchy) rash on my stomach from always being wet and a broken sleep schedule where I wake up at 12-1PM. Oh and they don't intend on letting me become a server, host or cook -- interesting part I learned today despite being promised a promotion within a month when I signed on.\n\nI just don&#039;t know what to do. I&#039;d love to quit and find another job I can stand, but no one will hire me for some reason (though if I get an interview, I usually always get the job, and this one was having open interviews (but I can see why they&#039;re that desperate)). I need to pay back my mom and sister though, even if they&#039;re not making a big deal about it, and it&#039;d be nice to be able to do things and buy things. Plus, I never leave the house or talk to people, so a job gets me out there. &gt;.&gt;","replies":[]}
