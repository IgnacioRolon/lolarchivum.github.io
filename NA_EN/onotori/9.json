Because, for the most part, targeted/guaranteed hit non-ultimate abilities cap out at around 200 base damage. If you're talking about Anivia's E, she has to either A) land her Q (skillshot) or keep you in her R for more than 3 seconds to deal more than the 150 +50% AP damage it deals (and yes, I did just go and look it up on her page on the League website). Q is a skillshot that deals 160 base damage with a 40% ratio and can go through you, then get reactivated to get the stun and deal its damage again. Getting stunned by this is also what causes the E to deal double damage (from 150 base and 50% scaling to 300 base and 100% scaling).\n\nMaybe it's Annie's Q you're talking about, which deals 220 +80% AP damage with no doubling mechanic.\n\nHaving just gone and looked at your op.gg, I can say definitively that you are a noob. Level 26, op.gg doesn't even show any games so I can't figure out who specifically you're complaining about.\n\nAlso, since you're talking about nerfing AD champions and how it won't happen since it doesn't make money, look at the PBE. Currently, the PBE has nerfs across the board for every single ADC and every single ADC item in the game, except for The Bloodthirster and Blade of the Ruined King, since those items are trash and not worth the gold to buy them. They get cost decreased, everything else gets cost increased, IE and Essence Reaver no longer give any crit chance at all, leaving Zeal items as your only source of crit. IE instead doubles your current crit chance and makes your crits do a small amount of true damage, nowhere near to matching the 50% extra crit damage that was on the old IE unless the target has a ton of armor, and this IE change means that Statikk Shiv, which could crit, will no longer get the extra damage on its lightning effect either and won't proc the extra true damage a second time. Essence Reaver now gives flat 20% CDR instead of 10% + up to 20% more based on crit chance and restores 1% max mana on-hit rather than I think it's 5% missing mana on crit. Zeal items are completely unchanged except for cost increases. There is a new ADC item called Stormrazor that guarantees a crit on your first auto within 3 seconds and gives attack speed and movement speed for critting, but it itself also doesn't give any crit chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Onotori","date":"2018-05-23T21:03:47.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"{{champion:84}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:238}} \n\nOh you know, only a couple champs.

He's useless if he can't run at you.\n\n{{champion:45}}: He's also a mage. His Q used to be targeted, but isn't anymore, and his ult used to scale with 80% of the target's AP rather than with their missing health. Don't walk into the edges of the stun cage and you'll be able to dodge his W and Q. If he doesn't hit either ability, his ult is gonna cap at 400 damage rather than 1500 because it won't be scaling up with your missing health.\n\n{{champion:112}}: Oh look, a control mage with no targeted abilities in his entire kit. What's the complaint? NEXT!\n\n{{champion:254}}: Yeah, Vi hurts. But you can dodge her Q and that cuts that damage out, her W is a passive, her E is an AA enhancer, and her ult is a targeted knockup that does some damage. Really, unless she's fed, she probably won't be bursting anyone tankier than a Sona.\n\n{{champion:19}}: Hey, look, my jungle main made it onto this list! Let's just show all the ways you can counterplay him, since I know this guy in excruciating detail. *cracks knuckles, flashes M7, and takes a deep breath* Warwick's Q deals % max health damage and makes him immune to displacements (think Blitzcrank hook or any knockup) for the duration. He can hold the button down to follow you through any movement abilities you try to do. Don't use your movement during his Q animation and don't try to displace him during the Q animation. Flash away as soon as the Q ends, and he won't be able to follow you without using his skillshot ultimate (that, by the way, before his rework last year, his ultimate was a targeted ability that instantly teleported you to the target and its range didn't scale with his movement speed, but other than that, it did the exact same thing). His W can be activated as long as he's out of combat to put the mark on the nearest enemy for 8 seconds, which increases his movement speed and attack speed when moving towards the target as well as having the target leave a blood trail that allows him to track them pretty easily. Without it, though, his dueling power becomes incredibly weak, and you can delay him getting it by dealing any damage to him at all before he uses it on you. While his E is on, get away from him as fast as you can. You won't deal much damage to him through the reduction, and when the duration ends, he'll fear enemies in the range. This ability doesn't deal any damage, but it does let him rip into his target for free. Warwick's ultimate is a pretty thin skillshot that's actually really easy to dodge if you're looking for it. Expect him to use this either after you get some distance from him or when he tries to engage the fight. If he misses, he won't get you below half health to get you blood hunted anywhere near to as quickly. The main way to beat Warwick is with lifesteal to keep yourself above 50% or by simply staying away from him without multiple people. His passive is an on-hit effect that does bonus magic damage and heals him if he's under half, and his Q and ultimate, which both have their own build in heals on them, will proc it. If he does successfully get you to half health, he probably won't die anymore because of the attack speed that his W gives and the healing on his Q, ult, and passive. Don't fight him alone unless your champion also has built-in healing, lifesteal, or true damage. Yes, Warwick is one of the stronger junglers right now, but the only time he's appeared in patches since his rework February 2017 was to fix a bug that was making enemies get blood hunted even when they only took damage from jungle monsters, which is just a testament to how perfect this rework was. It kept the feel of old Warwick while giving him a better look, a lore that wasn't literally the story of how Beast in Beauty and the Beast became the Beast, and making his gameplay kit so well balanced that they haven't had to directly adjust it since, even with all the indirect changes he's gotten between runes and buffs/nerfs to items he uses.\n\n{{champion:62}}: Also hasn't been strong in a long time. Don't stand in his ultimate and he'll do nothing to you beyond the initial knock up.\n\n{{champion:238}}: Ugh finally, last one. He's an assassin and is also one of the highest skill cap champions in the entire game. His ultimate has very easy counterplay, especially for mages: {{item:2420}}/{{item:3157}}. The stasis effect on these items makes his ultimate completely worthless. Also, any champion with a built-in untargetable or spell shield can put it up at the right time to negate his ultimate in a similar way. If you go untargetable during the part of the ult where he's got the 3 shadows dashing in towards you, while he's untargetable from it, it completely cancels and goes on cooldown without doing anything at all. Since that's the main way he's gonna kill you is by ulting into his damage combo and then letting his ult, which does more damage the more damage he dealt to you in the duration, finish you off while he uses shadows to slip away.\n\nHonestly, dude, I seriously do think that the only real reason that you think any of these champions are OP in any way is because you're playing normals either before you're ready yourself or before you're high enough level to dodge the majority of people who are leveling a second account while their main is in plat/diamond/master/challenger, so you're getting all these players in the top 15% of the game while you're still new. Honestly, I recommend sticking to bots to finish out the grind to 30 for this very reason, then, once you are level 30, you shouldn't get smurfs in your games anywhere near to as frequently as you do now and you'll be able to actually take some time and learn the game with players of an equal skill level to you instead of being bullied around by some of the best players in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2018-05-24T01:31:40.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ult. And look, I've run out of room in a single comment to explain to you why you're an idiot. So, let's go lightning round now:\n\n{{champion:55}}: Stay away from the daggers, walk out of/interrupt ult, and also she's not AD. She's AP.\n\n{{champion:121}}: Don't let him jump on you. He's an assassin. He's designed to kill people quickly. Don't let him get close enough to. Also, his Q does double damage if you're not nearby to an ally, so stay by a friend and he'll deal no damage. He and Rengar released one after the other and were literally inspired by Alien vs Predator.\n\n{{champion:7}}: Another AP assassin with 1 targeted ability that does less than 200 damage, but makes it so that the next ability she lands does more damage. She can use this to chain with her ult to deal extra damage on a second cast of the Q, then pop the mark a second time immediately with one of her skillshots. But she also doesn't deal too much damage unless she's fed out her ass.\n\n{{champion:64}}: He's one of the highest skill cap champions in the entire game and hasn't been any good at all since the jungle item that gave wards got removed. Riot did give him a base damage buff to his ultimate to compensate because Insec plays pretty much don't happen anymore, but that's beside the point, which is that if you dodge his skillshot Q, all that potential damage from his ultimate disappears. He also scales like shit, so in late game, he's not gonna do any damage anyway.\n\n{{champion:127}}: You're sure putting a lot of mages on your list of AD champions to deal too much targeted damage. Q is a skillshot, E is a skillshot, W is AoE with a small area (also does almost no damage), and R is a targeted ability that most of the time, if she uses it on you, she's not using it on herself to get the heal and invulnerability that she needs to survive diving into the middle of your team, which is something she HAS to do to get her extremely short range kit off at all.\n\n{{champion:90}}: Another mage. He does only have 1 skillshot, but then again, his ultimate literally does 100 damage to you on its own. It's his E and W that get to tick on you for free while his ult is running that makes him deal any damage at all.\n\n{{champion:11}}: Yi is a CC priority champion. In other words, you can probably stomp your way to diamond with him easily, but once you get there, people will know to stun the motherfucker the instant he comes out of alpha and he'll be literally the most useless champion in the entire game. He's also useless if you don't give him a lead.\n\n{{champion:21}}: When I was new, I thought she was busted, too. Mostly because I never tried to walk closer and to the side of her ultimate rather than further away. Get out of the ultimate and don't stand behind your minions so her Q can't hit you off of them and she'll probably not deal damage. MF doesn't even build a whole lot by way of damage on her autos, despite being an ADC, so she won't compare as long as you're not dumb enough to stand in her ult.\n\n{{champion:25}}: Oh look, another mage with literally no targeted abilities in her entire kit. What are you complaining about with this one? Thought the complaint was for AD champions with targeted abilities, not AP skillshots.\n\n{{champion:75}}: Nasus does deal a lot of damage, but only if he's been allowed to farm and it's 30+ minutes. His Q is a single AA enhancer that infinitely scales in damage every time he kills a minion with it. His W is also the most powerful slow in the game. His E does literally nothing, may as well not even exist, and his ult only makes him tankier. Don't fight him alone and focus CC on him and he won't do anything.\n\n{{champion:76}}: Another AP assassin who relies on hitting a skillshot. Like with Diana, dodge the ranged Q and her melee Q will deal no damage and her melee W will have no range to get onto you with. W doubles in range and Q doubles in damage if the target is Hunted, which they become Hunted if you step on one of her ranged W traps or if you get hit by the Q, which is a skillshot. Dodge the Q and all of a sudden, all of her damage vanishes.\n\n{{champion:56}}: AD assassin, relies on his ult to get to you. Once he's there, even if he kills you, if you're positioned properly, he'll probably also die for it. Hang back with your team and he doesn't have the ability to kill you safely anymore. And sometimes, it's better to get killed by the enemy team's biggest threat when you're your teams smallest threat, then have him die, than it is to have him go on your biggest threat.\n\n{{champion:2}}: All Olaf does is run at you. I will give you that it's hard to kite him, but it's also not hard to just burst him while he's running at you, even if he's built full tank. Just stick with your team and let them help you kill him.\n\n{{champion:80}}: His entire champion is designed around being very powerful early game, but if he comes out of top lane 0/0/0, even with better farm than his opponent, he's literally more useless than Aatrox. His W is short range, his E is easy to walk out of, and his Q doesn't do much damage without the W passive that makes him crit if the target is low. He also doesn't do any damage at all in late game because that's his design. Don't feed him early and he's the single weakest champ in the game.\n\n{{champion:133}}: She hasn't been strong in years either. Yeah, she has a lot of burst damage with her E+auto combo, but to get there, she has to get a lead. And in order to get a lead, Quinn has to land several rotations of E AA Q AA on her lane opponent and kill them. Because she's typically seen top lane, it's not hard for her to do this if her opponent does anything other than play ultra passive and sit under turret the entire time, but for 90% of top laners, if they come out of lane without dying to Quinn, they won lane.\n\n{{champion:58}}: Q is an AoE skillshot, not targeted, E is a dash, also not targeted, and ult only makes him tankier. He's also got similar champion design to Pantheon, where he's a lane bully, but he's garbage if he doesn't get a lead. I remember the days back when Renekton was the top lane META. If he wasn't banned, whichever team had first pick won guaranteed with the other team not even having a chance to do anything. He was like this for an entire year before Riot gutted him, and now he's balanced, and maybe even a little on the weak end compared to other top laners (including his brother with the exact opposite champion design, Nasus, who you complained about earlier).\n\n{{champion:107}}: Also an assassin, also designed to 1-shot you. Also fairly easy to counterplay. If you dash/flash away during the jump from his ultimate, you negate all the damage that deals and all the potential damage his Q afterwards deals.\n\n{{champion:35}}: Yet another assassin, but he's not actually going to 1-shot you ever if he doesn't get his backstab off. If you can learn the difference between a player and the AI on his ult, or if you can learn that his E and W only ever come out from the real one, so watch for those abilities and you know which one is real, then you'll be able to kill the real one instead of the fake and most of the time, he'll do nothing if you get it right.\n\n{{champion:37}}: You're complaining about a support dealing too much damage. Go back to playing bots until you understand how the game works. Or at least until you're level 30, at which point, the matchmaking system should stop putting you against plat/diamond/challenger smurfs that it has to because almost nobody plays normal games until after they're level 30. She also only has 1 damage ability and is the single squishiest champion in the entire game. Smallest base health, smallest health scaling, smallest armor/mr and smallest scaling for those numbers out of any other champion in the entire game. Any champion in the game can 1-shot a Sona. The real question is if she's out of position or if she's baiting or with her team. If she's with her team, there are better targets and focusing her over her ADC will probably get you killed. If she's out of position, she's dead with no chance of stopping you.\n\n{{champion:134}}: AP mage with her ult as her only targeted ability, and for that to do damage, she has to hit multiple of her skillshot Q abilities. What are you complaining about with her again? Thought it was AD champions with too much targeted damage? She has neither.\n\n{{champion:91}}: AD assassin. Dodge the return on the W and he won't kill you. Also, if you're facing him in mid, be aware of what he wants to do. He wants to hit level 2 and kill you right there. If he doesn't start that snowball early, he probably won't be useful, so count the minions. After the first wave is cleared, sit back a bit closer to your turret so he can't get on you when he hits level 2 without diving you, which is literally inting at that stage of the game.\n\n{{champion:17}}: Hey, look, it's the counter to all the AD champions with too much damage on their autos that your complaining about. His Q is a targeted ability that makes it so that they can't do any damage for 3 seconds. Also, buy {{item:3364}} to disable his mushrooms and let you kill them. He's annoying, hence is why he's called the Satan of League of Legends and is also why Riot gave him the Lil Devil Teemo skin for the memes, but he's also typically got a global taunt on him in that everyone wants that bitch dead, so everyone is gonna murder him.\n\n{{champion:18}}: Most of her damage is in her E, which she needs to hit 4 autos to charge up. Simply enough, don't let her do that. Also, she's also an ADC, and next patch, all her damage is going away until 50+ minutes, just like every other ADC in the game.\n\n{{champion:4}}: Mage, not AD champion. 1 skillshot, 1 targeted damage ability that's very easy to play around. E is a passive that does extra damage on every 5th auto, but it's not really all that much, and ult doesn't do damage. Just a fun fact for you, though, back in beta, release Twisted Fate was the single most broken kit Riot had ever released. His passive gave his whole team free crit chance globally, his gold card on W was the exact same, but with more damage and it was AoE, and the 2 parts of his ult, Destiny (the global...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2018-05-24T00:51:21.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}}: AP champion, the only way that she does any damage at all with basic attacks is activating the Q mark (6 second cooldown, you can just walk away from it) or the second hit of her passive. Also, she relies on her ult to get to ranged champions, so don't just let her walk up to you and bully the crap out of her from range before she hits 6. Delay that power spike as much as possible while you get your items to let you outburst her.\n\n{{champion:34}}: Also a mage, needs to land a Q for her targeted E to do more than around 250 damage, Q is a skillshot. Dodge to the left or right and avoid it.\n\n{{champion:1}}: ALSO a mage: Her Q is her only targeted spell and, while it does deal a decent amount of damage, it also needs to scale up to that. Early game, she'll probably be using it on minions instead of champions.\n\n{{champion:51}}: ADC, which, like I said, EVERY ADC IN THE ENTIRE GAME is getting all of their base stats and all of their items dead next patch. Also, she only really hurts before she has triple crit if you're dumb enough to step on one of her very visible traps or let her headshot you, which you can see when her passive is charged by either counting the 6 autos it takes for her to charge it or clicking on her.\n\n{{champion:164}}: Dodge the stun, then stun her yourself. Her Q is what makes her autos do most of their damage. The first Q does physical damage, the second does physical if she hits it too early or true if she doesn't. It's a 1.5 second delay and she can recast it for only 2 seconds after the initial trigger. So, she dashes on you and you dodge the stun and either snare/stun/slow her and walk away or let her get the first Q off, then right before the second Q goes off, snare/stun/slow her and walk away.\n\n{{champion:31}}: Don't get hit by his Q and he'll never get you low enough that his ult can kill you. His ult is designed to deal a lot of damage, but it also has a 2 minute cooldown and he wants to use it to kill you since it'll give him a stack of health if he does, so just don't let his Q hit. You see that circle appear on the ground, you stop any attacking and dodge it and all of a sudden he does no damage with the rest of his kit.\n\n{{champion:122}}: Oh look, another true damage ultimate that does a lot of damage. This one relies on him having his Hemorrhage stacks on you from his passive. It only does like 100/150/200 + some AD ratio, but that increases by 20% per stack of his passive. How do you stop this? Don't let him hit you. He's a juggernaut. They're tanky and they do a lot of damage, but they're very easy to kite.\n\n{{champion:131}}: Hey look, another AP assassin who relies on their ultimate to do anything on the list of AD champions you claim are busted. Her ult relies on a reset mechanic it gets from hitting her Q, which is a skillshot with a weird crescent-shaped flight pattern. Don't get hit by the Q and the only way she actually kills you is if she's fed out her ass.\n\n{{champion:245}}: ANOTHER AP assassin. Ekko's entire design is around dashing in and out of fights, doing smaller amounts of damage, running away, and then using his ult to finish off the target. His counterplay is probably the easiest on the list. His ult has a little ghost that follows behind him when it's up. That ghost is where he teleports to when he uses his ultimate, dealing a burst of damage in the AoE. Unless he's fed out his ass, he'll never kill you without hitting the ultimate. Keep an eye on the ghost and don't get hit by it and he has no chance of killing you ever.\n\n{{champion:60}}: You know, for someone who's complaining that AD champions deal too much damage and mages are too weak, you're sure putting a lot of mages on this list. Elise's Q is the only ability in her kit that does any reasonable amount of damage. Human form it'll deal % current health, spider form it'll deal % missing health. Her ultimate is a transform, her E is either a skillshot stun or an invulnerability into a potential blink, and her W is either a skillshot that does damage or an attack speed steroid for her and the spiderlings that heals her and is really only useful when clearing jungle monsters. So, dodge the human E and she won't be able to hit the spider from her W, and therefore she won't be able to deal any reasonable amount of execute damage with her Q. Accusing a champion who has 8 abilities, but only 3 of them deal any damage at all and who hasn't even been remotely strong since she got gutted 4 years ago of dealing too much damage is really grasping at straws, don't you think?\n\n{{champion:28}}: Another AP assassin. Also, she has no targeted abilities except for her W, which is a mark she has to wait 3 seconds for it to do anything more than refund its mana, and even then, it does no damage. It does reduce your MR and charm you so it's easier for her to get off her other abilities and THEY do more damage, but it doesn't do any damage itself.\n\n{{champion:9}}: Another mage that hasn't been relevant since Riot made his targeted fear on Q (that also do no damage) last 1.5 seconds at max rank instead of 3. His W is targeted, but it's also a channel. Either walk away from it to break the tether or stun him to cancel it. His ult also has an initial channel and it's also not hard to get away from the AoE.\n\n{{champion:105}}: Another AP champion. He's an assassin, meaning that he's designed to punish your mistakes. His E and R are skillshots, his Q and W don't deal a whole lot of damage (unless he has Lich Bane because either one can proc it, but that also has a 1.5 second cd, so only 1 of these abilities is gonna get to deal damage. More than likely his Q). Dodge the ult and he'll never do anything to you.\n\n{{champion:41}}: All his damage is centered in the barrels. You can auto the barrels when they're on 1 health to kill them and stop him from using his Q on them, or you can walk away from them in the time it takes them to charge.\n\n{{champion:86}}: Another true damage execute ultimate whose damage only scales with your missing health. Also another juggernaut. Don't let him get close to you and you'll be fine.\n\n{{champion:104}}: His passive makes his autos fire out 4 sets of damage (6 if he crits). The 4/6 sets of damage all deal a portion of his AD and can be bodyblocked by other things. He also has the shortest range of any champion classified as Marksman at 350, compared to the standard 550. Don't fight him in melee range, and walk away from his Q. Also, he also only has basic attacks for targeted abilities and even that has mechanics that kind of turn it into a skillshot, except instead of him having to aim it, it relies on his opponent being close enough or having a fat enough hitbox to get hit by more than 1 of them. If your hitbox is that fat, you're probably a tank. If it's not, you're probably never close enough for him to hit you for longer than the 0.5 seconds it takes for you, as an assassin, to 100-0 him. Also, he has 2 abilities that don't do any damage at all.\n\n{{champion:120}}: Slow him. That's literally it. His damage is based on his movement speed. Slow his movement speed and he doesn't do damage anymore. Also, he's always been a troll pick literally since his release, almost as bad as Aatrox. Bet you didn't even know Aatrox existed. He's also an AD autoattacker based on lifestealing his target to death, but he's been so bad since his release that he's never once seen play in the pro scene and has also never once been above D-tier on the tier list of S, A, B, C, D, and F at any point in history. Hecarim is almost as bad, except for a season he was a META jungler at high A-tier. And then he and every item he uses got nerfed in various ways and he hasn't been above D-tier since.\n\n{{champion:39}}: Her Q doesn't deal much damage without Trinity Force or without her hitting her E and/or ultimate, both of which are skillshots, to give it a reset.\n\n{{champion:59}}: Alright, I'll give you that he does a lot of damage. But if you dodge his E+Q combo, both of which are skillshots, you're left with the ultimate, which, while it is targeted and does deal a fair amount of damage on its own, it's not gonna kill you if you have a way out of the wall.\n\n{{champion:24}}: Jax is an entirely auto-attack based champion who is plagued by one thing: low range on his Q. His Q jump range is actually pretty generous, but it's also really easy to just stay out of. You probably won't deal damage to him, but he won't deal damage to you, and his most important thing for after he gets on you is landing the E. So, stay out of his range while he's using the E and then fight him afterwards, where he can't stun you anymore and won't do much.\n\n{{champion:126}}: Another champion with no targeted abilities (at least, not in his ranged form). His E does no damage, but it extends the range and increases the damage of his Q. His W also actually REDUCES the damage his autos deal by 30%, but give him attack speed steroid for 3 autos, until it's above rank 4 and I'm pretty sure Jayces max it last. Yes, his melee form Q+E combo are targeted, but they also don't really deal a ton of damage. Not compared to him landing an E+Q in ranged form, at least.\n\n{{champion:145}}: Her W is a skillshot. Her Q is an automatically targeting ability that splits its damage among targets in the range. Group up so she can't get more than 2 hits off on any 1 champion and it'll deal basically 0 damage. Also, while yes, she is an ADC, she doesn't build a whole heck of a lot of AD itself. She builds more attack speed and on-hit damage because her passive is a decent 5-hit passive execute that she wants to hit on you quickly.\n\n{{champion:30}}: Another mage with no targeted abilities except his ult, which targets all 5 enemy champions and only does like 200 damage until late game, by which point, you could block it with a Zhonya's really easily. You sound like you play mages, and they have access to the easiest item in the game to use to counter Karthus ult. Which, by the way, has double the cooldown of Zhonya's at 180 seconds. Even if he were to use it every time it came off cooldown, you could still use Zhonya's to dodge the first, use it again in the middle, and still have it up for his next...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aimléss","date":"2018-05-23T20:53:08.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skillshots already do >:) {{champion:142}}","replies":[{"poster":"Onotori","date":"2018-05-23T20:55:34.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Even fed, your Q won't do anywhere near 2k damage, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Aimléss","date":"2018-05-24T01:40:28.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol that's a good thing though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2018-05-23T20:44:20.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":" {{champion:202}} \n\n> let's make every skillshot do between 2k-3k damage.\n\nI mean sounds balanced\n\nnow he can do both xd","replies":[]}]}
