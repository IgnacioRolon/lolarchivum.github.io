I remember you joining before Wrath, and I remember you talking to people about design all the time, and the game became amazing, and then you left a while later, though I don&#039;t remember why.\n\n&#039;cause, as much as people used to complain about Frost Mages being OP... the new guy is just horrible, and makes the game so boring and mindless. I miss the classes back when you lead the design team. I haven&#039;t even really played WoW for more than a week or two at a time since WoD.","replies":[]}
