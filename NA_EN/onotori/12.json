I used to get all happy when I pulled off stupid stuff, and I&#039;d get excited for new champs, but now I just... don&#039;t care. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the gameplay, or the balance issues, or matching, but I just don&#039;t have fun anymore -- and this isn&#039;t just League, I&#039;m having trouble enjoying myself in any game.\r\n\r\nMaybe I&#039;m just jaded, since newer games are kind of shitty. Or maybe my depression is just getting worse. But I&#039;m having a hard time enjoying anything anymore.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m looking forward to Maplestory 2, since it&#039;s silly and light hearted, but are there any other games that are just... fun? Even if they&#039;re not good or popular.","replies":[]}
