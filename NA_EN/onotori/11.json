However, with every patch that comes along, it gets harder and harder to justify playing anything that isn&#039;t an AD stacking damage dealer, be that an ADC, a melee ADC, an assassin, or even full AD Darius. I do less damage, I have less survivability, I have less mobility, I have less sustain, I have terrible resource pools (that is getting worse), I have skillshots and CDs... I don&#039;t want to play a game where playing the champs I enjoy means I&#039;m gimping myself, but that&#039;s about how it is already, with it getting worse every patch.\n\nThen, combine that with the fact that we&#039;re ignoring champs who have absurd win and pickrates, ignoring champs who go against everything Riot says they value, making idiotic changes to try and push metas in LC$, and all that... It&#039;s no wonder everyone is complaining.\n\nI don&#039;t want to quit, since the game underneath all of Tencent&#039;s greed is enjoyable, and since I have nothing else to do, but I&#039;m kind of done with supporting a terrible company that doesn&#039;t care about the game at all beyond how much money it pulls in. \n\nI really wish people would just stop throwing money at shitty companies -- maybe EA wouldn&#039;t be as bad as it is, maybe Riot would be somewhat decent, maybe Nintendo wouldn&#039;t have switched to greed mode immediately after Iwata&#039;s death... but, modern &quot;gamers&quot; don&#039;t really give a damn about something as inane as quality or passion so long as they have a way to waste time and/or feel superior for being a high rank.

It did in terms of playstyle and functionality, but then they took the game and made it so horribly simplistic that it's hard to enjoy it at all. Mario games were never hard, but they had places that'd kick your ass for a bit, and they had some small amount of challenge, while Odyssey is just a hollow Easter egg hunt. It feeds off of the completionist in you, while older Mario games were fun just through their gameplay. \n\nIn short, older Mario games actually felt like a game, while Odyssey feels like a cheap sandbox with Easter eggs to find.\n\nNow, Zelda... I grew up on Zelda, and it's always been my favorite game series -- I even learned to read by playing Zelda way back when. BOTW just isn't a Zelda game. It's a watered down survival sandbox with a Zelda skin on it, and a vague story behind it that really means nothing 90% of the time. Zelda games are known for exploration, story, and progression with new items and whatnot. BOTW has one of those three, and the exploration is samey and boring. Nintendo wanted to go back to Zelda 1 (for what reason I don't know, since LTTP was infinitely more popular), but then took out half the things from Zelda 1 that made it a Zelda game. It's pretty, but that's about all the game has.\n\nSo, as a Zelda game it's a failure. As a spinoff or standalone game it's just boring and shallow.\n\nThough I really don't expect people to look at things critically.
