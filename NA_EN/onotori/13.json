They can swap roles, play new champs, all that -- but they're still diamond. They have a better understanding of the game, the champs, and all those little interactions you learn over time playing the game. A diamond ADC main who is playing mid for the first time ever will still dramatically outperform a silver mid main (assuming that diamond actually deserves their rank). Despite that, they could still lose because their bot lane decides to feed, and despite everything that diamond player does, they're unable to stop the snowball. That's got nothing to do with the diamond player in an offrole. \n\n**The issue is not people playing offroles and doing worse, it's that the ranked system does nothing to recognize each individual player -- it's all about the outcome of the game, which is determined by 9 other players who are out of your control.** \n######(Moreso these days than previous seasons, with how fucking absurd damage is)\n\nIf you want to make ranked fair for the individual, don't just cover up the issue like you're doing. Retool the ranked system to modify LP gains / losses based on your ***individual*** performance (not per game, but over an average that builds with every game you play), based on stats that are important to the role you play.\n\nFor example: A diamond player who was boosted feeds every game, and can't function in high ELO. But because they were carried by a booster, they got a rank they don't deserve, since ELO is based on nothing but the outcome of the game.\n\nNow, with a proper ranked system, that person who paid for a boost is performing horribly every game, and so their LP gain is penalized, while the booster gains LP faster, eventually making the rank disparity too much, meaning the boostee can't be boosted anymore -- forcing them to either pay a new booster, or just give up and stay in their own rank.\n\nA second example: A silver player who plays far better than most people up to say high plat can't climb because of bad teammates. With a system based on individual performance, even if the silver's teams are bad, if their performance is consistently higher, then they'll eventually climb to where they belong, since their LP losses are minimized, while they gain quite a bit more on winning.\n\nIf you wanna talk about fair matching, that seems pretty fair to me. But it doesn't artificially extend the average playtime of the population, so it doesn't have any kind of money making potential, and I know it won't happen.\n\n**TL;DR: Make a ranked system based on individual performance, and all the complaints go away.**","replies":[{"poster":"KonJoo","date":"2018-04-25T23:30:37.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"the riot philosophy is that your mmr ist based on winning and loosing but nothing else.

Also check lolking and you'll see I've played ranked since s1, so I'm not lying. If you don't belong in silver then your influence should be greater than your rank and it should show in the long run (if you're consistent). If you're stuck in silver you most likely belong there *50% wr over 100 games.  Not trying to be offensive, but I've had the same belief of elo hell when I couldnt even get gold 5.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2018-04-26T22:11:21.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think of it, winning actually not being everything would be a very good thing in soloque play.

They can swap roles, play new champs, all that -- but they&amp;#039;re still diamond. They have a better understanding of the game, the champs, and all those little interactions you learn over time playing the game. A diamond ADC main who is playing mid for the first time ever will still dramatically outperform a silver mid main (assuming that diamond actually deserves their rank). Despite that, they could still lose because their bot lane decides to feed, and despite everything that diamond player does, they&amp;#039;re unable to stop the snowball. That&amp;#039;s got nothing to do with the diamond player in an offrole. \n> \n> **The issue is not people playing offroles and doing worse, it&amp;#039;s that the ranked system does nothing to recognize each individual player -- it&amp;#039;s all about the outcome of the game, which is determined by 9 other players who are out of your control.** \n> ######(Moreso these days than previous seasons, with how fucking absurd damage is)\n> \n> If you want to make ranked fair for the individual, don&amp;#039;t just cover up the issue like you&amp;#039;re doing. Retool the ranked system to modify LP gains / losses based on your ***individual*** performance (not per game, but over an average that builds with every game you play), based on stats that are important to the role you play.\n> \n> For example: A diamond player who was boosted feeds every game, and can&amp;#039;t function in high ELO. But because they were carried by a booster, they got a rank they don&amp;#039;t deserve, since ELO is based on nothing but the outcome of the game.\n> \n> Now, with a proper ranked system, that person who paid for a boost is performing horribly every game, and so their LP gain is penalized, while the booster gains LP faster, eventually making the rank disparity too much, meaning the boostee can&amp;#039;t be boosted anymore -- forcing them to either pay a new booster, or just give up and stay in their own rank.\n> \n> A second example: A silver player who plays far better than most people up to say high plat can&amp;#039;t climb because of bad teammates. With a system based on individual performance, even if the silver&amp;#039;s teams are bad, if their performance is consistently higher, then they&amp;#039;ll eventually climb to where they belong, since their LP losses are minimized, while they gain quite a bit more on winning.\n> \n> If you wanna talk about fair matching, that seems pretty fair to me.

It also could have the side effect of inducing those passive aggressive quitters (who the report function will never punish) to play through the game, instead of QQ and sit alone somewhere  afking minions to avoid being reported even though the reality is they did quit playing. Got some jerk on your team decides he will feed and make you lose? Ok well he will lose twice as much as me, so he is punishing himself even more, if you are just bad and misplaced because you abused duo q with your really good friend to legally boost yourself? NP you will get crushed every match you play alone and atleast drop much faster as you deserve to. Your teammates are all misplaced and all go 0/12/0 while you went 7/3/9 well atleast your losses are minimized theirs maximized so that each of you can reach your proper rank faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2018-04-26T01:44:45.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A dieamond player is a diamond player: \nWell if this stays true there will ofcourse not be szenarios in which way you are a diamond adc and a silver mid.

Even if you get camped top and can't do much a winning game cause you did not loose entirely top and bot and your jungler used it good that enemy jungler focused top the whole time is something you earned too.

In no game you have players get advantages for loosign just cause they still performed good. A Messi who kicked 7 soccer goals wills till not accomplish the next stage if he lost with his team 7:8. He can get maybe player of the day or the tournament but these are not the real deal.

Once people realize that playing for stats isn't how you win and climb, people will go back to playing like normal people.\n\nAs for your example of a top lane being camped... people in higher ELO don't feed if they can't win lane. They just farm as well as they can and roam, helping out other lanes.
