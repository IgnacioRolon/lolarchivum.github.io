There were a lot of things you said regarding balance, about how you run the company, and all that... but you&#039;ve totally gone back on the things you said at this point, and continue doing so.\n\n* &quot;We hate it when a champ just up and 100-0s you with no counterplay&quot;\n\n* &quot;We hate mindless statchecks&quot;\n\n* &quot;We put balance and quality first&quot;\n\n* &quot;Money comes second&quot;\n\n... Just a few things you&#039;ve said in the past that no longer apply.\n\nNow, the game is starting that downward trend. The amount of complaints I see has been getting worse and worse every season, and I see more people leaving the game -- even people I used to play with. Financially, the game is doing great, since you&#039;ve got plenty of whales in your pen that will happily throw money at you for whatever half-assed cosmetics you push on them, but the game is doing awful from the player&#039;s perspective -- and I&#039;m sure at least a few devs agree with me, though they can&#039;t say anything about it.\n\n* Balance is abysmal, and the snowballing is so bad that even LC$ players are afraid to try doing anything. \n\n* Champs that are out of hand are entirely ignored or even buffed, despite the playerbase begging you not to.\n\n* Feedback on content coming out is entirely ignored, with the usual arrogant replies.\n\n* Work that shouldn&#039;t take much longer than a few weeks at most takes months to years, in order to build up hype and make more money while sacrificing quality.\n\n* Asinine changes to systems or champs are pushed through, even though they&#039;re not warranted at all -- again, despite community protest....\n\nI don&#039;t know if I believe what Beck said in his interview a while ago, but if things like this are what a company that &quot;puts the player first&quot; does... then I don&#039;t want companies like Riot to exist anymore. I think he said it like, &quot;A company for the player, by the player&quot; -- doesn&#039;t that sound like a cliche gimmick ad? If only it were true, but Beck decided it&#039;d be a good idea to sell out to a Chinese conglomerate that already has a stranglehold over most of China&#039;s gaming industry and is widely disliked in China.\n\nNow, if you put players first, and you put quality over money... why would you sell to a company like that?\n\nWhile I will swear up and down that Riot is a terrible company that shouldn&#039;t exist, don&#039;t get me wrong, not everyone at Riot is a bad person. Individual devs can certainly care beyond money, and most do, but a dev isn&#039;t allowed to do all the things they&#039;d want to do, since the company leadership puts money above all else (despite public claims that state otherwise). Beck and Merril (the people who started Riot) even quit, likely because of the things Tencent is forcing on them (assuming the things they say are true at all), just like GC left WoW because of Activision's meddling.\n\nBut, you know... I&#039;ve about had enough of the shit that the gaming industry is pulling lately, and I&#039;m tired of the morons that enable it. It&#039;s not like I can do anything about it though. I keep telling myself I could start a game studio, and remind people what quality and passion look like, but who am I kidding?\n\nI just wish people would open their eyes. ","replies":[]}
