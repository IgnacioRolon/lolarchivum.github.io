Show me one MOBA, RTS or FPS that does not have items/builds/classes that vary significantly in winrate across divisions/ranks if you really found one.\n\nStrategies change, but everything is viable in DOTA, which is why nearly the entire roster was played in their competitive season. Rainbow has infinite strategies to use. MMOs have infinitely more complex PvP but are much better balanced across the board (and they're balanced for PvE simultaneously). Overwatch is relatively balanced, and any hero can work in any ELO.\n\nHmm... I'm seeing a trend here. So, while playstyles and metas might change in every ELO, everything is viable in every ELO -- unlike League, which is based off of archaic designs that tries to be modern at the same time and ends up shooting itself in the foot as far as viability / versatility goes.\n\n> The issue is people perceive certain champs of being stronger or weaker than they actually are, and stuff snowballs way too hard in low ELO.\n> \n> Aside from removing all snowballing (ie, delete gold/items or make them timer-only, remove all benefit of kills except downtime) snowballing will exist, and it will be worse in low ELO where people have bad damage control strategy.\n\nOr we would delay power spikes to be more than one item or level 6, entirely rework autos to make them actually fair, and nerf unfair statchecks until they're reworked. But that would make LC$ boring and slow, and wouldn't be a good idea business-wise, so it won't happen.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-16T02:52:14.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> MMOs have infinitely more complex PvP but are much better balanced across the board (and they're balanced for PvE simultaneously).\n\nI just stopped here.\n\nMMO PvP is notoriously horrible and unbalanced, especially if it is mixed with PvE. \n\nI guess we will need to see how Crowfall and Camelot Unchained do, but right now every MMO with heavy PvP is a joke. \n\nWoW: Unbalanced, mostly dead.\n\nGW2: Totally dead, previously just elementalist circlejerk\n\nBDO: Entire game is slowly dying, PvP is P2W and as well-balanced as a drunk duck.\n\nEvery dedicated PvP open-world MMO just turns into a zerg-rush and dies when people realize nothing they do matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Onotori","date":"2018-03-16T03:04:29.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, good thing I'm not talking about open-world zergfests then.\n\nPvP in WoW (as in, RBGs and arena) are very well balanced, to the point you can find almost any comp in very high ratings.\n\nPvP in GW2 is very well balanced, and you can find any class in high rating, not just Elementalist.\n\nPvP in FFXIV is well balanced, though it's not a focus of the game.\n\nBDO is shit, so yeah.
