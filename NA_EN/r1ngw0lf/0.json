I come back and there are these newer new runes and items getting changed. I wish to acquire the collective mindset of multiple players and see if i can get help bring my Nami game back on track\r\n\r\nSo first i want to know what the best runes are for her.\r\nSecondly just curious on some good support builds for her.\r\n\r\nAs always i appreciate and await your future answers.\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nMay the stars guide you  {{champion:16}}","replies":[{"poster":"sad Ã¾oy","date":"2018-05-05T09:11:20.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami main here\n\nI almost always run Sorcery as Aery, Manaflow band, Transcendence, and Scorch, then for my secondary page I run Chrysalis and Revitalize on the Resolve tree.\nBuild I run: {{item:3504}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3107}} {{item:2065}} {{item:3117}} {{item:3190}} \nSituational: {{item:3222}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3905}} \n\nIf it seems like a really difficult all-in type of matchup I'll take Resolve as my primary with Guardian, Bone Plating, Chrysalis, and Revitalize.

Bounce a W off an enemy to heal your ally and apply a shield to them is surprisingly helpful for saving your teammates.  If you build Ardent, you can E your ADC and now they have both your slow and Ardent on them from one spell.\n\nI personally spec into Domination second specifically for the Active items CDR rune, since that means my Redemption, Locket, and Trinket will be on a shorter cooldown.  People like to fight in my elo, so having my redemption come up that much quicker might mean I can save my Top laner from getting caught even though he's on the opposite side of the map.\n\nOthers go into Resolve for Revitalize or into Inspiration for the Cosmic Insight.\n\nItem wise, generally you want Ardent, Redemption.  Obviously, if you have a Jhin or Ezreal, you can skip Ardent unless someone else on your team can benefit from it.  It's still a good item with them, but they don't benefit from it as much as a Jinx or Kog would.  After that, look at the enemy comp and decide.  \n\nDo they have burst or a wombo, Locket then.  Athene is good too vs burst for more healing benefits, but it's more single target (I tend to replace Ardent with this when I have Jhins/Ez).  \n\nSince I take Active Item CDR, I tend to get Twin Shadows or Shurelya for more play making ability.  Twin Shadows can be used to help scout when you go warding, so you don't need to facecheck bushes any more and have a way to out run the enemy if they find you.  If you watch where the ghosts go, you can tell generally where the enemy team is even without vision of them.  These are still good items without the Active item CDR, but personally I'm just trying to maximize my rune choice.\n\nYou will probably be fine with those items but always adjust your build accordingly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-04T21:43:11.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at what higher elo players are using and apply logic.\n\nLooks like just about everyone runs Aery with inspiration or resolve, which makes sense. Typical enchanter stuff to boost heals/shields/mana.\n\nYou could also run Comet with Precision for PoM and Cut Down, if you feel like gambling on a snowball or just chunking people with Q. There are much better champs for this, though.","replies":[]}]}
