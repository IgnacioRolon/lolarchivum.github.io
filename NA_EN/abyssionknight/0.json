July 4th one of their devs started attacking the community.  July 5th the CEO made a statement apologising and stated they were fired. They even went on to say they&#039;d have responded to the situation sooner, if the 4th hadn&#039;t been a holiday. They also made it clear that the ex-devs behaviour was unacceptable, and that they make their game for the players. \r\n\r\nThen almost 2 months later Riot Games has almost the exact same situation. Riot however seemed to learn nothing from ArenaNet&#039;s situation, was oblivious to fan feedback, or the fact their choices would get compared to ArenaNet&#039;s.  They&#039;ve shown zero support for the community, they&#039;ve failed to communicate, and they&#039;ve failed to even put out an apology. It&#039;s as if Riot wants people to think they hate the community or something.","replies":[]}
