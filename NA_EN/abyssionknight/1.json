Because of the Nyquist limit, people won't see much difference below 1/24th of a second ping (although if they know what the actual ping is, they may think they see a difference, because of the placebo effect).  If you can find some software that lets you view animated GIF's at arbitrary frame rates, try watching one at 24 fps, then try at 6 fps, then try at 60.

Which isn't wrong, but in Riot's case, it simply doesn't work that way. Riot is the only one that can answer to people's feedback and ideas.\n\nForums might have asked for less stall comps, shorter games and whatnot, but that doesn't mean it's been done correctly. And in this case it's perfectly acceptable to call Riot out on it. In fact, they want us to do so. They might not answer much, but our opinion of the game is still important to them.\n\nAlso, a lot of the more annoying changes were actually uncalled for. Mastery changes, mana pots, sightstone nerf, even the tower nerfs (though I have a feeling that's more of a \"change went bad\" than \"we just nerfed it\") are examples that come to mind.\n\n\nPersonally as a support main I'm mostly pissed about the sightstone nerf. Having only three wards every back rather than 4 is extremely annoying, as warding both Tri and dragon basically means you either give up the lane bush or sacrifice dragon (as I'm not gonna let Tri unwarded). Pinks are fine, but some supports are better at protecting them than others, and matchups can make defending one impossible to begin with. \n\nAnd what did we get in exchange?

If anything, they should have buffed both jungle monsters and items so that rushing sighstone would make it almost impossible but buying normal jungler items would keep the current level of difficulty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yukumari","date":"2015-11-16T05:11:07.940+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is so accurate, it hurts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lafouboy","date":"2015-11-16T07:35:40.896+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"I wished for none of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2015-11-16T07:45:54.923+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You didn't, but plenty of people did. \n\nExcept for the mana pot removal.
