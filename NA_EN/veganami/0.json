I know I can fill out the google form to redeem and use the code. I just tried that and it did not work.\r\n\r\nA possible issue that I can think of is that I changed my summoner name between the time I donated to the Impact Challenge and now.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this can be fixed!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T17:34:46.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After you fill out your information to the form, it will then need to be distributed which isn't instant.  if it's been a few days since you filled out the form and haven't received your items, reach out to[ Omaze Support](https://support.omaze.com/hc/en-us) to take a look into your specific issue.  Even if you changed your summoner name, your other information submitted through the form will help identify your account.  The key here is just to wait until the next batch of rewards are distributed.
