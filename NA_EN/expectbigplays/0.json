It could have an X so if you want to exit out so you can watch whats going on in team fights and stuff. But like the last 10sec of your death, being able to re watch that, That would be good for everyone so they can find out what they did wrong, what happen, and made sure that they could fix what they did for future battles.","replies":[{"poster":"Startyger","date":"2014-09-13T02:15:22.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just like to know how {{summoner:10}} Revive keeps killing me...","replies":[{"poster":"Rif12","date":"2014-09-13T09:14:17.812+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Sunfire Cape's passive, if I'm not mistaken.","replies":[{"poster":"Startyger","date":"2014-09-20T02:15:54.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty.
