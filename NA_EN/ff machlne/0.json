The zinger here is that they delete the emails as well, leaving no trace. It's good you have a ticket already, those account agents should be able to set everything right again after you verify that you created the account.","replies":[{"poster":"FF MACHlNE","date":"2017-11-28T01:17:45.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how long until I usually get a response?Has been longer than a day already and still nothing","replies":[]}]}]}
