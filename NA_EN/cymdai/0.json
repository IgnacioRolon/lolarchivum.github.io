Pretty low priority bug here, but if you&#039;re spectating a friend, there&#039;s still a surrender button on the UI! After 20 minutes, you can click it and nothing will happen, but I just thought it was kind of funny.\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n1) Log into the game and get to the lobby\r\n2) Right click on anyone in your friend&#039;s list and hit &quot;Spectate&quot;\r\n3) While spectating a game, hit the escape button\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nObserve that there is a surrender button showing up, despite being a spectator\r\nObserve that it unlocks after 20 minutes, and that a player can click the &quot;Surrender&quot; button\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.3.16_02_05_12_04","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-18T19:00:01.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Cymdai! \n\nThanks for the report! This is currently WAI. As Nyaboron mentioned, it's the same UI as the game client, and we're cool with this, as long as it's not actually surrendering the game. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Cymdai","date":"2016-02-18T22:40:42.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool.

Taking it out is more work, I think.","replies":[]}]}
