Good example - Annie's backpack clips, but since it's minor and hair, it's a-okay. \n\nThat said, we're going to take a look here and see if we can minimize it. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"LordOfMayonnaise","date":"2016-03-01T17:25:43.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Katey,\nI understand what you mean with the example but wouldn't the shuriken apply some sort of force upon contact with the hair? For example, unless of course, either his shuriken had no push effect or his hair is able to resist all opposing motion while in his taunting position.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-01T18:39:11.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's... not something we account for, unfortunately. :c I get where you're coming from 'cause you're right, there should be some force.\n\nIn this case, we're working with Kennen's older rig, and there are some limitations. When we make a new skin, we try to accommodate for clipping issues 'cause a new model can mess with it. (New armor on some skins is literally the worst when it comes to this. :P)\n\n**Super side note here** - legendary and ultimate skins are much easier to eliminate clipping because they get a new rig, in addition to the new model, which means it's wayyy easier to eliminate clipping 'cause we can rig the model  for the needs of the skin.\n\nIt comes down to clipping, which is exactly that - a piece of the skin moving through another. At that point, it becomes a question of - is it visible from game height/speed? Does it look wicked weird? Things of that nature.\n\nThis may not be the answer you're looking for, but I wanted to be super honest and upfront about how this kind of thing works. \n\nBuuut, like I said, we're gonna take a look and see if we can adjust this!","replies":[{"poster":"LordOfMayonnaise","date":"2016-03-01T19:49:05.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh well, thanks for clarifying {{summoner:13}} the reason.
