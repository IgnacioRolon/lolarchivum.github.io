So, the word &quot;Ass&quot; is next to Orianna&#039;s face and yes I know it is short for &quot;Assassins&quot;, but only the word &quot;Ass&quot; is visible. It doesn&#039;t affect game play, but it might be a little embarrassing and could possibly make teammates or enemies call you an &quot;Ass&quot;. This might be considered a bug, or an unintentional design. Hoping it&#039;s an easy fix!\nThanks for reading. {{champion:61}}","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-22T01:24:58.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's just assume it's an easter egg, and not mess with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-22T01:25:45.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh, can't believe nobody noticed that.","replies":[]}]}
