This video is a great representation of your progress. However, I do not like the path that this video is sending you. It sends an unsettling message. The song talks about the world around the players, but it says that we are more important when absorbed in this digital world. Reality is what's important. We need to be aware of what is around us.\r\nDon't get me wrong, I love video games. But I'm engrossed in school work right now; I'm trying to keep up with my AP classes. Education is important, and the more you get, the more prepared you are for life. Sitting at a computer, burning your eyeballs on the screen from playing all night is not how we should spend our short-lived lives.\r\n\"We are the warriors that built this town.\" This is misleading! Our great inventions and creations were and are made by doing, not dreaming. The world is added upon by our hard work and physical labor. These days, our ideas can gain great praise, too. But putting all those ideas into a digital world that will take lives away from reality is not how these great minds should be spent. \"But you always knew that you'd be the one to work while they all play.\" You don't accomplish anything through these bits of digital entertainment.\r\nI'm glad to see your progression, and I love playing League of Legends, but please don't send messages of \"the wonderful digital world\". Our lives are better spent with our families, working to make others better, helping others in need, and improving ourselves. I'm sorry if I made it worse for you as a gaming company, but I felt that this needed to be said.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-28T19:07:41.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I think the idea is that for the guys who made it to pro(which I think it's about) the game becomes their reality.  I think the only thing really wrong with the video is it kinda gives the impression that raging is simply part of the game and normal, which it shouldn't be.","replies":[{"poster":"Adjectivecorgi4","date":"2014-09-29T22:26:41.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course. I totally agree. A game is a game and nothing more. Things that happen in the game shouldn't affect the gamer's real life.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baneli","date":"2014-10-10T04:11:40.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the opposite. League and other games upon moving towards the e-sports arena, the game and the people who play it become different. If you think of League as any other sport, the yes a game can change the way you live your life. Soccer fans, football fans, baseball fans and others see their sport as a religion and couldn't see their lives without the game they so love. With Passion comes rage, because you want to do your best. Not everyone is going to rage, or change their life. But I do think if you do in fact wish to become the best, your life will change. Same goes with anything I suppose, if you want to be the best prepare to sacrifice other things in life!","replies":[{"poster":"Adjectivecorgi4","date":"2014-10-12T00:15:48.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you could say that I'm not a huge fan of *the idea* of e-games, but I don't think that it is worth being absorbed into something that's going to bring rage and hate. This concept of changing yourself to focus on this game does happen to a lot of people; but that's the big problem. I know that if you are going to play a game like this, you are going to need to put a lot of time and attention in it just to do on match. This is okay if you spend your time moderately, but all the time is what gets me. Not only that, but when these people let the game affect their real lives; when they let it become their life.","replies":[]}]}]}
