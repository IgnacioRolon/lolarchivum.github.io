It has gotten so bad that now I just keep repeatedly getting low priority ques and must 20 minutes to get into a que to start 1 match. I have repaired my game files multiply times. I have tried reconnecting multiple times. I have restarted my client multiple times to try and connect and restarted my internet. Any fixes to this or do I just have to constantly keep repairing my games files after each game to hope this doesn't happen. I just can't see myself waiting 20 minutes to start a game that may last 40 minutes or more routinely. It always happens when I am trying to load into a ranked game also.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T20:50:55.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be some network settings that aren't quite set up up in the best way so that you've got a solid connection 99% of the time, but that 1% is bound to show up sooner or later.
