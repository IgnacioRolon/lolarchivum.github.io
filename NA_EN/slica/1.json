It started with pop ups from my computer wanting to close LoL client because it was using to much memory (this has never happened before) and I had been playing for a couple years now without ever having this pop up. Then it progressed from that to me always getting bug splats during champ loading screen and having to try and reconnect about 6-8 times before finally getting into a game. Now I can't even connect to a game, I just constantly get bug splats and low memory pop up during champ loading screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game twice now. \r\nI'm not to tech savy so I don't know how to pinpoint the issue and solve it myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-11T23:27:59.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a ton of factors that could cause bugsplats and memory issues. Deep Terror Nami touched on some of the more specific causes, but to start, I recommend taking a look at our [Bugsplat & Crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) to address the common fixes. \n\nLet me know if you still encounter issues after working through those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-11T20:36:54.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is happening only while using a specific program, it's usually due to a 'memory leak', which is an error in the program that keeps increasing the memory usage until it's closed or your PC crashes. When you open up the game, pull up your Task Manager (press Ctrl + Alt + Del) and see if the memory usage from LoL.exe keeps climbing, or if it's from another program.\n\nIf LoL is causing it you can try running a client repair by clicking the question mark on the top right of your launcher, but if that doesn't work you may need to to a fresh remove and reinstall.\n\nIf another program is doing it you'll want to do the same with that one instead, but if you can't find any specific program you might have a faulty memory stick, which you'll want to troubleshoot separately through the memtest program or simply swapping individual memory sticks out one at a time until you find which is the issue (assuming you have multiple sticks).\n\nIf you need further assistance please let us know.","replies":[]}]}
