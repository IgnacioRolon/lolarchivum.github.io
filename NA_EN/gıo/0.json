Pretty sure instead of doing dmg with his Q it instead heals the enemy tank/laner. This champ is so fucking garbage right now it doesnt even make sense. Everything about him has been nerfed. QWER all nerfed. Base stats are all shit. His scalings are not good either compared to HIGH mobility assassins like Leblanc. Its bad when an udyr with triforce can catch me even when i ulti away. I just dont understand why this champ is even in the game since having one on your team is like playing without a midlaner for a whole 45 minutes. His cooldowns on his spells are too high except for his ulti, his mid game doesnt exist this champ doesnt fucking exist until the 40th minute of the game when he has 6 items. Even when im ahead on this champ i feel behind. I understand competitive somehow manages to find a way to abuse his ulti, but if thats the problem then give the fucking champ a rework instead of leaving him in this state of uselessness. Every other AP melee laner&#039;s base stats are fucking retarded. Diana is pretty much a tank with double dorans and an abysal scepter against any mage. Ekko has good base stats as well, mean while kass has shit base stats shit scaling and shit everything. \r\n\r\nCan we have a reworked Kassadin, with GOOD base stats, and some GOOD scalings. Change his kit so its not broken in competitive play, besides just gutting the champ until hes a 50g minion that can run flash away every 1.6 seconds.\r\nId rather have his Q a skillshot and his E changed to something else rather than having this champ that does zero dmg and is utterly worthless in solo que. \r\nMake kassadin not have reliable click on dmg or make it to where he has to go in, in order for him to get the kill so he is vunerable to being killed himself instead of him just not doing any dmg. \r\nJust throwing this post out there bc im frustrated with playing him and not getting any results. its almost like im handicapping myself just so i can have a shitty blink that doesnt even go far enough so that i can get away from udyr with a fucking triforce. \r\n\r\n\r\nALSO list of champs that have insane mobility with insane dmg:{{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:76}}","replies":[{"poster":"Your Real Mom","date":"2015-07-29T11:05:26.405+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin now isn't even about using his Q or E for damage output.

Imo her Shunpo and Ult should only recieve 50% of her passive CD reduction on kill. \n\nEven Akali's bases are probably the worst of any assassin in the game, 260 on Q, but she has to proc to actually do that much, meaning her initial q only does 115. Laning phase is shittier than Kassadin's and Katarina's, her E is a weird skill to have in her kit ever since they removed the proc, I could understand it having low bases and scaling just cause it synergized so well with her kit, but after the removal I think the base damage should have at least been up'd to 160.

Now I know you might say winrates don't matter, but the fact is that they do. When someone can't even carry 50% of their games, how the hell does that make them OP? He might be frustrating to play against, but never OP. I can tell you for a fact that during Katarina's glory days, she was more OP than Kassadin will ever have been.","replies":[{"poster":"Halo","date":"2015-07-30T00:36:03.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"During s3 his banrate ramped up and in oktober 2013 it reached 90% banrate in ranked games\n\nIf a champin recieves that high banrate.

His mid game actually isn't that bad, but his late game is when he starts to become a threat and It's just not a good spot for him.\n\nThe problem is that over the past 2 years Riot shaped the game to guarantee the 90% of games don't make it to lategame unless it's bronze or silver elo. It's too easy to destroy towers, baron and dragon buff give way too much push power, and mages are pretty nerfed meaning they can't prolong a game like they use to be able to with Athene's mana regen.\n\nPersonally I thought Kassadin was fine after the 170 base q nerf. I still didn't agree with it, but it wasn't the worst thing that could happen. After they nerfed his ult range, all the base damage reductions, scaling on w reduction, q shield value reduction, and removal of ult damage just became so much more apparent. I mean they just need to buff his W and E and he could be perfectly balanced. His E does way too little damage for an ability that has to be stacked, even if a teamfight stacks it fast, you're still gated by mana and cooldown. And his W does pitiful damage for placing you in melee range as an assassin, even if it's technically your AD + 140 + 60% AP meaning technically it does more if not the same amount of damage as Q and E, it still puts you in melee range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-07-29T22:56:32.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he cannot assassinate 100-0 with 6 items an adc. make the math ull see for urself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-29T20:23:24.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"If he was so garbage right now, then why is it that pro players still use him\n in lks, lpl, and lcs?\n\nAnd not only do they use him, they fucking murder everyone with him","replies":[]}]}
