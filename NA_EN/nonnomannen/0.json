I watched through alot of post and saw you was having a problem about 12-24 hours ago with Authentication. I have the very same problem. I was conected earlier but lost my network while away from keyboard. When I was back I reseted my connection to the network with the client up and it wouldn't automatically reset so I restarted it. Now I can't get through the autentication and I tried some stuff to maybe fix it. Like change the DNS-server and run the program as adminstrator. I think it could be the very same problem you had earlier. \n\nI also tried to login on friends account but that doesn't work either.\n\nI hope you can bring me back to the rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-11T18:22:24.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for trying all that!  Those older posts were specifically on NA, due to some ISPs having problems during that period.  I'm curious if something similar could be happening here.  If you get a moment, grab the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to grab a specific log file called LeagueClient logs.  This will help us figure out if something is messing up while trying to reach the authentication server.  \n\nThe file is a bit too large on the boards, so attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can take a closer look.","replies":[{"poster":"Luciéd","date":"2017-05-11T18:35:10.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I got the file you was asking for but I can't manage to get a ticket.
