I wasn't being toxic, I was simply irritated with this teemo's childish behavior (constant blaming jungler, telling us he would feed, I even defended fiddle when everyone wanted to report him for inting as well despite it being a bad game.) I've had 2 week bans and permabans before, but never one for this mild of a game, this was the ONLY game in the logs by the way. I was honestly super confused because my client completely froze up during the end screen before I could report the dude, and I got banned after the honor screen. I don't usually talk with trolls but this was the last game I had time to play and it ruffled my feathers that the time was wasted because of one dude deciding to troll. Of course I wasn't the most positive, wanting to ff and calling fiddle a feeder (that was more to point out the difference between teemo intentionally losing and fiddle having a bad game, but still) but seriously, one game? I get banned for ONE mildly bad game after I hadn't said anything for so long, demonstrated by the fact that there's no other games on the log? Imma have to send in a support ticket for this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Humb1e Rumb1e","date":"2020-02-07T07:20:04.688+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, but you were negative, called someone dog, accused them of feeding and asked for reports.

She ints while raging at people in stream chat because those people are insulting her. Minimum donation to use stream chat: $1. Her teammates are unwilling and unwitting business partners with no share of the profits, like a Three Stooges routine where two of them are just random people on the street getting hit in the head with a ladder. And guess what? She still plays on her main account. No bans for inting every game, because Riot said \"it's just a persona.\" I'm sure that's a huge comfort to all the people who get a guaranteed loss as soon as they see her on their team.\n\nIf the only way for you to avoid a ban is to turn off chat, that's a perfectly acceptable strategy, but not everyone needs to do that.

You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the matches that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several matches. You might see three matches, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity.

Where does it say that a reform card must contain X games minimum? Where does it say toxicity is only wishing Ebola to mothers? Spamming useless sterile sarcastic comments is forbidden as well. Some people reach permabans without being horribly vulgar or wishing horrible things to sisters. They are simply repeatedly negative and follow the protocol 10cr, 25cr, 14d, perma. The game you are displaying is not hardcore by itself but takes place after chat restrictions, hence the 14d ban. If it was your very very first offense, maybe you would have only gotten 10 chat restrictions or nothing.\n\nYou got 14d ban because you KEPT breaking rules, remember you didnt lose the account for one last incident only. Its an accumulation of negativity/toxicity.
