If you're a backline healer who isn't aggressive, you're not gonna get an invite to play with the boss man himself. Thems the works. \n\nMore importantly, this _Setts_ the precedent of Riot doing new champion promotions like this in the future, giving out the champion for free to players who do things that cater to the new champion's playstyle. Sett is all about aggression and getting in people's faces, so he's given out to players who get first blood a lot. A future champion might reward you for never dying during a match or setting up a ton of assists with stuns or other things that might appeal to a support player, and that's when you'd get your free champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2020-01-14T20:06:24.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah, but literally every single role, regardless of what champion type you are, is encouraged to get first blood EXCEPT for supports.
