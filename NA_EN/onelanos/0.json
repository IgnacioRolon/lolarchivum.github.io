So some time went by and I stopped caring about watching what I was saying or what it felt to other people of what I was saying. One day I got a chat restriction I was pretty bummed about it but knew that I shouldn&#039;t have said what I said, so I was dropped to honor 0 and ever since I haven&#039;t talked in chat and if I did it was to say good job or something informational (like top no flash). I never leveled up after and still remain at level 0 and I think I will never level up in order to actually play clash which to me seems really cool. I sometimes feel like the honor system leveling up just doesn&#039;t work for me, but it could just be my imagination. I do have one question do the honor levels get reset each season?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-12-13T00:41:55.818+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I do have one question do the honor levels get reset each season?\n\nhttps://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/HIZAeknK-honor-season-2018-on-pbe\n\nTLDR;\n\nHonor levels lowered due to penalty will not be reset to a higher value.","replies":[{"poster":"OneLanos","date":"2017-12-13T00:47:09.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for answering the question.

It's something we are looking to make better.\n\nIt's going to depend on your penalty. But it may help to think of Honor 0 and 1 as special cases, and the level from 3-5 is a consistent experience. Exhibiting genuine sportsmanship will see you through the system faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Has No Team","date":"2017-12-13T01:06:53.411+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm going to go ahead and have to say that the system as it is makes negative minded players lose hope even more so which does illicit more negative behavior from them.

I get that this may give a little too much info out than you'd like, though, so I understand if it isn't implemented.\n\nAlternatively, maybe keep a tally on their profile of how many games have slowed their honor progress? With/without info, but just a tally maybe?\n\n----\nPersonally I think the biggest clarity issue is that players don't know when their honor progress is being slowed at any level, but especially those that have been punished don't generally understand that if their behavior doesn't improve they won't progress, even if they aren't getting punished more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2017-12-14T06:32:11.391+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=n0ZiAy61,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-13T01:16:43.985+0000)\n>\n> There is a lot of reason for people to improve.

Also maybe put these in an honor tab where your best honors from a game can be saved so you can see the match they occured in and possibly a running tally like the old system of how many honors of what type you have gotten.\n\n\n\n\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellmaximus1","date":"2017-12-15T22:52:52.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will cursing slow progression ie \"Fuck me\" \"man that XChampion fucked my lane up early game\"?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-12-14T18:04:02.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question of clarity on Honors.\n\nIf they moved from Honors0 to Honors1 (from a 14-day ban), does that mean they have dropped a punishment tier (i.e their next punishment will be a 14-day ban again, instead of a permaban).\n\nYes / No answer will be suffice, if things change in the future, we as the community can adjust the information we give out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClonieMor","date":"2017-12-13T04:00:38.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if there were a \"lifebar\" of Honor that would be filled after every game? \nI just don't know when or where it'd be place, but would be nice for tracking.\nPS: Maybe the lifebar could seem like a tree, almost literally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Has No Team","date":"2017-12-13T03:57:21.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A mock up of the idea I stated would be (Albeit poorly)   \n\nI didnt have any decent progress bar stock images but I am sure the art team could make some kickass look on the fly.\n\n\n https://i.imgur.com/aer3C2w.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninja Assassin","date":"2017-12-13T02:39:52.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a little bit off-topic, but have you ever considered implementing a reward system specific to those that have had their honor taken due to chat penalties or bans?
