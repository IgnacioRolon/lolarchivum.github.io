For those with performance issues, we'd appreciate if you could:\n\n* Update your drivers\n* Adjust your environmental settings (try turning some down, as the scales got recalibrated! Your 'medium' settings on the old SR might actually be closer to a 'low' on the updated Summoner's Rift - *even with the same performance*)\n* Disable HUD animations\n* Disable VSync\n\nIf none of the above work, you can help us out by posting a description of the issue in this thread along with a DxDiag:\n\n>- Click the START button on the bottom left corner (default) or press the Windows Key.\n- Type **dxdiag** in the search box and press ENTER.\n- Click \"Save All Information...\" on the bottom right of the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.\n- Attach the file here.\n\nWe're seeing a lot of machines run the same or better on the new Summoner's Rift, but that's exactly what these staged rollouts are for - tracking down the unforeseen performance considerations and figuring them out.\n\nWe'll continue to provide updates via this thread on our efforts and thanks for your patience.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Quick update!** \n\nThank you all for the helping us track down these issues. \n\nWe've been able to identify some potential causes of the hitching and major FPS-drop-spikes that many of you have reported. This has allowed us to make progress on a couple of improvements we believe should reduce these problems and help with overall performance. We're looking to get these out to you all in a small patch soon. \n\nWe will continue to look into additional ways to improve performance further with the hope that we'll be able to roll out more optimizations in future updates. \n  \nThank you again for helping us understand these issues. I'll continue to update this thread with updates as we have 'em!\n\n---\n\n**Our hotfix patch, sent out this morning (11/17, 9:00 AM PST), includes the improvements mentioned above. **\n\nFor those of you who are experiencing poor performance on the update to Summoner's Rift, please give playing on the new rift a try after downloading this patch. \n\nIf these fixes are improving your performance or if you are still encountering issues please let us know. Thanks again for your patience and for your help in tracking down these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Pandam","date":"2014-11-13T07:01:03.888+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":2,"body":"Description is : I used to have ok FPS, generally 30ish FPS all throughout the game, regardless of team fights or not.

Dell is well known for selling overpriced clunkers, or computers with strange builds.  I don't understand why they gave you an octocore i7, but put the El Senor Budget GPU in that bitch.

I would like to point out that I own an average computer. 500-600 dollar computer a year old and I have been able to run the old summoners rift at 40-60 FPS. I turned every setting on low in this map and disabled my vsync for a while and HUD animations are off. The problem with this is the map puts me at 20-30 fps when I play and roam and in 1 v 1 with champions like riven where there are a decent amount of particles running around I get 7 fps. In the base where we have super minions turrets blasting everywhere and major team fights I get almost a constant 5 until I leave the base and go back a little bit into the jungle.  The lowest I have ever gone is 30 FPS...  Now I know I don't own a 2 thousand dollar gaming computer but I shouldn't have to. The computers you tested that somehow gave you the idea this new map preformed better were obviously not done on the average computer. I am sorry I am not Bjergsen or some higher up player who can run 156 FPS constantly but the old SR was fine. I will attach my DxDiag in hopes that it will help you solve whatever issues that are causing this but it is not our computers. If the old map worked fine then put the old map back until you figure this out please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jolt9","date":"2014-11-13T07:30:22.871+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I too am one of the people who will **NO LONGER** be able to play once this new map is fully released considering I was already on the **Lowest possible** settings  and could play fine but now everything goes to shit just watching the creeps fight, when I face 1 champion i miss half the battle due to lag/frame loss and everything just freezes when it comes to a team fight.\n\nI also just want to say it sorta has a DOTA2 vibe to it ***and if** this change was just to steal some fame or be more like DOTA2... that's just sad I chose League over DOTA2 for a reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skyceratops","date":"2014-11-25T18:16:43.197+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before the new summoners rift came out I used to run at around 40-50 fps and 35-45 fps during teamfights. Now in the new summoners rift I can get around 30-35 fps which is okay for me but the problem I'm having is when I hover my cursor over a model and it highlights it, I drop really low. My fps can get as low as 3-15 when I hover over something EVEN THE ENEMY. If this cant get fixed it will make the game unplayable for me so I hope there is a fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sir kazzy","date":"2014-11-24T15:52:00.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"For some reason the \"Retrieving data from server\" is taking forever (Even when im in custom games) also when i do play my pings go way up! when they are normally in the 90's-100's they shoot up to 190-300's plz fix this, it wasnt like this when the old SR was out so i think there is something wrong...","replies":[]},{"poster":"cZTssnNMTt","date":"2014-11-21T22:11:20.833+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please respond with an accurate estimate of how long the current maintenance is going to take?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanctioned","date":"2014-11-21T19:58:09.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i also can't seem to get into a game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Çhaos","date":"2014-11-19T03:24:12.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I love the new SR, but I do not love my newfound connectivity issues. I have done everything stated above and previous changes you have made have helped my game experience, but there is still a very annoying and frustrating problem. I normally can run the game easily and smoothly at 60 frames per second and have no interruptions, but on the new Rift I am getting constant spikes of lag/disconnectivity where I simply lose control of my champion for three or four seconds. It is generally during skirmishes or teamfights that this problem occurs so you can see my problem. I recently was playing mid Syndra and dominated my lane. I ended the game 17-6-7, but regardless of my score, we lost the game because of one of these spikes. I simply could not control my champion and ended up walking into the enemy team. By the time I regained control, it was too late to even Zhonya's. My team got crushed in the ensuing fight and we lost the game. Needless to say I was very frustrated with losing due to something that I could not control. Although this was the most crucial time that the lag spike occurred, it was not the only time. It happened six other times during my 40 minute game. Please look into it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spystrike","date":"2014-11-18T08:38:10.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be a little backwards to what I expected. I ran pretty well on the new SR pre-patch this 17th. There were some games I got fps drop, down to maybe 40fps, but even then that's playable, and that was only for a fraction of the games on the new SR. Ever since the patch yesterday, though, I don't have fps drop, however I keep dc'ing from the game. I know at first it doesn't sound like a problem with the new SR, but since the patch, I can't play on the map. I'll have a solid 60fps, now I never have the drop to 40fps, which is great. However, even with a constant 80 ping, never spiking, I'll get \"Attempting to Reconnect,\" and this effect I reproduce consistently on the new SR since the patch yesterday, and I DON'T have that \"Attempting to Reconnect\" problem on the old SR in ranked. I don't really understand how the different map would give me connection issues, but me playing on both maps multiple times confirms that the new map POST PATCH gives me connection issues. I'm adding the DxDiag in case they are topical, hopefully there is a simple solution before you port the new SR post patch to ranked!
