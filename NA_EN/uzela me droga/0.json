First of all, I&#039;m not spending even one more cent on this company if they won&#039;t fix this error by removing content, banning them or something else, but I have an idea!\n\nAs you can see, price for one capsule is 750RP.\nI suggest next:\n\nIf player abused that error and get for example 5 capsules, Riot can remove random content from users account worth 3.750RP.\nIf player abused that error and get for example 10 capsules, Riot can remove random content from users account worth 7.500RP.\nIf player abuse that error and get for example 100 capsules, Riot can remove random content from users account worth 75.000RP.\n\nIf player don&#039;t have enough content on his account, then Riot can suspend account until he pay, same as they suspend accounts for refunds/chargebacks. If you have better ideas, please comment, and Upvote this one so everybody can see that.\n\nI am here since 2009, I spent so much money on this company, but that what they do is just humiliation. \n**\n\nSorry for bad english, I hope that you understand what I wanted to say.","replies":[]}
