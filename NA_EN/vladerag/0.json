The only lane that can really use it is bottom lane otherwise you're putting yourself at a disadvantage in the other lanes. With the change to warlord's and the reduced effect on range champions it's really not that strong. There's more of a chance that the new Warlord's will break something over stoneborn.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-03-08T16:46:19.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could work, if you're willing to put this onto Swain instead of Deathfire.
