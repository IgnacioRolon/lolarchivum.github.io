I would pick support, and to counter invisibility I would get Oracle's  Elixer. I see now that Oracle's Elixer has been removed from the game. Okay.\r\n\r\nSo, Teemo has Mushrooms which are invisible. And instead, we have access to Oracle's Lens, which has an uptime of at most 10 out of 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nSo is that it? I'm literally asking. I could be saying a lot of things in this thread. I could throw a temper tantrum, or I could not throw a temper tantrum. Instead, I'm asking a question.\r\n\r\nIs that seriously it? Just Oracle's Lens now? That seems kind of insufficient, so that's why I'm wondering. Am I missing something, or does Riot actually think it's okay that the only way to disarm Teemo's traps is to walk over them, and take damage?","replies":[{"poster":"C0NCH0BAR","date":"2019-12-17T06:42:26.290+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oracle lense, control wards, Adaptive Helm (for tankiness), maw of malekiekfiehtjwieh (for AD damage dealers), no clue for AP centric characters","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-12-17T06:38:46.226+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3364}} ,  {{item:2055}}, or literally anything that builds out of {{item:1033}} .\n\n{{champion:35}} is a much, much, much bigger problem right now.

That can give you 40% active item CDR, so you can have 36s CD on Oracle Lens.  Ashe mage AD mentioned Umbral Glaive via item icon {{item:3179}} , but I'll repeat it since it's a new item that took an old effect.  It automatically disables wards and exposes traps that detect you (45s passive cooldown).  Mushrooms exposed this way are destroyed with a single auto.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DÃ¼ff McWhalen","date":"2019-12-17T13:47:25.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOBODY ever remembers Adaptive Helm...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-12-17T09:10:01.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well no one else is saying it so guess its my job then.\n\nUse minion Wave for lane and a mix of {{item:3361}} {{item:3363}}  {{item:2055}} {{item:3364}}  for Epic monsters.\n\ndo not mindlessly chase for kills into fog of war.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2019-12-17T07:30:04.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few very situational and very champion specific ways of 'countering' it, but even these are a stretch since you need to know approximately where they are such as spellshielding yourself and walking into it or if you're Neeko, using your close to pop them.\n\nSo yeah.
