But I don't remember the last password it had or the signup email. I don't even know if I can regain access to that email since I wont remember any information associated to it.\r\n\r\nIs it even possible to get this account back and would they bother? No RP purchases were ever made and no debit card was attached since I was 14 when I created the account.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T20:24:43.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still possible to get that account back, though you might need to try to remember a few more details.
