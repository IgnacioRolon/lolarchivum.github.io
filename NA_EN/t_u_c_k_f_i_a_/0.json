How do I get it?\nA: Yes. There’s a mission called Force of Wills in your mission log that unlocks the Victor’s Emblem. You’ll need to complete any seven missions to get it, excluding In the beginning... The Victor’s Emblem will sit in your loot inventory until VS. is over. You will then need to craft it into an icon that celebrates the reigning side.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-20T19:29:24.167+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":">You will then need to craft it into an icon that celebrates the reigning side\n\nYou only get the icon of the winning side.

The icon will be for the side that wins, it does not matter WHO you supported, if you finish 7 missions during the event your able to craft this icon. that being said riot may be tricky and put an orb cost on it, but I doubt it as folks would get so tilted if their side won but they couldn't unlock the icon.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-20T23:27:36.838+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":12,"body":"Why are you repeating the obvious?","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2017-06-21T07:40:16.778+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Tldr. Your first two responses did not address the Openers questions, had no relevance to how the event worked. Your response to my Ctrl C and Ctrl V seemed like you had confusion over  the wording of  \"You will then need to craft it into an icon that celebrates the reigning side\" and I wanted to be helpful so I elaborated, twice.\n\nWall: Well mate that's an easy answer. I got a down voted from some one who I had assumed was you and I figured that you had no idea how the emblem worked with this event. This assumption is because my post addressed the op's question, your post how ever involved \"bragging rights\" something that has nothing to do with the rewards from Victor's Emblem. Also its not even a thing that exists considering that players can swap to the other side at will when missions reset daily. Your response to my post was to claim its not that hard to follow, which I do agree with but I must confess I don't get why you chose to quote me and follow up with \"seriously, its not that hard to follow.\" To me this implies that there was some form of confusion with the sentence you quoted. Overall I do agree with you in that its pretty easy to understand so long as you have read the publically available website. Unfortunately from the number of posts on the boards not knowing what the emblem is for its clear that people don't know what's going on. I guess its my bad that I assumed you where confused and had the wrong idea about how this event functioned, but in my defense literally every thing you have posted in this thread was incorrect and/or off topic making me thing you had no idea wtf was going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-22T14:03:38.608+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"OMG, it was a joke, not an off topic reply. The objective answer was already provided by Sw4, so there was no point in repeating it. The whole point of receiving an icon for the winning side is to brag about having supported the winning side, otherwise why would you equip it? Unless you're some sort of vichyist that wants to brag about having lost, or if you want to pretend that the winning side was the one you supported all along. \n\nSeriously, what's wrong with people nowadays, you can't say anything sarcastic or oblique anymore without people taking at it face value as some serious reply. Maybe the conspiracy theories about vaccines have a point after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2017-06-23T00:47:00.048+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"1. jokes are supposed to be funny, and would still be off topic.\n2. If you want a post to be associated to another post use the reply feature.\n3. Not really, the icon is for participating, not everybody gives a dam about being on the winning side because even if their favorite champions one side there's free stuff you can unlock that has more allure. Annie vs vayne skin drops from orbs, and icons. I for example have been running order to farm orbs and praying to rng gods to give me annie skin, but personnaly i like yasuo more and love the darkside force puns.\n4. You should work on improving your sarcasm then. I'm **absolutely 100 percent positive** that you don't know this but text is actually a bad format for conveying tone, something that's a key part of sarcastic responses.\n5. Bluntness, literal answers, and patience are great tools in helping folks who are genuinely confused and also has the added bonus in pissing off trolls as they feel their trollery is going over some ones head and will waste more of their time trying to get under their skin.\n6. A good hunk of my wall was to bait you out to determine your intent. Thanks to your response I now know you where not confused by the wording \"reigning side.\" As your not some one who was struggling with a limited vocabulary or the concept of how this event works I will just move on. (Pro tip, this means that further responses to this post  will be a waste of your time.)\n7.
