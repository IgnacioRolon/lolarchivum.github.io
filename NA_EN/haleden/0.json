Every game I play, I put 100% into making good plays and winning. For me, the fun of the game is playing at a high level and ultimately winning. I can enjoy a loss if it was a close game and well played.\r\n\r\nI do have a temper, especially when I get harassed for not playing to my teammate&#039;s expectations. Especially when those teammates happen to be playing very badly independently of me.\r\n\r\nMy account is about 10 years old. I just received a permanent ban within minutes of finishing a game. I was playing with someone who played top and was dying a lot early on and was harassing me to come gank their lane, and saying that the other team&#039;s jungle was ganking but I wasn&#039;t. Common scenario, right? This particular scenario is infuriating, because I&#039;m already doing everything I can to help out my team. I want to help them. I want to make good plays with them and win. But I can&#039;t be everywhere at once. At the time this guy starts harassing me, it&#039;s only a few minutes into the game and I haven&#039;t had an opportunity to gank top yet. They continued to harass me as I was making plays, trying to help other lanes, and I ultimately flew off the handle. I cursed them out, and I complained in all chat that I was getting harassed by my teammate using very colorful language. The opposing team joined in on the fun and took his side, because why not, when you&#039;re stuffing another team, it&#039;s fun to add insult to injury. Well, after the game, I got permabanned. The troll won in the end, and I guess I&#039;m never playing league again.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not a saint. I can be baited into reacting. If that means I can&#039;t play league, then fine. For the troll, on the other hand, he&#039;s winning the game of being inflammatory and getting otherwise innocent players banned.","replies":[{"poster":"4G PnutCollida","date":"2018-08-26T22:57:24.469+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH, should have just muted him. If you got permabanned, you had to have gotten a 14-day ban before, meaning you’re on thin ice. Even if you call the dude an idiot that’s basically enough for a perma ban in the end","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-26T23:06:36.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LV49, 10 years old.\n\nCant have used it that much recently..\n\nEither way you chose to get yourself banned, nobody did it for you.

Like down voting posts like these is even more sad than him being banned. You would've all posted aswell, most of you atleast if you ever got banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Haleden","date":"2018-08-26T23:00:22.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is now!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Haleden","date":"2018-08-26T23:02:01.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Topic is already at -2 within minutes of posting it.

On these boards, you're one of a sea of players every day trying to represent their permanent bans in a sympathetic light. We have only your version of events to go by in this instance, and you're also addressing a community well-acquainted with the fact that a permanent ban means you've worked your way past several previous tiers to get where you are now. I'm not surprised that the community has reacted negatively to this thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dat Kat","date":"2018-08-26T23:04:40.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know . . . the boards does have a lot of hate and trolls aswell.
