Can someone help with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-22T20:25:14.587+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"The issue you're having might be due to launching the repair tool through its shortcut icon, which can't properly be opened as an administrator.    Run it as admin through the actual tool in the installation folder, and that should get you fixed up.  The program should be in its own folder called Hextech Repair Tool via your Program Files folder.","replies":[{"poster":"jookíe","date":"2016-07-22T21:07:51.379+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! I actually found that by pressing shift while right clicking the shortcut it allows you to directly run as admin. I am actually rather surprised because the hextech repair tool seems to have actually fixed my packet loss, which id been trying to fix for quite a while. Id recommend for anyone to try this if they're dealing with packet loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Adar the Red","date":"2016-12-05T02:15:59.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you!
