When I do the password reset, I received email and was able to reset the password.  But when I attempt to login to the league of legend client, it shows \"Your account is in the process of transferring. Please try again in a few minutes.  If the issue persists, contact player support.\"  Which I did not do any account transfer at all.  When I try to login and open a ticket on the website it says we cannot find the combination of username and password.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do next?  This is really upsetting, since I have invested tons of money into champion and skins......\r\n\r\nPlease help\r\n\r\nBest regards","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T19:48:13.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we can work with you and help recover your account.
