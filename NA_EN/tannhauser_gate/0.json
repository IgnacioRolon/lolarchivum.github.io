I&#039;m really disappointed Talon doesn&#039;t have a hood and Twisted Fate somehow does. How something so distinctly Talon just slipped into the hands of Twisted Fate boggles me. I feel like Talon and TF swapped because Talon is missing a hood. The mask doesn&#039;t scream to me &quot;this is Talon&quot; and I&#039;m not the not the only one who initially mistook TF for Talon in the teaser simply because one of them had a hood.","replies":[{"poster":"Gapybo","date":"2017-01-25T15:25:27.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it, not every skin he has requires a hood. It brings variety and makes him look distinctively different. That's a positive thing in my book. Also his mask/entire outfit is badass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-01-25T15:50:28.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do like the hood and feel it should go to talon, but I'm stil gonna play talon just for this skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-25T23:36:16.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont touch the hat!  oh, hood, i meant 'dont touch the hood!'","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sandrahy","date":"2017-01-25T15:41:02.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't have a hood in his dragonblade skin.\n\nhttp://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/chinesenewyeartalon2.jpg\n\nAnyways, you should of been able to tell by their postures.\n\nAs TF stands straight up while Talon is slightly crouched over (or how to english, idk) \n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Eyhg3Opowmk/WIgPZ9keo8I/AAAAAAABBVI/jrQvSicCSKgtiaWbKLIfUwvIpx31RHszgCLcB/s1600/576757567.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-01-25T22:19:30.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sandrahy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LdiuA3pf,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-25T15:41:02.746+0000)\n>\n> He doesn&#x27;t have a hood in his dragonblade skin.\n\nOne of Biggest reason why I don't like the skin.\nIt doesn't even look like Talon anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-25T23:45:50.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's supposed to be Strider.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
