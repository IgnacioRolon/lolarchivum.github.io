Something like ADC is almost certainly heavily weighted towards CS, where as something like support probably doesn't get penalized for having almost no CS in a 20 minute game. Furthermore, champions like Zilean with little kill potential are probably less weighted on kills than champs like Katarina. \n\nNot sure what exact stats riot uses but I'm like 90% sure this is how it works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-22T05:32:53.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it was 5.7 cs a minute.

I understand that rofl-stomp games can make farming harder (it's more important to take a free tower than go farm a big wave), but that's just how it breaks down.\n\nAlso, vision score.. \"I dropped 5 wards\", in a 20 minute game, is 1 ward every 4 minutes. You could drop basically triple that amount with minimal effort. If you REALLY want to rack up vision score, you've gotta go ward hunting.\n\nVS and CS (vision score and creep score) are the two things you need high to get an S; that and a low number of deaths. S ranks really don't give a shit about your champion kills, because this isn't a team death match game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheVoidCentury","date":"2018-03-22T04:51:18.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see. thank you for the quick responses and clearing it up. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-03-22T04:46:44.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, it's really hard to get an S grade on a 20 minute game.\n\nSecond: \"over 100 CS\" and \"5 wards\" are like bare minimum expectations. Those aren't impressive stats, I'm sorry to tell you (and one of reasons 20 minute games are hard to get S's on because you can't farm or place as many wards)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-03-22T04:45:46.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cs too low","replies":[]}]}
