(85 cs at 10 min is good enough for laning, 60 at 10 mins if your jungle)\ndo these and you'll start to climb.\nalso never hurts to work no mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-07-14T20:53:25.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop pretending that 9 out of 10 players you see are trolls and focus on your own play.\n\nFocus entirely on your own play, because if you're in bronze in the first place you are still making a LOT of mistakes. Fix those, and you'll climb over time. Because if there are 4 people who suck on your team but five people who suck on the enemy team, your team will still win.\n\nFocus on improving as a player, and you'll rise in time too... but remember, your goal is to become worthy of the better rank, not just get it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-07-14T20:48:55.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze 4 in season 3, and have since climbed to where im at in gold 5 now. It IS possible to climb out of it, it just takea a lot of hard work, time, and patience. My younger brother has a bronze account that i go play on every once in a blue moon to try and win a few ranked games for him....and i gotta say it is consistantly the most aweful experience i ever have in league. Not only do ppl not know what to do to win games, but they constantly flame everyone in the game and blame everyone else for their own mistakes. Plus all they want to do is play team deathmatch, which is NOT the objective of the game. Do you watch streamers? Read champion guides? Watch youtube videos? All these things will help you to understand what it is you should be doing to win games and climb. Climbing from the bottom isnt something an average player can do quickly, it takes some time. Map awareness, rarely dying to your lane opponent, last hitting effeciently (10 per minute average), always warding (whether buying stealth wards or upgrade trinket @ lvl 9), itemizing properly to who youre playing against....just some examples of things that should be second nature to you if you want to be serious about climbing. Hope any of this helps ya","replies":[]}]}
