The game is downloading unbearably slow though. It says it has to download about 4000MB and it's downloading at about 20-50 KBps. My internet speed is about 1.5MBps based on a few websites I checked on though. Is this a bug on my computer or is there some type of fix?  I don't have Pando Media Booster on my computer, so it isn't that. Any help would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T16:45:02.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update files are grabbed directly from the patching server, so this wouldn't be the result of some peer to peer network or panda media booster.  The improtant thing here is to let the patcher continue doing it's thing without closing it.  Doing so can force it to rescan all of your game files for corruption before ever restarting your update.  \n\nOnce finished, go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot anything blocking or throttling you from promptly downloading those updates.
