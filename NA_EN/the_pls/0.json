It doesn't look like you've had a series since the 6th of this month.  That series ended after 2 losses, and I wasn't able to find any series after that.  Per the[ ranked play](https://www.google.com/search?q=ranked+play+guide&rlz=1C1NHXL_enUS727US727&oq=ranked+play+guide&aqs=chrome..69i57.1614j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) guide, you need to reach 100 LP to enter a series which hasn't happened just yet.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"The Pls","date":"2017-01-12T17:15:49.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in my series. It said congrats you've made it to your series and have one free win, etc. that was the game where I went 2/2/5 as vi. then I played another game as kha zix and lost. But right after that kha zix game I played another game as vi and won, going 14/0/2 which would've meant that i.d rank up. instead of ranking up it put me back at 98lp. No offense to you but I know for a fact I was in my series with one free win, a loss, then a win.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T17:31:54.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye, it looks like I was looking at the wrong ranked queue.  Thanks for clearing that up with additional details!  It looks like you did enter a series in ranked solo earlier.  Unfortunately, there was a queue dodge that resulted in a second loss and ended the series.  Any [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) during a series will result in a loss and cancel any promo helpers, so it's important to stay in-game.  Hopefully that clears it up now, and good luck in your next series!","replies":[{"poster":"The Pls","date":"2017-01-12T17:42:26.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, and one more thing relating to that dodge (I had completely forgotten that it happened and do not recall it saying that I lost my series), with the new league setup just about everything about league lags really bad except for my in-game and it leads to me not being able to place in champ picks, accept games, ban, set my masteries/runes. I try to never dodge or afk but I cant do anything about it with the lag. Its never happened until the new setup.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T17:43:46.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing so you could run into issue.  While testing is on-going, there's no harm in using the legacy client to queue up for your ranked games:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"The Pls","date":"2017-01-12T17:44:53.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for the help","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
