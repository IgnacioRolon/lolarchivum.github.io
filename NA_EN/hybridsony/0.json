This problem is sometimes the result of a player in your game \"drop-hacking.\" or the issue may stem from deeper system troubles. The good news is that I can definitely look into this for you! Unfortunately, we're unable to provide any LP for games lost this way. \n\nI'll need a few things from you for my investigation: \n\n-That game's r3d log - this will show me a history of the game as seen by your computer. Make sure to pull the r3d log from that game only, please! \n\nhttps://riotgames.zendesk.com/entries/27495980#wq7 \n\n-A list of players and which Champions they were playing - this helps me check the trends of player matches to spot potential \"drop-hackers.\" If you can only remember your Champion, that'll still help us to try and find the game. \n\n-The time of the game in question - try to be as specific as possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Bananar","date":"2014-10-07T03:52:10.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have the same issue here. \nBut when I click on detailed history match, I can see the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecondStreet","date":"2014-10-06T18:11:31.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Damion Slevcik","date":"2014-10-06T15:04:26.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually happened to my ranked games as well.
