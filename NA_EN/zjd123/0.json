See ya.\n\nYou know I have an idea speaking of Talon.\nChanging his passive to an execution like Nightfall on the old Duskblade would move him out of top lane and give him extremely reliable burst damage. As in like when you get the enemy to 30% health the passive procs. That would also allow you guys to revert his W and R.\nAdditionally, 1 more thing. You know what would REALLY help Talon? If when he's in his ult, if his Q turns into a blink. That way, you can still have it be a jumpstab, but when in ult he has the reliable blink he used to have.\nThese are changes that would just be SO good for him and would move him to mid where he belongs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zekaboy","date":"2018-05-09T20:45:33.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree since there are plenty of platinum accounts where the players only play zed and talon. especially zed since he is more empowered than other mid champs.
