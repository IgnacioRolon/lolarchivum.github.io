Minions for my daughter. I was told in a December 13th email: \r\n\r\nMechs vs Minions is expected to arrive in our warehouses between December 12th and 20th. We&#039;ve made all the necessary arrangements for the game to be issued to you from there without delay. We can&#039;t guarantee delivery before the 24th December, but we believe most will receive the game before then.\r\n\r\nThis order was placed as part of WAVE 2 and should have shipped. But since then I have not heard a peep. No email that it was shipping, no email that it was delayed.\r\n\r\nI have sent two emails to Riot without response.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what is going on? Did this happen to many other people. I would love Riot to get back to me.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nWill","replies":[{"poster":"Kades","date":"2017-01-18T00:40:02.958+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Will,\n\nI'll need to see more info in order to help you with this.
