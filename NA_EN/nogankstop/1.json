When some guy with the .5 kda overall is in the game with the guy with the 5 kda it is beyond stupid. The guy who averages 12 deaths a game and 10k damage who basically acts like a bot. Every game feels like this:\r\n\r\n1 great player\r\n1 good player\r\n1 okay player\r\n2 mentally challenged people who shouldn't be at this elo\r\n\r\nWho has the biggest impact? The two mentally challenged people. They decide the game. The worst players. Not the best.

And that's just the reality of most average players... they have wide variance. If you look at my match history, I have two lux support games back to back: 1 I went 8/2/15, the next 1/9/6. Then after that I had a more average 9/6/23. Last night I had a game where it took me like 20 minutes to get my manaflow band online because I just couldn't hit ANYTHING... but then I also have games sometimes where I hard carry, even as a support.\n\nThose are the realities of being a mediocre player at this game - it's not like you go 5/5/5 every game, it's that some games you pop off, and others you look AWFUL.

Back when we didn't have role queue you were required to learn how to play every role and as a ADC main i would just learn maybe 2 champions in each role just in case but majority of my time would go towards learning marksmen and their matchups. In fact most of the champions i play still today came from that time i was learning more champions to be useful in other roles.\n\nBut what's the problem? Every role (specially jungle) changes way too often. One patch your comfort picks are decent then Riot does one of the balance patches and your comfort picks in another role now perform worse in some match ups or have to change their build now to adapt to changes and it's simply to much to keep up for most players (Even high elo players can't keep up with learning new information in their main role and then on every other role) this is why you feel the difference in teammates is too big sometimes. It isn't necessarily their skill level as players, but the how the knowledge they used to rely on isn't relevant anymore. Staying competitive in LoL is hard and the fact that the game changes so much makes it even harder.\n\nI don't even bother to learn the jungle anymore, it changes every month anyways so i just dodge whenever i get it. I can handle myself in mid but i only play one champion there comfortably and in top lane i can play more but then i get destroyed by ranged top laners because i don't have the necessary experience to deal with them. I'm good at support because i play ADC so i understand how supporting and their match ups work.","replies":[{"poster":"OrangeMarine","date":"2019-05-24T01:38:40.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"lol i just skimmed the first sentence of each paragraph to see if this was worth reading.

DuoQ smurf abusers 70% of an issue\n2. Bought accounts 10% of an issue\n3. People don't care anymore because league is trash 25% of an issue\n4.

Of course if nobody feeds, and its a stalemate game where I can carry, we win 100% of the time. Which is why I rank up, but very slowly.\n\nIts the same thing in gold elo, plat elo, diamond elo.
