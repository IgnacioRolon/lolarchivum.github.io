In game whenever the camera moves the textures become blurry and lose focus. But when I stop the textures are sharp and clean again. I've done some looking around but can not find an answer.  My specs are well over the necessary requirements for league.  Also I have tried turning down the settings to complete minimum and the same issue is there. I don't have anywhere to attach pictures if someone knows of an easy way let me know! Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Bocius","date":"2017-09-30T22:55:56.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you found a fix for this? i have the same problem and it kills my eyes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T03:05:27.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to shoot some screenshots our way to better troubleshoot, you can upload them to something like Imgur or Gyazo and share the image url from there! \n\nIt kind of sounds like those textures might be going a bit blurry from some weird driver interaction. Check to see if you might have missed an update for your graphics drivers and let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
