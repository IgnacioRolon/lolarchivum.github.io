Let's make sure to check some of your firewall and [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).

Just to be safe, I&#x27;d like to have you reinstall the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and then run it from the install directory as admin. Doing that should make sure that it did install correctly, and that it has the ability to run without being denied permission by your OS.\n\nLets try this and head over to the [Permissions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to see if that works. If it doesn't then submit a support ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saggin","date":"2017-06-01T04:19:15.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ran the repair tool but after a minute or 2 it said repair failed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saggin","date":"2017-06-01T04:12:01.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i clicked on the link and it said site can't be reached i tried it on my phone and that didnt work so idk what to do","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-06-01T03:55:22.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Hooded,\n\nThat seems quite odd, but lets see if we can fix it. The [Network Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) here might help fix it.
