The skins are looking worthless if this is the state it's going to be left in and I also wondered about why Blood Moon was able to have the particles these 2 skins are missing about, it's quite obvious when you just put a bit of thinking into the difference between the skins.","replies":[{"poster":"FGO Rin","date":"2016-06-01T15:47:48.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i can see the NEW PARTICLES but they're practically invincible. can't they remaster the old particles or something?\nand what about the e+q combo on classic and high noon that didn't look out of date at all if anything that combo feels empty now","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-31T20:03:00.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Okay, so I spoke with several teams, as it looks like particles were changes across the board.

If they can reply back or give an answer that explains why they chose to do this then I will gladly accept defeat and withdraw all my comments. \n\nI want them to elaborate on what they mean by 'Gameplay Clarity' because from what I can see, having the particles changed or having it looked like it being removed only made the skin value drop. I am sure many would prefer to have those particles back even if it looks retarded in the current style rather than the new one which is almost invisible, if it is present, can they provide some sort of proof of what the new particles are?\n\n[Yasuo Mains Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/YasuoMains/). This is the subreddit that both Spartacus and I came from to present this issue to Riot, or you in this case. I am requesting that If you or someone that works on Yasuo or anyone that can change his particles to pop into the subreddit and ask something along the lines of wanting the old particles back and I can guarantee at least 10-20 of them will say yes or even pop in and question them about it.\n\nOtherwise, atm, the 975 RP, let me remind you **975 RP** skin _High Noon_ will just end up looking bland and it's pretty disappointing to users like me and even more for the **1350RP** skin _PROJECT_ skin that I know a lot of players have.  I remember Riot asking in a survey if we feel our money was worth, I said yes to it and I want to believe they still is. Sure 2 skins won't make me change my mind **ENTIRELY** but this issue is making me reconsider it. \n\nIf High Noon and Project's particles were fixed/changed for 'Clarity', then I want to ask, why is it the Blood Moon skin that came out a few months ago fresh this year, ends up having the particles that the previous 2 are missing and Classic keeps his? If it were to be changed to 'Clarity' then why isn't Classic and Blood Moon changed as well? I'm not blaming or flaming the the team for they did but I am **QUESTIONING** as to why they only specifically chose those 2 skins for the 'Clarity' change. \n\nThis is just me reinforcing the fact that these changes for Clarity ended up making it look it being removed. I know that Yasuo has many bugs that cannot be fixed due to it being hard to pinpoint down but these effects is all that I and even the Yasuo mains are asking for in return at the **_VERY LEAST_** for Yasuo. \n\nThis is me pleading for another hope or chance of them reconsidering returning the old effects back since a lot of Yasuo players (Including me) are really sad about it being replaced/removed and we would be **SUPER APPRECIATIVE** to everyone that worked to get it back. I will even take a shot of it and tweet it out   for them to see. Thanks for taking your time to read this and hopefully consider it, You can tell I truly care for Yasuo and definitely his HN skin that I always love to use so please reconsider about this and **I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER** _as with everyone else._","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoryAlby","date":"2016-08-12T10:04:23.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HI Riot im in the seson 7 and the particles are not returned and i love that particles soo can u re add that particles pls??? i realy enjoy it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asakawa","date":"2016-05-20T02:08:53.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:157}} {{item:3070}} \n\nI have the High Noon skin on my acc and I can provide the screenshots needed like Spartacus has to show the missing effects for the aa, knockup, the E+Q effects which was not mentioned and the ultimate. Katey would know that I have discussed with her on twitter about this and as I promised to have screenshots provided, outside commitments and life events kept me busy this past week but I will get some ASAP. Once I or anyone else with the High Noon skin provides the proof, hopefully the team can look into this to investigate. In the meantime, I present to you videos that I recently watched as my evidence to kick off the case, the effects are still there and I hope the team can look into this video even for just a few minutes of gameplay to investigate. \n\n[Dade Yasuo-Effects present Season 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOiQZ6rsp1s) In here of course are the aa 'swipe' marks, 'wind' knockup effects on 3rd Q cast hit and a 'swipe' on cast also as well and last breath's 'swipe' marks that were present, the E+Q effects and compare it to this, [Dade Yasuo-Effects missing Season 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KgIC6I_564) where he uses the same skin again but now in recent times and it's evident the 4 or more effects are missing now. It may have happened during Season 5 but I cannot confirm myself because I was on school studies that year but some videos of Yasuo gameplays proves otherwise, I only noticed it this year and when someone brought the issue to my attention.\n\nThe videos above are for High Noon and for Spartacus who uses Project, the videos are here [Dade Yasuo-Project Effects present Season 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCtumB5HhSo&feature=youtu.be&t=8m49s) and compare it to this video [The Shy Yasuo-Project Effects missing Season 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoAwMjaIxOA) .\n\nIn case someone asks: Why Dade? Why not Faker or anyone else? He's my favourite player to look at when it comes to Yasuo but the video is where the proof is at, I would use Faker as an example but he rolls with using classic which the effects ARE STILL present in this time and that doesn't help with this discussion. Even so, a side by side comparison with Classic+HN or Project in game is enough to see the differences in the effects. Everything is fine with the Blood Moon skin so we'll leave that out.\n\nSorry for the long post but as a {{champion:157}} main myself, this feels important to me and I would like to join in on it. Plus if you think about it, without these effects, it feels bland using the skin and may as well go back to classic. Hope you can give the players something worth with the skins they own.     \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Stone Free","date":"2016-06-01T09:50:33.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Make{{champion:157}} GreatAgain","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-26T23:42:10.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for following up on this boards post, it's greatly appreciated. ^-^ As I've mentioned to OP, we may have an idea as to what happened here, but we're still investigating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nøble","date":"2016-09-13T05:38:29.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any news regarding the missing particles?
