If you're using any of the settings that adjust your HUD positioning (flipped minimap, team frames on left etc) the bars will show up for Manaflow Band/Presence of Mind on teammates.\n\nBug should be fixed in 8.1, but if it's too annoying a temporary fix is to use the default HUD settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-12-16T21:28:23.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leave it like this and let's call it a training of map awareness.\nOne does not simply miss Lee Sin preparing for sneaky gank when you have to watch your Support's Manaflow Band status.\nFor more life hacks subscribe to my channel.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"R0XTAR","date":"2017-12-16T05:28:20.793+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:81}}  Who needs a map","replies":[]},{"poster":"TryMucinex","date":"2017-12-16T01:41:24.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's caused by your allies taking Manaflow Band.

Notice how they are all evenly spaced? The only reason they do not look like the same colour as the mana bars normally, is because there is an opacity layer over the mana gauge that is not present in this graphical glitch, if I would have a guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2017-12-16T04:47:33.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suddenly got this in 7.24 but I didnt post because I cant print screen in league.
