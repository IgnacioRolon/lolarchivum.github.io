Once back in December, and again last month and it's being ignored. Whenever Syndra casts Force of Will, and she gets knocked up/silenced/stunned she is unable to activate Force of Will a second time after the cc wears off. It'll just show Force of Will either awaiting a second activation, or it'll go on cooldown meanwhile Syndra will still be holding onto whatever she's grabbed onto. This tears into her dps potential pretty heavily. Please respond! :( It sucks playing Syndra and having this bug occur every other game that I do.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-04-23T21:51:33.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Krys. I just tried to reproduce the bug using your guidelines. Here's what I did.\n\n1) Cast Force of Will on an Orb\n2) Stun, knock up, or silence syndra (I tried all three)\n3) Second Cast W \n\nMy result was that she threw the ball with no delay as expected. Do you have a video of your results?\n\nSide note, there's the possibility you're experiencing lag. When lagging and these steps are followed it will seem like Syndra is not casting as a result of the CC but it can be delayed because of lag. If your ping is 150~ ms or higher this instance is exaggerated.","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-04-23T22:02:38.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot MeyeA,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=8GKuUN0E,comment-id=000800000000,timestamp=2015-04-23T21:51:33.803+0000)\n>\n> Hey Krys.

Spamming Force of Will and nothing happening, not even a cast range indicator, is a bug. The ability locks up completely when you cast Force of Will, and get cc'd during. Maybe there's something else causing it, but Force of Will will literally lock up until the cooldown expires. There's no second cast happening. Maybe it's particular knocks up, because Yasuo and I believe Cho'Gath have been the ones I remember this happening against.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-04-24T01:33:41.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tried with Yasuo and cho'gath as well and couldn't reproduce this bug :(\nIf you find any re-pro steps or a video of this happening that would help me confirm how to make the bug happen. \n\nI'll keep my eye out for any more posts about syndra's force of will x.^","replies":[{"poster":"XuWarrior","date":"2015-04-24T07:12:50.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Meyea I think it's global champions problem.
