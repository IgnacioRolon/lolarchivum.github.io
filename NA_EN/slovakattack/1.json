Seriously, it's kinda ridiculous that the passive has a BASE BONUS OF 20 THAT DOESN'T SCALE AND A .1 AP RATIO. It's inconsequential, and seems like a not very well thought out afterthought to his kit. He is just not incentivized to use it effectively, due to it's low impact.\r\n\r\nWhy not give him a reason to invest in items like Nashors and LB?\r\n\r\nYou have a chance to genuinely make a cool, AP based MADC/bruiser that counters mages... why are you turning him into a spell-rotation reliant burster like he was before?","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2014-04-15T22:04:27.868+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Slovakattack,\n\nYou certainly bring up legitimate concerns with the buffs.\n\nI don't think that I agree with the fact that giving him substantial burst will make him an unhealthy champion, as long as he has to close into melee to achieve its full potential (even for just a second or 2). Removing the Silence has given us a lot of room to move now that his opponents are not completely locked out of reacting to him. \n\nAt the end of the day, Kassadin's burst is still not top-of-the-line in comparison to other assassins / mages, his base damages are among the lowest in class and his AP ratios are sizeable but not insane. A mobile, high burst, but squishy Kassadin with a hit and run combat style is something I believe is core to many Kassadin players. The buff to the W is simply to make it compare more favorably relative to Q / E and give him more reward when he arrives at his target.\n\nWe ran into some difficulties when creating a sustained damage Kassadin combat style, primarily due to the Mana itemization that exists in the game. Mana items are inherently very tanky, specifically they have a ton of easy access to Armor. Combine this with the focus we want to put on anti-magic in Kassadin's kit, this becomes a bit problematic because he often quickly becomes extremely resilient to both magic (built into his kit) and physical (Mana itemization) damage. Whenever we give a champion both Tankiness and Mobility, they need to have some pretty severe tradeoffs elsewhere on the kit or they become overbearing to play against. For Kassadin, he has to make real tradeoffs between Tankiness and Damage which is something we need to preserve.\n\nUltimately, I'd love for both Burst damage Kassadin and Sustained damage Kassadin to have places in the game, but to do so we would need to ensure each has its own strengths and drawbacks. With the current Mana itemization in place, I don't think it's plausible to make a sustained Melee DPS version healthy for the game. Currently, Kassadin can opt-in to a riskier AP focused build where he has significant damage and mobility but is ultimately very squishy, or a Mana-Tank build which is tankier and more controlling at the cost of damage output.\n\nHope this helps explain things a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-04-16T09:06:01.132+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">A mobile, high burst, but squishy Kassadin with a hit and run combat style is something I believe is core to many Kassadin players.\n\nAs a kassadinplayer i have to disagree here. He never had that 100-0playstyle without being fed, it had all been about using his superior mobility to get of multiple-combos without getting yourself killed in the process - and using his map-mobility to set up his team.\n\nIf i want to just step->burst there are already enough way stronger options in the game (LB now has more cc, way more dmg and a step on 6sec cd with instant retreat - there will be now reason ever to play kassadin if you keep his kit like that, as he fails in comparision to LB with everything he does). \n\nAnd I still don´t see why a sustained dps version would be unhealthy (->he needs time to bring the dmg, so there´s time to react to it accordingly), while a version that steps out of nowwhere and kills a carry within 1sec from 100%lategame should be healthy. It doesn´t matter if he doesn´t have a silence - there´s no counterplay if you are dead once you see him. That said...he needs an incredible amount of AP to reach that state atm as it´s all in his scalings, leaving him unable to either apply sustained dmg or burst dmg the first 40min+ of the game - rendering it to a 4v5 for his team right now before he yet again does become toxic and can carry.\n\nAnd last but not least...either change his jokes or bring the silence back, but this is just sad as it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-04-16T12:49:13.654+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realy don't like the new direction of kassadin.\n\nI loved the idea of becoming more melee focused to involve more risk for him, but for me it meant he gets more dps based frocing him to **stay** close if he realy wants to deal dmg, so he either builts tanky or becomes pretty risky.\n\nBut now, his dps got lowered, he does actually get rewarded less for gettin close while haveing more risk doing so, his base dmg is so gutted that building tanky means ur a no factor unless ur team wins anyway and u can clean enemies from ~15%hp, **and he lost his silence!**\n\nBesides his Riftwalk, his silence was the most iconic thing in his kit. If u asked anyone who got a silence, Kassa would have been the first champ that comes to mind for most players.\nEven his joke line is based on his silence, Kassadin simply was silence.\n\nI play kassadin since i play this game, and i never have seen him as the pure antimage he has become, he always was a bursty highly mobile guy with a silence, bursting squishys and anyoing the rest regardless of beeing ad or ap.\n\nI also never were a fan of the insane mancosts and resulting forced itemisation towards mana and the dependncy on bluebuff, but i did understand the need of gating his ult in some way.\n\nI think kassadin needs his silence back, maybe with some conditions bound to it, maybe with Q turning into a skillshot to allow counterplay, but kassa without silence is not kassa.  \nI think his Kit should be more dps focused, so lower ap ratios on his q+e burst, more dmg on his W on-hit and maybe a return of the as-buff from his passive. \nI wouldn't mind loosing the new shield if it takes to much powerbudget\nThe stacks of his ult need to fall-off much faster, or atleast scale with cdr, but a kassa that is more or less limited to 4steps total simply sucks, even if that means the base cd on his R needs to get increased.\n\n\nIf u wonder why i think he gets less rewarded than befor for getting close while haveing more risk:  \nHis W acutally now gives less dmg than the old one, in 2 hits, the new one does 180+0.7 dmg(1 of those hits beeing the active), 3 hits deal 200+0.8.\nThe old one did 180+0.6 in 2 hits and 270+0.9 in 3, and u got bonus as from ur passive, so if u stayed close to a target for more than 1 hit, u did alot more dmg than now. \nAlso, thx to the silence, u could afort to stay close for 2-3 hits easily, the new shield is barly noticeable making u alot more vulnerable if u actually get close.\nThe higher managain is just there to compensate the increased manacost of his ult, so not realy a net buff for his W.\n\nI don't think kassa with his current kit should be allowed to have a *huge* burst at any point of the game, as it kit still alows for to less counterplay un less u realy put all the burst into his W+R\nThe R->Q+E currently means he can apear out of nowhere and hit u with his 2 best scaling skills befor u know what happens, as the range of the combo is higher than visionrange, both dmg spells are point n' click(E kindof as it'S instand), and both skills have no casttime and fast animations.\nIf Kassa is alowed to reach a point where his Q+E takes 50%+ of an enemy carry, he will be broken as soon as he gets there, as any champ that would die from his Q+E has to recall as the threat of kassasdin apearing out of nowhere and finishing them without anything u can do abiut it.\nEven if u have vision on him, u can't get in a ~1350 range aoe around him without dieing-> u can't participate in the fight.\nThe possibillity of dealing dmg from so far away without a chance to miss it means for me that the burst has to stay low or he will be unhealthy for the game, it's like a nida homing spears.\n\nI don't think the current buffs on his Q shield on pbe are good, as it would only push him further into the niche of a pure antimage, makeing him and hardcounter vs ap-heavy comps, while making any ad into a hardcounter vs him, wich conflicts with the 'no hardcounters' philosophie that was mentioned in serveral rio posts, as winning a game cause u picked champ X vs champ Y rathern than outplaying or opponent is a bad thing.","replies":[{"poster":"turkeyBACON","date":"2014-04-16T18:09:46.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I like the idea of turning his Q into a skillshot to retain the silence but it would also be an indirect buff to his E since you would be able to proc it more often in the early game pre lvl 6.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-04-16T00:20:17.608+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you comment at all on the on-hit damage?

Sion had/has a similar issue, so I wouldn't be surprised if the Sion rework was an AP burster as well, rather than his original badass undead fighter self.","replies":[{"poster":"Keira Helsh","date":"2014-04-16T22:40:22.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, one hundred percent. I begin to feel like Riot loses focus on what they intended for many old champions over the years of playing. Kassadin is /not/ an AP caster, he is, has, and will always be a 'Melee Disabler' trying to get rid of that, is getting rid of Kassadin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fool4aLifetime","date":"2014-04-16T22:26:52.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well seeing as everyones making notions on AP kass, has anyone seriously tryed or considered AD Kass as an alturnitve to the weak AP builds. In all honestly we all know kass's AP ratios are low base solid scaling but hes suffering from one main problem, Gold. he needs too much gold to make Rod to make Zhonyas to make tear to make void staff to make tank items. He takes too long to scale and has little kill potential by himself if opponent builds MR. I dont see the recent buffs changing any of the problems with AP kass.\n\nBut AD kassadin is an interesting beast all his own. With Tri or hell fist, he does damage both burst and sustained, slap a muramana on him and ur doing solid mixed damage and can build HP tank items to help him thrive in frays. his kit is set to use and take advantage of Spellblade effects, so until his AP version is boosted to some sort of relevance i sugjest u give this alternative build a shot see what kinda results u can get.","replies":[{"poster":"Keira Helsh","date":"2014-04-16T22:32:06.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually been playing AD Kass recently, and he's honestly a lot stronger than AP Kass right now imo. Sure his Q and E don't scale, but his W is on next hit and has a 100% AD ratio because of it. Triforce is amazing on Kass, especially with his high base AD, and CDR also helps him overall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-04-17T07:37:08.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"right now i think his most viable spot in the game is actually jungler...with FF and a trinity later on his dmg isn´t great but sufficient and if you get some tank items he works alright to catch opponents and never let them go, as he still has an incredible strong slow and you just cannot run from him. And as a jungler it´s ok for him to not deal some major dmg, but instead being a tad more on the supportive side of things.\n\nThough of course, he´s still not really competitive to the current Tier 1 junglers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zerodias","date":"2014-04-16T06:54:49.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without the silence in his hit, Kassadin has a really hard lanephase now, buffing the base damage on his Q, with the buffs of his shield that are currently on the pbe should do the job, helps his burst as an assasin and his lane phase. As ive seen people dont know how to properly build him yet. Ive never seen a Kassadin runing lich bane now, when its so good on him IMHO. With a buff to his shield and some  base damage buff he shoudl be good to go.","replies":[]}]}
