Since the early jungle ganks has increased, Yi is actually scaling better with going Warrior then an AS item. With bloodrazor, Yi has to go rageblade with tiamat for taht AoE dmg. With a win rate of 42% i believe, he went 10% lower in a single patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-05-08T21:59:31.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"For champions like Xin and Shyvana, can't you just refocus their kits a bit to favor Warrior or Cinderhulk more? AS builds require tankiness in order to go off because of their sustained damage, and that doesn't work well on melee characters. AD burst or tankiness is just more balanced and better to support isn't it?","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-05-08T22:30:26.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana's entire kit scales with AS.

The item is already semi-tanky, offering damage while also being able to fill an MR slot for defensive itemization. It just needs to be a better item as a whole and that would help out tanky AS champs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
