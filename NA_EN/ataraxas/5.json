Now I know as a regular players league may not seem complex, but imagine for new players. It pushes them away from the game and alienates them. Even I, a returning player, had to look up almost every champion I used to know like the back of my hand when I got them in ARAM. And yes, I had to look them up during loading screen because you can&#039;t just quickly read them at the beginning anymore. Before it was like:\r\n&quot;Q makes you run fast and deal more damage next auto&quot;\r\n\r\nNow it&#039;s:\r\n&quot;Q makes you run fast, and if you can W the enemy while running fast you will do more damage to him; This will also leave a mark that can be consumed by your E, if you can get this combo off you will be able to cast your R&quot;\r\n\r\nLike what happened to all the simplicity? I don&#039;t get why simpleness is a bad thing, honestly. I feel like league is dying as a game you can have fun in after a long day and turning into a job for the LCS big boyz to show off in by doing 5000 pages of homework. If this is all coming from a returning player, imagine how new players feel.\r\n\r\nNow let the downvotes and &quot;git gud&quot; comments commence.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-11T05:15:01.743+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with simplicity is that it's difficult to create significant diversity while keeping kits simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Reanimatrix","date":"2018-04-11T14:56:12.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe there are enough champions already.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TitanAnteus","date":"2018-04-10T21:47:52.593+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't know man.

I understand not wanting to be able to master a champion after one day, but right now I feel like it's to the point new champs take a few games to even play decently. It should be more so that you can play a champion decently with relative ease but need time to _master_ it. Not you need a few games just to even get used to one champion's abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"TitanAnteus","date":"2018-04-10T22:54:19.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"6300 champs shouldn't be considered old if your initial statement holds this statement.\n>  Champions are getting too complex and it's not a good thing.\n\nRegarding this point.\n>  It should be more so that you can play a champion decently with relative ease but need time to master it.

Jhin is a popular adc because he's so different and complex as compared to other adcs. It also helps that complexity allows for varying character types. We don't want a homogeneity of character types as that makes the game boring.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2018-04-11T08:15:49.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Down voted for that weak and insecure last line","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2018-04-11T15:58:49.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh not all of them are complex... and it is a 4 button game for the most part.\n\nZoe for example is super simple, you hit E and then Q.\n\nMany champs do have so much weaving in their abilities which I agree should be toned down.\n\nBut most are hardly nidalee with more text in one ability than karthus entire kit, AND transforms.\nJayce...Elise..","replies":[]},{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2018-04-11T11:48:28.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing Swain and I love him.

Not only that, but I think that in my own experience, there are ample amounts of remaining simple champions that are noob friendly and act as a gateway to more complex gameplay.\n\nI see your point though.
