His visuals need to represent where is he from and where was he in the past (he is needed to be figured out thematically).\".\n\nI'd assume that he's not being worked on for now since IronStylus also said that currently all the VUs they are working on are bundled with a gameplay update (They're basically doing it because they see gameplay updates as opportunities to work on champs, visually, that they may never have the time, resources and chances to work on ever again or at least any time soon).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-08-15T11:55:51.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Dorito Hands to be honest.....but then again I don't play Udyr.","replies":[{"poster":"Hatless Casual","date":"2015-08-15T23:01:59.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just sad they only come in nacho cheese flavor.... sometimes I want cool ranch. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-08-15T23:25:39.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That actually sounds nice.
