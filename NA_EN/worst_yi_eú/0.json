Yes that&#039;s amazing according to Riot i&#039;m a psychopath! a toxic human, in their logic i&#039;m having a &quot;bad day a lot&quot;.\r\nI played League for about 2-4 years after my accounts got perma banned in the less than 3 weeks. So how could i last 4 years without any bans ever, not even a warning? and when i return to the game, with the new system, i get banned under 3 weeks of gameplay time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell first, why you have an ignore buttom in your game, i don&#039;t understand that, your logic is, that toxic players that type in chat, are distracting other players because of them typing, my opinion that&#039;s their own fault for not ignoring people that are &quot;distracting&quot; them.\r\n\r\nWell that&#039;s fine, what i&#039;m not fine with is that you ban players base of popularity votes, i have been banned two-times on two different accounts all of them because of PREMADES, always ganging up in a convo, and then mass report after game.\r\n\r\nAlso i play jungle, and as i jungle i&#039;m always the guy that gets blamed no matter what, why play this amazing role, if you are always the target, for their failures, but don&#039;t try to disagree with anybody, you always have to man and take the blame!!!!!, yes i see\r\n\r\nBelow you can find, there&#039;s a pyke support, that&#039;s fine it was when pyke first came out, and nobody knew what he was.\r\n\r\nAfter some mins, i get blamed after 10 mins.\r\nGame 3\r\nIn-Game\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: is pyke even a support?\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: i use him in jungle lol\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: yeah\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: you are late\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: gj\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: pay attenti9on\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: jesus\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: thats ur own fault\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: for not following\r\nWorst Yi E&uacute;: yeah after 10 mins\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell that&#039;s fine you can&#039;t disagree as a jungler, you have to man up, and don&#039;t mind getting blamed by 3-4 premades, you also can&#039;t talk to people!\r\nand try to teamwork like you do in other games, like CS:GO, Overwatch, Paladin and many other teams games, because you can&#039;t distract them :) remember, you can&#039;t try to call positions.

As a player that comes from CS:GO, this type of play in League is counter-productive and keeping the potential of the game back, are people playing their best games, in chat where nobody chats, and bypasses loopholes to not tell their true feelings, i look at top league streamers, and i see their chat is not moving.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in CS:GO if you don&#039;t say anything you will be kicked out of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting scammed for a lot of money by a bot, the trollers and bypassers.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s legit a whole indstruy of how to get your account back on League Of Legends, which you created, you created a black market riot, and the people that post down, in the comments hating on this thread will be money hungry bots, that love their money they scam for on the black market telling people they will get their accounts back.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-11-07T14:54:41.399+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Worst Yi EÃº,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=b7fKavGw,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-07T14:44:16.624+0000)\n>\n> There&amp;#039;s legit a whole indstruy of how to get your account back on League Of Legends, which you created, you created a black market riot, and the people that post down, in the comments hating on this thread will be money hungry bots, that love their money they scam for on the black market telling people they will get their accounts back.\n\nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/018/489/nick-young-confused-face-300x256-nqlyaa.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Worst Yi EÃº","date":"2018-11-07T15:03:08.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-11-07T15:17:36.803+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, who falls for scam websites like that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-07T17:22:27.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hold up.\nA BLACK MARKET\nWell Fuck skins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-11-07T16:12:34.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">So how could i last 4 years without any bans ever, not even a warning?\n\nBecause a player's behavior can change fairly rapidly.
