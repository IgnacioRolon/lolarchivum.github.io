Can you finally add opinion to disable FPS limiter, if the league game will not be focused? (alt-tabbing and such)\nI'm streaming and I alt-tab a lot. The game looks laggy for a viewer, because of your background fps limiter. I think it isn't that hard to add one button in a game opinion. Thank you. All streamers would like to use this opinion.\nEdit 1:\nSee here is my problem. I'm using bordeless or windowed. I'm alt-tabbing often.

Let me show you something. I've alttabed my game and focused the browser. I've got 20 fps, because of that.\n[My two monitors](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/303306970658504704/341563486276419584/unknown.png)\nA lot of games can actually set up BACKGROUND fps limiter. for example [Diablo 3 background fps settings](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nwWlF.jpg). The problem is that LoL has no settings for background fps limiter. It's constantly set up to 20. And I would like you to bring that opinion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kreyz","date":"2017-07-30T18:01:19.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keeping your FPS limited is actually to prevent horrible lag because spikes can and will happen. League of Legends does frequently lag for streamers unless you have a beast of a computer and WiFi connection, you're probably just fine as it is. What works the best for me while tabbing out is windowed borderless actually, maybe give that a try. Warning though, you can click out of the screen.","replies":[]}]}
