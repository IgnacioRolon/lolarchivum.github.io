I really enjoyed the sit downs with developers and hearing their thoughts on the new or reworked champions and how they approached the design process, or even the talks with the writers in the in-depth lore of locations and champs. Since January, we&#039;ve had Galio, Xayah, and Rakan releases, as well as the tank update and lore updates for several places like Demacia along with a lore refresh on their characters.\n\nI am assuming it stopped when Scarizard left Riot, but I hope that doesn&#039;t mean it is completely axed. Is League Community Podcast dead or is it (hopefully) going to make a comeback?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-06-29T20:30:49.489+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Barkingspider73!\n\nYou have a horrifying summoner name. If spiders could bark they would be 100% more scary.\n\nWe don't have any plans at the moment to return to the League Community Podcast, but yanno... \"impossible to see, the future is\". I'm really happy you enjoyed it, and I know the whole crew is happy as well. We put a lot of love and effort into making something that would give players a glimpse into the development of the game we all love.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2017-06-30T11:34:46.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I REALLY miss the podcast. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-06-30T23:21:20.798+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you believe me if I said _we_ really miss _you_?","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2017-07-01T07:28:47.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like if u cri evrytiem ;--;","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2017-06-30T02:49:02.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there was the attempt to carry on Champion Insights for Galio's rework over on Nexus.

But the only article we have is for Galio, we've since had the duo champs and now onto Kayn soon. So when Rakan & Xayah didn't receive their own article I can only assume the blog wont be continued. Am I wrong?\n\nEdit: ah okay don't respond.
