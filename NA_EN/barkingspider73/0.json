However, in Rakan&#039;s VO, there is a couple lines that sound like lines for when Xayah dies that are &quot;Hello world, look who&#039;s single!&quot; and &quot;I miss her already... Oh well!&quot; Plus, a lot of his VO lines are very self-centered &quot;what do you think of my beauty and awesomeness&quot; kind of lines.\n\nSo, my question is does Rakan only care for Xayah because she is just a fan who adores his beauty as much as he adores his own beauty, or does he actually love her? \n\nNot sure if this is a question that cannot be answered at this moment in development, but I am curious to know more about them as characters.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2017-04-05T19:50:22.428+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of cool discussion over reasons why, but I will just say that Rakan absolutely does love Xayah.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-04-05T20:05:35.329+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Fd4JsPob,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-04-05T19:50:22.428+0000)\n>\n> A lot of cool discussion over reasons why, but I will just say that Rakan absolutely does love Xayah.\n\nSeems like the sort of false brave face a fairly cavalier person might put on in the face of terrible personal tragedy, frankly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2017-04-05T22:04:38.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh yeah?
