It sounds to me like a security setting might be preventing you from properly installing and accessing the updated client.  Go over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that the new application is added as an exception to your system or any anti-virus software you might have.  Once complete, I suggest doing a clean reinstall through the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to make sure everything installs without issue.
