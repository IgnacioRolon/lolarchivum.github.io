Launch Button Wont Work","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So when I open league it comes to the regular launch page, with patch number, champ rotation, all the good stuff. But when I click launch the button goes grey, like normal but it stays grey for 30 seconds and then the button goes orange again. No matter how many  times I try it keeps doing that, I uninstalled league nd installed multiple times but it does nothing. If any riot members or people can help me please do, its really frustrating","replies":[{"poster":"Matcha Mocha","date":"2016-11-21T01:43:53.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem too \nWhich step did you use to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"2Plus2isJhin","date":"2016-11-21T19:30:13.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Configure DNS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-20T23:33:18.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue in particular often occurs if you have a poor or unstable connection to the servers.
