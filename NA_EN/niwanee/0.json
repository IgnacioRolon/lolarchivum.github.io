I didn't really work on it in connection with the background (Summoner's Rift), so maybe it would look terrible. I'd check, but my PBE is still updating.\n\nHowever, a lot of recent skins (and old skin re-textured) are very simplified in detail, which I'm sure it's on purpose, I just don't agree with it. For example hair strands are barely visible and there are very little details on clothing and armor. Yes, those details wouldn't be very noticeable in game from a top view, however, when people know something, it usually bothers them even if they can't see it most of the time. \nHair strands on the other hand, look less good when close up, but better when from far top view. Which is why I am a bit confused by the decision to make hair less contrasted, as it makes it look more like a helm then hair. If you check any recent skin re-work news posts (for ex. Poppy one) you will know what I mean (as well as this Vayne skin).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-04-22T03:09:24.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about Twisted Treeling, Crystal Scar and Howling Abyss?

While I appreciate the effort from the skin team it clearly fell short and the splash art does not just give the artists a way to express the story or theme of the skin it is made to sell. In most cases a majority of the splash arts can be extremely misleading, which is why in heroes of the storm 3d models are shown of the skin you are about to purchase. Why league has never implemented something of the sort baffles me.\n\n ALTHOUGH if people really wanted to see the skin they could go online and look but that is just expecting the consumer to go the extra mile. There's no reason the skin couldn't have better matched the splash art. The textures probably took the OP less than 10 minutes to enhance and you'd expect better time management and editing from riot. I mean no disrespect but it is really insulting to the community when people from the riot team insist on X reason why Y was no implemented. Whether it be features, game mechanics, skins, models, animations or balances. The more popular reasons being priorities and or clarity. \n\nI don't see how minor changes to the skin would impact priorities or even clarity. We'll see though... A shame splash arts are just meant to hype you for the skin and purchase it and then only to be disappointed. And then only limit people refunds. I didn't buy the vayne skin and to my knowledge I've never used a refund. But I believe this principal can be applied to most skins released in the following years. I think league has done better by showing the models in posts but there should be more \"clarity\" hue in the store.
