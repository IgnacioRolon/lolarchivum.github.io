It&#039;s a single person buff that has a time limit, why would a team focus it unless they&#039;re lost or have literally nothing else to do.\r\n\r\nSo, I propose a change.....\r\n   We make it, essentially, a secondary dragon.  Either change the buff entirely or keep it the same, but make it similar to the dragon buff: it buffs your whole team and they stack.  \r\n\r\nNow, obviously the spawn/respawn timers would be changed (personally I would have them mirror the dragon timers) and the buff itself would most likely have to be changed.  \r\n\r\nThis is where I need help, cause I don&#039;t know what the buff should be.  I was thinking about just another dragon buff, but that sounds boring. Then maybe a more defensive buff, like percent-max-health increase, or bonus mr/armor.  Then I thought...what if It was like a reverse dragon buff?  Essentially, what if this new rift Harold buff reduced the opposing team&#039;s damage. So, late game, that Caytlin is no longer criting your face for 1500+, but now is only hitting you for 1000 because you have max stacks.  Anyways, it was just a thought I had.\r\n\r\nNow share yours....","replies":[{"poster":"it be l√¨ke that","date":"2016-11-02T22:34:30.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no. and lots use it, specifically bruiser tops or the rare assassin jungle.\nits a 1 spawn buff that takes time to kill, making it a risky play but ever so slightly rewarding for solo laning/roaming for the 1v1 potential.\n\nthey just changed it and its fine the way it is, not a big power swing, but noticeably beneficial.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T22:48:41.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't think it's worth the loss of map pressure though. The time you spent taking it would more often than not pressuring other objectives like towers. It's pretty neat to have it if you're a splitpusher though.","replies":[]}]}]}
