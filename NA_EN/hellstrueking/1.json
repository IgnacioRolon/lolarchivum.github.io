People can tolerate flawed design when the champion is weak / underpowered, but once the champion with poor design becomes \"balanced\" or even strong, that's where the trouble comes in.\n\n\nIf Riot made an actual effort to fix and rework those problematic, poorly-designed champions, then the game would be a lot more fun even if it was never truly balanced.\n\n\nAs an example: When Yasuo is strong, everyone is complaining about him constantly and banning him in every game - because his kit is really annoying to play against.

Hypothetically, every champion has a state where they get to be exactly as strong or as weak as they need to be in the appropriate situations, and it's a matter of tuning until they get to that state, or something very similar.

Beyond that, there's also the recurring issue where players, regardless of skill level, experience or overall attitude, will sometimes make erroneous generalizations based on their own experiences (e.g. \"I totally dumpstered this Riven as Renekton, Renekton must be really OP\"), or complain about a champion being particularly strong or weak in a specific situation despite that being completely intended (e.g. \"My squishy team dived the enemy Illaoi, fought her at close range while mostly standing still, and all died once she popped her ult; Illaoi is broken, pls fix\").

League is a constantly changing, shifting game due to various changes, additions and reworks going on all the time. It also implies that Riot knows about every possible outcome for every champion and build, which they don't. \n\nI don't think they considered Lulu when they reworked Kog'Maw, and her ability to turn him from a gigacarry to an exacarry with just her natural kit, much less before all the various support items that give her tremendous firepower, much less the buff she got to her Whimsy more than a month ago, or that she can do this to a slightly lesser degree for ANY champion who focuses on basic attacks.\n\nThey didn't consider Cho'gath when they made the Titanic Hydra, which when combined with his massive health stacking gives him 300+ AOE basic attack damage and a 500+ AOE burst.\n\nThey didn't consider the rabid obsession with teamfights and grouping up when they reworked Brand, and how it requires almost zero effort to proc his explosion on four or more champions simultaneously because of that mindset.\n\nThere is always going to be imbalance for one reason or another because of the very nature of the game constantly evolving, the countless mechanics at work, and the random, generally single minded nature of the community. More often than not I get games were one team wants to go all ADCs and AD melee assassins, and then the entire team gets DEMOLISHED because of a single tank on the enemy team and because no one bothers to buy armor penetration (Youmuu's doesn't do shit if they have more than one armor item, and they do). That isn't the game being imbalanced. That's the players playing into their greatest weaknesses and exacerbating the problem further by not adapting to what's right in front of them.\n\nImagine the balancing a bit like Pokemon. In Pokemon, much of the combat is centered around elemental superiority. If you build an entire team of Fire-types, you will get demolished if you encounter any opponent of equal level and number of Pokemon who have elemental superiority over you (rock, ground, water). It's POSSIBLE to win, and if you have crowd control abilities to dampen or negate the enemy's advantage, it becomes easier to scrape by a victory, but if your Pokemon have nothing but offensive moves, then you're fighting an increasingly uphill battle.\n\nThat is basically the imbalance right now in League. Everyone is a fire type, and all it takes is the one water type to come along and fuck everything up. That's usually when people cry imbalance; when the enemy Bubblebeamed their Charmeleon into oblivion for the twentieth time and they haven't thought to change their tactic. There's nothing you can do to balance against that.\n\nHonestly, right now the game is better balanced than it ever has been. If you disagree, you forget the days of AP Yi, Tristana and Sion, when Dodge was a stat and before Unique Passives were a thing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2016-08-03T07:07:22.452+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why does everyone feel the game needs to be balanced.....if thats the case we might as well just have 1 champ in the game.

Even if every character were LITERALLY the exact same, there are human/psychological factors that will affect the \"balance\" and break the theoretical 50/50 winrate. There's a ton of psychology that goes into game balance (Even down to the fact that blue team/red team slightly changes how you perform), which is better left to self-research and professionals.\n\nHowever, that does NOT mean it's OK to let your game go completely unbalanced like League of Legends is right now. The lack of balance is pretty disgusting right now and they should be ashamed of it. But for as long as CertainlyT and Ghostcrawler work at Riot, they have no shame. They have no capacity to balance properly, but their egos are so bloated and massive that they can't admit ANY wrongdoing.

From a macro standpoint, both players equally have a 49.9999999...% chance of winning. Great, perfectly balanced. If we start breaking down individual interactions however, game looks skewed as hell. Think:\n\nWOAH, SCISSORS HAS A 100% WINRATE AGAINST PAPER, BALANCE?!\n\nLeague on the other hand has many more variables, that all interact with each other, on top of having a gradient of factors like human skill and error. We can work forever to make each interaction a perfectly equal exchange only tipped in the favor of human ability, or we can full on Rock Paper Scissors the hell out of every interaction in the game. Either way, it's not going to look just right to everybody, and we will never get a unanimous vote that League is balanced no matter what objectively correct form of balanced it may actually be.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy embracing neato interactions in the game. If it means I can get some clear lines that make sense (the Burst/DPS/Tank triangle), I'd gladly accept statistics that may misguide people that don't understand the contexts behind them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotCounter","date":"2016-08-04T17:14:51.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"considering most of the time when people complain about something there isn't actually a balance problem with it, no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindworm Jim","date":"2016-08-04T08:43:01.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you define balance as \"no one is complaining\", then no. The game will never be balanced. Players will always disagree on what is best and someone will complain. It'a an unavoidable facet of life. You can't please everyone.\n\nHowever, what I suspect most people mean when they say balanced they mean an extremely diverse meta with multiple strategic routes to victory, where every champion has a unique but not overly necessary role to fill and disadvantageous match ups can be overcome with skillful and clever play.\n\nThat CAN be achieved, but is EXTREMELY difficult, especially considering a game as complex as League. That said, Riot does seem to me to be trying to push the game in that direction and I have overall been pleased with watching their design and balance teams learn and grow. (Now, how WELL they have been moving towards that goal is debatable, but their heart looks to be in the right place.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlkGolem","date":"2016-08-03T23:56:21.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2016-08-03T21:47:56.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am no statistics major but look at all the champions and items alone.
