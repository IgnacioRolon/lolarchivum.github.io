The build will accelerate faster and at 50 minutes you will actually have some items, but the choice for the first 3 ones will be just as limited.\n\nWhy we need more options? To feel better? To have more power? No - to **enhance gameplay through decision making**. Having options means choosing between route A and route B. Every route is different. Making a decision to buy A or to buy B is part of game and requires knowledge and adaptation skill. It's nothing big, but it separates people mindlessly following one build from people capable of adapting to the situation. A good example would the DFG/Zhonyas dilemma in the mid lane on select champions (Annie, Ahri, Lissandra).\n\n#One Way Ticket\n\n{{item:3302}} {{item:3301}} {{item:3303}} \n\nOnce the support picks a GP10 item line - which most champions can do efficiently in one, at most two ways - their first 3000 spent gold is set in stone. There is no choice to be made until 2200 g is spent on the gold item and 800g on a Sightstone. In most games lasting shorter than 20-30 minutes, supports will have pretty much the exact same build every single game - for a tank like Braum or Leona, it will be FotM, Sightstone and Boots of Mobility, game over.\n\nThe problem of Sightstone lacking alternative upgrades has been already brought up in countless posts, but this is only a part of the problem. Building items is not only about minmaxing your champion's potential, but also about adapting to the situation, Supports have no choice to make with their core item, unlike the junglers.\n\nTherefore, I believe that **the GP10 items need alternative final upgrades**.\n\n#Sight Seeing\n\n{{item:2049}} {{item:3341}} {{item:2043}} \n\nIntroduction of Sightstone brought an end to the era of Ward Bitch Healer archetype. Maybe you haven't witnessed that, but in the legendary CLG.EU vs WE game during Season 2 World Championship, [in the 50th minute a support Janna had only 2000g worth of items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBYfcz1cdxw): tier 1 boots and GP10-granting items Philospher's Stone and Heart of Gold - she has spent all the rest of her gold on dozens of wards (50 to 70, I believe).\n\nIt's much, much better now, but Sightstone is in a weird spot where it can't be too gold efficient, or everyone, starting with junglers, will pick it up and litter the map with wards. The possibility of buying Sightstone favours champions who can get away with it - for example Nunu, Elise, and Lee Sin - and hinders champions who need to spend their gold on combat statistics (like Kha'Zix, and there was one trying to purchase Sightstone in the latest round of EULCS Expansion Tournament). And the \"supports are designed to use less gold\" paradigm doesn't hold anymore, as with the introduction of GP10 items even the \"true supports\" like Janna and Sona received AP scalings on their utility.\n\nThe best way to expand this item would be giving it the same treatment that the jungle items had: **introduce alternative gold efficient Sightstone upgrades** that would offer different stats (health, mana, AP).\n\n#Cool Down the CDR\n\n{{item:3067}} {{item:3114}} {{item:3108}} \n\nEven though lowering CDR on Talisman from 20 to 10 mid-season 4 opened up the itemization a little bit, quite a few support items are underused because CDR and mana regen they grant becomes superfluous. Ardent Censer is a great example - even though it has a great synergy with Janna, Mikael's Crucible is so dominant that the supposedly cheap and efficient item sees almost no play - since Censer's mana regen gets overshadowed by the one from Crucible.\n\nTo be honest, I'm starting to believe that the problem is Mikael's Crucible itself. There is no choice to be made about this item - CC or no CC, it's a godsend for saving carries (which is the main job of supports) and it's also the best mana regen item in the game at the same time, lowering the gained value from items like Censer and allowing to get away with starting Spellthief's Edge and never upgrading it. I believe the best solution to make purchasing Crucible a meaningful choice would be making it the third Aegis upgrade. This way, you're getting team-wide defense (Locket), focused rescue (Mikaels) or strategical value (Banner) - and if you want heavy mana regeneration, you have to build specifically for it.\n\nOther situational and theoretically usable item is Twin Shadows. Surprise surprise - AP supports will rather opt for real AP items, like Morellonomicon, Zhonya's Hourglass or Liandry's Torment - and if feeling lucky, Mejai's Soulstealer is a better option for heavy AP. Zeke's Herald is just a painful and unrewarding support item as it is for tanks (and even more so for mages).\n\nAll in all, the **support items need to be** either **attractive enough to be worth rushing right after GP10** - so, on par with Locket and Mikaels - or **meaningful enough to have a place in a lategame build** - so, on par with the usual AP items used by midlaners (and therefore available to midlaners).\n\n---\n\nThis section contains example solutions to the forementioned problem, so **if you don't agree with my assessment, you can skip to the end.** The solutions might be wrong, of course, and feel free to add your feedback.\n\n#The Expanded GP10 Lines\n\nThere are two ways to design alternative final forms of GP10 items: by similarity (so the main stats are more or less the same) or by expansion, introducing a statistic far away from the core of the item line. Same goes about the costs: either we keep everything at the same price (2200g) or introduce two alternative pricing levels - for example, 1800 and 2200 gold. This way supports who are behind or looking towards other items could rush a cheaper GP10 upgrade. Stats, components and pricing aside, in the end it's all about the item effects. I guess the question here is: when do the current actives feel lackluster on supports supposedly made for the HP/regen/AP line?\n\n{{item:3401}} Face of the Mountain feels weak when used on yourself, as the explosion damage is much higher when used on ADCs. You're gonna have a hard time being in range of ADC if you dive and disable the enemy carries instead of peeling for the ADC (Leona is a good example here). Two ideas I've come up with are Bracer upgrade (for frontline regen theme) and Raptor Cloak (for towerdive theme).\n\n> Targon's alternative upgrade - codename: **Crescent Shield of the Lunari**\nBuild - similar: {{item:3097}} + {{item:3801}}, alternative: {{item:3097}} + {{item:2053}}\n* Option 1 - Active: Gain 20 armor and MR per enemy champion in the nearby area for 10 seconds.\n * The \"I'M GONNA DIVE YOU HARD\" version. Preferrably building out of Raptor Cloak.\n* Option 2 - Passive: Whenever a nearby enemy dies, restore 10% of missing health to all nearby allies.\n * A slight rework of the previous one, requiring success to pay off. A \"little bit\" snowbally.\n* Option 3 - Passive: Whenever a nearby ally dies, you gain 50% of their AD and AP for 10 seconds. If you avenge them, they get full gold for the kill.\n * I had this initially in mind when naming the item after Diana's subfaction of Mt. Targon - becoming an avatar of vengeance.\n * It's sad when your carry dies and you get left behind, with very low damage potential (think Braum, Leona, Alistar). Of course it means that you failed at your job, but still, this allows for some action instead of running around helpless awaiting your doom.\n * Of couse this is pretty controversial - an item that could make people want to let their carries die - but I've figured  the concept is interesting enough to be worth mentioning.\n * Obviously limited to one ally getting the buff from one death, to prevent people from running multiple insteances of this item.\n* Option 4 - Active: Challenge an enemy champion for 5 seconds. If they attack anyone but you, they deal 25% less damage.\n * A soft taunt. \"Hit me or you won't do that much damage\". Effect would need to be visually readable (tether, for example).\n\n{{item:3069}} Talisman is already the best active item of them all, so the alternative item needs to fill a very different niche. The only problem with this line is very low power in lane - the mana regen on Medallion got nerfed to half of that on Frostfang, and Ancient Coin is just laughably bad compared ot alternatives. This item line is supposed to be worse early and better late, but it could use a tiny buff, I think - Ancient Coin could get 5-10 MS, to solidify the item's identity as \"utility>movement\", and Medallion nerf should probably get reverted (why would Frostfang have twice as much mana regen as the utility-oriented item?).\n\nAlternative upgrade: First, looking at components - the Tear concept is meant to preserve the \"lategame\" theme of the Shurimian line, which provides utility over combat statistics. Obviously the item would have enhanced effect after 750/750 transformation and some sort of mana-to-stat conversion. Possible candidates are health (like Singed's passive), health regen (like Strength of Spirit mastery) or resists. There's an option of using the Bracer here, especially if the Targons alternative upgrade builds out of Raptor Cloak.\n\n> Talisman's alternative upgrade - codename: **Shurelya's Oasis**\nBuild - similar: {{item:3096}} + {{item:3070}}, alternative: {{item:3096}} + {{item:3801}} \n* Passive (Tear version): Gain bonus health equal to 20% of your maximum mana. (Or health regen. Or bonus resists. Something)\n* Option 1 - Active: Restore 50% of missing mana to target ally. 60 second cooldown.\nStacked Tear A: Restore 50% of missing mana to all nearby allies. 60 second cooldown.\nStacked Tear B: Restore 25% of missing health and 50% of missing mana to target ally. 60 second cooldown.\n * It's summoner spell Clarity in an item\n * Could actually make a difference for the likes of Ezreal and Corki\n* Option 2 -  No Active\nStacked Tear (Shurelya's Sandstorm) - Active: After a 2 seconds, summons a sandstorm in a target area that obscures vision of enemies inside it for 10 seconds.\n * Think \"Ascension\" featured game mode\n * Obviously needs some windup time, can't be instant, enemies need to react\n * Enemies can see from the outside (so it works like Graves's Smokescreen)\n * Best possible use: Obscure vision in dragon/baron pit while the enemy is doing it\n * Seems just as OP as Talisman, all is well on the Rift ;)\n\n{{item:3092}} Frost Queen's Claim is possibly the least attractive GP10 finisher. The Freljord line is best for early harass, but FQC doesn't satisfy champions who would prefer much heavier AP (like Annie) or don't need AP that much (most Jannas will sell this and buy Talisman).\n\nAfter the 4.20 changes, the mana regen granted by Frostfang is actually lower than before until mid to lategame and it's actually better to leave Spellthief's Edge unfinished if you don't plan to upgrade it into FQC. I think Frostfang could have its AP increased to 10-20.\n\n> Frostfang's alternative upgrade - codename: **Shard of the True Ice** (I am so original)\nBuild - similar: {{item:3098}} + {{item:3113}}, alternative: {{item:3098}} + {{item:3145}}\n* Option 1 - Active: Channel for up to 3 seconds, restoring 50% of your missing mana. You gain 100 armor and magic resistance for the duration of the channel.\n * Can be used to restore mana, can be used as mini-Zhonyas\n * CC an silences will break the channel, of course\n* Option 2 - Active: Grant nearby allies +30 AP and 10% spellvamp for 10 seconds.\n * Old WotA in an (active) item\n * This effects can apply to both builds, doesn't have to have spellvamp normally\n* Option 3 - Passive: Restore mana equal to 10% of damage dealt\n * As long as you land the harass, you should restore some mana and keep the pain train going\n * If scrapped and reused on more than one item, the mechanic could be called \"Mana Leech\"\n\nAll in all, the alternative items listed above are secondary to the main point of the project, which is:\n\n#The Sightstones\n\nThe idea behind this particular expansion is quite simple and loosely based on the preseason jungle items. Here's the main concept:\n\n* Four different Sightstone upgrades, each one gold efficient (stats are worth the full price):\n * Types: {{item:1028}} Ruby - health, {{item:1027}} Sapphire - mana, {{item:1006}} Emerald - regen, {{item:1052}} Opal - AP\n* Final versions enhance your warding, by either:\n * increasing the ward lifespan to 240 seconds\n * increasing the number of stacks on Sightstone to 6\n * allowing you to regain stacks without going back to base, for example whenever a ward is being destroyed nearby\n * increasing the casting range (like Feral Flare)\n* The stats and vision enhancement are balanced in one of the two following ways:\n * Option 1 - Pick Your Enchantment: The upgraded Sightstones can be enchanted later on (level 9?) with selected vision enhancements.\n * Option 2 - Two-Dimensional: The upgraded Sightstones are bundled with the vision enhancements - you need to find balance between desired efect and statistics (Something like Zhonya's Hourglass - sometimes it's not the armor you want the most, it's the stasis effect).\n\nThat's awesome and whatnot, but to make sure that the vision control is available for supports and grants good stats, but doesn't get abused by all other roles:\n\n* Sightstone costs 400 gold and grants no stats whatsoever. It requires level 4 to purchase.\n * Purchasing Sightstone and a Ruby Crystal has the exact same effect (you get wards and 150 health) as on Live.\n* Stacking Sightstones is limited in one of the following ways (You can have Lee Sin using it to jump around, but it comes at a price):\n * Option 1 - The original idea: one Sightstone per team, but that could probably result in junglers taking it and forcing supports to buy wards.\n * Option 1a - Two Sightstones per team; in competitive it would make it a must-have for junglers, but least  they won't lose gold efficiency on it\n * Option 2 - Sightstone wards are limited per team (to 4?).\n * Option 3 - This could also be solved by introducing a team-wide ward limit (5-7, counting trinkets or not).\n * Option 4 - There's always an option of requiring a GP10 item to purchase a Sightstone.\n\nExample batch of items (the Two-Dimensional version, where you balance between the stats and the effect):\n\n| {{item:2049}} Upgrade | Cost | Stats | {{item:2044}} bonus | {{item:2043}} bonus\n|-|-|-|-\n| {{item:1028}} Ruby | 1100 | 400 health, | +60 s duration, | +2 health\n| {{item:1027}} Sapphire | 900 | 400 mana, | +2 Sightstone charges (6), | Gain vision of the area for 5 seconds whenever it dies \n| {{item:1006}} Emerald | 1000 | +100% health/mana regen, | Recharge on nearby ward kills, | Restore 1 health every 10 seconds\n| {{item:1052}} Opal | 1200 | +60 ability power, | +400 placement range (1000), | Reveal all Sight Wards in the range (even over walls)\n\nThis is obviously just an example. Perhaps it could even be possible to introduce the commonly mentioned \"increase ward limit to 4\" effect without it being broken and obscuring other choices.\n\nIf going for the \"stats first, enchantment later\" option, the pricing could differ - mana and regen are less combat-effective as HP and AP, so Sapphire and Emerald Sightstones could be cheaper than Ruby and Opal. And of course the enchantments would need to get their costs specified. Most people I've talked this over with preferred the two-step choices (first upgrades, then enchantments), but it might be easier to balance items with multiple power axes.\n\n#Support Items\n\nLast part would be rebalancing the secondary support items so that the likes of Ardent Censer and Zeke's Herald have their purpose, and Mikael's Crucible isn't a must-have on every single support without any competition.\n\n{{item:3222}} As mentioned earlier, the best way to balance out Crucible would probably be removing the \"You no longer get out of mana\" component, as this makes the item uncontested in both saving carries and spamming built-in heals. One item shouldn't be #1 in both. An idea I've come up with is making Crucible an Aegis + Idol upgrade (in extreme version - just Aegis, without Idol). This preserves the \"ADC protection\" theme while presenting you with a meaningful choice - do you protect your whole team with Locket, or that one single target with Crucible? I'd also seriously consider removing the healing part of the active and reducing the cooldown to 90 seconds, especially if the alternative Medallion upgrade was to receive the heal.\n\n{{item:3504}} Of course supports would need some compensation for the loss of Chalice, and here's where Censer gains value. I think the idea of Tear+Medallion upgrade is one thing to fix that, and another way would be rebalancing the whole mana and CDR itemization - but that probably wouldn't fit in this post and is a good material for the next episode of this project. Without any additional changes, though, that could actually make picking Censer a good idea, since you'd still make use of the mana regen.\n\n{{item:3023}} Twin Shadows are in a weird spot where they're not good enough to be rushed, and not good enough to stay in a lategame build either. One way to move it into the \"lategame\" side of the spectrum would be increasing the MS gain to 10%, making this a \"mage Zephyr\" that could replace boots in some situations. Of course that would require increasing the price or lowering the AP to 60, and the %MS passive should probably become unique (not stacking with Censer and Lichbane).\n\n{{item:3050}} As for Zeke's, this item needs to be redone. As it is it's neither a tank item, nor a damage item, nor a support item. If it's supposed to be a support item, the best way would be removing the Vampiric Scepter from the build and making the aura an active effect (shifting away from the \"power without gameplay\" problem). As a fighter item, it simply needs to be more slot-effective than that, for a higher price - it could work as a Brutalizer or Phage upgade.\n\nThere are some other issues like the lack of anti-AD itemization for supports when compared to anti-AP, but that's material for a separate discussion.\n\nThe idea behind forementioned CDR overhaul would be making all 20% CDR items build out of two 10% components and grant situational utility rather than power - current Morellonomicon is a great example for that. A few new ones would be needed, especially considering that the suggested alternative GP10 final items have no CDR whatsoever.\n\n**Rough sketch** of an example changelog:\n> All current 20% CDR items but Morellonomicon are down to 10% CDR and 350g cheaper and/or receiving some sort of compensation for it. \n\n> Sample new 20% CDR items (exact stats to be adjusted, but all those items should be around 2000-2500g):\n*Blackfrost Buckler*: (Kindlegem + Glacial Shroud) - 10% reduced damage from enemies affected by crowd control\n*Sanguine Orb*: (Kindlegem + Fiendish Codex) - When out of mana, you can cast spells paying with your health\n*Soul Shroud*: (Kindlegem + Forbidden Idol) - 25% reduced death timer\n*Chillwind Crown*: (Glacial Shroud + Fiendish Codex) - Reduce the cooldowns of activable items by 20%\n*Sage's Runestone*: (Glacial Shroud + Forbidden Idol) - Increased experience earned by 10%\n*Arcane Helix*: (Kindlegem + Forbidden Idol + Fiendish Codex) - 30% CDR (this item does not need to exist) - Reduces the cost of all spells by 10%\nBasically - take two or three or all of those concepts, mix up, implement.\n\nThe idea is to make **purchasing big CDR a conscious decision**, and having the 20% CDR items less overpowering in terms of sttas and active effects.\n\n---\n\n#Discussion time\n\n* Are you happy with the current support itemization?\n* If so, what do you like about it, if not, what is your main problem with it?\n* Do you feel like any of those changes are needed at all?\n* Which concepts do you like, which are unnecessary, which are outright bad?\n* Sightstones: Stat+effect bundle, or two-step cherrypicking?\n* How do we get to the \"MOAR SIGHTSTONES\" state without the menace of junglers stealing the support warding glory? \n\nFeel free to bash my complaints and concepts into the ground and present some better ones :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chortle","date":"2014-12-03T18:20:37.109+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the gp/10 items should be where the diversity lies.\n\nAs for the other items, they are all situational depending on what your team/champion calls for.

Now imagine that, but 10x worse due to stronger sightstone upgrades.\n\nI think there needs to be an option to add the wards from Sightstone to GP/10 items.  For instance, Ancient Coin can have an extra upgrade option (or at any time during the game through it's upgrades) to gain 3 wards that refresh at base for 300 gold.  This can be further upgraded to 5 wards for an additional 200 gold (so 100g per ward).  This way, wards can be purchased earlier, for cheaper, and can really impact supports who do not need the extra health.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Knight Devout","date":"2014-12-03T15:58:51.172+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"As an avid support players, I also agree that support are tunneled into 2 builds , depending on their role, without enough diversity.\n\nI previously tried to discuss something similar through this post[ about sightstones ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/NG7XFHIs-sightstone-enchantments-proposal-for-season-5) , but generally people complain that all this discussion just come from support players wanting more \"personal power\".\nBecause apparently that's an issue,unless you play whatever fotm champion is dominating at the moment.\n\nHowever, rather than personal power, what supports  need is diversity and tools to continue their job.\nThey won't ever be fighters, or assassin, or a damage threat, so  it's no wonder that , yes, they need special care because the moment they become frustrating to play, as a class, you'll see the whole support playerbase disappear and disperse in other roles.\n\nThis season already hits supports, as all other roles gold gain has been improved, thus placing supports again at last place. \nAnd , less gold, less itemization choice.\nHence why I wanted to introduce diversity at least on sightstone. making Sightstone worth upgrading, and with different upgrades, creates room for strategy.\nAnd that's vital, no matter how powerful the role is.\nAlso, by gating the sightstone upgrade to gold gained with support items you made the junglers unable to buy it, making their effects able to be tuned only to the support role without abuse case.\nRemember when adc players were crying over the fact that their build was always BT+PD and IE as luxury item?\n\nYou have some fun ideas but I think they need a little more polish.\nEspecially, most of the actives are quite unpractical and they would never be picked, like the clarity one.\n\n----------------------------------\n#DISCLAIMER: NOT MY IDEA\nThere was this nice player once with this great idea about support itemization.\nBasically, he proposed **2 different upgrades path for each support starter item, one with an active, and one with a passive**.\n\nExample:\n{{item:3302}} Relic Shield, upgrades into Targon bracer, and THEN you can choose between an item like  face of the mountain , or an item like a low range Aegis aura, but centered about mitigating physical damage, and damage from critical strikes.\n{{item:3098}} Frostfang builds into the current one , or a Will of the Ancient-like buff that refunds some mana on spell hit.

And, unlike other aura item, they don't grant raw stats, but an effect when certain conditions are met.\n{{item:3401}} Face of the mountain shield allows to increase any ally survivability from range- the passive upgrade while weaker makes all allies near you much stronger in prolonged combats against divers.\n{{item:3092}} Gives a strong ranged engage- the other increases the siege potential of your team.\n{{item:3069}} Is good for rapid movements and sudden reactions, like engages or disengages- the passive effect makes your team better in rotations between lanes or managing objectives as they are continuously faster when out of combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2014-12-03T16:06:22.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> people complain that all this discussion just come from support players wanting more \"personal power\".\n\nIt's not about personal power, it's about expanding limited gameplay options.

Problem is, supports' second item is Sightstone, which presents no upgrade choices at all.\n\nEven as it is, it's easy to itemize for MR as a tank - you simply rush Locket right after FotM and Sightstone (health is a good anti-burst protection as well). For health regen, you can build Bracer into Righteous Glory (pre-4.20 FotM regen was higher, though).\n\nMages don't really choose between AP, CDR and mana regen, and that's an issue that concerns midlane mages as well. They get all 3 in one item (Athene's/Morellonomicon). Archangel's Staff is balanced around its obscene lategame synergy with Rod of Ages. and overall feels lackluster on many mages who would rather get immediately effective items and emphasize their midgame power spike instead of delaying their power surge to the lategame like the RoA users do.\n\nAnyways, in this project you'd choose between CDR and for example MS in the first item - and, what's more important, between the actives.\n\nAs for magic penetration, it's fine at the moment. Liandry's Torment allows the likes of Zyra, Karma and Brand to deal absurd amounts of damage.\n\n> I think they should be good enough that soraka could choose the tank tree, the utility tree, or the mage tree depending what path she wants to go for the match and her personal preferences.\n\nRelic Shield line is designed for melee champions, Spellthief's is for ranged mages. There is no purpose for making the tank line work on Soraka or mage line work on Leona.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that building health on Soraka isn't very effective. Your heals cost a % of health, so you won't get more of them -  it's better to build AP, CDR, mana regen and resists.\n\n> Supports need sightstone so they'd have a 2nd must buy but it should be gold equivalent to the jungler completing their enchantment, imo.\n\nThat was exactly my idea, but it creates a problem to be solved: how do we stop everyone from buying a Sightstone, if its stats are gold efficient?\n\n> I do agree mana regen and cdr seem wasted stats alot of the time in support buying options after the first item.\n\nThis problem is complicated. The huge regen on Mikaels allows to solve the mana problem without having to complete the GP10 item line. Pretty much nobody in competitive scene picks Ancient Coin for laning (LCS/OGN), because they can get away with having no mana regen on this item and Spellthief's Edge provides superior harass and gold generation. Also it's worth noting that with changes to mana regen the effective regen from the gp10 items got nerfed in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2014-12-04T19:05:19.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you need to worry about everyone buying sightstone if the stats are gold efficient.\n\nADC's won't buy it because they don't have room for it in their build.\nMids won't buy it for a similar reason.\n\nSo you only really have to worry about Top and Jungler.

This helps prevent early ganks and the reduced cost is from the lack of health.

The entire point behind the sightstone was to prevent the support from being a ward bitch -- that is, someone who only buys GP10, boots, and wards. Doing this would shove supports back into that place, except now they could only take 3 green wards and 1 pink at any given time. That means they have to return to base more, lose more EXP, and lose more gold than they currently do having to refresh their sightstone, which holds 4 or 5 wards at any given time. It also increases the effectiveness of forms of vision that allow for the removal of wards -- especially the smite bonus from raptors -- possibly to a scary place for supports in teams where the jungler goes sightstone and leaves them without one. \n\nMy counter proposal -- merge the support items with the sightstone. Tier 1 gives basic stats and a trinket ward, tier 2 upgrades ward time to normal, gives an additional ward, and improved gold generation, tier 3 allows for diverse enchantment ala jungler item and max ward stock (3). This also puts the support in a position where they have to make a real choice in their trinket and not just switch to sweeper once they get their sightstone.

While the introduction of gold income items last season was a godsend for supports, they are limited in what they are able to actually give to the support when it comes to stats.  As a support early game, yes, these items give me exactly what I need to earn enough for my mid game.  However, after that, there are only a few specific items for a few specific champs that you can get.  As a support, you don't want to focus on doing damage all that much (depending on which champ you take, I guess), but more on the actual supporting of your allies.  \n\nOne thing that I would like to propose to Riot is more items that come with a \"healing\" buff.  {{item:3504}} was a great introduction to that, but I think it's time to introduce more items that give a similar \"on heal effect\".  Take Nami's passive for instance.  Any time she hits an ally with one of her abilities, they get a slight MS increase.  Putting abilities like this on more items would give more choices to the healers of the game and bring them more deciding power in the game.  Ardent Censer is crucial on certain champs, like Soraka and Sona, but I feel that this is just the beginning of what they could do with \"on heal effect\" items.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2014-12-04T10:56:12.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even supports could get some upgrades. The existing concept is perfectly ballanced right now and it's really difficult to say it will remain this way if you start changing the income items again. Both {{item:3401}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3092}}  are equaly buyed in solo Q what's actualy really impressive.\n\nTake away the cdr for poke supports feels like risky. It's often the higher the cdr the higher the peeling. Supports that lack on it somethimes buy {{item:3165}} get buyed soon after. The {{item:3108}} can always not be ignored for a poke support. Most poke supports out their will already buy cdr in their runes {{champion:25}} {{champion:37}} to decrease the risk they won't get their cdr in time. If they entirely depend on finishing {{item:3165}} whe might see less diversity in those builds.\n\nAccording to the wikia. Their is already a spell vamp for supports under development. That item could be the first option that can use in it's build path so it keeps his additional stats.\n\nWhe just can't ignore the cdr for supports but I can agrea the concept arround cdr is indeed a bit overloaded. I just feel if you remove the cdr from the income item whe will see no diversity in the runes anymore. Every support will want that cdr in their runes. A lot of supports will go for 9/0/21 for that 10% cdr and a lot of supports will lose their power because of this.\n\nWhat I was thinking about. Why don't whe shift the cdr to the {{item:2049}} ? Every support will have to buy this anyway and shifting the cdr to their might solve a part of the problems. The only downside about this change is that it will further increase the powerspike from tank supports early on. And the cdr powerspike will verry similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2014-12-03T23:39:05.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm quite comfortable with most support-oriented items (mikael, censer,...) but I do think GP/10 and (mostly) Sightstone could use an overhaul.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2014-12-03T23:49:58.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Censer has a laughably low pick rate due to Crucible domination.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2014-12-03T23:58:49.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Censer has a laughably low pick rate due to Crucible domination.\n\nNo, it has a laughably low pick rate because it gives too little AP to be viable despite its passive. Censer and Crucible have different stats(one give MR, one AP) and they could easily co-exist, the true problem is that Censer passive isn't really all that powerful and rely a lot on your ADC being a strong AA and capable to keep AAing for the full duration of it,  and at the same time you don't get enough stats to be useful on your own cause you don't build tankiness nor damage through it, and you probably die without being able to help your ADC to keep him alive and using Censer passive too\n\nRight now, Censer can just be a laaaaaaaate game replacement for boots(even after swapping your gold item for a better item) if your champ does a lot of heal and shield and can yet get enough tankiness on the other 5 items, it is basically the Zephyr of the supports","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Orchidmaster","date":"2015-10-28T04:16:30.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love if there was a sight stone with a sweeper active rather that ward placement because after I place my 3 wards I'm forced to back if I see them get cleared or they die.
