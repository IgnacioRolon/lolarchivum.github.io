And caster ADCS want neither AS nor crit\"\n\n\"Then let's make them *want* crit\"\n\n\"That's so troll dude\"\n\n#*a few champion and item reworks later...*\n\n{{item:3508}} {{item:3078}} burst for dayz and free 40% CDR, lol\n\n{{item:3165}} {{item:3174}} too bad I don't deal damage with this\n\n---\n\nThat's about it. Mages used to be balanced around getting 5% CDR from masteries and 5-15% from runes, capping at 40% with just one CDR item (and optionally a blue buff). This was the point of midgame power of Ahri, TF, Lux, LeBlanc, Orianna - all of which have dropped in winrate since 5.22.\n\nThis is why right now we're seeing the emergence of mages who aren't so dependant on CDR, especially DoT mages like Anivia, Brand, Malzahar. They've always been sitting at high winrate and low pick rate, just their items haven't changed that much.\n\n\"But it's just 5% CDR, and you can still get it from masteries\" - Previously, getting CDR occured at no cost. Currently, you have to give up on Precision, which is quite important for most AP assassins, and actually stronger than % mpen from the mastery in the Ferocity tree.\n\n---\n\n#Solution A: 30% CDR Items\n\n\"Fight broken with broken\". The DotA style.\n\nHow to introduce 30% CDR without having it feel overpowered? The answer is a Black Market Brawlers item, Lost Chapter.\n\n> http://i.imgur.com/EKDG2qh.png Lost Chapter\n* Recipe: {{item:3108}} Fiendish Codex + {{item:3114}} Forbidden Idol + 650g (total cost: 2000g)\n* +40 AP, +100% mana regen\n* Passive: +20% CDR\n\nWhat's the point of this item, if it's not even that gold-efficient? Well, it happens to consolidate the Unique Passives of Codex and Idol into one item - and opens up the possibility of getting to 30% CDR only once it's assembled. With Morellonomicon, you can get your 20% CDR from just the components - with Lost Chapter in play, we can force a sizeable gold expenditure before opening up the possibility of getting the second Codex/Idol. It's also a perfect building block for all CDR items:\n\n* Lost Chapter + Chalice of Harmony = Athene's\n* Lost Chapter + Blasting Wand = Morellonomicon\n* Lost Chapter + Fiendish Codex = 30% CDR Item A\n* Lost Chapter + Forbidden Idol = 30% CDR Item B\n* Lost Chapter + Aether Wisp = Another 20% CDR Item\n\nThat's the genral idea, the execution is another matter entirely. What I had in mind was mostly using the drafts of Black Market Brawlers items.\n\n> Rite of Ruin\n* Recipe: Lost Chapter + Fiendish Codex + 400g (total cost: 3200g)\n* +80 AP, +100% mana regen, +30% CDR\n* Passive: Gains charges upon moving or killing enemies, up to 300 charges. Attacking structures expends 50 charges to deal 100 (+15% AP) bonus damage.\n\nThe first 30% CDR option. Much like the current Morellonomicon, its active does not necessarily help you in 1v1 combat in the mid lane.\n\n> Pox Arcana\n* Recipe: Lost Chapter + Forbidden Idol + 650g (total cost: 3200g)\n* +60 AP, +150% mana regen, +30% CDR\n* Passive: Applies a stack of Pox for 10 seconds whenever you deal ability damage, stacking up to 5 times.\n* Active: Deals 100 magic damage plus 20 (+5% AP) per stack of Pox (maximum of 200 (+25% AP)) to all nearby enemies affected by Pox, and restores 5% of your maximum mana for every Pox stack harvested. 60 second cooldown.\n\nThe second 30% CDR option. Focused around the DPS and higher mana sustain. Kinda low on the AP side.\n\n> Netherstride Grimoire\n* Recipe: Lost Chapter + Aether Wisp + 350g (total cost: 3200g)\n* +80 AP, +100% mana regen, +5% movement speed, +20% CDR\n* Passive: Gain 15% movement speed for 2 seconds whenever you deal ability damage.\n\nTool for sticking (melee) or kiting (ranged). Paired with Lichbane grants you insane MS in combat and nears full CDR.\n\n> Staff of Flowing Water\n* Recipe: Chalice of Harmony + Aether Wisp + 150g (total cost: 2000g)\n* +40 AP, +25 magic resistance, +50% mana regen, +5% movement speed\n* Passive - Mana Font: Restores 2% of your missing mana every 5 seconds.\n* Passive: Gain 30% movement speed and 10 mp5 while in the river.\n\nTo be fair, this one could have been a componenet as well.\n\n#Solution B: The Lichbane Clause\n\nThere's one particular subset of mages who won't have trouble getting to the CDR cap, and that is Lichbane-using assassins. With the tweak to Sheen, Lichbane became even more slot-efficient with 10% CDR on it. Mages like Twisted Fate can get to 40% with just Morellonomicon, Lichbane and a blue buff, optionally ensuring 100% uptime with runes. It's rare to see both Morellonomicon and Lichbane on one champions, but still it's a possibility.\n\nThe solution here would be to take this example and build upon it, simply by adding another 10% CDR to another commonly purchased item, preferrably something that Lichabne chanpions wouldn't use - be that Liandry's Torment, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Abyssal Scepter, or a new item entirely.\n\n#Solution C: Rune Revamp\n\nProbably a simple buff to CDR runes, allowing to get 10% right away or 20% scaling, instead of 7.5% and 15% respectively. Simple as that. This woul dmake up for the loss of 5% CDR from masteries, and allow to round up the CDR from runes in general.\n\n#Solution D?\n\nIf you have any better ideas, feel free to express them.","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-11-17T22:31:26.682+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Another 20% CDR item that doesn't force mages to double dip on mana regen would be fine, really.

They are trading survivability and damage for CDR and mana regen, much like you're trading CDR for Survivability and damage.\n  \n>And that's really not convincing, considering how easily resourceless AD champs can get CDR.   \n  \nEssence Reaver, Death's Dance, Black Cleaver, Trinity Force, Youmuu's Ghostblade, Warrior's Enchantment if you're in the jungle. Only one of those items by itself gives more than 10% CDR. Essence Reaver is overtuned and being addressed, but is not useful on champions like Talon and Pantheon and Jarvan IV and Jayce since they don't do much with crit, and Talon and Jayce and Pantheon would LOVE some more CDR. In fact Jayce loves it so much he takes Ionian Boots instead of Tabi or Merc Treads. Trinity Force is only useful on champions who auto-attack often and have low cooldown spells. Death's Dance is ok but it's not all that useful on most champions compared to a Bloodthirster, but is a viable option.  Black Cleaver has a comparatively low amount of damage on it compared to other AD items.  All of those items are also more than 3000g. \n\nOnly some Marksmen can really get 40% CDR without heavily investing into either defense or sacrificing runes/masteries for it, but only those that can afford to get an Essence Reaver over a different item.  \n\nI mean what resourceless AD champs are there that want AD and CDR? Aatrox maybe? But he wants tank items as well so outside of Black Cleaver he can't devote a lot of his budget to AD and CDR. Yasuo? He doesn't care about CDR because his spells already have low cooldowns. Tryndamere? He doesn't give two craps about CDR.  I guess Rengar? \n  \n>Who's balanced around not having it? Katarina? She's balanced around not needing it.\n\nKatarina and Vlad as manaless; Brand, Kassadin, Lux, Orianna, Veigar, Ziggs, and Zilean are all balanced around not being able to reach the 40%/45% CDR cap without large investments into CDR vs. other avenues. Vlad takes CDR runes because CDR is super important on him. Katarina would LOVE a CDR item that gives AP and doesn't give wasted stats on her. \n\nEnergy champs are balanced around the fact that they would run out of energy if they built CDR. Resourceless AD champs tend to be melee so most of them have to build defenses, so they can get the CDR cap but in which case they aren't getting any offensive stats on those items.\n\n>Nashor's Tooth exists. Why not one more non-regen medium AP/20% CDR item?  \n  \nNashor's Tooth has a large part of its cost devoted purely to attack speed and the on-hit effect.\n\n\nI still don't understand; if your RoA/Seraph's champions need CDR that much then why aren't you building a chalice item on them instead of the Seraph's or taking CDR runes? I mean you're acting like RoA champs aren't doing well right now? Anivia is #3 winrate for mid lane, Swain is #5, Malzahar is #6, Morgana is #9, Cho'Gath is #11, and Karthus is #13.\n\nBrand is #1 and doesn't build any CDR or Mana Regen. Kayle is #2 and only because Guinsoo's is overtuned.\n\nI mean the way to fix the CDR disparity between them is to nerf AD CDR items, because really those are what's broken. AP champions are already balanced in regards to CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-11-19T23:46:06.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Peach Plum Pair,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O2Ev19LJ,comment-id=000e00010001000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-19T15:23:04.218+0000)\n>\n> Utilize it then. It' 6 runes to get 10% scaling CDR/5% flat or 9 to get 15% scaling/7.5% flat. It's not a good option on everyone and if it is a good option you should consider it. \n\nLike I said, it takes a lot of runes. Lots of people used to use 6 flat CDR blues and masteries for 10-15% CDR at level 1, but one of those masteries no longer gives CDR, and there's no way anyone can afford space on their rune page to make up the difference. The remaining CDR mastery is only slightly more accessible than it was before, which makes 10% at level 1 that much harder to obtain.\n\n> Both Seraph's and Rod of Ages give more AP than Morellonomicon and Athene's, while giving more survivability as well, so that's not true at all. They are trading survivability and damage for CDR and mana regen, much like you're trading CDR for Survivability and damage.\n\nThat would only be true if everything in a build with Seraph's/RoA provided the absolute maximum AP possible. But supposing I accept that sacrificing damage for CDR is an appropriate tradeoff, that's not the same as being forced to spend gold on useless or redundant stats.\n\n> Essence Reaver is overtuned and being addressed, but is not useful on champions like Talon and Pantheon and Jarvan IV and Jayce since they don't do much with crit\n\nWhat? It's not like that's a rule. It's only because they didn't have a compelling reason to do so. Now, they do. But that's not necessary. Black Cleaver, Ghostblade, and Death's Dance provide a lot of penetration as well as physical spell vamp. As for ER \"being addressed\", I'm curious about what that means, because I haven't seen any statement to that effect, and as far as I know, there are no such changes pending for 5.23. I do agree that it's a bit on the strong side, but not overmuch. Some people still don't seem to know it exists, and heedlessly rush Infinity Edge anyway.\n\n> Black Cleaver has a comparatively low amount of damage on it compared to other AD items.\n\nNot really. When it comes to AD, 65 is the new 80, which puts Black Cleaver only 10 behind most items, and it also gives arguably the best armor penetration in the game (now that LW has been nerfed), depending on how bursty you want your kills and how squishy your targets are.\n\n> All of those items are also more than 3000g.\n\nSo is almost every completed item. All of those give CDR in their build path before they are completed. A Black Cleaver and a Warhammer is 30%.\n\n> Only some Marksmen can really get 40% CDR without heavily investing into either defense or sacrificing runes/masteries for it, but only those that can afford to get an Essence Reaver over a different item.\n\nConsidering that maximizing damage consistently involves both Infinity Edge and Essence Reaver, that's probably almost all of them, at some point.\n\n> I mean what resourceless AD champs are there that want AD and CDR? Aatrox maybe? But he wants tank items as well so outside of Black Cleaver he can't devote a lot of his budget to AD and CDR. Yasuo? He doesn't care about CDR because his spells already have low cooldowns. Tryndamere? He doesn't give two craps about CDR.  I guess Rengar? \n\nAatrox can get CDR from tank items. Tryndamere definitely wants CDR for frequent dashes and maximum uptime on his ult. Riven wants maximum CDR in every game, if she can get it.\n\n> Katarina would LOVE a CDR item that gives AP and doesn't give wasted stats on her. \n\nThat doesn't explain why she shouldn't have it. You keep asserting that resourceless champs are balanced around not having CDR, but I'm not seeing any evidence of this. She is balanced around not needing max CDR, like I said. Getting it wouldn't break her. Twin Shadows was an option, and that's gone, now.\n\n> Energy champs are balanced around the fact that they would run out of energy if they built CDR.\n\nSo let them. Akali is already an example of this, being able to dump her energy into E. It's not a problem.\n\n> Nashor's Tooth has a large part of its cost devoted purely to attack speed and the on-hit effect.\n\nYes, it does. So? Similar things could be said of Morellonomicon. What's wrong with another option? Why are _those_ stats acceptable to bundle with CDR, but not another — say, movement speed or MR (there was talk of an MR item for mages to replace Abyssal Scepter, since it was changed to a tank item, but that change hasn't gone through yet)? I mentioned that Twin Shadows is gone now. That only granted 10%, but it was an option.\n\n> I still don't understand; if your RoA/Seraph's champions need CDR that much then why aren't you building a chalice item on them instead of the Seraph's or taking CDR runes?\n\nThe reason to build Archangel's Staff is always the same: you want AP and a large mana pool. Bonus mana lets you stay out longer between backs and last longer in individual encounters. Regen allows you to simply wait between fights rather than backing every time you're low. Their purposes are different.\n\n> I mean you're acting like RoA champs aren't doing well right now? Anivia is #3 winrate for mid lane, Swain is #5, Malzahar is #6, Morgana is #9, Cho'Gath is #11, and Karthus is #13.\n\nWinrates are polluted with irrelevant variables. You know that. And RoA did just get a significant buff. But this isn't about winrates. It's about playstyles and choices.\n\n> Brand is #1 and doesn't build any CDR or Mana Regen. Kayle is #2 and only because Guinsoo's is overtuned.\n\nRageblade is overtuned, yes, and Deathfire Touch makes Brand's harass broken because of his passive. These cases haven't much to do with anything being discussed here, as far as I can tell.\n\n> I mean the way to fix the CDR disparity between them is to nerf AD CDR items, because really those are what's broken. AP champions are already balanced in regards to CDR.\n\nThat doesn't follow. How did you decide that?

It's almost like 40% CDR isn't an absolute necessity. *Audible gasp*. \n\nIn fact, 40% CDR that early in the game puts pressure on you to abuse it fully. When your role requires you to burst someone down, that's usually a bad idea. (Unlike ADCs who are only required to provide consistent damage)","replies":[{"poster":"Anu3isII","date":"2015-11-18T14:42:24.643+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. The OP mentioned the fact that Trinity and Reaver have a good synergy. In exchange , these two 20% CDR AP items offer you too much mana regen and a barely decent amount of AP. It isn't the difference of cost the problem , it is the amount of gold wasted for nothing.\n\n2. Not every mage needs even any amount of CDR. But there are mages that don't scale only with damage... The best examples are Lux , Karma , Lulu ,Twisted Fate and many more. Damage is powerful for Assassins and Burst-Mages, but Utility/CC Mages will prefer to use their powers as much as possible. Utility in general scales only with CDR , and a few categories of it scale with AP too ( Shields , Heals and damage Buffs ). Magic penetration will never be totally useful in their kits , spell vamp isn't good if you don't tank the damage , HIGH amounts of AP will not make your utility spells a lot more powerful.\n\n3. That is actually the opposite effect. CDR is a stat that mages buy for better skirmishes , allowing them to do several combos in much quicker successions. So it allows you to use your mana as much as possible in fights. Also , from many points of view , CDR doesn't force you , it ALLOWS you to use spells more often. Many mages have only one CC spell , and if they use it to engage on somebody , they will most probably be defenseless , and are forced to play safe until it comes back off-cooldown.\n\n4. Your role doesn't FORCE you to do ANYTHING. Again , there are mages who have only PURE damage , and mages that have UTILITY. The only target any player has is to find a way to abuse your champions power. LeBlanc , kill that one guy! Orianna , ult their whole team! Lulu, protect our team! Twisted Fate , catch people off-guard! Veigar , stack AP and kill them later! Mages can all be: Assassins , Fighters , AoE-Monsters , CC-bots and Supports. They all are different , but they have only one purpose... To win the game!\n\n5. This thread isn't about asking for something \"new\" , it is about giving back options! Before this patch , the masteries could offer you 5% CDR right at the start of the offensive page. The only CDR option they added is deep in the cunning tree , and it doesn't feel rewarding enough to be there until you get the 45% CDR cap ( or better said 40% runes and items ). Besides this problem , they also made Lucidity Boots  give from 15% CDR( originally ) only 10% CDR( currently) . Before you could take one of those 20% CDR items , Lucidity boots , the 5% CDR mastery and bam... 40% CDR... the cost of this was actually the fact that you didn't buy Sorcerer's Shoes , so you wouldn't have Magic Pen , which was an OK trade off if you aren't a ball of pure damage. Now you are either forced to fill your whole Rune page with CDR runes if you want full CDR in early-mid game , or buy a second 20% CDR item ( which is cost ineffective) , or find a 10% CDR item that works with your champion ( most of them are situational items).\n\nAgain , this not an attack to  ADC's , AD casters or anything. It is just the problem that an build path option has been removed , making players have less choices in terms of items.","replies":[{"poster":"Tactical Salad","date":"2015-11-18T17:45:39.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beautiful.

You're slowing down your power curve and (in the case of RoA or AA, crippling your late game) by picking up more CDR, AP, and essentially nothing else.\n\nBut also, you can calculate mana regen that way (though it's inaccurate now-- at new prices, it should be 125g for 25% mana regen {{item:1004}} ), but it's not a stat like any other. AD, AP, and virtually all other stats will linearly increase some attribute of your champion. It makes sense to calculate their gold efficiency linearly.
