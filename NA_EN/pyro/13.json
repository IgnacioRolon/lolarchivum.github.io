{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2016-10-13T12:01:22.640+0000","title":"I'm sick and tired of having ranged ADCs in every game","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":114,"down_votes":32,"body":"I can stomach two in one team. But when you play three games in one day with Graves in top or jungle, and Jayce/Ezreal in a solo lane... it gets frustrating.\r\n\r\nThe quintessence of this problem is Vayne top. Sure, it&#039;s a legit pick that craps over numerous melee solo laners. But Vayne top players tend to carry over their 1v9 mentality from the bot lane, and are prone to heavy tilt when losing. ADC-heavy comps are downright useless when behind and annoying to play against when ahead. I&#039;m a mere plat scrub, but I&#039;ve already seen toplane Lucian and Jhin in ranked this week.\r\n\r\nBy themselves, champions like Graves, Jayce, Corki, Varus and Quinn are quite unique and interesting to play against. But there is a point at which it&#039;s too much. I don&#039;t mind playing a game with a ranged ADC overload from time to time, but the issue is that in *every single game* there&#039;s going to be at least 2 ranged carries.\r\n\r\n#What is the problem, exactly?\r\n\r\nAccording to Riot&#039;s new classification, there are 6 main classes in the game: Tanks (Vanguards and Wardens), Fighters (Juggernauts and Divers), Slayers (Assassins and Skirmishers), Mages (Battlemages, Burst Mages and Artillery), Controllers (Enchanters and Disruptors) and Marksmen.\r\n\r\n* You can have a game with no Tanks. Toplane and jungle is often taken by fighters, slayers or even mages. Support tanks are just one of four options.\r\n* You can have a game with no Fighters. Tanks, slayers and fighters are viable toplane and jungle options.\r\n* You can have a game with no Slayers. A fed fighter can do their job and dive the enemy backline, there&#039;s an entire fighter subclass &quot;Divers&quot; dedicated to it.\r\n* You can have a game with no Mages. Midlane has numerous viable AD picks, and the lack of magic damage can be remedied by tanks or disruptors.\r\n* You can have a game with no Controllers. There&#039;s always a pure mage support or two in the meta (Annie, Brand), and support Tanks have always been a thing.\r\n* **But you can&#039;t have a game with no Marksmen.** This is one rule of League of Legends that irks me.\r\n\r\nSure, we&#039;ve increased the diversity of ADCs in the last preseason, but we failed to make it possible to play without them. That is due to several factors, but the problem can be summed up as: You **ALWAYS** need one ranged ADC in the bot lane. There is no alternative option.\r\n\r\n#Why ranged ADCs are irreplaceable\r\n\r\nRight now there&#039;s several reasons for it:\r\n\r\n* Botlane gives less XP, but safer gold. Marksmen are fine with that.\r\n* The ranged vs melee lane matchup has always been a nightmare for melee champions\r\n* You can&#039;t properly punish the squishiness of a ranged champion if they&#039;re protected by a support\r\n* Ranged champions are best at taking towers\r\n* Ranged champions can build AD glass cannon and still output damage from a safe distance\r\n\r\n&quot;Breaking the meta&quot; and allowing for any non-marksman picks in the botlane would require enormous changes to the game. Marksmen dominate because the entire game is centered around them, with no alternative strategy available.\r\n\r\n#Who could replace them in the bot lane\r\n\r\nThere are two types of champions that seem good candidates:\r\n\r\n* Mages. Some mages who scale hard into lategame could use a support help to get through the laning phase. This could be a good place for Karthus, Cassiopeia or Ryze.\r\n* Melee carries. Champions like Tryndamere, Master Yi, Yasuo, or the pre-rework Fiora. Xin Zhao would work here as well.\r\n\r\nOf course enabling them to lane against marksmen would require some changes to the game systems. Stuff to consider would include:\r\n\r\n* Protection against ranged attacks in items (Doran&#039;s Shield, Relic Shield) and masteries - if we want melee carries\r\n* Changes to EXP distribution in duo lanes - if we want mage carries\r\n* Changes to tower damage - more damage from AP champions, less damage from ranged AD champions, more damage from melee\r\n\r\nMarksmen would still remain the most reliable source of high DPS in teamfights, but such changes could open the possibility of non-marksman botlanes. there would be still an option to have a ranged ADC in solo lane.\r\n\r\n#But what about ADC mains?\r\n\r\nNobody wants ranged ADC to be cut down in 50%. It would just be nice if we had an option of sending a non-marksman champion botlane, in let&#039;s say 10% cases. Something akin to how midlane is dominated by AP picks, but there are AD options available.\r\n\r\nRiot has already made an attempt with Mordekaiser, but that was just silly. These changes need to be made at game systems level, not by breaking a champion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow do you guys feel about it?","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-10-13T13:21:11.840+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember {{champion:82}} \nDo you really want THAT to happen again?","replies":[{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2016-10-13T13:25:59.230+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually loved the *idea* of that (Dragon ghost!), but hated that they sacrificed an old champ to test it out.

The Morde rework only reinforced this, since Morde at his strongest was completely immune to anything the enemy marksman or support could throw at him.\n\nThat says a lot about how much of an advantage being ranged in lane is, and how Riot ignored this discrepancy for years (and still continues to).\n\nYasuo also demonstrated that if a champ with a kit specifically overloaded to deal with ranged harass and support poke is taken to a solo lane, it's much easier to succeed. CertainlyT learned a lesson and designed Morde's W passive and active to both only work in a duo lane, forcing him there and preventing him from taking his strong kit to a solo lane like Yasuo did.\n\nHowever, since Morde's kit forced him into one role and the balance team nerfed the hell out of him in that role, he was left a broken mess of a champion for months until his kit was changed to allow solo lane and jungle viability. You can't force a champion into a single role and then nerf them, or else you basically delete them from the game. Kalista mains should know all about this (and as someone who likes to play melee champs, I'm not shedding many tears for her disappearance).\n\nAll in all, I would love to see melee carries in bot lane as a viable option to marksmen. However, that's not going to happen until Riot gives melee champions some love in a distinctly one sided match up.

This way solo lane 1v1 remains unchanged, but melee vs ranged 2v2 is now possible. Now the only thing to take care of is making sure the revamped Doran's Shield/Relic Shield isn't abused on all ranged ADCs/supports. I think throwing a Melee Only tag onto it would be a neat solution. Another way is to put that passive onto an AD item.\n\nThis could be solved with masteries as well (interesting choice would be putting it deep into Ferocity) if putting it on items warps the balance too hard. Text of the passive:\n\n> While an allied champion is nearby, you take 20 less damage from ranged attacks.\n\nFlat damage reduction works best in laning phase, and if it comes before armor % reduction, it won't make much difference in the lategame.

Its kind of the same issue of class mashing that you get out of trying to create a utility assassin like Ekko.  They're pretty much always outliers in the whole of the game and just because we have a lot of adcs you can pick in other lanes doesn't somehow mean they're dominating the game, every role is still getting picked for.  However having at least one adc is just a staple for having a successful push and its a fundamental of what league of legends is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-10-13T12:39:01.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait til you get a premade that decides to have their top laner take Varus top lane in a ranked match.
