We don't need 120 stories about how a character joined the league to find answers or justice or that the league has them imprisoned.\n\nThe world of Valoran can be a hell of a lot more interesting than that, and some of the better stories, in my opinion, that Riot has produced completely ignored the institute of war. Why would a psychopath like Jinx or a badass ghost dude like Thresh join the league?

We had 120 stories about how a character joined the league to find answers or justice because we had shitty writers who couldn't tell any other story.  That hasn't changed.  Azir's story isn't better; in fact, his story could have been exactly the same, since the entirety of the story took place long before the League existed.\n\nWhy would evil, crazy, or ethereal characters join the League?  Well, the thing is, Narrative never really tried to flesh out what the League could or couldn't do.  They never attempted delving into the lore of the League itself and crafting a universe based upon it.  What does it matter if these characters are out in the world instead?  They cannot resolve the storylines.  Nobody can hunt down and kill Cho'gath, because too many players would get pissed off about it.  So, what--he's just out there, somewhere, rampaging through villages unhindered?  That's idiotic.  There is no necessary reason for champions to interact with each other at all.  Who cares that Amumu is cursed?  It just means stay the hell away from him.  All parts of the lore are now disconnected short stories that aren't better written than the League Judgments were before all this.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but if you can't see that nothing has changed, that just means you're every bit a shitty writer as the people on Narrative.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verandure","date":"2015-03-03T09:00:29.209+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except it can't.

Do you have any idea how many times Gotham gets torn to pieces?\n\nThe cool thing about league stories is that they are always open ended and left to speculation. As in just because one characters Lore is him destroying everything, another characters lore is him trying to protect everything. Look at Kassadin and the Void monsters. Sure the Void guys are trying to kill everyone they can find, but Kassadin is trying to stop that. Same goes for Lucian and the Shadow Isles. Who knows who will win? But it gives you a more fun idea for these character identities than \"The league has us all imprisoned, so we have to fight for them. \"\n\nThe only problem is Riot still has a lot of work ahead of them for Champions whose lore revolved around the institute of war.

No.  For every single one of them, all you have to do is come up with either a reason for them to want to join the League or an incentive for the Institute to put a stop to their activities.  By delving into the lore of the Institute itself, instead of merely tacking it on to the end of every champion story, you could create a rich world in which the champions interact with each other.\n\nA writer who cannot write a good story, regardless of the restrictions on the story in place, cannot blame the restrictions for a bad story.
