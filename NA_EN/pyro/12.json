But one peculiar thing remains:\n\n#Champions can only belong to one of these groups.\n\n**Star Guardians**\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:78}} \n\n**Mecha**\n{{champion:14}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:266}} \n\n**PROJECT**\n{{champion:157}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:55}} \n\nNow, my theory here would be that other skin lines might share that universe:\n\n**Super Galaxy**\n{{champion:68}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:105}} (Fizz, his icon is broken on boards now)\n\n**Dark Star**\n{{champion:412}} {{champion:110}} \n\n**Battlecast**\n{{champion:112}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:72}} \n\n**Full Metal**\n{{champion:126}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:33}} \n\nI'm not so sure on Battlecast and Fullmetal, because it's an old skin line (they are confirmed to be shared as a vision of future in which Viktor and Jayce mechanize their allies), but the fact remains that none of the Battlecast/Fullmetal champions have any skins belonging to other lines. Mostly because they and Mecha are thematically pretty much the same thing.\n\n---\n\nSo, we got a bunch of champions (23% of the total pool) divided into separate skin lines. What other evidence supports the theory that Star Guardian and Super Galaxy belong in the same universe?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/83YSxNZ.jpg\n\n#It's all anime as fuck.\n\nSeriously. I don't think you need to even watch any single anime to realize there's something thematically coherent in the way Star Guardians and Super Galaxy skins are portrayed. And if Jinx calls out PROJECT and Mechas, it's no longer a reference to just Transformers or Pacific Rim (let's ignore these two ones were heavily anime-referenced) - we're blending several seemingly faraway concepts (robots and magic) into one reality.\n\nThen, if you do have any anime knowledge, you begin noticing all the Madoka/Pretty Cure references in Star Guardian skin line (Sailor Moon is a reference even people who haven't seen a single anime in their life get), you realize Super Galaxy Rumble is a one big tribute to Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and you notice how Mecha Malphite was supposed to be a reference to EVA (if only the skin itself was as epic as its splash).\n\nDark Star isn't a big skin line yet, but I'm banking on it being too thematically related to Star Guardians to not be connected in any means.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RtWlxSf.jpg\n\n---\n\nWhat's your opinion on this approach? Personally, I love it. I always like when you can match skins in your team, and I'm quite upset when a promising skin line is discontinued (like Crimson Elite was).\n\nAlso, do you have any good ideas on what champions unassigned to any of these groups yet should get a certain type of skin? And how should be this shared universe called, \"superworld\", \"animeverse\", \"weebout\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Odinakos","date":"2016-09-25T01:01:50.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito should give the rights for the anime to a good japanese studio already. Like the one that created attack on titan. They had nothing to do this year and made _kabaneri of the iron fortress_ which while had shallow plot, the animation was excellent and quite enjoyable. Imagine if they bothered with a LoL anime. The success would be massive.\n\nIt would really profit both parties. Rito because it would be free advertising and prob money from rights. And lets not mention the best preview for future skins.\nThe studio because it will go into a topic with great fanbase, that would lead to even greater viewership. Even people not particulary interested in both, would watch it because of the hype.\nIt is like the case of Warhammer:Total war. It lead to the reborn of total war series not only because it drafted from both fanbases, but also outsiders that were curious about the collaboration.\n\nThe only obstacle would be if it would fit Riots view of that alternative universe. It would require a decent cooperation beween lore team and the studio to produce the raw storyline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-09-24T21:27:01.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that these skin lines, while having the potential to exist in the same universe, probably don't in most cases. In any case I certainly don't want Riot to beholden to the idea that if a champion has one skin they can't have another, providing those skin lines don't conflict too much. Kha'Zix not having a Battlecast skin because it could be far too similar to Mecha makes sense, but I'd hate to see Jinx or Poppy get denied potential PROJECT skins because they have Star Guardian skins.\n\nThe reason there's likely little overlap currently is because skin lines are generally made with some design decisions from the get go, and we're not at a point yet where skin lines are fleshed out in terms of quantity. Some examples:\n\nPROJECT: Human champions only\nMECHA: Humanoid/Unusual Human champions only\nBattlecast: Monster champions only\nStar Guardian: Young human women/yordle women only\n\nThe boundaries are only just being explored so overlap has yet to occur. Having skin lines in the same universe would be interesting in my opinion, but I don't want things to be set in stone just yet. Having a bit of ambiguity in that regard helps to build up the potential for later.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2016-09-24T21:58:13.922+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But that is a part of why this design is so genius. You don't forbid champions from \"joining\" a skin line - they're deliberately designed in a way that makes every champion \"fit\" into one of them.\n\nAnd if they could fit into different styles, you just make a skin for them that's separate from the animeverse. For example Lux has a Steel Legion skin that makes pretty much any PROJECT design redundant, yet it's significantly different from that line. Poppy admittedly could work in the PROJECT line but that demand can be met with another Steel Legion skin to match Lux and Garen.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-09-24T22:06:49.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But in that case they specifically don't get to make one skin of a specific theme because it's part of a singular skin universe and deliberately have to choose a different skin line. That's what I DON'T want to see. That effectively kills the creativity by setting up the arbitrary measure of \"skin can't be made because skin lore\". Clashing aesthetics is a major thing and I respect that when they design skins, but deliberately saying we'll make X skin and not Y skin because of an alternate universe seems super restricting and not fun at all.\n\nIf this animeverse means any champion can denied access to a new skin, and the ONLY REASON WHY is because of that AU's existence, then it's a major negative as far as I can see.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-09-24T22:25:13.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say that having skin lines in the same universe could be inhibitory, but I disagree. This \"universe\" can have a timeline, it is not just a singular picture.

Project is some kind of future cyber-punk setting, Battlecast looks like the world from the Machines from Matrix, and Mecha seems to be a not-so-very-far future (~100 years from our pov), as it is in Pacific Rim.\nThough I can't tell about Dark Star and Super Galaxy, although the latter has, just like the Star Guardians a heavy anime theme, one Skin line I can see exist in the same universe is the Academy one. If you look at the Star Guardian comic, they wear very similar clothes to Ahris in the 'school-picture'.\n\nAlso I think Project, Battlecast, Mecha and Dark Star are way too dark a theme for Star Guardian and Super Galaxy","replies":[{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-09-26T00:09:33.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if we see, like, Academy Ahri in the background of some Star Guardian art.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-09-25T10:19:11.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PROJECT, Mecha, and Battlecast are indeed part of the same Universe (Battlecast units found in splash arts of PROJECT skins, and both Mecha and PROJECT being inspired by Viktors Evolution...and thematically they all fit nicely into that dystopian alternate future vibe), let call it Universe B (since Universe A is the main timeline of LoL). Star Guardians are part of Universe C, but due to the nature of their powers, they are able to traverse multiple universes and dimensions, making the connection possible the same way Bard traverses plains of existence.\n\nCurrently, there are no indications if Dark Star or Super Galaxy skins fit in Universe C, but thematically they make sense in it just as the ones in Universe B fit inside that universe.\n\nAdditionally, Program, Full Metal, Steel Legion, and Pulsefire skin themes could potentially fit in Universe B, but few or any proof could indicate the truth of that outcome as of this time.\n\n\nAlso skin lore doesnt deter potential new skins being created for champions that already had skins in the same universe, in fact, the way each theme was handled, there are multiple ways of creating new skins for the same character within the same multiverse (specially since some of these skins arent the real characters we see, rather their mecha, robot, cosmic versions of what we would closely associate any given characters with, not actual character if he was in that setting at that time). \n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=cinomenapplebae,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qlhNNYsq,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-09-24T22:49:44.278+0000)\n>\n> What about bloodmoon and arcade\n\nBlood Moon is a theme that derives from the myths and tales of Ionia itself, as such it is its own separate universe of a tale...same could be said with a lot of Lunar Revel skins.\n\nArcade is a gaming universe, its existence could be in any number of Universes mentioned, and it wouldnt clash with the themes of them since it all happenes inside a game verse, which is different from what possibly the outerverse of the Arcade is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-09-25T09:49:10.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is just a meta thing.\n\nI mean, what about Jinx having quotes while looking at *herself*?\n\nJust accept it for the lulz and move on :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"YouCantClickThis","date":"2016-09-25T03:10:15.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although plausible, you cannot rely solely on VO's to prove a connection to a lore.

Now  simultaneously it&#x27;s possible that Illaoi could meet Rek&#x27;Sai in the future and quite possible she has encountered Tahm Kench in bilgewater-- and those lines accurately reflect how she would feel about them.

As of right now the only ones that have been almost verified to be part of the same universe are PROJECT and Battlecast. Battlecast was teased on the splash art of PROJECT skins. Also, i'm pretty sure the Mecha line also ties into it, i remember someone providing me evidence before but i forget and im too lazy to look up. I feel like it would be too much to have all these skin lines in the same universe, they are probably divided into their own separate universes. \n\nDark Star vs Star Guardians (& maybe Super Galaxy)\nPROJECT vs Battlecast (& maybe Mecha)\nFull Metal vs Super Galaxy\n\nSomething like that","replies":[]},{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2016-09-24T22:49:44.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about bloodmoon and arcade","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-09-24T22:02:37.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully support an anime league AU.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ozzie Storm","date":"2016-09-24T21:21:04.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do beleive that the Full Metal universe actually share the same universe as the Super Galaxy & Star Guardian one, the reason being the project skins.
