Hes just irrelevant. His ult should be a AOE skill shot for bundle targets for the long ass cooldown it is on. Right now his ult feels like an Inferior Darius ult, when they removed Garens DFG his ult turned to crap (joke). For some reason all these tanks have these HP ratio/etc boost to damage or shields for being tanky but yet he doesn't. He jumps in fight gets focused (for some dumb ass reason), Leaves the fight, Passive heal his health then comes back in to deal damage somehow because he has damage(which he doesn't).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-22T09:34:10.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thats because scrub Garens actually think building full tank on him is a good idea.\n\nlmao","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-03-22T10:16:31.313+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3071}} + full tank.\n\nAny more damage items and he gets deleted in teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-22T20:40:37.555+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope.\n\nThats not true in the slightest.\n\nHIs W Gives him more than enough room to itemize very offensively\n\nYou can build at least two offensive items, and still be very tanky.

He can be tanky and his base stats help his tankiness even before building tank items. I agree that Garen is currently non-competitive and I resort to itemizing more damage items for several reasons. Building tank on Garen only helps Garen and the enemy team quickly learns to ignore him until all the other opponents are killed. Only one damage item does not provide Garen with enough AD to be a meaningful threat. More than one damage item will have more impact and will force the enemy team to deal with Garen sooner than later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-03-23T05:15:29.863+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Secondary: Tank\n\nYea I guess Garen should never ever be considered as a usable tank, obviously Riot agrees.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-31T17:18:11.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah and Ashe is listed as a support.\n\nAnd Aatrox a tank\n\nDo you see the problem?\n\nIf you build Garen full tank, and wonder why he \"sucks compared to other tanks\", then well thats just your stupidity.\n\nI wonder if people still think urgot is an adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-03-31T20:30:44.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ashe is listed as a support because she has permaslow, vision, and a global stun.

Not every tank has to bumble around like {{champion:113}}, some can be tanks because they get into the middle of the enemy team and wreck havoc while using special skills to negate most of the focus they are subjected to. {{champion:62}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:266}} \n\nUrgot is ADC because he does consistent targeted long range damage, just not with his basic attack.\n\nKeep arguing.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-31T20:57:13.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really need to\n\nAatrox?
