Bad luck? Now I assume the chests give the same skin for cheaper champions (450-1350 IP) to prevent people grinding accounts for good skins and selling them. I know for a fact more expensive champions give different skins, because I got Pool Party Draven one time and Primetime Draven the next.\r\n\r\nAnyone got a different Soraka skin from the Hextech Chest? The only thing that makes me reconsider it being bad luck is I got Snow Day Singed one time; which seems an odd choice for a fixed skin. If the chest gave the same Singed skin each time, you might expect Hextech Singed instead, since it's not as good and is thematic (Hextech skin for Hextech crafting).\r\n\r\nA friend got Panda Annie from his first chest, another Definitely Not Udyr, and one Sinful Succulence Morgana. Can anyone confirm they got different skins from the free Hextech Chest for these champions (if not Soraka)? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T01:59:59.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those skins are in fact random. Sometimes it might not seem like it though. For instance: I myself have actually gotten Elementalist Lux as a skin shard 5 times.....right after I bought her nonetheless. Regardless of my terrible luck, the skins shards from hextech chests are not fixed, but sometimes you might get the same shard just by coincidence.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU NWAH","date":"2017-06-09T02:28:50.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to double check: I mean the free Hextech chest you get at level 5 not one from the loot system. The level 5 chest gives a guaranteed skin for one of your owned champion(s). It doesn't reward random champion/skin shards. I've gotten two different Draven skins from this chest, but every Soraka skin has been the same. I guess it's just bad luck. Thanks for responding.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T02:41:58.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaaaaa! I honestly thought you were talking about the normal hextech chests, my bad! \n\nThe Premium Chest will give you a random skin for a champion you own that costs 975 or less. Since Soraka has 3 skins in the shop that qualify right now it's pretty unlucky that you've gotten the same one, but it is still a random skin. I'm assuming that you're making multiple accounts and leveling them up, because otherwise, I'm a little confused as to how you're opening so many premium chests xD.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU NWAH","date":"2017-06-09T02:44:50.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I never considered that.

I was honestly just confused as to why you would have gotten multiple Premium Chests lol. No problem with being a one-trick pony either, I was with Teemo until I found Illaoi ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"YOU NWAH","date":"2017-06-09T03:08:02.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting you should mention Illaoi. I was considering her. You said the premium chest only rewards skins that cost 975 RP or less. What if I opened one and only owned Illaoi? She only has the one skin (Voidbringer) and it's a 1350 RP skin. What would happen there?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T03:27:52.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that's the case, the system would probably end up giving you a random skin 975 or lower for a completely random champion, even if you don't own the champion. I don't believe it would just give you the 1350 Void Bringer skin.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU NWAH","date":"2017-06-09T03:35:53.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess there's only one way to find out...\n\nI'll stop bothering you with questions now.
