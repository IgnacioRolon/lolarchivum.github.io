{"poster":"SHADOWFISH1","date":"2014-10-17T03:07:51.652+0000","title":"Champions that lack visual updates/retouches","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Note that this is my perspective of what I think Riot should update these champions to be lore-friendly to their surroundings, such as map, visually updated champions, and terrain with the upcoming Season 4 and Season 5 updates.  You don't have to agree with me, again, this is my opinion.  Please up vote, and bump for Riot to be aware of these outdated champions.  After reading, please tell me if I'm missing any details.\n\nIt would be more beneficial for champions if Riot visually updated all these old champions, before adding these new updated skins.  (Arcade MissFortune, Dragonslayer Pantheon, and especially Spirit Guard Udyr)\n\nThe champions listen below:\nLack better skill animation\nBetter character frame, and body proportions\nLore friendly color scheme\nTo match with it's surroundings\nMore/Less dynamic effort displayed when using a skill/spell\nAlso need a new splash art\nMissing recall animations, as new champions do\n\n{{champion:34}}  Anivia - Overall animation lacks smoothness, too choppy.  Skill frame/proportions seem too blocky and rough.  Needs more icicle looking appearance, since she is made out of ice.\n\n{{champion:18}}  Tristana - Skill animation is too plain, requires more dynamic effects, physical movement, and is slightly choppy.\n\n{{champion:17}}  Teemo - Annoying, and repetitive head bobbing when shooting darts, and when planting shrooms.\n\n{{champion:77}}  Udyr - Pizza/Elephant feet, body animation is choppy and is outdated, he still has season 1 animations, and physique.\n\n{{champion:13}}  Ryze - Has the season 1 feel, update skill FX, visual physique kind of seems inconsistent, especially when Ryze is throwing spells.  In my opinion, requires more feel of power, and fluent movement.\n\n{{champion:26}}  Zilean - Similar to Ryze's mechanics, Zilean requires more smooth movement, only his basic attack animations, and [Q] are displaying movement, other than his speed buff/debuff, and ult, they don't really do anything significant.\n\n{{champion:80}}  Pantheon - Pantheon has pizza feet.  His colors (As well as his other skins) Need to be matched with his surroundings, as well smoothing his physical animation.\n\n{{champion:35}}  Shaco - Lacks skill, and movement animation.  Attack animation seems to exaggerated, along with other champions that seem to lean in, and extend their arms forward when attacking.\n\n{{champion:20}}  Nunu - Pizza feet, lacks skill animation as his blood boil doesn't do anything significant.  Fix physique/figure as well.\n\n{{champion:42}}  Corki - Lacks skill & movement animation.  Add more dynamic feeling when Corki ascends during his Valkyrie.  Requires refining during Gatling Gun, Corki idly remains the same.\n\n{{champion:54}}  Malphite - Pizza feet.  Malphite's color tone seems too boring, all skill animation greatly lacks fluent, and smooth movement.  See for yourself.\n\n{{champion:78}}  Poppy - Color tone, body movement, and dynamic skill animation require revamps and retouches.  She needs to match with her surroundings and environment for next season.\n\n{{champion:45}}  Veigar - I think Veigar needs a slight fix for his skill's graphic quality, and for his general physical appearance.  Veigar's feet are too large.\n\n{{champion:33}}  Rammus - Lacks better animation for his Powerball, as well as a more powerful feeling when he taunts an enemy, and when he is unleashing his earthquakes.\n\n{{champion:90}}  Malzahar - His basic attack movement seems a bit exaggerated in my opinion, as well as his color & physical body.  Lacks lore-friendly colors.\n\n{{champion:81}}  Ezreal - Physical appearance needs to match his new updated splash art, as well has his basic attack animations need revamping.\n\n{{champion:36}} Mundo - Slightly has pizza feet.  Mundo demonstrates only one animation out of his skill set.  Lacks movement, lore friendly voice over.  Generally a new visual update is needed.  Mundo is still in Season 1.\n\n{{champion:32}} Amumu - Skills need to be recolored, and have better graphics.  Reconfigure his physique/frame.\n\n{{champion:21}} Miss Fortune - Skill animation lacks smoothness.  Ult movement seems exaggerated.\n\n**Edit** 10/17/14\nSorry, yes, of course, how COULD I forget Mordekaiser, and Taric?\n\n{{champion:39}} Irelia - Fix hair strands, and other noticeable errors in her animations.\n\n{{champion:44}}  Taric - Fix large feet, better body proportions, color, and as well as better animations.\n\n{{champion:82}} Mordekaiser - Same as Taric.\n\n{{champion:38}} Kassadin - Kassadin lacks better body proportions, animations, and a new color retouch.  Armor/Skin colors don't seem void, and or lore friendly.\n\n{{champion:90}} Malzahar - Malzahar's clothes could use some recoloring, and perhaps some new body proportions.\n\n{{champion:19}} Warwick - Classic skin lacks lore friendliness in terms of color, such as skin, and armor.  Warwick really lacks better animations, and a better body proportion.\n\n{{champion:31}} Cho'Gath - Pretty self explanatory, he's growing, make his animation, and skin colors most ferocious looking.  He IS from the void.\n\n{{champion:22}} Ashe - Basic attacks have a large interval/wind up before sending another AA.  Gameplay changing if fixed.\n\nAwaiting for more responses, and edits.\n\n[](http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1413597647074/chinesetaric.png)","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2014-10-17T03:21:40.438+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that two of the most ugly champion models aren't there disappoints me (pizza feet kings).\n\n{{champion:44}} {{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2014-10-17T10:47:52.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about hte Pizza body king?\n{{champion:38}}","replies":[{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-10-17T11:31:23.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malzahar needs an update, too.
