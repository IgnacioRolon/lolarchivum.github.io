When the Rioters subsequently took back content, they also ended up taking  back some content he had spent purchased RP on. \n\nMy assumption is that this happened because there's an automatic system in place that removes content starting with the most recently obtained content until a price equal to the fraudulently obtained IP/RP is \"paid back\". i.e. it doesn't distinguish between content bought with purchased RP and fraudulent RP. Am I correct?\n\nNote that I'm not asking to add fuel to any fire/go on any witch hunt, I'm just honestly curious.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Diabollic","date":"2015-10-16T06:51:05.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They werent obtained by illegal means, and thank you i shall submit a support ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-10-16T06:27:31.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they were bought with RP that was illegally obtained, they will be removed.\n\nHowever, that's not to say it can't happen on accident due to a bug or mistake on Riot's part.
