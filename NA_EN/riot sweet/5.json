Wasn't there a discussion earlier about how quotes should be somehow highlighted?\n\n-\nI maintain, as I have always believed, that simply stapling chronological features onto Reddit (which is similar to what has been done here even if that is not at all how it came about) is a terrible way to manage a forum.\n\nIt spawns tons of one-line comments that do nothing but make the people using vbulletin-view have to read tons and tons of nothing, constantly loading extra pages (which you can't open in multiple tabs **still**, WHY, exactly was that decided?!); and the people using reddit-view don't actually see any of the vbulletin-view posters because they're not properly nested (as they usually respond to more than one person).\n\nThus you, despite having one... THING, have two completely different groups of people responding in a thread. Very few people in reddit-view quote because the context for their post is above due to how nesting works, which makes everybody in chronological lost. As above, people trying to join a standing discussion that use reddit-view will not see hardly any, IF any, of the chronological multi-replies because they don't scroll down.\n\n\\*sigh\\* But that is neither here nor there, I'm elated to have quotes that have more function.","replies":[]},{"poster":"medium katarina","date":"2014-12-11T00:52:48.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1 (✿◡‿◡)","replies":[{"poster":"Insanity Kiwi","date":"2014-12-11T02:59:05.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=medium katarina,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=oOJGXBnK,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2014-12-11T00:52:48.435+0000)\n> +1 (✿◡‿◡)\n\nThis is a quote in discussion view.\n\nEDIT: That needs working on it appears but at least it links back to the quoted post.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Frosthaven","date":"2014-12-11T03:03:02.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrazynTough Kiwi,realm=OCE,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=oOJGXBnK,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2014-12-11T02:59:05.625+0000)\n> This is a quote in discussion view.\n> \n> EDIT: That needs working on it appears but at least it links back to the quoted post.\n\nYep, I've got a fix for that as well!
