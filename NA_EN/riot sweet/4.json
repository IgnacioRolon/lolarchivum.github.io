So,I was hopeful for these placement matches.  My used to be duo partner (my brother) hit plat as you decayed me into a bottomless pit that most of the players whom fall victim to claim it's impossible to get out.  \n\nI got out.  Because I don't believe in the option to \"surrender\".  I didnt give up.\n\nI was hopeful because though I'm not as good as my brother, I was on a rise.

Make it impossible to lose the tier you earn!  Also, don't mix the tiers up.  It's hard to climb out of silver when I'm matched with people in bronze who are literally clueless...like come on dude...you gotta ward...or come on guys, we killed 4 of them...why are u running in different directions aimlessly?\n\nSo, with that said.  I think you need different conditions entirely to allow people to even play ranked.  Maybe it's harsh, but your level 30s who just hit, are basically level 5's still.

According to Riot, you will always start lower than you ended last season... So even if you win 10 straight placement matches, you're going to be lower than S2.

In fact, I got placed in Bronze 1 the day before Season 3 ended (3W-7L). I then saw all divisions of Bronze in Season 4, before ultimately taking a break from LoL when our baby was born. I was in Bronze 2 until the season reset. \n\nI just finished my Season 5 placements last night and was placed in Bronze 1 (7W-3L). I was honestly expecting to be placed lower, but was pleasantly surprised to find myself placed higher than last season. I fully expect to get into Silver in the next few games. I was playing with quite a few Silvers from last season, and I feel like I can compete on that level now.\n\nMy matches went as follows:\n1 - Katarina - Win (1-0)\n2 - Braum - Loss (1-1)\n3 - Janna - Win (2-1)\n4 - Janna - Win (3-1)\n5 - Janna - Loss  (3-2) - My client crashed but I was able to get back in after the first 5 minutes - all lanes lost, and the game ended quickly\n6 - Janna - Win (4-2) - Two guys fought over ADC (Vayne and Corki) - I ended up going mid against Ziggs... as Janna with support runes and masteries - everyone finally calmed down and worked like a team - We aced and rushed their Nexus with only 1 Nexus tower of our own\n7 - Katarina - Win (5-2)\n8 - Katarina - Win (6-2) - Troll concerns due to champ select miscommunication - Keeping positive as the game started I told my team, \"I see a crazy way we can win this big.\" - We had a decisive victory - 21 min Surrender\n9 - Katarina - Loss (6-3)\n10 - Janna - Win (7-3)\n\nAll in all, I had great teams, no DCs (other than mine), and very little argument. I friended quite a few people who were on my teams. When you find good teammates, keep them!\n\nJust wanted to share my positive experience, since it seems most people had a rough go in placements.
