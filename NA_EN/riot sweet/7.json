I wonder if that is part of the reason QT and others decided to run from DIG.\n\nLets be honest here, DIG as a organization is messing up big time for over a year. Something is failing and the management leadership does not seem to exist. I remember Scarra saying last split on his stream he had to stream since he was not getting paid enough as DIG coach. DIG's owners need to realize that they are going to be 10th place if they do not show proper leader ship and support a meaningful staff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FaerKhan","date":"2015-02-04T00:07:14.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In his defense, Jungling is considerably less rewarding and more difficult than it was in previous seasons.

Really screwed my fantasy team\n\nIt's not really his fault though, he relies just as much on his team to make plays as they rely on him.  And his team just doesn't know what they are or want to be at the moment.  Did you watch that last game?  You could tell he just didn't know what to do to bring his team back from the certain death two minutes in.  Also, that Annie ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-02-03T12:44:55.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how does that explain the last split.

I realize he has had high points, but I've just never seen him as a play-making kind of player.  He is more of a goes with the flow sort of player, which sometimes a team needs.   Not a pro team, mind you, but still an important asset.  If his team is winning, he is taking them from winning to completely out of control winning.  If they are losing, he does silly things like go in 1v5 with a jarvan ulti.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2015-02-05T04:10:30.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ik this is prob obvius but how do these guys pull it off, my bro tells me lcs players usually retire after 1.5-3 years, and that to me is mind blowing, even traditional sports atheletes can't retire that fast. \n\nNow the second thing is the pressure to much or is it just that the dominate players a constantly shifting that they dont/cant stay for longer.\n\ni dont particularly pay attention about lcs but this has me curious","replies":[{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-02-06T06:18:41.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your brother sure seems informed on the long term trends of the LCS given that it's only been in existance for [less than] 3 years.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-02-05T02:56:23.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy crap .-.\n\nExodus:qtpie, scarra, zion, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-02-05T03:24:51.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tang Bohu,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Wky2eh0l,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-02-05T02:56:23.764+0000)\n>\n> holy crap .-.\n> \n> Exodus:qtpie, scarra, zion, etc.\n\nSo much sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-02-06T06:16:52.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sweet,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Wky2eh0l,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-02-05T03:24:51.816+0000)\n>\n> So much sad.\n\nthat's exactly my sentiments....
