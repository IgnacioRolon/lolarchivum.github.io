Where exactly are our reports going to? Surely Riot can't check the huge amount of reports personally?\"\r\n\r\n#Riot Lyte responded with this to say:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nReports are still being used by a variety of systems that aren't tied to the Tribunal.\r\n\r\n**Some examples include:**\r\n\r\n* **Chat Restrictions**, which are given to players who show moderate verbal toxicity.  \r\n* **Intentional Feeder Bans**, which are given to players who currently show intentional feeding patterns in their games.\r\n* ** Ranked Restrictions**, which are given to players who show toxicity in Ranked Modes and restricts them from playing Ranked until they improve their behaviors.\r\n* ** Escalated Bans**, which are 14-day bans given to players who show extreme verbal toxicity.\r\n\r\nThere's a team at Riot working hard on the Tribunal, and we realize it's been down for 6 months now. One of the biggest problems of the system was the speed of its feedback loops, as it would often take longer than a week for a player to receive their punishment. As we've mentioned before, the faster the feedback, the better the results. A second problem was that many territories in the world never got a Tribunal at all due to hardware/infrastructure issues.\r\n\r\nWe intend to have more news about the Tribunal in 2015, and are planning some initial tests of the new system. For example, we're seeing how current reports affect the new system, and we'll be looking for some players to help us test the system on the PBE in 2015.\r\n\r\n**Some of the new features in the system include:**\r\n\r\n* the ability to review positive players in the Tribunal and grant them some rewards\r\n* new ways for players to see their contributions to the community in the Justice Reviews\r\n* a visual update to the entire system, including the Case Review and Reform Cards\r\n* a new tier system for punishments so that players only get 1 warning and 2 chances before they completely lose their account\r\n* optimized algorithms that hopefully allow us to ensure that players get punished or rewarded within a few days of their Tribunal case (we still need to tune this)\r\n* the ability for awesome contributors in the Tribunal to earn some in-game rewards each year\r\n\r\nThere's some other additions to the Tribunal, but these are some of the cooler things I'm looking forward to as a League player myself. Anyways, we'll talk more about some of our plans on how we'll re-introduce the Tribunal back into League in 2015. We apologize for the delay; unfortunately, scaling the Tribunal globally to millions of players proved to be more difficult than we initially expected... but when you're making something that millions of people will use, nothing is ever easy.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-12-16T21:03:02.591+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":6,"body":"*Didn't get a chance to cross-post more last night but here are more details Lyte elaborated on. \n*\n---\n\n> It dosen't matter because no human is checking the report it's only a robot that bans after a X amount of reports. If you report them wheter or not they were toxic the result will be the same they'll get banned\n\n#Lyte:\n\nThis is false for several reasons.\n\nOne, the Report System takes into account every player's report accuracy. If your reports are accurate, your reports will mean more and the systems will actually take your votes into account.\n\nIf your reports are inaccurate, if you spam reports, or if you simply do silly things like get a premade group of 4 to report someone for no reason, your reports will lose value over time.\n\nIf reports just resulted in punishment no matter what, trust me, you'd hear about millions of false positives on the forums, not just a few players complaining about their bans every so often.\n\n\n> \"the ability to review positive players in the Tribunal and grant them some rewards\"\nIf you can elaborate I would be very interested in hearing more about this?\n\n#Lyte:\nWhen players log into the new Tribunal they will be presented with a random case that could be Negative, Neutral or Positive. Because there's 3 options and random \"test\" cases, it's very difficult for players to simply spam \"Punish\" in the new system because they'll quickly get flagged for being highly inaccurate, and also this new setup encourages players to dive deeper into cases and read the details instead of potentially seeing something like 90% of cases be punishable.\n\nIf you get presented a Positive case, and you vote Positive, the player in the case will get a small in-game prize that is still TBD but should be a nice little pat on the back for the player. Players that are rated positive in the Tribunal often will also be eligible for more frequent rewards like the double IP Boost we tested a few weeks ago.   \n\n\n\n> Are reports from custom games in fact already counted? If not, might they be in the future?\n\n#Lyte:\n\nAt this time, the launch of the new Tribunal does not include support for Custom Games; however, what queues are \"active\" or not are a simple toggle in the new system.\n\nAs with any new system we want to manage the launch very carefully and not simply open the floodgates of every queue on the system. If all matchmade queues are doing well after the Tribunal launch and we want to expand into Custom Games, we can.\n\n> So why couldn't you keep the old system up while creating the new one in the background or on the PBE?\n\n#Lyte:\n\nUnfortunately, maintaining a \"live\" system is a decent amount of work for a team so if we kept the old system up and running it would have potentially taken much longer to get the new system up. It is also much harder to run some analytics and research tests when 2 systems are concurrently \"live.\" For example, it was much easier to run Escalated Ban and Ranked Restriction tests without an old Tribunal also reviewing cases and judging the same behaviors these other systems were monitoring and punishing for. Now that we understand how Escalated Bans and Ranked Restrictions work without any other systems interfering, we can incorporate them much easier into the new Tribunal.\n\nNot to get into the nitty gritty, but for example if we're upgrading tech stacks or hardware throughout League of Legends, this team would have to keep up with these changes on the old system while also building a new one for the future so it's also a lot of redundant work.\n\nAlthough it was a painful choice, and one that we can debate for the ages, we made the choice to shut the old Tribunal down to focus all team resources on the new one.\n\n\n> Does that mean that the ribbon/honoring system is essentially... going away? Like if I honor someone as friendly, does that even do anything in terms of their tribunal status or am I just wasting my time even bothering?\n\n\n#Lyte:\n\nWe actually have a follow-up design to Honor that will make it compatible with the new Tribunal.\n\nIt won't come out at the same time, but Honor is something we're working on in 2015.","replies":[{"poster":"Jambulija","date":"2014-12-17T06:23:59.128+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"1.

I was literally temp banned and all my rewards taken away for the entire year because I had been trolled so much, kept a running list of the worst trolls I'd encountered, and not one had ever been punished.  I tried a new tactic to see if it would finally get a troll punished by riots system and instead of the troll who had been harassing me for picking teemo (our team comp was mostly tanks, and teemo countered their top laner) for the entire select menu, and 24 minutes of the game I finally said \"STFU braum you suck\" and after that encouraged people to report him (the tactic I was testing, again remember that out of 30+ trolls on my list not a single one has ever been punished and they are the worst of the worst).  Instead of him getting punished I GOT PUNISHED.  \n\nRiots system doesn't seem to punish trolls it punishes the ones who get trolled.  Now despite years of seeing riot have a week or three where they mention player behavior and seeing them come up short and ignore everyone about PB and ignore the entire PB section of forum I find I still have a shred of optimism, but it is a bit over shadowed with my wrath fro being punished in an attempt to help riot finally single a troll out.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2014-12-18T22:36:53.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why a new tribunal is going to be in place.

For trying to help I lost all my rewards for the entire year...  \n\nAs far as strictness; I was considered negative for around 4 to 6 games and harshly punished... I think they might be a little overly strict, at least with the Mild offenders.  Though the Worst of the Worst have never had a gap in their game play.\n\nI was optimistic but after losing a years worth of rewards for trying to help riot, (I have over 30+ of the worst trolls in the game on a list that I monitor to see if they are ever punished and not a single one ever has been.  FYI; 2 are RL death threats, 2 spent about 30 minutes trying to get my teammate to kill himself in RL, one said \"all military are fa ggots\" and spammed \"fa ggot\" all game long, Many spammed things like \"eat a di ck fa ggot\", or \"you're a worthless ni gger\" all game long, many did all that while feeding 30 deaths, and one was feeding and telling the enemy team what we were doing in all chat.  Not a Single One has EVER been punished) \n\nI figured riot had issues finding them so I started to encourage players to use the report button since I'd noticed many people just never used it.  (had one guy troll our champ select as last pick refused to support and picked a second top laner {pretty common I know} The team asked if I could support mundo so the troll could top lane and I said\" I would if they all reported him after the game\" and they all agreed.  After the game which we won because I not only got my adc fed in lane I got fed well enough to do my job as a tank [which was good because the troll died often, lost his turret early, and just trolled] and hands down I was why we over came the troll and won... in the end menu all but one person on my team left immediately without reporting the troll.  The one that was there who I reminded to report the troll said \"why report him we won\"... there was more to the conversation after that but the summary is he refused to report the guy who trolled us all game and the rest didn't bother either)  \n\nI've seen this community get worse and worse every year in the exact ways I predicted and warned riot about.  I've given dozens of ideas to combat trolls, all of which were ignored, I've posted hundreds of times trying to talk about how to help the games community get better, all ignored.  I remember when I'd first see people claim that LoL had the worse community of all on-line games years ago and people would deny it and harass the guy a bit.  No one denies it anymore.  LoL is the 4chan of the gaming world \"trolling on 4chan is like pissing in an ocean of piss\" and it's the same here on LoL.  \n\nMaybe riot did finally realize they have a problem, but I've seen them do a little show like this every year since I started playing and every year it's just talk and no real action.  So my optimism is a bit lacking.  Especially in light of there recent attempt hitting looks like a blanket wave of punishments with no regard to justice, as a scary show (which I've seen happen before in other venues and always leads to nothing afterwards).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SerBlaise","date":"2014-12-16T15:41:44.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree this part needs clarification.
