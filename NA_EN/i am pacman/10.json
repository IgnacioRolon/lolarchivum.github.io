They have wanted to promote gameplay with friends ever since season 5 and since then the power of solo carries has gone (If a single person gets caught out now you give up sooo much map pressure until you are 5 again), team objectives have gone up, we got dynamic que (which don't get me wrong I enjoyed with friends but as a solo experience it might as well been hell), first tower blood along with a plethora of other changes designed to make the game more team oriented. As a result the game has become more toxic among solo players and just meh among friends.\r\n\r\nRemember when every game felt different? When there was a trio of team comps for teamfights that kinda worked like rock, paper, scissors? Poke, engage, and wombo combo. You could have a little of all, or two, or invest heavily in a single comp and you knew your win condition. On top of that there were other strategies like splitpushing and seiging instead of fighting.\r\n\r\nNow EVERY game feels the exact same. People do so much damage that a single poke champion is enough to be the old poke comp, a single engage is enough to be a wombo combo since people blow up instantly anyways. Splitpushing is pretty much part of most games but it falls off pretty fast since the mid game disappeared.  \r\n\r\nI loved this game. I played way to many games a day and tbh I still would be playing if I could bring myself to look forward to each game. Now I look at the champ select and it doesn't even matter what champions are on either team. They game will play out the same way regardless of who gets the lead.\r\n\r\nThis game used to be about the overall strategy of your team mixed with the tactics of teamfights and rotations. Now is all just fast paced tactics with none of the strategy I used to love.\r\n\r\nSo yeah I still play it with friends but it will never compel me to properly learn (read main) new champions and buy their upcoming skins anymore. It will never compel me to play just one more game after a tilting loss and it will never again compel me to get on immediately when I have free time.  \r\n\r\nI may just be burnt out but I played perfectly fine with plenty of enthusiasm since season 2. I feel like the current nature of the game is what burnt me out.  Correct me if I am wrong Riot since you have the data but If that is true Riot then the playtime of older players is going down significantly as they lose interest and close their accounts (especially if they don't have many friends that play this game) and turnover rate of new players is going to go up significantly over the next couple seasons compared to previous.  \r\n\r\nI would really like to hear your thoughts on this matter boards and Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-12-27T16:07:10.336+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel this criticism resonates especially strongly with me because I too feel League has lost a fair bit of strategic and even tactical gameplay over time. Even at a time where various different marksmen like Miss Fortune (the ultimate wombo combo ADC) and Ezreal (a top-tier poke marksman) are viable at the same time, there doesn't really seem to be as much of an emphasis on the unique strengths of these champions, and how well they fit in with their whole team. Rather, the success of a game tends to boil down to whichever bot lane has the lead, and fights tend to be determined by whoever can successfully throw all of their stuff at their opponent within the first few seconds, while taking as little damage themselves as possible.\n\nThe fact that these exciting points in the game last only a few seconds, and are usually followed by lengthy periods of forced inactivity (i.e. respawn timers, backing and returning to lane, etc.), I think tends to increase frustration and decrease overall enjoyment, while also making the game's balancing environment particularly brittle: getting killed or chunked without having the proper opportunity to fight back I think will always feel like bullshit, but it also means that whichever champion that inflicted that gets put under much heavier scrutiny. We joke here about how literally every champion in the game is toxic according to the Boards, but I do believe a part of that comes from a balancing environment that is so unstable, due to the high amounts of damage and snowballing, that almost any champion can go off the rails and lose most of their counterplay in the process, all while feeling less pleasant to play against than they should even when they're not ahead.\n\nBecause losing a particular interaction with a champion can precipitate so quickly into a death, I also feel this may be one of the most new player-unfriendly environments in League's history. Complexity has never been higher, new players are still given learning tools that are either insufficient or downright counterproductive, and gameplay is now more punishing than ever before, precisely because losing a fight can put you so far behind your opponent. Because good strategy and tactics end up having less of an impact compared to earning raw statistical advantages early on, there are fewer avenues to recover from lost fights, and thereby fewer options for everyone. One common criticism of players who complain is that they don't know how to outplay specific champions, but in a healthy environment, 1v1 or 2v2 outplay potential should be just one out of several determining factors of success, rather than the make-or-break for an entire match. I think League has tremendous potential for rich tactical and strategic gameplay, one where no match would truly be the same. As it stands, though, we're currently stuck with a rigid compositional meta that hasn't changed much for the past 7 or 8 years, and a balancing environment that has itself become increasingly brittle since Preseason 6. Since then, League's changes have pushed the game into a much more snowbally, damage-heavy, and therefore much more mechanically intensive state, at the cost of all of its other aspects.","replies":[{"poster":"Krij33n","date":"2017-12-27T21:43:37.301+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Left the game like a week after Pre-season hit because it felt as though the game just took a turn and went down the drain, as game lasted like 15 mins, before the surrender was hit, people wont even try to make a comeback, because the new runes are so broken, that if you have a good comboing champion with the right runes, that champions 1 v 5's the opponent and rekts them , GG league, time to head back to dota, it was fun while it lasted {{champion:103}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2017-12-28T09:56:27.350+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly was thinking all this snowballing talk was just people complaining just to complain, but yeah... this is a really well worded way of putting it... and I feel it. I started around preseaon 6 and well, champions that didn't used to do much of any damage and were well... supports, or tanks; now end up doing highest damage some games. \n\nI liked that I could play Alistar and only do a little bit of damage, but contributed by locking down a single target. I liked how all my lanes could be losing while I jungled, but I could still pull my team out a win because I farmed up for late game, played objectives, and vision game. I used to be able to joke that Janna does no damage, but be completely okay with it because she didnt need to. By the time Rakan came out I was mad that he did so little damage, I didn't want him as my support; that;s how much the game has damage creeped, and I didn't even realize it until new runes hit. \n\nNew runes just accentuated the existing problem. So many are damage focused, and there are few that offer utility. Sure Inspiration offers utility, but too much of it is niche. Tanks have turned into fighters, fighters have turned into divers, and divers are building assassin now. Cooldown's are all incredibly low, and champions are all being balanced on damage output instead of their other strengths like mobility or crowd control. I can build a full tank Mundo and do more damage than the enemy's fed Veigar by the end of the game. \n\nWhen I started counter-jungling was viable, the jungler farming for late game was viable, early game lasted longer, the transition from early to mid to late was very pronounced, and it wasn't all about who can gank the most lanes as quickly as possible. It wasn't advisable to team fight all the time when I started, you were encouraged by experienced teammates to keep team fights to a minimum. If you got ganked you could safely stay under tower, and all they could do was poke your tower while they got poked by you from under it; and they would need 2 more people than you had under tower to safely dive it. \n\nNow junglers are just gank-bots, you sometimes don't take dragon for several minutes just to gank more it seems. Any champion can now tower dive a low health enemy and burst them while getting out alive. I don't remember the last time I saw a tower dive fail to get a kill at least. Everyone can burst like an old assassin, but assassin's aren't allowed to do that without dying in the process. There no longer seems to be a distinction between sustained fight champions, burst champions, poke champions, supports, and tanks. Zyra isn't a lane bully support anymore, she's just another damaging support, with less CC. \n\nHaving come to realize this... it's really disheartening.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kasumi Midou","date":"2017-12-27T15:23:45.403+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":2,"body":"no you are not burned out. this is the state of the game now. overtuned to motivate casuals to also do their \"big plays\"","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-12-27T18:58:37.850+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"As one of those casuals, I despise the overall direction the game has been going in.","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2017-12-27T21:05:53.849+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you are one of the few.

Item variety is a great thing, it allows players to customize their experience and play a champion to their brand of playstyle. It may not always be the most effective way to play said champ, but in most cases, a player who is well-experienced in their champion can still make a pretty decent game of a quirky build. \nBack to the point, they've gone overboard with damage, and it's why you see tons of posts claiming that bot lane is the decider of game wins. In general, there aren't good ol' fashioned brawls like there were in early seasons. Has anyone else been around long enough to remember the original Twisted Treeline? League of Bruisers. That was quite literally the only thing you could play that lived long enough to withstand the long drawn-out battles that required planning and teamwork. You had fights that lasted long enough for some people to use their ultimate TWICE before the fight was over. Now people are able to engage a fight, button mash, and the other person is dead. There's no reaction time, no back and forth. Just BOOM, do WAY too much damage in 1 fell swoop and the fight's over. Follow the progression of items and you'll see what they've done.\n\nSeason 1- Heart of gold / Regrowth pendant / Force of Nature/ WOTA/ Malady/ DFG/ old Wit's End/ Mana Shroud\nThese were items that you could buy and use them for what they were; strategic advantages. They all came with drawbacks. (Heart of gold didn't build into anything. It was just a little bit of health, but you got gold in return for the inconvenience. Regrowth pendant gave no stats other than health regen.) These items slowed the pace of the game by lowering the overall amount of damage you did so that you had to focus more on strategy in terms of how much poke you could take, how long it takes to recover from them, and how long you can keep your opponent stalled to let your jungler get in place to help gank for you. You could quite literally do math in your head as to how much punishment you could take before it was time to back. \nAs to the other items I listed above, they were specialized. Hardly anyone besides Kog and Teemo used Malady because it was a strategic item that didn't fit into the cookie-cutter build design.\n\nI didn't follow the exact progression of items season-by-season, so I'm not going to attempt to break them down 1 by 1, we're just going to fast forward to where we are today.\n\nSeason 7- Now we've got items that are combination of old ones that used to be separated so that you had to plan what type of role you were playing. Now you get the best of both worlds, but the results are far from balanced. The main demonstrative items are:\n\n**Mortal Reminder**- Last whisper and Executioner's Calling USED to be separate items. You had to prioritize which kind of playstyle you wanted. You could deny an enemy healing, or you could go penetration to keep tanks from steamrolling you. NOW, you get both, which is a huge problem. Now you can not only deny enemies from healing, but you can significantly diminish their attempts to buy a defensive item to help their survivability. You have a dual-purpose item that gives far too much power.\n**Thornmail-** This now gives health, attack slow, damage reflection, AND grievous wounds.... Why do you think that is? Because everything else is hitting WAY to f'king hard. It's a testament to how fk'ed damage output has gotten. Thornmail used to be a last-ditch effort type of item only used regularly by Rammus, Shen, and Mundo to deal with an over-fed ADC or Trynd. It used to be just 100 armor and damage reflection. Now it's gotta have 4 different properties just to keep up.\n**Phantom Dancer**- I'm sure you remember the old big advantage of PD right? Yup, you got to ignore unit collision. What does it do now? It reduces the physical damage done to you by the last champion you AA'd by 12%!!!! TWELVE PERCENT... That was a privilege that only Urgot used to get, because he was so out-maneuvered by 99% of these new high-utility champions that he couldn't keep up. Why 12%? Because even the now hyper-damage ADC's are doing too much damage for their own good. Now we need to reduce the amount of damage the enemy is doing by killing it by 1/8th without ANY thought to buying defensive items. I'll go out on a limb and say that the only Melee AD champs that uses PD reliably is Trynd, so this is mostly an ADC item now. \n**Blade of the Ruined King**- This one's just been a headache since its inception. %hp damage should NOT be available to everyone. Especially when you've got champs that ALREADY HAVE %hp damage built into their kits (Vayne, Kog). There's a reason they're hyper-carries. The active slow, active move speed steal, lifesteal, attack speed, and attack damage are enough. You don't need an item that has 6 attributes. That's too many, far too much power in 1 item.\n\nYes, these are mostly AD/ADC related items, but that's in response to the above mention of bot lanes carrying games too much. Okay, now take an ADC that has Mortal Reminder, PD, AND BotRK, you've now got an over-tuned killing machine that has the power to shutdown healers, tanks, mages, other ADC's, bruisers. There's enough attributes in those 3 items to account for 12 individual items. Now, half the time an ADC can 3-4 shot a mid mage or support champ if they've got the element of surprise or a half-decent peel. \n\nIt used to take skill to blow up an enemy champion. You had to have teamwork, and it took a hell of a lot longer than 1.2 seconds to delete someone. Now, these ADC's on steroids just walk up and 3 shot you. There's no fun in it. It's no longer a risk-reward type system, it's a \"Whoever right-clicks and button mashes the fastest wins\" system. \n\nAs for the new 'Rune System', this just amplifies the problem. Oh, the ADC is fed AF, has all these over-tuned items, and can already 3 shot half the team? Cool, let's give them a Rune that let's them shoot EVEN FASTER. Ya, fk it, let them attack 4 times a second, what could go wrong? \nWhy do the new 'Runes' have to give damaging effects? The old masteries were damn near perfect. Slightly underwhelming stat-wise, but they allowed you to choose your path and allowed you to play within it by shaping the ATTRIBUTES of your champion, not how much extra unnecessary bonus damage they do. The items now shape the attributes of your champions, and the \"runes\" just add extra damage to make up what new players and normies lack in skill. Oh, you landed a skillshot? Dude nice job! You're MOST LIKELY gonna miss the next one, so let's shoot a meteor at the enemy to add a little bit of extra damage in there just in case you DO suck. Oh, you can't plan ganks in advance and use the Ghost summoner spell properly? Let's give you a dope built-in boost with some extra on-hit damage so that just on the off-chance that you DO manage to pull off some half-assed gank attempt, you're probably still gonna do enough damage so as to not get disappointed or get your feelings hurt by your suckage.\nYou have to learn from your mistakes, not be rewarded by them. I learned the hard way. Either get good or get lost. If you can still wreck shit with half-assed and sloppy play, then the problem is not with you, it's with the platform. We need to smack baddies on the hand, not hold their hand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lit Corn","date":"2017-12-27T19:41:19.161+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I entirely agree , i keep playing solo Q but this is getting me mad tbh , i only play this game for its competitive aspect and great esports scene , but where the fuck is the competitiveness atm ? the real issue is that it isnt either really fun or competitive to play , which really sucks , since the goal of a game is to have both of them , or one of them but really well developped , s4-s5 = fun and competitive , s6/s7 = competitive ( but less fun , cause if you werent following the meta and everything you'd lose , but the overall balance was okay and you had clear win conditions / strategies ) but late s7 and beginning of s8 ... well the game is totally unbalanced there isnt really any strats , you cant try any special thing or you'll get totally stomped , its just like whoever gets the first kill on botside spam all what they have and end in 15 min with no counterplay .

It feels like farming for mid game doesn't exist anymore. I can last hit with 90% efficiency if I'm left to just farm on my own. But I usually get less than half of that in an actual game, just because I never get to catch my breath from all the fighting that happens. It's like farming post 6 doesn't exist anymore.\n\nAnd if I die more than twice, it's just game over for me. Farming at tower is just simply not an option. I have to just let them take it, because if the jungler shows up I just flat out die 100-0. There's almost no safety nets in this game anymore.\n\nOh but if I get some kills without dying, the game becomes almost too easy to just snowball out of control. 100-0 people left and right, get other lanes ahead because the other guy can't do anything.

It would work only on one language based server, imagine having to deal with people who barely speaks English there, on EUNE/EUW. You could hardly make something out of it. However, I believe it would reduce the toxicity of players.\n\n2.) Dragon used to give 150 gold team-wide and it was removed due to being it a significant boost to the team (dragon kill used to be a must-have. Nowadays if you get a sucky dragon there's no reason to fight for it and you just let it pass.). So now we have the first blood on towers, hell yeah, I really do enjoy 5 minutes long laning phase. \n\n3.) The overall gold increase ain't that much of an issue, you still have to do cs-ing and play for the objectives to get ahead. Imho, the support items are already strong enough. (When built right you can heal better as {{champion:76}} than {{champion:16}} LOL)\n\n4.) I agree, {{item:3147}} is a problem! And RIOT is well known for the nerfing CHAMPIONS instead of ITEMS that caused the problems in the first place. The runes are a chapter that speaks for itself, we will see what happens when the season starts.\n\n_Rather than to admit to it we are looking at a desperate attempts to create more problems to get us out of the problem that got us here in the first place; respectively introducing new items/mechanics/nerfs, than to actually fixing the problem~ the ultimate fix._","replies":[{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2017-12-28T18:51:44.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow someone on the boards that isn't a total headass.
