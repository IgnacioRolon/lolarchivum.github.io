Still no skin.\r\n\r\nNow this by itself doesn&#039;t bother me all that much because I understand riot is a business and illaoi as a champion has a pretty small niche of players.  Jhin and kindred are certainly going to be getting skins faster and more often by virtue of being popular champions. \r\n\r\nWhat does irk me is that zero mention of a upcoming skin at all and the fact that Zyra is now getting a new skin. (check it out here http://www.surrenderat20.net/2017/02/pbe-preview-dragonslayer-xin-zhao-and.html it looks amazing)\r\n\r\nSure zyra is popular and is being played in competative (so is illaoi now lol, she just got played in EU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I0SdVpT6dM&amp;t=43s games are in description)  but even Riot has stated how notoriously laborious it is to make a skin for zyra.  She now has 2 great skins.  \r\n\r\nCan we use half that zyra skin team make some chromas for Illaoi?  \r\n\r\nTL;DR  Hey Riot, some info on a new illaoi skin or chromas would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"DiscoVinzan","date":"2017-02-23T10:46:47.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If possible, some update on these guys' skins too {{champion:136}} {{champion:83}}","replies":[]}]}
