However I didn&#039;t buy 7/8 of those goddamn icons because I wanted to. I did it because in order to get the ONE taric Icon I had to spend 17500 BE instead of 2500 BE.   Hell if they were separate I&#039;m sure they would cost double so lets just say 5000 BE. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t really care about the BE since I have so much still it doesn&#039;t matter.  I just don&#039;t want you to misinterpret my willingness to buy 7 icons to get one as me being satisfied with my purchase or how you went about selling me it.  Obviously I understand that since this tactic worked (and it worked on me) that we will be seeing more shit like this in the future (not being able to buy the single product we desire but lottery style buying it and hoping).\r\n\r\nThoughts? Did you buy them all because you liked them or because you only wanted a specific one?","replies":[]}
