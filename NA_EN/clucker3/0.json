He is much better as I am b5 and I said I usually go about 17/3 but other lanes get fed and we loose anyway. He recommended going top if we get first turret and having too go bot. Is there any basis to that?","replies":[{"poster":"Branagen","date":"2016-10-26T01:58:37.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I'm in that situation where the rest of the team is struggling, I continue to pressure bot to second turret with good warding and often let the support go help the jg gank mid and top to bring it around. This gives you better map control for dragon also.\n\nIf the enemy team doesn't react to pressure against bot lane, they lose turret, if they do react it takes pressure off of mid and top.\n\nEssentially if you're a good adc and can play smart, when you're losing a 5v5 even match, you turn it into 4v2 and 4v3 everywhere else on the map, all the while jacking up your cs so when it does come time to group and get drag you're ahead.\n\nOnce you have enough items and are feeling confident with your power, you can start taking control of objectives like drag and towers.\n\nIf you run around right away after getting bot turret, you'll waste farming time and not be strong enough to make an impact vs enemy lanes that are winning vs your team, you'll just set yourself and everyone else back by giving up cs and splitting experience, ending in a gg before 20 minutes hits.","replies":[{"poster":"ViiLLAiN","date":"2016-10-26T02:10:48.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thjis is all with the hope that ur team is actually pushing their lanes while u push to tier 2 also i find this alot harder to do now with how mobile champs are","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cannoli Virus","date":"2016-10-26T02:04:05.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but the top doesn't go bot.\n\nThe point is to force pressure on toplane since you already won bot lane, in order to get top's first tower.\n\nYou can then rotate to mid as 5 and pressure mid tower or dragon. Since you now won two lanes, a 5v5 is favorable for your team.\n\nWhat Llama is referring to as \"misunderstood echo of an old high-level strategy\" is lane-swapping, but he actually doesn't understand what lane swapping is since it doesn't match what you're talking about, so ignore his comment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-26T02:00:16.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Absolutely none. that is just a misunderstood echo of an old high-level strategy that no longer works or has a purpose.\nIt takes meta about 6 months to filter down to bronze, at which point most of it no longer means anything important.","replies":[]}]}
