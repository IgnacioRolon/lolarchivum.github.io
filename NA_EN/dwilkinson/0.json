Yea - i was harsh but when some players dont take a game srsly and troll - i will call them iditos and feeders and when they dont have common sense - it is so stupid took at chat from one palyer presctive and ban him - extremely stupid and unbeleiveable. look below - not a single curse word or even being toxic - point out to people to help and they responded flamming - i rpeorted - i ended up getting a ban - this tribunal is fixed riot. \r\n\r\nAnd best part is - people who support the system will acutally flame on the boards cursng people who banned and being toxic but that&#039;s alrighht cos u can be toxic to players riot deem toxic - if that&#039;s the case - i can be toxic to the idiots and feeders i play with and i shouldn&#039;t get banned. Lol - check urself riot and fix  it - the game is amazing but the way it is ran is extremely stupid and so silly. If people are so damn sesnsitive - i honestly don&#039; think they should be playing an online game and act stupid in it .Again, ever since you introduced that dmb syste, - you honestly ruined the game. Hell WOW has 10M players and no one flames (clean community) blizz didn&#039;t implement a tribunal system lol aka logic community will fix it self and it worked for them - you with this system aren&#039;t fixing anything just ruining the gmae cos 2% of people who vote arent&#039; even reading all of the chat and i know that for a fact - they just want the rewards......lamest system ever -

If they are truly being careless or taking dumb risks, I would point that out in the interest of helping them to get better, but err on the side of being conservative here. In my experience, players tend to think innocent mistakes are not innocent, or think that accidents could have trivially been prevented. I think we all expect more forgiveness as players than we are willing to give out to others.\n>\nThere is no excuse to harass anyone in League, period. Nothing someone can do in a game can justify you trying to use verbal (or spoken if they can hear you) language so harsh.

I know it just makes the game that much worse instead of better; once you accept that and make an honest effort to take the high road, your games will be much more enjoyable.\n\n> see problem is even talking and pointing people to things is now considered toxic lol - and that's the whole problem with this system - toxic is now defiend as simple as saying ''hello''\n\nNot remotely true.

Riot did away with that system a few seasons ago.  It has been replaced with the Instant Feedback System, which is an automated system that has absolutely zero bias.  It's free from the human error that skewed the original Tribunal system.  The IFS doesn't have the ability to be \"overly-sensitive\" or \"thin-skinned\" like a player would.  It's an evolving algorithm that learns what the overall community finds offensive, and makes judgments based on that.  \n\nAs far as your logs, your first game, I would have simply ignored you.  Nothing in it seems that bad to me, aside from some arguing with the Orianna, but Id have been irked if she hadn't called a MIA too.  It's the second and third games I would have been less likely to overlook.  They were a bit harsh, but you know that.  Hell, you said it yourself.  And it might have all been in response to trolling, but the thing is, the minute you unleash this kind of stuff on the trolls you are no longer the innocent victim.  You are the toxic player harassing the troll, and the innocent victims are the other people on your team who haven't done anything to either of you.  It's bad enough that they are getting trolled.  They shouldn't have to put up with this toxicity too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-03-25T00:31:38.405+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your chat logs are the very definition of toxic; you're griefing, arguing, punishing your teammates verbally for mistakes, etc.\n\nBan is deserved, let go of your ego and learn to have more humility.","replies":[{"poster":"Dwilkinson","date":"2017-03-25T00:37:41.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"I made a mistake - why you're being toxic to em ? pointing out ot me what to do ? i did that do - so your point is dumb as your anem is.

Are you seriously flaming people this much in normal games? Why are you freaking out over a normal? Normals are supposed to be the place where people can try out new builds or try out champions they aren't good on. Not everyone is a one trick like you.\n\nAlright, so there's two possibilities when someone does poorly on your team:\n1. They're a troll.\n2. They messed up / aren't good at the game.\n\nIf they're a troll then you flaming them is exactly what they want. Trolls want attention. They want to know that they're ruining your game. They're like children throwing a temper tantrum. The worst thing you can do is give them attention and let them know they're getting to you.\n\nIf they just messed up or they suck at the game why do you gotta rub it in and flame them? It makes no sense. When you make a mistake do you want people to tell you how much of an idiot you are? Does that make you play better? Like it or not you're on a team with these people. If you want to win then it's in your best interest to promoted team cohesion and unity rather than ripping the team apart. And if you don't care about winning then why flame in the first place?\n\nThis is why it's completely pointless to flame people and also why it's prohibited in league. And to be honest people don't report you because they're sensitive, they report you because they don't want to play with you or people like you. If you act like an asshole in real life people aren't going to want to associate with you and are going to ask you to leave. The report system is our way of ostricizing people who act disrespectfully to others and asking them to leave.","replies":[]}]}
