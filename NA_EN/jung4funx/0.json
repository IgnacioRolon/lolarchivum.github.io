My mid TF last minute changes to smite, then in-game says &quot;korean tf mid strat. I&#039;ll take their wraiths and get ahead&quot; .. I knew he was going to be useless but I said sure dude do your thing and was supportive. From there he randomly leaves lane to take my scuttle bot side as I run into their JG top. Which in turn makes mid rotate onto me too while he&#039;s too busy taking a free scuttle that should have been left alone for later or simply warded. From there I&#039;m berated with all sorts of colorful language, told I&#039;m trash, and I&#039;m the reason we lost. Gee, I couldn&#039;t be the pro korean strat or the fact that he kept going into our side jungle entirely messing up my pattern ...\r\n\r\nSometimes I think I ask for it when I come back to this game on a new account ..
