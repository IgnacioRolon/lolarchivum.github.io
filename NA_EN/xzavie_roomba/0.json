The Space and Enter keys are two examples since they are commonly used when typing messages in chat.\n\nYou can still level up abilities on the fly by pressing Ctrl+Q/W/E/R.  I know it may not seem as seamless as using the spacebar, but you can still level up abilities extremely quickly once you get used to it.\n\nHope that helps!  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Xzavie Roomba","date":"2017-08-24T23:15:29.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay at least there's a reason thanks for the answer.","replies":[]}]}]}
