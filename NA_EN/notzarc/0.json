While your keyboard might work on other rigs, I'd suggest trying another keyboard on the PC that's not responding.  I suggest going over our [keyboard issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues) guide to help get this fixed up as your first step.\n\nAdditionally, this could also happen if you've been modifying game files.  If that's the case, your best bet would be to download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and run a clean reinstall for a fresh client.
