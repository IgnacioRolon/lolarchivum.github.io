But I am not going to bring them to ranked untill I am comfortable with my skill with them in normals before I bring them to ranked. Is it fair to my team to keep down voteing the surender when I am trying to practice my champ? ( a side note, it takes 4 to surender so my 1 vote doesnt lock in my hole team to the game..... second I never surender a game even if we will lose.... third when I say practice I dont mean never played champ before and bring to normals.... I learn champ in bot mode.) Is it fair to the rest of my team if I do this? ( oh and I am not feeding the team...)","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-03-14T16:28:55.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're well within your right to vote as you please.
