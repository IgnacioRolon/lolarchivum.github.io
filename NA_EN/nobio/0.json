Can we at least get a Riot employee to make an enquiry post so we can maybe narrow down the culprit of this bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T21:39:20.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of anything specific, or some kind of widespread fps issue.  We're regularly having patches and a lot of players are updating to the new client, so it's possible that some game files are getting corrupt along the way.  There could also be driver or specific video card issues too, but I don't really know for sure.  This is why we regularly ask players to go through the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to help rule out possibilities.  If there is something major going on, sending in those [tickets](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us are super important for tracking emerging issues.  \n\nFPS and connection issues are pretty common, so hit us up in a ticket and we'll see if there's more to it.

There are more than a dozen threads discussing this specific issue in detail. If I have to gather links for each thread on this specific issue then I can. But to say this is an isolated incident, or riot isn't aware of this problem regarding the new client and fps loss, would be the furthest thing from the truth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chaosmonkey691","date":"2017-05-07T04:17:12.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT YOU MUST MAKE FIDGET SPINNER GAREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n{{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:86}}","replies":[]}]}]}
