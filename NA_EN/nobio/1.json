I have played very little League in the last 4 months because I (among others) have had the worst FPS, 5-10 during games. I have submitted 3 separate tickets and nothing has helped. I keep hoping that I can come back after a new patch and the problem will be resolved, but here we are almost 8 patches later and nothing has been done.. I'm about ready to quit League for good because it is simply unplayable atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T04:39:17.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Over the course of patches, certain parts of the game might get updated that would require some driver updates as well. Double check the steps in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) while making sure to catch any missed driver updates. If you've recently updated Windows 10 let's also make sure that the Xbox Game DVR isn't turned on again.","replies":[{"poster":"Nobio","date":"2017-07-16T05:03:43.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, should have specified that I'm on Mac.","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-16T06:54:50.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A macbook?

I can play other, more graphically intensive games fine, fps is no problem. League is the only game that this happens on. Before I was having problems I was getting a constant 50-60 fps. Now it's close to unplayable, it's not like there has been a huge graphics update since the beginning of the season either.","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-17T00:02:13.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont know what else to tell you, you are running on outdated sub par hardware. Apple produces overpriced and a generation old hardware every year consistently. The benchmarks on your mechanical hard drive and Intel GFX card that uses shared system ram arent too high.\n\nedit: Intel HD 3000 has 64 MB of video ram. The rest is pulled from slow system ram on a bus that was outdated before it was installed in 2010/2011 in that laptop. Modern graphics card has 2GB plus minimum... which means apple forgot to install about 1984MB of ram into your laptop.","replies":[{"poster":"Nobio","date":"2017-07-17T00:43:43.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League isn't a graphically intense game by any means. Like I said before other games work perfectly fine.\n\nAlso Intel HD 3000 has 512mb of vRAM.\n\nI know I don't have a gaming rig and my laptop is pretty aged, but it should easily be able to run League. One patch was completely fine, the next I was getting frame drops at 5-20 fps.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2017-07-16T22:33:31.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The word mac is what's wrong with your sentence","replies":[{"poster":"Nobio","date":"2017-07-16T23:00:30.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How original -_-","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2017-07-17T00:02:59.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothin wrong with macs as a whole, I use one for uni work. But they just ain't built for the purpose of games. So I've got a beast sitting at home which obliterates any game I'd ever want to play.\n\n\nOne thing I'd recommend is \"glary utilities\". It's a pc cleanup which may improve ur farms slightly by getting rid of excess temp data from ur browser.\nApart from that idk what else you could do mac wise. You could make yourself a hackintosh (basically a beast PC running on apple OS)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
