Another reason they don't could be, that players will yell at them for replying to one post and not another, then scream that they are being ignored. \nRioters are still people, and a lot of people don't like being yelled at. \n\nNow skins, they do not have as many bugs as other features, so katey has less to go through and can spend more time responding to posts. But she has said in the past, they all make sure bugs are known. If she sees a bug report for something that isn't a skin, and the team working on that feature needs to be aware of it, she will let them know its there.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-02T03:56:42.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!
