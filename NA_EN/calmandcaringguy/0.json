Tbh vs plats and diamonds I have a bit of a hard time as well, but if you pay attention to what they are doing you can generally learn and then play better in the long run. So yes, you will likely get smashed if you are actually new.... or if you are not as good as they are period.... but you will learn how to play better if you choose to.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
