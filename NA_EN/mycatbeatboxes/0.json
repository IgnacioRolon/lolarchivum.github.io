I am a new girl looking to get better at league! I got such great game advice that i now want to practice what i learned! However i just realized I dont have a champ to practice with! I have tons of IP and RP because my fiancee wants me to get anything i need! I would love some advice and thoughts on **who to buy!**!! My preferences are below but im open to ideas outside what i put!!! **Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! **\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**My ideas on who i think i would play best as:** (keep in mind i am only level 7 so i need a champion who is not extremely difficult to learn the strategy if possible)\r\n\r\n* I think i prefer a ranged champ that way i can hang back and turret hug a little while still doing damage. I don't know how well i would do with a tank because im nervous about diving into the heat of the battle!\r\n* I like mid because it allows me some solo time to not worry about jacking kills or screwing someone on my team over. I have played annie and i like her but i want to try something new. I also like that Mid is usually ranged mages. ( i dont know if mage is the right word)\r\n* I like bot adc because i really really like playing high damage champs. Also they tend to be not to malee\r\n* I dont really want to do support because it seems really confusing. I would hate to accidentally steal a cs, kill, or to not support correctly and have my adc die.\r\n* I really like high damge champs\r\n* I like how an assasin sounds \r\n* I dont know how to jungle at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain thank you!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Fairy Flan","date":"2015-03-04T20:03:41.264+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"These would be my suggestions for mids based on your preferences listed :)\n\n{{champion:134}}  Syndra  (AP Mid)\n{{champion:99}}  Lux  (AP Mid)\n{{champion:115}}  Ziggs  (AP Mid)\n{{champion:143}}  Zyra  (AP Mid)","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-03-04T20:17:46.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"Hate to burst your bubble, but 3/4 of those suggestions are in an underpowered state ever since the mana regen nerfs (Zyra is the only one who came out of it relatively unscathed).

His passive also allows you to still attack enemies even if you die.  \n\n{{champion:161}}: Vel'Koz is pretty simple and fun, the goal is to hit them with abilities as often as possible and most of his abilities are fairly easy to hit.   \n\n{{champion:51}}: Caitlyn is a AD Marksmen who is pretty easy to understand and use, her long range and damage make her a really strong pick against most opponents. She also happens to be the only ADC i actually play (I dont use Marksmen all that much.)  \n\n{{champion:236}}: Lucian is my second favorite Marksmen, im not all that great with him but he is just loads of fun to play. His Q and Passive are my favorite things about him but his Ultimate is also incredibly fun.  \n  \n{{champion:15}}: Sivir is a good learning AD Marksmen as well as a strong champion. She is somewhat easy to understand and has very interesting mechanics.\n \nThese are just a few in addition to some of the others that were recommended here. I would like to add that you should try to buy Champions with IP and Skins with RP. If you want a really expensive Champion (the 6300 IP ones, maybe 4800 IP ones) then buying them with RP is fine, but i definitely wouldn't use RP on cheaper Champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thresh Outta Fux","date":"2015-03-04T22:52:31.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surprised that Quinn {{champion:133}} isn't listed.\n\nShe's pretty fun, not overpowered, and requires some thought and skill to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-03-04T22:50:01.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're just starting out, I would really take advantage of the free rotation (or ask if you can test out some champions on your fiancee's account in a custom game; I don't *think* you can get in trouble for this kind of 'account sharing' since you're not playing with/vs human players, but maybe you should double check); play every single champion you haven't played before, and as you get better at the game and start to learn more, play them again. If you're nervous about playing vs real people, you can always just play vs bots or even just load them into a custom game to try them out for a few levels and get a sense of how they work. You might run into some champions you don't like, and that's fine; playing different champions also gives you insight on how those champions work and how to play against them. Overall my suggestion would be to try every champion you can or seem interested in, even if you only go into a custom game and test out their abilities for 5 minutes before figuring out you don't like them.\n\nRiotNurseFlan has some great suggestions for longer ranged mages (I would also add Xerath, Malzahar, and Vel'Koz to the list), but I would suggest you stay closer to Lux, Ziggs, Malzahar, or Vel'Koz (maybe Xerath too; in terms of just controlling him as a character he isn't too bad, but he can be tricky in the absolute highest levels of play), as Zyra and Syndra can be a bit more complicated.\n\nYou can also try Morgana; she and Annie are pretty easy to pick up and are my go-to mages at the moment (I'm really buckling down and focusing on my fundamentals, so I'm choosing very simple champions to play). Ryze and Veigar are also pretty straightforward to pick up, though they're in the process of being changed by Riot so I would wait a few patches to really start picking them up. Heimerdinger is also an option, he creates his own turrets so you can stick close to them, lol.\n\nFor ADCs, Jinx is a great champion, fairly straightforward to pick up, and has great range and damage. Caitlyn, Varus, and Ashe are also good champions to learn ADC and have among the longer ranges in the game.\n\nAssassins are pretty complicated, and even if you're ranged you usually have to learn how to get in the middle of a fight. I feel like Talon and Akali are among the easier assassins to pick up and play, though, similar to Veigar and Ryze, Akali is kind of in a weird spot I think since Riot is still figuring out how they want to change her.\n\nSince you're only level 7, I would recommend you just have fun with the game, I don't think there's a real urgent need for you to start running drills in custom games like I'm doing just yet. Unless you have ridiculous amounts of IP/RP to burn on champions (also would recommend you use IP to buy champions unless you don't have the time to grind up IP to buy them; in which case *I believe* the starter bundles Riot offers are actually more efficient in terms of RP, though you might want to double check on that. Also note that you can get Alistar, Tristana, and Garen for free by following their Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter, if you haven't already done so), I would recommend you try a champion out on free rotation or on a friend's account (again, don't think you'll get in trouble if it's just in a custom, but I might double check if I were you) before you buy them; I've made a few purchases I ended up regretting, and you only get 3 refund credits per account for life. Best of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-03-04T21:10:04.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got some advice, I'll add more.\n\nFirst, don't worry about jungling until you are level 10 and get use the Smite summoner spell.  Without it jungling would be very unfun.\n\nNo for mid, you got some good advice, but I'll add my thoughts.\n{{champion:103}} Ahri - very popular recently,  She's not really an assassin, but can be very powerful.  She's a bit tricky to learn due to her dash abilities, but will never be a terrible choice.\n\n{{champion:268}} Azir - he was very good until a recent patch took away some of his damage.  He can play relatively safe, but he's a bit tricky as he summons sand soldiers to fight for him.  I've played with a good one and he was impressive.\n\n{{champion:7}} Leblance - Mage/Assassin.  She's one of the champions many people say the hate to play against, but that's because if she gets a few kills she tends to steamroll the enemy team.  I can't say much more as I've never played her, but I've seen some good ones.\n\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:25}} Lux and Morgana - Two very good mages that I put here together because in some ways they are very similar.  Lux has a better ultimate ability in my opinion and is considered the more natural midlane mage.  Morgana however is great at \"farming\" for CS and can also play as support thanks to having the ability to stun an enemy champ.  \n\n{{champion:76}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:134}}  - These are all good champs.  However, I do not recommend them for new players.  Nidalee has 2 forms (human/cougar) and can be difficult to pickup.  Syndra is another hard to play champ as she requires that you pay attention to the number of dark spheres in play.  Cassiopeia powers up by poisoning the enemy champs, but is also not very mobile and is extremely mana-hungry.  Orianna is another one where you have an item you manipulate with your abilities.  She's fairly safe during the laning phase, but it can be difficult to direct her toy properly.\n\n{{champion:115}}  Ziggs - the mad bomber who reminds me of Crazy Harry from the Muppets.  He's fun to have on your team, but is another mana hungry and squishy champion.\n\n{{champion:101}} {{champion:161}}  - Xerath and Vel'Koz - good solid champs.  Not amazing, but not too difficult to learn to play.\n\n{{champion:45}} Veigar - a recent change to his E ability has a lot of people upset as it made it much more difficult for him to stun enemy champs, but he's still a mage who can do a lot of damage to an enemy team.  But he's also often a primary target for the enemy team to kill.\n\n{{champion:143}} Zyra - I play her as support.  She doesn't really have the ability to put out enough damage to excel in the midlane.  I don't recommend her as a first choice.\n\n--\nAlso I see you worry about stealing kills or failing as support.  That mostly depends on teammates.  Most good ADCs aren't going to complain if you end up getting a finishing shot occasionally, especially if you keep them alive.  Any many of the better ranges supports are all about poking the other teams champs while the ADC tries to kill minions, so it can be fun.  It can also be boring if your ADC is going to hug the turret.  I still recommend it as a way to learn more about how an ADC works, as you can watch one.\n\n--\n\nFinally, although there are a lot of mages that go mid there are also melee assassins like Zed and Katarina.  They usually will win that 1v1 unless you have practiced.  Don't get too down on yourself if it does happen.  Those two champs need to \"snowball\" to be effective late game so people play them very aggressively in order to try to get kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2015-03-04T21:09:01.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an ugly(acnes T_T) little girl and I don't have a rank(muh toxicity), but you can add me if you want :) I mainly play jungler/support/AP mage mid.\n\nSome supports' job is also poking from a distance {{champion:43}} {{champion:37}}{{champion:267}} \nFor AP mids, the current meta favors {{champion:69}}(kinda hard but rewarding) {{champion:7}}(this is hard too) {{champion:101}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:76}} (those 3 require skillshot presence)\nFor ADCs, the beginner's choices are {{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:21}} *I suck at this role, those ppl I listed are community's favourites*\n\n**All assasins are melee except LeBlanc and Nidalee**\n\nAlso, you can play some mages at toplane {{champion:117}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:50}} Their job is the same as other mages at midlane.\n\nFor supports, I steal kills a lot :D There's no problem.
