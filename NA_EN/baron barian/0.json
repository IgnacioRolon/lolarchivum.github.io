I was facing no internet connection whatsoever. So I started up League again, and for the first time, the client made no effort to let me get back into the game that I was disconnected from. And of course it was during the first game in a while where I had a competent ADC.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing this, the game seemed to have been suffering from \"server side player preference\", and I'm really not sure if that has an effect on the issue at all. I've always been a good noodle and I just don't want to worry about someone reporting me for leaving the game, even though the game itself won't let me back in it, even though I can apparently start up a new game.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas there something stupid I did, or is there just something I can do to prevent this from happening again?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-17T00:32:37.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally speaking if the client doesn't let you reconnect it means one of two things: the game ended, or everyone disconnected at the same time and the server cancelled the game. If this is rare, you have nothing to worry about :)","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2017-10-17T00:51:52.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose it was the latter, because the weirdest thing about it is that my match history didn't even document the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oldkingcoal","date":"2017-10-17T08:38:10.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it similar to this issue?
