Yesterday my client had to update due to the old client being retired. After I updated it, it sent me back to NA with no downloading required to play, so switched the region back to EUNE and now its downloaded 13g's of data? I don't get it, I just played a game in EUNE 3 days ago. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T01:29:58.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like each time you switch regions, the patcher decides it needs to redownload that data. Now that you've switched to EUNE and updated, you should be good to go. If that patcher keeps trying to make you update, hit me back up and we may need to look into what's going on with those game files.","replies":[{"poster":"ShedZz","date":"2017-05-10T01:49:41.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please I took the game from my friend and it's updated put when i tried to run the client on my computer it want to download 13gb of data even though I took the full installed and updated game from my friend .. what should I do ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niallina","date":"2017-05-08T17:05:51.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I got the same problem I had to reinstall league which took 2 hours.
