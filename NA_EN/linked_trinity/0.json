I am at 93 points (I've been working and just recently found time to put myself back in the lol scene) and seeing that the lunar events are ending at midnight tonight... I hope Riot keeps the bundles for at least another week. I do enjoy the way we can give back to the company, and still get a great reward. Hoping for another prestige event sometime later, but for this time.

There are the event skins (like Firecracker Vayne, KDA Akali and KDA Kai'Sa) which are only available with the event points. Then there are the yearly Prestige skins like Blood Moon Aatrox which are buy able with the Prestige points that come with the Masterwork Chest bundles. \n\nHere's the info they released with the Aatrox skin.\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/prestige-points-and-new-prestige-edition-skins","replies":[]}]}
