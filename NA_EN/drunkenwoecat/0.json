If that golden urf icon was real xD For a sec i really thought it cost 99,999 rp. Did you? Lmao.. yea. If i do happen to somehow win, for any or no reason at all, don't be expecting me to hog it for my self. I don't have many friends, but for all the ones that have stuck around and offered me their time to talk and enjoy a simple game together, every will definitely get something in return :) also, i have a donation i wish to give to somebody who deserves it, running tournaments to give away free rp and skins to winners. Me helping never nor being on enough doesn't give me as much time as i would like to join in on the whole rp fest. So why not jump at the chance i see here, right now, if it hasn't already been announced someone has won it? (I assume..)\n\nGL to everyone in this thread, and last but not least..
