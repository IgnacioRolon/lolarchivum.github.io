He's a vastayan of mixed blood and well, that's an interesting story within it'self. If he is meant to be this character who shares half and half, which he does, then I believe that he should have more vastayan features to him. So far, he only has the two ears, which are barely visible, in his model. Sure. The fur on his coat might be used to signify that he wants to be more vastayan, with noxian features, but I believe that at least his ears, should be expanded, and be deserves more animalistic features. In our society, we may see mixed children as distasteful (JUST TRYING TO MAKE A POINT) because they do not agree with their looks or styles. We have enough, but wouldn't it be grand to have a big cat ear boi? Sure we dont want a Warwick, but we dont want a powerful man with cute little cat ears that mean nothing. Maybe that's not the problem, we already have the gold and the prowess from his body, but, there can be more added to him.","replies":[{"poster":"c h a u u s i e","date":"2019-12-12T19:06:33.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't some of that fur..

Because honestly no one could tell he was different from the other vastaya like Rakan/Xayah or Neeko since they literally look like him but a different species. For someone whose supposed to be hated for being a half breed he looks like a very normal vastayan except with no claws unlike his mother whose a full vastaya","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-12-12T13:12:46.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing like Wolverine, now Sabretooth on the other hand... https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/deadpool/images/e/e2/Sabretooth.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140626200444\n\nSabretooth look more Vastayan that this guy.
