Tibbers was bound to Annie by magic (though he may well choose her now, we don't really know) into a teddy bear form.\n\nWhether or not Tibbers should continue moving after Annie's death depends on how/whether Annie is actively channeling magic into him in his bear form. Is Tibbers' form change a result of Annie pumping magic into him to force and maintain the transformation, or is Annie simply releasing the bonds that keep him in small form, so that Tibbers naturally reverts to normal size?\n\nPoint is, from a thematic standpoint, Daisy's lifespan should not be cut short by Ivern's death. Whether Tibbers should behave this way or not is up to Riot to decide, once they officially lay out how Annie's magic affects Tibbers in both teddy and bear form.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F1HvNiEO.png%3Fnoredirect&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=150","replies":[{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2016-10-10T01:52:32.973+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure her ult is her letting him out of his cage, since she stuffed the shadow bear into a teddy right?

I legitimately think Daisy is the worst ultimate in the game, bar none. I actually can't think of an ultimate that does absolutely nothing with as much reliability as Daisy does.\n\nTo start with the problems, the damage is pretty pitiful. I often get about as much damage from putting a shield on Daisy as I do from Daisy herself. Her autoattacks do mediocre amounts of damage, and it's so easy to kite her out that she usually doesn't get off enough to put out any serious pain.\n\nOn top of that, the utility is almost nonexistent. It takes 3 hits, which can be hard to get by themselves because kiting her out is not hard. Then you have a LONG windup before the knockup actually goes out, it can still be dodged even once it gets thrown, and even if it hits the knockup itself is only for one second. One fucking second! There are ultimates I can just throw at people with stronger CC than that, and they're way more reliable and hurt more too. After you get the knockup, you can't start stacking again for a couple seconds, pretty much guaranteeing that you're not someone up again. Of course, you'd never get a second knockup anyway, because Daisy is too goddamn slow to keep up with anyone once her initial speed buff wears off. \n\nThe only thing she has going for her is that she's decently tanky, but that doesn't matter unless she's tanking a turret or unless the enemy is chucking damage into her, which they have no reason to do because she sucks so much.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2016-10-09T21:27:33.928+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"like annie wasn't cheap enough as it is having burst and a click stun/aoe stun.
