Downside is that you then end up with a game where towers can be nullified completely from pretty early in the game, especially if a jungler's snowballing. Despite the complaints some people have about towers not being lethal enough they still put out quite a lot of damage early to early-mid game, which does a lot to give champs behind in lane at least some ability to survive. \n\nThat's kind of the problem we've had with Ohmwrecker overall. We think towers are good for the game, in terms of how they shape fights/sieges and give teams that are behind some chance, so an item that shuts them down completely clashes pretty hard with the reason they exist in the first place. That clash is why we've been talking more about removing Ohmwrecker potentially, rather than trying significant changes like this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-09-22T19:03:43.297+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would rather it upgrade towers personally since currently there aren't any pure Anti-Push items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2016-09-22T18:53:38.115+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe instead of having Ohmwrecker completely nullify a turret, have it force retargeting onto the user and reset the damage amp back to zero. That would aid divers without making the dive itself COMPLETELY trivial, as the turret would continue to fire, so if the champion getting dove can still make some outplays, they can still win the fight (though admittedly it would be unlikely).\n\nYou could have it build out of just a Raptor Cloak, so they get the Point Runner passive, some armor and a little health regen, with no offensive combat stats.\n\nWould there be some way to interact the Ohmwrecker active with Smite? You guys already have items that modify Smite and spells that have both charges and cooldowns, so how....viable, I guess is the word, would it be to have the Ohmwrecker have its own active cooldown and also require a Smite charge to be used? That way it's kind of like using your Smite charge on a tower, so you can't double down on \"turret weakened\" plus Red Smite.

The item has 1 legit offensive stat (10% CDR), plus movement speed. Not your typical option for towerdiving.\n\n2. The item boosts your armor and health primarily. 2 stats that are generally less valuable once the clock starts ticking and the tower is ... well... no longer testing your Armor nor your Health pool.\n\n3. Towers are already a joke. There are plenty of useful diving champions, even early game, like {{champion:60}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:105}} , and these are just the ones that can burst someone down and immediately hop out/ become untargetable *without Flash*. Add flash, and this grows immensely.\n\nIf you want this to be a decent item, it needs to really turn the tide in a battle reliably. My suggestion is something like this:\n\n* Active: select a huge area (think Trundle W, possibly larger), and all allied champions gain 5% damage resistance that stand on it. If an enemy tower is within the area, that tower's cannon is jammed, and cannot fire, but the Active's area that's within tower range neutralizes, leaving no buff while under the tower.\n\nIf this were done, the item could actually be a legit support-type item, as not only could it be useful on a team that may lack some damage to keep up with the enemy's power creep abuse, but that could be done in a game where the lack of team push leaves you frozen within your base half of the time. As it stands, we have a moderate tank item which needs team assistance to simply balance out the low effectiveness it lends the team when you can't effectively push anything.\n\nI would also add something offensive to it. Maybe even a {{item:3057}}  proc on it, to limit the effectiveness to a more dedicated tank initiator, who would waste his money if he were to get a stronger Sheen proc, like {{item:3078}}  or {{item:3025}} . A possible tagalong onto that would be a utility-type Sheen proc, which instead utilizes something like Urgot's Passive effect (which lower's the enemy's damage on-hit, if you happen to be one of the few millions of non-Urgot players out there).","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2016-09-22T02:11:45.739+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf is this green square","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-09-22T17:53:15.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ReZisT Lust","date":"2016-09-23T13:10:46.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like buying it on zed tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephen The G","date":"2016-09-22T05:51:20.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this would legit be the strongest item in league with the area thing but if you added a proc like trinity it would be a must build on practical everyone bad idea imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magearna","date":"2016-09-21T23:06:47.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would actually be a really cool item.

This means that a lot of gold has to be invested into the item, making it useless 99% of the time.\n\nIn addition to that, the item would simply be frustrating to play against. The enemy is ahead? Okay, play safe and farm under turret. Wait, what turret?\n\nThen there is the issue who should this item be for?\n- Tanks don't need it, they happily soak the turret shots.\n- On assassins or carries it would be too snowbally.\n- Mages generally stay out of range anyways.\n\nThe best fit seems to be support. They don't need items loaded with stats, as long as they're cheap enough. They could use the active to dive with the adc and jungler and not care about who does the first hit under turret range. I think this item could have been the active for {{item:3401}} or perhaps have alternative upgrades.\n\nIf the item (or active effect) stays, I think it should be adjusted. Perhaps make it \"enemy turret deals half damage OR allied turret shoots twice as fast\" to make it useful in more situations and not simply a win-more item while making the offensive usage of the item a bit less frustrating for the opponent.\n\nThe biggest question, though, is what stats will go with this item? I think there's already too much CDR so this stat is not very appealing. Perhaps the item should be a mid-tier item costing like 1000-1500 with just a few stats that everyone can use. This way, you'll be able t pick it up and sell later. Maybe even a passive that allows you to sell it for the full price after X minutes or after X turrets have been destroyed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2016-09-21T03:33:40.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be  a decent item if it could be used to empower your own turrets or something.
