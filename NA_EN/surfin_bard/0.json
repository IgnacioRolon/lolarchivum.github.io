First, I took a look at your ticket and saw that Port 5060 (pretty important port for communications) was **blocked** on your network. You may need to reach out to your ISP about unblocking this port entirely.\n\nThe second issue looks suspiciously like the known issue listed on the [**Service Status Page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#eune). I recommend following the directions listed in that ticker message so we can confirm whether or not this is the known issue.\n\nLet me know what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Surfin Bard","date":"2016-12-14T12:56:49.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've ran a network analysis and saw you were right about port 5060:\n**[Link removed]**\n\nThis is what I've had after logging into my router and trying to allowing it:\nhttp://imgur.com/0WB7QBq\n\nWhat do I do now ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surfin Bard","date":"2016-12-14T12:18:49.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still the same unfortunately.\n\nI went over to my friends' place two days ago to check if League worked there, and it actually did. I could play using either cable or wifi connection. The next day I've experienced no problems at my own flat either after going through these steps: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/hu/articles/204134104\n\nToday however, everything the same as it used to be. My client still won't connect to chat or games. \n\nI believe I've already allowed port 5060 because when I logged into my router and tried putting it in there I've had a window popping up that it already exists.\n\nSo how come one day it works and the next day it doesn't ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JeConfidant","date":"2016-12-12T23:46:04.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jesus cant they fix that, its so stupid and takes too much time...","replies":[]},{"poster":"VlKT0R","date":"2016-12-12T21:05:18.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
