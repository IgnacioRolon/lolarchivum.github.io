{"poster":"OH NO ITS LU BU","date":"2014-05-20T23:27:46.468+0000","title":"Lu Bu's \"Guide to Gaming and  Snacking\"","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:2010}} Hey guys, Lu Bu the OP Villain from your nightmares/Chef at Battle &amp; Brew in Atlanta, Ga here with a guide to HEALTHY snacking while gaming!(Yes, I lured you into a healthy food thread.)\nLemme give you a taste of what you'll get ahead\n\n**BUFFS GAINED FROM TAKING MY ADVICE IN THIS THREAD:**\n\n* Super Night Vision from Carrots\n\n* Enhanced thinking power from nuts\n\n* lady-enticing pheromones from celery\n\n* I won't hunt you down and kill you at Hu Lao Gate\n\n* 200% Musou gauge\n\n\nFirst things first, the \"why?\"\nWhy? Cause I want to. I honestly want to share this knowledge with you guys because I'm surrounded by gamers all day every day and I care about them. They, you, are my people. We share similar interests and bonds and we play together day in and day out and as a chef, if there's one thing I'm most concerned about in life, its what people are putting in their bodies. I care deeply. I see what gamer's eat and it bothers me, intrinsically, because I just turned 31 and I see people in their early 20's or teens in worse health than myself. That's not good. Context: My father recently suffered a cataclysmic health breakdown as he required a triple bypass and was afflicted with an aneurysm at roughly the same time. I had many talks with doctors and nutritionists as it related to his health and my own, so it's beyond personal. Very much so. Both of these were caused by poor diet, too much salt intake and too much cholesterol. I don't want to be the last gamer, I don't want my brother's to have to bury me, I also don't want to be in the same position as my father, so the grimness is real. We need gamers to have gamer kids and gamer families an in order for us to be healthy and awesome and **eventually rule the earth**, and one easy step towards that is that we need to **pay attention to what we're eating.** We can do this, I will help. \nSo I made this thread, two years ago, and now I'm updating this thread, because it's that important. So I would love your attention. Thanks in advance.\n\nSO, what I compiled is a list of great food to eat while playing League of Legends. No mess food that you can handle with one hand that won't cause you to stop looking at the minimap and get ganked in the meantime. Unless you're Eve cause then you can just AFK in the Baron pit while you lay the proverbial snackdown. This is by no means a complete nor comprehensive list, but I think it's a good list. Suggestions that I think are good will be added if I have time. I look forward to all feedback.\nNow for the \"What?\"\n\n**1. GRAPES AKA TASTY FUCKING FRUIT BITES OF TASTINESS**{{champion:115}} \n\nGrapes are the best. Grapes are low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium and are also a good source of Vitamin C and Vitamin K. Grapes are hassle-free, if they're seedless, and if not, get a cup. You don't need to look at the bowl of grapes on your desk to grab one. You don't need to cut them. You don't have to move your head, take off your headset, use two hands or even pay any mind to making a mess with grapes. So yeah, eat some grapes. Grapes do have sugars in them so it's a mixed bag with some added energy but also extra calories, but pound for pound, grapes beat everything for eating and gaming. Seriously. Get some.AND MIX IN SOME NUTS WITH YO GRAPES, PLAYA. SECOND PLACE GOES TO BANANAS. No excuse for not eating bananas in general, they're super tasty.\n\n**2. NUTS, BRO.**  {{champion:57}} \n\n\"Nuts are underrated as nutritious snacks — particularly raw tree nuts, such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, and more, which have been linked to lower cholesterol, better heart health, weight control, and even a lower cancer risk.\"-A SMART PERSON. Nuts are crazy good for you. They're natural anti-oxidant, heart-helping, super-food that can aid you in weight loss and fill you up during a late night gaming run. Best Choice? **WALNUTS.** Especially if you don't like fish cause WALNUTS are chock full of omega 3 fatty acids that, if you ain't hurd yet, fight inflammation and will make your over-all gaming a more comfortable experience. Other good nuts? Cashews(my fave), Almonds, Pecans(not pecan pie), Brazil(hue) nuts, and Macadamias. A bag of mixed nuts is a bag of healthy delicious options that you would be crazy(GETIT) to pass up. That's a lot of nuts.\n\n**3. HOMEMADE HUMMUS**  {{champion:90}} \n\n\"Hummus also contain about 20 essential Amino Acids, including large dosages of Tryptophan, Phenylalanine and Tyrosine, a threesome that makes it, surprisingly, a potential substitute for Prozac and the such. Omega 3 too was found to be effective in treatment for minor mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety.\" ***WHAT DOES THAT MEAN LU BU?!  ***That means that people eating some good-ass hummus are going to be in a better mood. They're going to be more friendly. More honourable. You get what I'm saying, here? Hummus will make your entire team's gaming experience more enjoyable. Not pre-made hummus though. That stuff in (most) stores is gross. YOU NEED TO MAKE THE HUMMUS YOURSELF. The added benefit here is that you can totes add other stuff to your hummus, like garlic, sun dried tomatoes, avocado(hell yeah) and other stuff. Here is an easy Hummus recipe for you: http://humus101.com/EN/2006/10/14/hummus-recipe/Remember that you can add spices of your choice to the recipe to flavour it up nicely. Now I'm reading your mind. You're saying: ***\"This LU BU guy is an idiot. What am I gonna do, eat the hummus with my bare hands?! Then it gets on the keyboard! MINUS ONE I HOPE THIS THREAD IS CLOSED! :[\"*** **Hold the blurplin phone guys.** You can eat hummus with:\n\n**4. CARROTS AND CELERY! BUY ORGANIC, BUY LOCAL. FARMER'S MARKETS FTW.**{{champion:143}} \n\nI don't even need to sell celery(ha!) it sells itself down by the seashore. You can dip these *bad mutha-shut yo mouths* in the hummus and then pop'em in your mouth for a flavour train to happy town.\n**FELLAS, CHECK THIS BLURP OUT**\n\nToday, scientists know that celery contains androsterone, a pheromone released by men's sweat glands that attracts females. Boom. I don't even NEED to list more facts, but I'm going to. Why? Cause I ****ing love you guys and your health is always on my mind. I'm Ray Charles and you're my Georgia. ALSO I'M GEORGIAN AND GEORGIA IS LITERALLY ALWAYS ON MY MIND. IT'S TERMINAL. I DIGRESS.\n\n**CELERY FACTS BROTONANONALEWSKIS:**\n **This food is low in Saturated Fat, and very low in Cholesterol. It is also a good source of Riboflavin, Vitamin B6, Pantothenic Acid, Calcium, Magnesium and Phosphorus, and a very good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Folate, Potassium and Manganese. Its a 5-star weight-loss food, y'all. No guff, hoss.\nAND CARROT FACTS TOO!:\nCarrots are about 87% water. BIG UPS TO HYDRATION. This food is very low in Saturated Fat and Cholesterol. It is also a good source of Thiamin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate and Manganese, and a very good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K and Potassium.\nFiber is gonna keep the rest of this food moving through your body at a good pace. That's important for reasons I'm not going to get into but you're going to realize more of as you turn 30...trust me.\n\n**5.TUNA SANDWICH UP IN THIS POST!**  {{champion:105}} \n\n**Canned Tuna(in water, not oil) is the holy grail of meat that is ridiculously healthy for you and also delicious and comes in a can.\n**It is rich in protein, low in fat and calories and is an excellent source of the essential omega-3 fatty acids which help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. See a trend? Tuna with mustard is so low-calorie its blurping stupid. So if you want a sandwich, get some tuna, get some mustard, get some FETA, MOZZ, SWISS, OR COTTAGE CHEESE, Go apeshizz on it, shove it in your facehole til your full and be happy that you're not dying of heart disease.\n\n**ONE MORE THING, DRINK WATER. LOTS OF IT. IT'S THE BEST.\n**\nI will update this more as I get time, but I really wanted to write this post and I hope you guys enjoy it. Questions are welcome. \n\nLove, \n\nLu Bu.\n\n\n**tl;dr too bad. read it. it's important.  \nBUT HERE IS A GREAT GROUP OF IDEAS IF NONE OF THE ONES I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT ARE GOOD ENOUGH, YA PICKY POLLYS.**\n{{champion:17}} \n\nGrains:\tdry cereal, whole grain crackers, mini rice cakes(there are hundreds of rice cake options at the grocery), sliced wheat or 9 grain bread, mini bagels(MAKE SOME LO-CAL PIZZA BAGELS WIT GRILLED CHICKEN AND CHOMP THEM FOOLS), graham crackers, whole wheat tortillas or spinach tortillas\n\nVegetables: veggie \"matchsticks\" (thin sticks) made from fresh carrots* or zucchini, bell pepper rings, cherry tomatoes, steamed broccoli, green beans, sugar peas, avocados\n\nFruits: apple slices, tangerine sections, strawberry halves, bananas, pineapple, kiwi, peach, mango, nectarine, melon, grapes, berries, dried apricots\n\nDairy: low-fat cheese slices or string cheese, mini yogurt cups, fat-free or low-fat milk, low-fat cottage cheese\n**BEST CHEESES: FETA, STRING CHEESE(No, really), PARMESAN, SWISS, AND COTTAGE.** If you're craving a sandwich(I always am, Swiss and Mustard is tasty AND super lo-cal compared to other options.\n\nProtein Foods: Egg slices or wedges, peanut butter, bean dip, hummus, slices of lean turkey or chicken, shelled pumpkin seeds","replies":[{"poster":"Circuit Dragon","date":"2014-05-21T00:56:44.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh cool I live in Smyrna im only 16 tho so no going to a bar lol","replies":[{"poster":"OH NO ITS LU BU","date":"2014-05-21T01:01:04.719+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can come in before 8pm with a parent to eat and check out the place, but after 8 pm we're 18 and Up only.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamat","date":"2014-05-21T01:07:27.492+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would highly recommend this if you're in the area.

Avoid all microwave pre-packaged stuff. You can air-pop your own popcorn and hit it with some sea salt and Parmesan and that would be about as healthy as you're going to get with it. I don't see anything particularly wrong with it as a whole, but again, you're going to be doing the preparation and seasoning all your self. Anything that comes out of an orville redenbocker bag is incredibly unhealthy. You might as well just melt butter and drink it. \nI can still recommend turkey bacon or something but only like 1 or 2 strips as a light snack, paired with some veggies.
