(by AFK I mean sitting in base or just running around doing nothing, or even leaving the game entirely.) Riot doesn&#039;t seem to care about it and people on the opposing team say they wont report the afk&#039;er, obviously because they are winning. If someone rage quits and makes the team lose their game, with enough reports, shouldn&#039;t riot have a forgiveness program or the like? Losing a bunch of games and losing all the LP I&#039;ve been working hard for and grinding for is starting to really suck.\r\n\r\n My previous game, I had a person get mad that he got autofilled support and not adc, so he went yasuo support and intentionally fed the entire game. No he was not doing bad, he literally walked into the enemy team and would die on purpose. Then I had a teemo ragequit because he died twice within the first 5 minutes. Yesterday, I had 3 games in a row with a person whose name I know by heart now because they fed the enemy team each game and was being a complete troll. Sure, maybe they had an off day, but if the are in my queue, then I have to deal with it because if I dodge I lose LP anyway and also get a queue limit.\r\n\r\nIt is completely unfair that people are able to ruin your game and your rank that you&#039;ve been working so hard to get up. Why won&#039;t Riot do anything about it?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-11-18T18:49:17.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You cant fix what you don't know the circumstances of, but then again... you only care about yourself and your thread proves that.","replies":[{"poster":"WanderingHobbit","date":"2017-11-18T18:57:00.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does my thread prove that I only care about myself? I think it sucks in general that people on my team are losing as well due to an afk or a feeder, and also that (sometimes) the other team is not having a fun game either because it presents no challenge doing a 4v5. \n\nAlso, Riot would very well know the circumstances, as that is the reason for the report and giving information option. If a team is reporting that someone has went afk or that they are inting, then Riot now has knowledge of the player and the testimony of the other players, be it on the same team or from both teams.\n\nIf you are going to come to my post and try to troll, then kindly leave and go back under your bridge.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2017-11-18T20:03:54.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well yeah, which is why riot introduced the leaverbuster system.\npeople honestly expect riot to be practically psychic, predicting who will have a real life problem. most AFK's are actually do to a real problem, because a real troll would actually throw the game. sure it sucks considering YOU lose ~20 LP because someone else either int'd or actually had a power outage (or their internet decided f*ck it I'm out), but riot cant control these type of things, without leaving the system open to abuse\n\ntl;dr\nriot cant predict what they don't know will happen","replies":[{"poster":"WanderingHobbit","date":"2017-11-18T20:47:17.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive had a loss forgiven before due to an afk, so I would like to know what happened to that system.
