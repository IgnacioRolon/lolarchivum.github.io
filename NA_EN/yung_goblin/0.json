Character detail on very high looks the same as character detail on very low. However, increasing the effect detail increases the resolution of Zed&#039;s body textures. Not a game breaking bug, but I like to keep effect detail low because certain effects cause a large fps drop. I have tried repairing the client. Please fix.\n\nMac OS X Yosemite 10.10.5","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2015-09-11T00:33:06.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same happens with Blood Moon Thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-10T22:40:33.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey yung goblin,\n\nThanks for the report!
