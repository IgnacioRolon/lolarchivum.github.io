Often he will speak two to three voice lines at the same time. For instance, if I move, use Garen's Q and his passive activates around the same time, Garen will say all three lines of dialog overlapping on each other. Additionally, more than 70% of the taunt emotes I perform he doesn't say anything at all. And when he hits a cannon minion or tower a loud squeak noise like a bird's chirp comes out of nowhere. Please fix this for this wonderful LEGENDARY skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-04T11:36:13.705+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's annoying and very noticeable since it happens pretty much any time you use an ability.

I mean think about it, the theme is supposed to be Darius vs Garen but everyone knows that Garen is just a much much much worse off version of Darius. They should've buffed Garen before they made this rediculous VS thing, every other VS event was much more even. Not to mention the issue where Garen mission progress wasn't being counted. I literally haven't even played since this patch because of all the issues I've been hearing about. Why Garen gets a \"God-King\" skin when the only time he can ever feel god-like is against bad players is beyond me. I'd probably have bought the skin too if Riot wasn't busy being the Blizzard of balance with flavor of the month design choices. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]}
