The thing is when you use your Q on Vi and charge to someone if they flash right into your Q path you wont collide with them, you will go straight through them. Also alot of times I would charge my Q up and try to hit someone but it just goes though them and its really anoying trying to main her when I am getting cucked by a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2019-02-16T07:02:37.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nChampions Team is in the process of fixing a charging bug that affects several champions, Vi included.
