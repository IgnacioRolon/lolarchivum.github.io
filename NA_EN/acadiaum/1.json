I have made multiple trips to my local best buy for professional help from Geek Squad. Yet, every time i get my desktop back i continue to have the same problem of the screen going black while in game. First the screen goes black and then the sound cuts out. Geek Squad has run hours of tests on my computer, but have found no issues with my components. I went as far as bringing in my entire set-up for testing and use, but there is still no problem detected. I reduced my settings in game to hopefully help; this did not help..... please someone give me guidance. I want to play league, but i find my self ready to give it up.","replies":[]}]}
