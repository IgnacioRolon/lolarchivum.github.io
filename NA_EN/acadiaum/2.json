The ultimate of his shouldn&#039;t heal him, just like in the trailer he should feel the pain of his mistakes. As it is now, if he gets in over his head he can do just undo everything that happen. \n\nOverall I don&#039;t find him Overpowered but it ticks off many players that you essentially have an undo button every 100 secs. \nThat way if you ignited him you still a chance. \n\n\nThe shield shouldn&#039;t last too long, and it shouldn&#039;t go over his max health. That way he can&#039;t pop up in the middle of the group with his max health plus a shield on top of the W Shield.\n\n\n\nI&#039;m not very good at explaining myself but hopefully I wrote it well enough for you to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR\n\nHe should still pay for his mistakes, if he jumps into a group of people and ult away he shouldn't be able to undo the damage. He should still risk being in danger of lingering effects as bleed/ignite/ or delayed minion/champion attacks  ","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-05-31T13:34:32.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"im not entirely sure what they were thinking when they designed the ability. it seems like they made the shadow visible for enemies, to give it some counterplay. meaning if you coordinate yourself with your team properly, you can prepare and directly catch him at the place hes going to appear. at the same time there is a large nuke with a pretty decent area attached to it, so you have to accept that youll eat a ton of damage when you try.\n\ni havent really figured out, where the counterplay in half of his abilities is. his timewinder is pretty straight forward, but his ult is giving me a headache. his e has no counterplay, since its simply a mobility tool (a dash and a blink).\n\nhis w should be relatively clear. stay out of it. but they made it in a way, where he can place it invisible a lot of times, and made the area so large that its pretty difficult not to get hit by it if you dont have a lot of mobility yourself.\n\ni feel like gameplay wise there should be the possibility to displace the shadow (through knockbacks etc.). but that would absolutely make 0 sense thematically.","replies":[{"poster":"Acadiaum","date":"2015-05-31T13:41:11.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q is easiest to dodge, as you said.\nW should be made visible at all times, just like Bards Ult.\nE, it's strongest when you're below 30% health where it then becomes a very hard hitting attack. Honestly that's a hard one, that combined with the ult or flash makes it very easy to kill a low health target and run away.  Maybe it shouldn't be able to proc on hit? That would be a very huge nerf though so I can't really say.\n\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
