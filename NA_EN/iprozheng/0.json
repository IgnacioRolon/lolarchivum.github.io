I just close out the client and restart my laptop. After my laptop restarted my league client just wont open anymore so i reinstall the game. After i reinstall, it finally opens with big words \"THE CLIENT UPDATE HAS BEGAN\" so i hit launch and NOTHING happens, league just disappears. So i looked at a couple post about deleting some file in the \"lol_air_launcher\" in the RAD folder, but I can't find that file. Inside the RAD-projects folder only has league_client, league_client_en_us, lol_patcher and lol_launcher. I don know what to do, please help","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T00:52:49.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, this sounds like quite the pickle. Since you've uninstalled now, you're going to need to go through the client update before proceeding onto the patching process. Since that client update isn't wanting to open correctly, there's a chance that your OS doesn't recognize the program anymore. Double check that your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) are still setup correctly in order for League to patch and scan it's own files.","replies":[{"poster":"iProZheng","date":"2017-07-14T01:04:25.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently reinstalling league for the 4th time.
