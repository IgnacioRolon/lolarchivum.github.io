This is how league works at its core. Youll get higher and higher mmr until you peak and thats where you should be winning 50% of your games. If you just started and win 68% of your games then you are doing amazing. Dont take losses as a bad experience. If someone is flat out whooping you, watch a replay and see what they did. Some people are better at farming, macro, mechanics, and all sorts of little things that when added together make you a good player.\nDont get discouraged. Nobody should be winning as many games as you have if theyre new. If anything you might just be a natural at this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-20T18:19:38.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have only had 2 games in the last 18 days where you got no kills, and you have a 68% win rate.\n\nYou are getting better so you are playing against better people, which will cause your own skill to rise over time.\n\nIf you want to play some games together so I can help you out, add me in game.
