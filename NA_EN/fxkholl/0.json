This error might have a much simpler workaround though, as your PC might be failing to locate the client.   Try the following steps to see if that fixes the issue:\n\n- Navigate to your League of Legends installation folder. (Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n- Scroll down until you find \"LeagueClient.exe\" and delete the file.\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n- Repair the client by selecting the “?” button in the top right-hand corner of the Patcher window (the first window that appears) and under the options menu, select Repair.\n\nLet me know if that does the trick!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImMautze","date":"2017-02-26T22:54:14.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poroles how is the installations Folder","replies":[]}]}
