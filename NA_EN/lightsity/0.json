Overall nothing truly changed, and my ping stayed the same. \r\n\r\n_**Problem **_\r\n \r\nUpon using Riot's Lag Report Feature today I noticed information that bothered me as my reported average was set at 54ms which is true based on my in-game experience. The problem here. Those around me receive pings of around 20-30 never spilling into the 50's range and this is further aligned with the data in the Lag Report as nearby players max caps at 48. \r\nA while back I noticed this upon checking the hextech tool noticing my ping was reported around 24-26 avg. with min. max. ranges all relative too.\r\nMy ping used to be 51 avg with a min of 48-49; however, recently as in within the last 3-5 months it spiked up to 54.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any clues, hints, leads, to how I can solve this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T04:14:50.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm sounds like this might be centered around your network settings if other players in your area have been able to get down to 20-30 ms.
