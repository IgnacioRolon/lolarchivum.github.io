Am I to just accept that? A normal is fine, but ranked is different. What do I do? Do I file a ticket or am I just fucked over again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-02T22:29:05.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes shit just happens and other players disconnect. This could be caused by a regional ISP outage, a continental backbone having issues or a hiccup in the game server. Regardless of their intent, their disconnection negatively affected everyone else in the match. If the players who disconnected exhibit a trend of leaving, they'll be audited by the [Leaverbuster System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\nAs someone who didn't disconnect, it really sucks because you're left both outnumbered and completely lost as to why this happened. In a situation like this, the best thing to do is simply take the L, report the players who disconnected and move on.\n\n Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Lightsity","date":"2016-08-03T04:43:00.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm at least glad someone responded, but would this have anything to do with current rank queue down? And does current rank down explain why I suddenly only got 9 lp for winning a game. Normally I get on average 18-20 but it seems ive been getting lower and lower.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T16:22:10.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your current MMR has placed you where the system believes you should be at the moment, based on the games you've recently played. Strong win streaks will sometimes cause you to gain slightly less LP with each victory.
