For jungle Yii is good but I would have someone better than me or you talk you through the proper way to team fight with him so your not just really on you enemies incompetence with cc to win. Cho is decent mid and great top and easy to farm with and you dont have to worry about his e pushing lane if you just bounce it every wave and never get closer than your q range to your opponent you will be pretty safe. I max q to one shot the back line so i can bounce consistently. If they try to hold the minions out tower range you q them and they keep taking all that minion dmg while knocked up and then slowed you've won lane. If your ahead rush rhylais and theres no escape. W and they can only walk 60% speed to try and avoid your q and then with your e you esentially have frozen mallet. Cho's level 6 all in is strong. When you get ganked just run and then when they go to chase there is an obvious best path for the to follow so you can q where they are running and if they keep going theyve been hit if they swerve you've gained ground you have to stay calm though because a bad q means death. My standard full build against balanced dmg and if im not stupid snowballed is rhylais cdr boots frozen heart abyssal scepter gaurdian angel and deathcap. You have solid dmg great cc full cdr with 5% from masteries and your and you are just shy of being a legit tank. \n\nGeneral tips: If you can bounce the wave and your not behind your lane opponet its not dangerous to shove out the wave and let it get some turret dmg its you following the wave up for harass plus more tower dmg thats a hazard to your kda. Work on your farming thats where you get most of your gold from if you play properly.\nPressure: If you've killed your lane opponent and have 60% hp or 40% and an ally with you go kill the turret. If your lane opponent has backed your healthy and the tower is below 30% take it. Once you've killed it come to lane often enough to keep it past there side of river but don't go past it yourself instead go roam and help your team.\n\nIf your computer freezes up in team fights you might want a knew one. If your internet can't handle multiple people( F U Timewarner cable and your adds that your the ultimate internet for gamers if there was another isp here i would get it) don't play ranked when other people are on the internet.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mexican Pharaoh","date":"2015-07-31T03:30:47.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mexican Pharaoh","date":"2015-07-31T03:22:33.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-07-31T01:57:20.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mexican Pharaoh,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=gQlxqLy0,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-30T22:15:29.353+0000)\n>\n>  **once u play them well**\n\nThat's all that really matters; learn a champion well (not just mechanically, but strategically), practice your fundamentals, and you can carry with anything\n\nIt's easier to do this on with mechanically simple champions; yes you can carry with Azir, but it's difficult since you're wrestling with his mechanics as well as learning the game's fundamentals.

The best thing you can do is find a champion that you play well in bronze. You are in bronze 5, so you just need to find a champion that you really enjoy playing and dedicate a lot of time to them. Get very good at your champion. It doesn't matter much which champion you use to carry you out of low bronze. Good ones would be bursty champs you can make plays on. Most assassins are very good at solo carrying in low bronze. Even adcs can if your positioning is good. \n\nIf you want me to watch games of yours and give tips, I can.
