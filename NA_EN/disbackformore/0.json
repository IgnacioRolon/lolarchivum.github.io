By all means, ignore the haters.  It's okay to get angry sometimes, anyone that pretends otherwise is bullshitting you.  It happens, we're human.  \n\nPeople who will mock you for it on these boards are not worth responding to.\n\nTo your particular issue at hand.  If your comfortable, I'd encourage you to link or copy and paste the text of the chat that was sent to you for your ban.  No pressure if you don't want to, but it does help others better understand where your behavior may be going wrong.\n\nIn the heat of the moment we may feel like we're justified in our actions.  In our minds, it is Us Vs. the World.  But other people can help us understand perspective a little bit better, and by sharing the chat you may gain insight in to your own actions.\n\nI'm going to make an assumption in your case based off the post you made.  If it's wrong; forgive me; I'm happy to adjust it based off the actual chat.  (I don't have access to my tools right now so I can't view it)\n\nYou mention that other players were saying terrible things to you and that it angered you.  In response, you asked them to stop.  If you ended up suspended, I'm going to guess you said some mean things in response as well.\n\nFirst, it's important to know that if what you said about the other players' comments is true, then that's un-excusable.  Telling someone or their family members to die is NOT okay.    That behavior is the kind of stuff our disciplinary systems are looking out for.  You. I and everyone else in League shouldn't have to deal with that, so it's important that we report it after the end of the game when we see it.\n\nBut if you respond to that level of toxicity from others with your own toxicity, then you're not helping the situation at hand.  You're not helping yourself, you're not helping your team.  You're not going to get the other people to stop  (You'll probably encourage them by feeding them information).\n\nIf anything, you're likely to hurt yourself and your team.  Let's take a hypothetical game where you are playing Ranked Queue on Summoner's Rift.  There are five players on the team, including you.\n\nYou\nPlayer 2\nPlayer 3\nPlayer 4\nPlayer 5\n\n10 minutes in, Player 2 says really nasty things to you.\n\n15 minutes in Player 5 says really nasty things to you.\n\nYou snap.  You've been playing 15 minutes of this game, trying your hardest and now you have Player 2 and Player 5 ragging so hard on you; just tearing you a part with every insult in the book.\n\nIn retaliation you unleash a stream of your own attacks.  The kind of stuff that will make your grandmother blush.\n\nWhat's the end result here?  At 15 minutes there were 2 toxic players in the game and 3 non-toxic players in the game.  Now you've joined in, and there are 3 toxic players in the game.\n\nPerhaps three minutes later Player 4 decides why the hell not, and they start being a jerk too.  Now there are 4 toxic players.\n\nWe don't want that.  You don't want that.  The other players in the game don't want that.\n\nIn an alternate scenario let's say instead of unleashing on the two toxic players you muted them.  There are no more insults coming from them.  They're likely to give up trying to insult you  (since you're not giving them the attention they want)  and if they don't, then who cares! you wouldn't even know they're saying anything since they are muted.  All that wasted effort on your part for them to troll you.  :P\n\nSo now we have a situation where you ignored them and stopped the toxicity where it is.  Two toxic players, three non-toxic players.   You have the mental energy to focus on the game without their terrible comments.   The other two players in the game don't have to worry about another person becoming toxic either.  Best case scenario, the two toxic players get tired of their insults and start playing.  \n\nIf those two toxic players don't?  Well, let's be honest; that sucks.  BUT now you have the trump card.  You report them at the end of the game.  The disciplinary systems take a look and ban them.  \n\nIf they report you in retaliation?  Who cares!  You didn't say anything to them, so their report is disregarded.  \n\nAt the end of the day; they're banned.  You're not.\n\nThis is what I'd encourage you to do the next time.  In the situation that led to your ban, you saw yourself a victim; BUT, you were also an aggressor by adding your own toxicity to the game, ruining it for everyone else.  In the future, you can make sure you're not either by muting/ignoring toxic players and reporting them at the end.","replies":[{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2015-11-05T07:23:37.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey this cookie's pretty sweet","replies":[]},{"poster":"NamelessTailz","date":"2015-11-05T08:07:02.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just submit my support ticket.  Just now, I got permanent suspended on my account.  An email should be sent to my email, but I noticed I have an old email associated with this account.  So in my support ticket,  I wrote that I didn't received an email due to old email associated to this account.  \n\nFrom this post, I agree with everything you said.  My situation is similiar, but except the flaming back part.  I actually ignored them completely.  I thought that was the best thing to do.  In the end, they will report me regardless.  I panic, and my greatest fear is that I get suspended by bully reports, majority ruled.  So I made a report, in case, my side was blinded.  In the end, I got suspended.  Right now, I just barely learning more about my situation.  \n\nMaybe I am suspended for a legit reason.  Right now, I'm just anxious to get ahold of the reason for my account suspended.  One thing for certain, I don't harass player or pick on player for their poor performance,  because getting caught by pro enemy happen all the time.  But if a player harass another player, I wouldn't stand for that.  One thing for certain, I probably deserve this suspended because I didn't communicate well with my teammate about my position or communicate at all.  And when i decided to communicate, I made a joke here and there.  I thought it was ok to keep silence and once a while make a dumb comment like,  \"I decline to answer anymore question until I speak to my lawyer.\"  I admit, that is a troll comment.  Oh, I also only play Teemo, one of my favorite character.  NOT FOR TROLLIng, TEEMO is actually really strong,  his shroom is epic.  The shroom brought my team some time to catch up with item.  But the downfall is that Teemo is always get belittle and get pick on.  Everyone seem to hate teemo.  I get alot of report on that alone.  I don't know for sure, but i can assume. \n\nI was looking forward to the new patch, which might solve the problem.  I get to pick the position that I want without having to conflict with other players.  most of the dispute started from calling the position anyway.  But I got suspended before I can try out the new patch.\n\nHopefully, i get an email soon.  I would like to know where did I went wrong.  I really love this game.  I do hope to play a game without too many opinion involve.  Or have to bend down to make player happy.  I want to be neutral as in just play my role the best i can.   I don't know much about the game world.  I'm really curious about what got me suspended.  But I would like to apologize for being a jerk for not communicating.  And thanks for the great time I have with this game.  And thanks riot for your hard work.  I would love to create a new account and start afresh, but it was way too hard work to get all those runes and to level up to 30.  After seeing the reasons, I guess my only choice is to uninstall.  =/  Ill miss you TEEMO lol\n\nhopefully, this post will help me speed up my support ticket.  I want to accept my crime and move on asap.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2015-11-04T21:53:12.260+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Answer is simple; You agreed to certain rules when u made account and after every downloaded patch.

Spending 30 minutes away from the game typically resolves this.\n\nI would also suggest that instead of responding to people who are being toxic, to ignore them, mute them, and report them at the end of the game. Typically they want you to engage in their toxic behaviour because they think it is funny. If you don't respond it will likely annoy them more than if you do respond.\n\nIf you don't engage in the toxic behaviour being directed at you, you will have no risk of getting your account suspended.
