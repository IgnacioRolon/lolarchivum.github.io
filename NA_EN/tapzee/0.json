This happens when the game server for your previous match doesn't properly report the results of the last match to the game platform. It typically won't last longer than a few hours, so let me know if this is still happening to you.","replies":[{"poster":"TapZee","date":"2016-10-16T08:41:05.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, it was good after few hours, thanks for replying!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
