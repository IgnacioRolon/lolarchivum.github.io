I don&#039;t care if you think I am being whiny etc. Also please be educated on the subject, maybe Diamond, or have a good link to a video or thread that relates. I was in plat last season (not on this account), so I would just prefer to take advice from someone who was a bit higher than where I was.**\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me use the last game as an example, it&#039;s a perfect example of what happens to me regularly and it is part of what is keeping me from climbing.\r\nGame plot: I am Jax, I kill Fiora 3 times in the first 4 minutes. At some point I start out 6-0. Ok, so I have the lead I aimed for. I went mid a few times to gank their twisted fate, but he was usually too close to their tower, and there was no point in diving because Azir wouldn&#039;t follow up anyways. So I eventually teleported bot, and we got some kills and then took their tower. then I went up and took my tower.\r\n\r\nSo Early game checklist:\r\n* Win lane: X\r\n* Help mid: few failed ganks, but I killed twisted fate after he ulted me after I killed fiora. \r\n* Help bot: X\r\n* Get tier 1 towers quickly: X\r\n\r\n**So things are going decently well, but at this point they start to decline, JUST LIKE ALWAYS.**\r\n\r\nHere are a few situations that started to turn the game around.\r\nExample 1: Fiora goes into Lee&#039;s jungle, but he&#039;s playing dumb, so despite having no money, he just tries to fight her instead of escaping. I follow to help but she is elusive so I couldn&#039;t quite finish her off before she dashed through a wall. She then walks right into mid lane to our Azir, who ignores our pings and just dies.\r\n\r\nExample 2: Fiora is walking bot. I am top lane with 3000 gold, but my teleport is up. I type ~~&quot; Back the f*** up you idio so&quot;~~ &quot;Guys wait about 20 seconds so I can buy, and I&#039;ll teleport bot.&quot; I then ping them my gold count. So instead of doing that, they walked past the tri bush near drag and fight the 2v3. I still teleported and tried to help, even though I was only about 80 percent health, didn&#039;t get to spend my gold, and really didn&#039;t want to at this point. It would have been an 0 for 2, but it was then a 1 for 3.\r\n\r\nThose are a few things that got them a lead. Also, my team keeps forcing bad fights around the map, especially in their jungle for some reason, despite my pleas for them to stop. NO focus on objectives. Despite that, I am following them, trying to bail them out of their bad decisions, make lemonades of their lemons. It didn&#039;t work, and we get aced, of course, because we&#039;ve already thrown our lead, i try to convey to them to stop forcing fights, to no avail, and it throws the games. Fiora gets so fed than I eventually can&#039;t even touch her. Meanwhile, the enemy team knows they are behind, are still farming up and getting fed, playing smart, watching u destroy ourselves, and then eventually take our nexus.\r\n\r\nSo now I end up 9-9 feeling like I&#039;m being forced into a lot of plays that I really don&#039;t want in the first place, and also making those last few minute desperation plays to even out the deaths :-). This happens regularly though, and I really need some advice on what to do in situations like this.\r\n\r\n**YES, I UNDERSTAND TO WORRY ABOUT MY OWN GAME AND MECHANICS, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM ASKING ON THIS PARTICULAR THREAD. A LARGE PART OF SOLO Q IS LEARNING TO MANAGE WITH YOUR TEAM AND IF YOU DISAGREE THEN JUST LEAVE THE THREAD.\r\n**\r\n\r\nSo, a few thoughts and questions I have relating:\r\n\r\n1. It seems that my team gets cocky with a lead (even if minor) and throws it a lot. I try not to do that myself, because it just helps get the team going. Advice on how to counter this?\r\n\r\n2. After the laning phase, my teams like to run around and YOLO dive in the enemy jungle amongst other bad plays until we are too behind to win. Should I actually not get my tower, and maybe not help my teammates get their tower too early, and try to prolong the laning phase, so I can accumulate a lot of gold, my teamamtes can keep laning, and then when the laning phase is forced to be over I&#039;ll be even more prepared to fight, and my lane opponent less prepared?\r\n\r\n3. An opposing view of question 2, when should I ditch my lane and try to help transfer my lead to my allies, or maybe take my tower and ditch lane and try to transfer my lead.\r\n\r\n4. What words do I need to use to prevent my team from engaging in stupid fights? Or to let them know that they are over extended, and need to get on our side of the river, since its just 2 of them and their whole team is MIA? Being nice doesn&#039;t work, and being a dick doesn&#039;t work.\r\n\r\n5. At what point do i decide, &quot;F*** my teammate,&quot; and just try to split push all game.\r\n\r\n6. If I tell my teammates to please back off for about 30 seconds, and they overextend and get caught or fight anyways, should I still help them? If I TP in, solid chance we&#039;ll just die, if not, whole team just gets pissed off. Should I just decide based on team comp and gold if I think it would matter to the fight?\r\n\r\n7. What do I do when I know my team is about to jump in a 3v5, when one of our teammates is just running around the map refusing to group? Group up the 4v5? Ditch them and just go split?\r\n\r\n8. Is Jax just not that good? Not good at teamfighting? Do my builds suck? (I usually will go damage item into boots and tank item and 4th is damage or tank, I vary a bit in my builds but you can just check them. I&#039;ve been trying many different types of builds, so don&#039;t look at just one game and assume I build that every time.\r\n\r\n9. I&#039;ve gotten pretty good at laning with Jax, but that doesn&#039;t always translate into wins or game success. When should I pick Jax and when should I pick someone else. I like playing tanks, but if you get a team who doesn&#039;t work together, there&#039;s nothing to tank for!\r\n\r\n10. Should I ever even use words at my teammates, more than pings? Just do my own thing if it&#039;s one of those non-cooperative or throwing games?\r\n\r\nAny other constructive advice relative to the situation is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-20T04:59:09.114+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly there are just some games where you have to accept you will lose.  Sometimes your team is just full of bonobos.\n\nIn terms of Jax you have a 56% win ratio over 129 games.  Thats pretty good man, keep that up and you will climb.  \n\nYour builds are lacking.  Try starting triforce as your first item, the components are all cheap and easy to build and phage/sheen are great items before you finish it. Rageblade is when you fed or against someone immobile who you can beat to death like a tanky top. Also definetly finish your titanic hyrda if you build tiamat as the active gives you an aa reset.\n\nAlso I recommend trying this runepage: AD marks, Armor seals, 15%crdperlevl glyphs (can also do 10% crd at 18 and 3 scaling mr), AS quints.  I use it and it makes early game feel nice with the attackspeed while giving you more cdr for later game which with triforce gives you 35% total.  \n\nAlso take 5% over 5 sec mastery its better than the 1% per person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Borkahn","date":"2017-03-20T04:24:34.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First an observation of the game you were talking about:\n\nThe team lacked an actual tank while {{champion:32}}  had time to scale up and get tanky. Not only that but while you do have {{item:3111}} and {{item:3075}} you lack the health to back it up and with noone to really soak up the damage (no {{champion:64}} can't soak the damage with the build he had) then it is really easy for them to bring it back. While you do each have a little cc packed in your kits, none of you have a full blown shut them down aside from {{champion:117}} . And your winrate with {{champion:24}}  is not terrible at 56% (although the past 20 days show you at 49% which means you must have had a bit of a rough time) and you average a 2.17 kda which is not terrible either. I think you just had a bit of a mind funk in trying to get tanky and you had a team that still does not grasp resistance when losing (no not saying you were losing lane, I'm saying them losing lane.) Also, I just noticed that {{champion:37}} went AP instead of a more supportive role so combining her damage with {{champion:4}} and {{champion:32}}, it's not surprising if you were blown up rather quickly. I'm thinking based on the AP items you had and the mercurial treads that you had somewhere around 125 MR? Just a bad game really all around since noone really watched what they were building. Now on to the questions:\n\n1. I mean if you can, try to talk them through a small strategy like I do with my games. I usually tell my team the basics of a 1--4 split or 1-3-1 split because I usually play {{champion:77}} . It's time consuming but most of the time it reaps rewards because when they understand the intentions and they saw my rank 7 they tend to follow along. Communication is key. \n\n2. This really depends on your champ. For someone like {{champion:24}} , hell ya. Kill the laner and take the turret. Keep wards top side to watch for potential invades and try to apply as much pressure top. The opposing top most likely won't leave and the jungler will be forced to address you. When i play top, I try eating as much jungle ganks as possible to give my team reprieves and most of the time they take their turrets because of the lack of help their opponents are receiving. I would probably exit the lane when a second turret falls to start getting a grouping together or after taking the top turret if I have a {{item:3512}} available.\n\n3. Look to the end of answer 2.\n\n4. There is no answer because every game, most everyone believes they are right and everyone else is wrong (even I'm guilty of this). Honestly, I find it's more how you handle the stupid decisions they make then trying to pull them from making them. After being proven wrong and you being understanding, they tend to be more receptive to the words you give.\n\n5. Answer 2. And also it really depends on if you are on a split pushing champ. (which I'm sure you were already aware of)\n\n6. You make the judgement. If they engaged and you are nowhere near ready to go, don't go. This isn't LCS where you can talk in the heat of the moment to set things up. Solo Q takes time. If a fight starts bot, and you can't show, make sure the enemy team pays for what they do or do not get bot. For instance, I'm a jungle main and when I'm on {{champion:77}} , I don't gank too often. So if the enemy jungler shows top (whether he fails the gank or not) I'm taking the bot side jungle as punishment for him showing and possibly dragon.\n\n7. Take into account cc, builds, leads, etc. While you can win a 4v5, it really comes down to are ults up and how much cc can they drop on yall. Oh and are you tanky. Most of the time I just split push the opposite side because hey, I'm {{champion:77}} and that's what I do best. Although that isn't always the best decision. It's all about what you can gather before jumping in. Also will the fight end the game or not?\n\n8. {{champion:24}}  is a hyper carry but if cc'd he's like any other champion. Easy to bring down. I find that my best build with {{champion:24}} tends to be one that has {{item:3146}} first and then depending on if anyone on the enemy team is fed or not, {{item:3153}} or a tank item. And I usually go 2 damage items and 2 tank items and then the final item is debated between armor pen or more tankiness. My tank items also tend to have health on them. Rarely do I go {{item:3075}} . Usually reserved for mass Auto champs or specifically {{champion:11}} or {{champion:23}} .\n\n9. Quite the contrary on tanks. If played right, a tank can be the whole reason a team won despite being behind. I've played {{champion:78}} {{champion:57}} and {{champion:98}} and been the only one fed on my team and we still won because the amount of cc and peel that I could provide helped them be able to lay down some damage for us to win the game. It also helped that I didn't just dive the carry way behind everyone everytime. Just look at the team comp and become familiar with which champs synergize well with others.\n\n10. Keep words and pings relevant. Keeps people from just flaming you constantly. If all else fails, just split push I guess. It's something that you can control and apply pressure.\n\n\nYes, I was Gold 5 last year and currently Silver 3. Take my words with a grain of salt if you like but this is how I base my judgments in game most of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"463","date":"2017-03-20T04:02:24.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too much to read. I would argue you could extract more information and cover more bases just off of a 30 minute replay clip instead.\n\nIt's much more solid, than you just describing certain bits of the game.\n\nAnd a specific visual of where lanes are, creep waves, towers, levels, items, objective up times are important factors to determine how you're approaching the 1 v 9 game wrong.\n\nThere's a lot that goes into this game. We cant just provide a vague answer as to how to solo carry from minute 1 - 30 given the various situations you are placed in every single game.\n\nUnless you go 6/0 in lane every time, something is probably extremely wrong with your macro, but as for laning / micro you probably have it down for that specific bracket. Who knows? We need a replay.","replies":[{"poster":"CodyTonSex","date":"2017-03-20T04:04:24.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for input!","replies":[{"poster":"463","date":"2017-03-20T04:10:50.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CodyTonSex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Uc5g7Ggr,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-03-20T04:04:24.995+0000)\n>\n> Ok thanks for input!\n\nWhat champions do you play? / Which roles?\n\nNvm it seems like you only play Jax.\n\nI'm not sure what Jax does best.

You want to understand Jax and his role from the perspective of a higher tier player, since they most likely can carry with Jax in your current MMR.\n\nYou want to read probably the whole guide, there might be new information you don't even know about Jax with abilities items or skill prioritization.\n\nThis should be a good start. Gold 5 isn't difficult to carry imo, most games are easily taken advantage of / hostage if you have the capable skill set.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
