Is it to counter champions like Katarina from getting a pentakill or something? Regardless, this shit just drives me up the damn wall, especially Fiddle&#039;s 2.5 undodgable fear. There shouldn&#039;t be a ability in the game where it has a 7 second cooldown, prevents movement of any sorts, and is undodgable in the game, QSS has a 90 second cooldown, meaning that they can use their 7 second cooldown ability 12 times before QSS is even back up again.\r\n\r\n{{champion:9}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:26}}","replies":[]}
