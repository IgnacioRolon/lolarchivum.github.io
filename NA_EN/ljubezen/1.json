The old system was dumped because it was poorly designed. The new one is better, but there will always be people who are unhappy and try to ruin the experience regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2018-01-03T23:37:03.000+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your comment, but have one caveat. \n\nIf, for some highly unusual reason, that a plumber is obligated to groom a dog, I would expect it to be done and performed with a modicum of competence.

It was just a method; it was still up to you to ask politely to swap lanes and not to be a gigantic jerk to claim a lane and stick with it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2018-01-04T00:52:05.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Was it really so long ago that people were expected to be reasonably capable in all 5 roles when playing ranked?\n\nThey weren't. Stop saying that. During those days, people would just screw you off with pick order or still instalock, and force you to play around them. You weren't expected to play all 5 roles because you could still just pick whatever you want and expect the team to comply and play around you.\n\nRemember in those days when people would say \"(insert role) or feed\"? That happens a lot less these days.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tibold","date":"2018-01-06T02:06:12.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I main support. Because I can get it easy.
