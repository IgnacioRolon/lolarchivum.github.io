I'd think as its a tactical game more people would want to be able to play the role they actually play, and certainly you'd imagine there's more people who want to give people a choice. \n\nAlso I'd like to point out before choosing positions was a thing I suggested it and had people screaming \"no you noob it'll make 20min queue times you noob go **** yourself no wait time!\". And guess what... it's about as  fast as it always was, and honestly I doubt removing auto-fill or at least making it an option would make it much worse. \n\nThey could even just make it so you either turn off auto-fill or ONLY auto-fill so the people who don't care what position they get and just want a quick match can constantly fill the positions people don't want to play as much. But as I said I'd happily wait 20 minutes and definitely get the role I want instead of being forced to play a role I've barely ever played which basically makes the game a 4v5 right off the bat, as at that point you just spend 20+ minutes waiting to lose anyway.\n\nHell they could even just make it so you can auto-fill all you want in un-ranked but at least in ranked make it so you ALWAYS get the position you want, most pros seem to play basically 1 role, yes they have a second they can play to a lot as well but if even the pros tend to focus on 1 role with a backup then how do they expect your average joe to auto-fill into a random position and be able to do anything?","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-06-24T21:34:43.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Womp womp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VeganScout","date":"2018-06-24T17:51:27.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quiet Dude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VnB8vshN,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-24T17:49:47.251+0000)\n>\n> Majority who want short match queues &gt; minority who can’t adapt to new roles and make these posts\n\nTheres no need to segregate, like i said a simple check box where it would say \"wait more at your risk to not get auto fill\" would suffice","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-06-24T17:52:15.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Isn’t that called blind pick?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-06-25T01:14:39.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You cannot get rid of auto-fill while keeping role select.
