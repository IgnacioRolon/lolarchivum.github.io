Randomly throughout games, the client will randomly crash. At first it only happened once or twice every 20 games or so, but then the frequency of disconnects slowly rose. Now it happens almost every other game. These are the solutions I have tried:\r\n\r\n1. I have tried to redownload the client multiple times (No help)\r\n2. Put in multiple bug reports to Riot through the client (No response yet)\r\n3. Tried doing the Full Repair through the client as well (Little to no help)\r\n4. Tried using Ethernet and Wi-Fi to see if internet was the issue (still happens on both)\r\n5. Tried doing a virus scan to see if any of the files or programs might be corrupted (still nothing)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is anything I can do to stop this from happening as it is extremely infuriating...\r\n\r\nComputer Stats:\r\nMacbook Pro 15\" 2014 model\r\nIntel Iris Pro Graphics Card\r\nOS X High Sierra","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-28T22:31:57.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes we need to narrow down what the main problem is before we can fix it up!

I saw a brief period of 4-5 games where i didn't crash which was nice, but now it has started again. Any other tips that you might have?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T23:51:52.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that's pretty odd. I spoke with some of our techs and they don't believe resetting that nvram should be something you'd have to do on a regular basis just to play League. It almost sounds like something might be overheating over an extended playtime causing a crash. Be sure to check your vents really quick as a precaution, but I'd also like you to hit up those techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get their opinions on what might help better!","replies":[{"poster":"TheCrazyAsian","date":"2018-01-11T20:10:47.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, I will double check my vents and I have just put in a ticket to the techs. I will let you know what, if anything, we can figure out and thanks again for all your help. Is there a way to give people honors on this site?
