I can click and drag, but they won't drop into the item set areas. It won't even let me add anything, it will only allow me to remove them. Is this due to something wrong with my computer or something with the client? None of my other friends have had the same problem as of right now that I am aware, but I would like to get this fixed ASAP. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T17:28:41.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running on[ Mac Sierra](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/bJx6P0hX-known-bugs-in-macos-1012-sierra)?  There's currently a known issue that's preventing item sets from saving on that OS.  Setting up the list on another PC can work as a current workaround.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TheCrazyAsian","date":"2016-10-19T10:22:56.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am running on Mac Sierra currently, however, it's not a matter of them not being saved, it's that I'm unable to edit them for some odd reason.
