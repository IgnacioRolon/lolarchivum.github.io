Draft, Blind, Special, ARAM...they are all ridiculously long queue timers - It never used to be like this... WTF has happened? I haven't played in days because of this - I don't have all day to sit looking at a constantly scaling queue timer.\r\n\r\nYes I have very high win rates, my MMR is probably up at High Plat/Low Diamond level... But how hard can it be to match me with any willing players in a normal game - I'm getting incredibly bored...I just want to hit level 30 so I can ranked..","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T21:42:36.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your MMR truly is in the high plat/low diamond range at level 24, it would certainly impact your queue times. It would be pretty difficult to find players with similar skill levels below level 30 or preventing an unfair matchup by having you play against others will large champion pools and rune pages/masteries that exceed what's available at your level. A lot of this also depends on the role you select (if in draft) since roles like *Support* may provide a lower queue time.\n\nI hope this clarifies what's going on. I definitely recommend reading through our [Matchmaking FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide). Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
