One concept for ultimates is to overcome your weakness for a short window of power.\n\nIf you move the knockback to his Q, that would mean that you basically killed his weakness. Since he can peel himself more reliably and more often.\n\nThey can't do this, otherwise Aurelion Sol would be hell of imbalanced.

Ideally, you'd want a champion to have the lowest skill floor and highest skill ceiling possible, and while not every champion will be easy to pick up, every champion needs to have at least some baseline level of effectiveness, so that you can do at least okay in your first few matches. One of Aurelion's main issues right now is that it can take a very long time before you get the hang of him, and before that he can feel a bit too difficult to control effectively.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShaolinToilet","date":"2017-01-25T21:58:15.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is rumbles skill floor and skill ceiling?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-01-25T18:58:11.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whatever you do, please keep the BOOP line.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-01-25T21:47:17.315+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh making him say ''Boop'' whenever a star Boops an enemy champion, the satisfaction goals wouldbe fullfilled.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-01-25T21:49:58.799+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think the other \"roam\" mages {{champion:4}}  {{champion:163}}  could also be looked at too in order to make what they bring to the table more clear?\n\n{{champion:163}} - Environment creating/shaping \n{{champion:136}} - \"Grand Entries\" or initiation\n{{champion:4}}  - high single target damage and disruption\n\nso this way they dont \"overlap\" or \"overshadow\" each other and cause problems like how {{champion:163}} gave {{champion:4}} a run for his money?

And why don't you make his q be able to detonate immediately, or at least quicker. And/or making it so whenever I get stunned I don't get dropped with 100% certainty. I understand his intentional weakness, but I think he gets too heavily punishrd by cc and champs with gap closers. They jump on you, you peel, they jump on you again and you're dead. He's my favorite champio ln and I like his skill floor and ceiling. Tbh I like being the only bronze player to play him (and be good with him) I hope what I love about him isn't taken away.
