He's no less an assassin playstyle than others, but he's the only one you won't dumpster, which means assassins aren't the problem: Riot's perception of them is. You have favorites.

No. I've ganked many Yasuos, in normals and in rank, and made them go like 2/11 or 2/13. I remember I ganked this one Yasuo. Got him killed. He decided to walk back in lane again, I decided to gank again and get him killed. or even when I'm Fizz and face him in lane, he gets destroyed. Honestly, I don't see why they made Yasuo really weak now. To me, he was finally balanced when they fixed his retarded 5,000 shield damage that lasted for 2 years and was up every second or two. Once his shield wasn't as much a problem as it was on release, he was A LOT easier to face against from then on. I could finally beat him without that retarded shield lasting so long and taking up so much damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2014-10-14T12:04:29.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I didn't find anything of him so powerful though, and I've been fighting against him many times. Probably because I played him a lot too I know what he can and what he can't do and what mistakes ppl do:\n\n1) Melees try to keep distance because they are afraid of his first 2 Qs and then they will get the 3rd tim to time allowing him to free farm ignoring that they can outscale him either by tankiness/sustain or by damage/sustain.\n\n2) Rangeds keep waiting for QWER him without luring the wall first and then they get pissed of if a decent Yasuo uses it to save his arse. They ignore that: most of their skills won't be blocked anyway (I saw ppl claiming that Yasuo wall was OP trying to Wind Wall my Xerath's Q... ), they can make his shield pop up at will leaving him defenseless.\n\nAny1 who practiced either with or against Yasuo agrees that he is more than controllable and suffers from the same issues that other melee carries do. I've never said that he is weak and I kinda agreed with most of the small nerfs he had and the buff (Shield reset after ulti), I just don't understand why would you make him the weakest in lane when enemies can jump on him and win already (you won't have an easy Q stacking before you build at least Zerker Greaves).\n\nAlso, Zed has a far easier way of dealing damage. I want to remeber that he has a point&click ultimate that alsos erves as a gap closer. Similar to this other melee carries and Assas have ultimates that can be used at will while Yasuo has to: hit 2 times a target, hit the 3rd time a telegraphed skillshot or dash into the enemy team, use the ultimate and then stick to the target/s to make use of the passive (if the enemy has armor from runes/masteries/items, if not, the passive is useless).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"quetzalcÃ´atl","date":"2014-10-16T22:57:02.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because yasuo dosent have items that make his ult worthless","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jjookkeerr","date":"2014-10-14T09:12:08.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Zed's strong when well played, no argument, particular when picked into the right matchups/with the right team.
