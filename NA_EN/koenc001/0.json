Having more than enough IP, I go into the shop, the first page loads, when I click on champions it gives me a login screen similar to one you would find when trying to access a web hosting control panel (has a realms line). I have tried every button and idea, but it will not let me into the store, it will either tell me my session has expired or give me a bunch of random characters in black font on a black background. Any idea if I can fix this?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-18T06:39:13.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a trick:\n\nhttps://www.playonlinux.com/fr/app-1135-League_Of_Legends.html\n\n\"The big one, the in-client store has issues, but they can be fixed. Anytime you log in, immediately click on your profile, go to champions and click on a champion. Wait a moment, the skin price and champ price should show up. Now you can click on the store icon.\"","replies":[{"poster":"koenc001","date":"2016-10-19T02:41:34.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems to work, I had thought you could only buy them directly from the store, Thanks for the help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T01:23:06.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as it pains me to say this as a fellow Linux user, I cannot assist you in troubleshooting this because [we don't officially support Linux](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements/). \n\nSince you're using PlayOnLinux, I recommend reaching out on [their forums](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/forums.html) for assistance with troubleshooting this.
