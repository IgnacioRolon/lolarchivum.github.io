When I first tried  to update league to patch 7.16 I kept getting this error where it would download the patch properly until a certain point, then the middle top part of the league window would stop showing the MBs left to download and the download speed and it would say \r\n\"0 files scanned\". Despite this, the part of the percentage downloaded would continue to rise up to 99% where it would show an error saying \"Unspecified Error has occurred\". After trying to patch it several times I decided to reinstall league. Now it will download until the 33% checkpoint. Then after 70%-80% the exact same problem as with the initial patching will occur. I have tried a lot of ways to fix this through league support pages but the problem doesn't seem to fix ( link of a support page example is in the link box ) and o have tried reinstalling several times. I need further advice on how to solve this as it has frustrated me a lot and i would like to play league on the following weekend.\r\nThanx for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-31T18:54:27.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of that content is old and may no longer be relevant.  After 33%, your patcher is done scanning game files and needs to connect to the patching server to download updates.  Something with your network is blocking that from happening.
