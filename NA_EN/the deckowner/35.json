It is NOT even RNG. It is pseudo-RNG and there is a *massive* difference.\n\nEveryone seems to think \"If they only have 10% Critical Chance, then each shot only has a 10% chance to crit\" and they get angry when that crit goes off because they view it as a low-chance BS thing. *This is completely false if you know how the game engine works*.\n\nUsing League's PRNG system (just like DOTA's), if you have 10% Critical Chance then your first auto-attack has less than 10% chance to crit and every auto-attack that does not crit raises the chance of the next auto-attack being a crit until you get a crit, then it resets. This means that having 10% Critical Chance will get you a crit *roughly* 1 shot in 10 pretty consistently. \n\n***Yes, just running a single Critical Chance rune will give you a guaranteed crit eventually - all the more reason the runes need to go so you actually have to invest in crit items.***\n\n* \"Why don't we make Critical Chance just double damage every X attacks???\"\n\nBecause *that's already how it works* for one thing. Riot has stated repeatedly that they like crit not being 100% predictable because it makes interesting things happen and prevents horribly abusive gameplay.\n\n***Imagine if {{champion:41}} could buy {{item:1051}} then just auto-attack minions X times then Q you in the face, knowing that it was a guaranteed crit every time like clockwork. That sounds like so much fun right?***\n\n* Critical Strike has \"zero strategy, skill, or brain activity\".\n\nThis applies to basic attacks in general. What \"skill\" does building AP to do more damage show off? Is there any mechanical skill in building tank items and relying on inherent CC/base damage to do things? There is zero micro decisions to be made on most items in the game - it's all just macro decisions of \"what items let me do my job best?\"\n\n* Critical Strike has no counter-play!\n\nAgain, neither do basic attacks in general. They are target, resourceless, and have almost no cooldown. Marksmen and Mages can even use them from a safe range.\n\n\ntl;dr - *Critical Strike in League is just like {{champion:4}} Loaded Dice passive, emphasis on \"Loaded\"; just because you get different amounts of gold every minion kill doesn't make it random. If you last-hit every minion in a wave you will get the same amount of gold every wave. If you buy X% Critical Chance you will get a certain number of crits every X auto-attacks but you won't know ahead of time which ones they will be. If you want to crit more often, buy more Critical Chance. Since most crit builds give 70+% it's hardly random by mid-late game.*\n\n***If crit needs to be removed from laning, then remove crit component items like {{item:1018}} {{item:1051}} and make it only a stat on completed items.***","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-09-03T18:15:17.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"psudo RNG is still RNG, something that you can not control, observe, predict, nor avoid.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-09-03T22:06:21.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except... you can...","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-09-03T22:23:51.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can you tell if my 1% crit rune is gonna make me crit next auto? no you can't.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-09-04T05:17:18.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you got a crit recently, you probably won't crit on your next attack.

It's controlled by an algorithm and that algorithm can be modified however you want.\n\nLike this: Below 50% Critical Strike Chance, the next attack after a critical strike has a 0% chance to crit. This prevents double crits when you only have 10-20% Critical Chance. *Seriously though, how often has this EVER happened to anyone?* It's extremely unlikely to happen since crit is actually a controlled system and not pure, random chance - it's PRNG *specifically to avoid these cases*.\n\nThe computer essentially rolls the dice ahead of time, so it's possible to put all kinds of rules to dictate the behavior of when you crit and how often based on how much you've actually invested in it. ***The only limit for making the rules healthy and fair is your own imagination and knowledge of game design***.\n\n\"Has no place in League of Legends\", \"can only be a % damage increase on all basic attacks\"\n\n***Riot has stated repeatedly why they never want this to happen and why it would be terrible for game health***.

I agree with Riot's effort to make IE unattractive as a first item, as it's one of the best late items.  However, because IE is very expensive, dependent on other crit/attack speed items, and because those crit/attack speed items suck to rush, it makes the build very sensitive to match length.  That's not only the time when the match ends, but it's also the time when the game starts becoming decided/snowballed - which makes the pen build so attractive as ADC \"comes online\" much earlier.  \n\nAlso worth noting is how much defensive itemization exists solely to counter autoattackers (Ninja Tabi % reduction, Warden/Frozen Heart %attack speed reduction, and Randuin's %crit reduction).  Honestly, autoattacking is one of the most dangerous ways to deal damage because you need to remain at risk for a prolonged period of time (as opposed to burst damage), and the reward is not always worth it (single target damage from glassy champions with low utility).  \n\nRiot could fix it by slowing down the earlygame (no first tower gold, nerf drags, buff towers), but I doubt that'll happen.  Item-wise, they could make the build-up to IE/RH less punishing or more flexible (but, again, I'd want to avoid a situation when IE is both the best first and best lategame ADC item).  Maybe make crit more accessible on (cheaper?) items without gimmicks (all zeal upgrades) and also on good first items that aren't IE.  That way you could start with an AD item that has crit, build your crit/attack speed item 2nd, then build IE late as intended, but get a bigger payoff at that time.  Alternatively, they could nerf the penetration items (to be fair, I think Ghostblade probably deserves a nerf).  Lastly (and I think this is bigger than most think), Riot can rebalance the champions themselves.  Only a few ADCs actually use the pen build particularly well, and Jhin in particular seems to be a bit too strong at the moment.\n\nOh well, just my 2 cents.
