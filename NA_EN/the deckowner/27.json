If you have 1000 HP it will take 34 auto attacks to kill you (30 x 34 = 1020). If you look at this in Effective HP, 233 Armor and 1000 HP is 3330 eHP (1000 x 233%). We now compare the full 100 AD to eHP because it isn't mitigated anymore (100 x 34 = 3400). Same number of autos.\n\nAnother example will be 75% DR, or 300 Armor, vs the same 100 AD 0 pen auto attack. \n\n100 AD would do 25 damage to the target, and with the same health pool of 1000, it would take 40 autos to kill them. (25 x 40 = 1000)\nIn effective HP the target would have 4000 eHP, so the 100 AD auto would take 40 autos to kill the target (100 x 40 = 4000). Still the same number of autos between normal HP and eHP, right? If we add just _10 points of armor_ to make it 310 Armor, it will take 1 more auto to kill the target because their eHP shot up by 10% to 4100 making the needed autos to kill 41. So even though that 10 armor only increased their DR by ~0.6%, it gave them 10% more eHP.\n\nIf you wanna do the more complicated math instead of nice neat numbers, feel free, and I hope this made sense.
