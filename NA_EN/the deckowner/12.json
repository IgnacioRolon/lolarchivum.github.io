Zed's ult doesn't give him up front burst but delays it so enemies have time to react (lifesteal, zhonyas, exhaust). His w has a long cd so if he uses it you can abuse him. He has some range and easy minion executes so he his laning phase doesn't get trashed on but neither should he dominate it. Q can be juked\n\nYasuo has plenty of mobility which kinda sucks and requires you to understand what his objective is. If you can accurately predict where he's going to dash to (watch your minions to see which he is targeting, or he might be going at you) then deal damage there. Better yet if you're ranged you want to get him on the first dash as he's approaching minions. The first minion is way more predictable than the 2+, if he's already in the wave maybe back off a bit and respect it. He can't get his knockup unless he's in the thick of things fighting so once again zoning properly will help stop that threat, it's also a skillshot and can be dodged. Baiting out his shield and passive is also possible so they definitely have counterplay. In fact I think yasuo was designed to have so much counterplay it's crazy. If the yas is really good then he can wreck but if his opponent can properly punish he can't do much. \n\nAnd no, I'm a squishy immobile mid lane mage main {{champion:143}}.

The real issue with her though is that it's so easy for her to get in and then out right away. With Zed or yas they need to stick around to get their damage down and I can fight them then, use my exhaust(always worth it) and punish them for going in.
