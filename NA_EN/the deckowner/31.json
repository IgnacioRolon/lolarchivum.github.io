For sure, it's always good to question the rules, understand why they exist, and find exceptional cases where those rules don't apply, or at least not as much, but designs like Yasuo, Kalista, Zoe, etc. don't really do that. They break the rules, but do so in a manner that neither makes any tradeoffs nor gives their opponents any further options, and so predictably cause horrendous interaction problems with other champions. Zoe's randomness isn't there because it's under tight control so that it remains fair, or because it adds fun gameplay for everyone involved, it's there because someone just decided to ignore many years' worth of warnings against RNG-based power and plonk it in. It may make the champion more interesting in the short term, but it's tremendously detrimental to the game overall, and is likely to be yet another constant pain point in League's overall design for months, even years to come.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-12-03T22:09:38.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean if she couldn't get them from minions her W would be borderline useless outside of teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2017-12-03T23:02:11.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Outside of stealing a summoner spell, one of the most powerful and potentially game changing actives in the game, on top of being able to steal many active items, she still mostly relies on her EQQ combo.

It's triggered on enemy summoner/item usage or minions that are tagged with a balloon.  Not only that you can clearly see the shard and it also has to be picked up before it can be used.\n\nThe only random aspect is the minion that appears on average once every other creep wave if she is in lane and has the ability leveled.  This mechanic has an extremely minimal impact on the game overall.\n\nIf you are good enough to harass/zone/counterplay when your opponent is going for CS then you can EASILY zone her from picking up a shard because she will have to move out of position 95% of the time to obtain it.","replies":[{"poster":"Myozthirirn","date":"2017-12-05T10:42:45.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can even deny the drop to begin with.
