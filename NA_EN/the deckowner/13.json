Like Riot, they can't favor balance over profits. Zed isn't getting nerfs because to the unexperienced player or the non-player (in other words, the biggest customers and the potential customers), he is the absolute most fun champion to watch play. A dark, edgy shadow-ninja who can teleport and kill enemies while laughing darkly? Yeah. He might as well be their logo. Ninjas are always in. \n\nLikewise, though using a necessarily different business strategy, new decks are completely structured around you buying certain specific cards so you can win for a few months before they'e banned. After which, the cycle repeats and you buy the new broke cards before they're banned.
