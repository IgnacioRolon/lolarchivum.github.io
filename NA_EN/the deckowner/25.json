The first being that Dynamic Queue throw things out of balance by throwing the rules out the window. This rule functions under the example of abuse cases in which players of a clearly higher caliber are finding ways to play in lower leveled tier games to bring up their friends or suitably money wealthy internet acquaintances. \n\nThis is of course as i've already mentioned, an abuse case, and the vast majority of dynamic ranked is really just people joining games with friends (my case family) and playing higher competitive gameplay.\n\nThe second misconception is that Dynamic degrades the sanctity of MMR balance by introducing wider pools of players to cause greater skill disparity and uneven matches.\n\nThis assumption is also false unless the player has reached a state of longer climbing due to whatever short coming they have preventing further climbing. Considering much of ranked IS ALL ABOUT THE CLIMB in order to find your own skill level, matches will never be truly balanced to begin with because there will always be people in matches with exceptional skill that simply havent ranked out of that MMR yet making their way up.\n\nFor example I've done Duo Q with my brother all season so far. Started Bronze 4 and made it to Silver 5 yesterday. he's gone from Bonze 3 to Silver 1 (he has double the ranked games I do since he enjoys league much more recreationaly than I me) and is at 96LP. \n\nIn game 90% of the time we call out about our own team or the enemy team it's <X isn't very good it seems. dont fear/trust them> and we almost never call out that we're impressed by anyone's display of skill and to trust or fear them in turn. He and I are still well into our climb and still havent made it into our own tiers, thus making our matches imbalanced inherently regardless of Dyna Q.\n\nDyna Q only ever trumps Solo Q in combating groups abusing solo players and in Dyna Q being used to abuse Rank stagnation for un-earned ELO.","replies":[{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-08-04T04:45:49.448+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your right that games were never truly balanced with the previous system, however before though the individual player used to be the most influential variable in each that game that would naturally climb over constant games if their skill level was above those in said games. The only thing holding you back from climbing was your self. It does throw out balance since it allows players who have normally not been allowed to play with/against each other that while increasing the number of constraints on the matchmaking system that cuts corners in order to have reasonable queue times because of those said constraints. Not to mention that the current system will never to come close to accurately measure communication to help balance teams which has a great amount of influence on winning or losing. Climbing out of bronze isn't difficult since those player lack significant mechanics, game knowledge, or both that solo players can take advantage of to carry the game consistently. However I would say that the problem of dynamic queue becomes noticeable starting in high silver where its a mix of bronze, silver and gold players being incorrectly matched together with a similar problem in the elos above.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-08-04T05:52:04.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"Say what will you will, implying you are no longer a factor in your games, sounds suspiciously like elo hell.\n\nEDIT: And as usual, you're not telling me what exactly premades accomplish, only using hazy words like \"communication\".","replies":[{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-08-04T06:36:30.101+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your still a important factor but the existence of premades alone have created new factors.

S4 and S5 were MOUNTAINS above this season competition-wise due to lack of accountability for dynamic queue groups.
