Why do you think almost every pro game is 4+ adcs in it. Look at the finals teams were running kindred none stop or jungle graves none stop cause the meta fits AD type champions so well. I just hope the mage rework actually brings some balance back to the mage side. Mages are pretty much supports at this point that deal ehh damage and really only their to cc for the ADC god.\n\nWhy I've just been playing jungle most of this split I find it very boring to play mid atm, due to how enemy can just pick corki and click on a minion then go make some tea for the next 5mins cause the game is playing for itself. Then when he comes back he has 2 kills cause he actually doesn't need to use anything other then the games pre-programmed AA that automatically work without the player doing anything. \n\nThis has been the worst split to watch in general and play mages in that there has been. It really is a shame that riot would even consider making the split like it is. Just shows you the level of people that don't actually care for the game or it being a interesting experience to play. Honestly from what I have been seeing with the mage rework. I am not even sure if this is actually going to bring mages back to the lime light. No AD item nerfs or champion nerfs, while Ap items actually become worse in terms of ap and mana regen. From my perspective the only champions that might even be good will be the reworked mages. The rest will just fall behind cause riot doesn't seem to care. \n\nAlthough if this prediction is wrong, which probably won't be. Then only thing that is going to happen is the new rework mages will be nerfed hardcore cause the ADC gods can't have any other champions actually posing a threat to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-04-24T11:06:59.355+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"6.
