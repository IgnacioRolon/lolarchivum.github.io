I'm still missing mastery 3+ on champions that I _know_ how to play, but haven't played recently or often enough. I have over 4000 games played; I'm not a newbie. If the system came out earlier, I would have mastery 5 on a TON of champions.\n\nI totally get where you're coming from, but your solution only works for new(er) players to the game. Veteran players are still missing masteries. It will take time to catch up 100%, if it ever happens... I personally don't want to grind mastery levels just to be \"allowed\" to use my champion pool...","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-08-31T05:21:01.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even mastery 2 just to filter out ppl who 1st time things in ranked would help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-08-31T13:41:45.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> People shouldn't be allow to play champions they never played in ranked\n\nSo...
