It would become an item for supports, but supports don't get enough gold to reliably put Rylai's in their build.  I'd much rather have the HP on it nerfed than the AP.\n\nReally though, 40-50 AP is absolute garbage for a mage item.  Even Zhonya's (which I don't usually buy anymore from it's massive loss in AP) has 60 AP on it.  I could see Rylai's being nerfed to 80 AP, but beyond that would seem a bit excessive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2016-07-20T04:15:19.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3009}}","replies":[]}]}
