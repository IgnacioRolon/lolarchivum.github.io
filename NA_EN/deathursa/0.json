My internet dropped on me twice and by the time I can ever reconnect (i know how to catch up and play safe I'm never really gone for long if anything were to happen) I get leaver (remake) status. So I got the 5 game priority queue, and demoted to gold 4 and I managed to get myself together and get to 95 lp getting ready to get back into my series or whatever and the game literally says cannot connect to server mid loading screen. I hit retry and it goes back into loading but I can't hit any buttons. The game is stuck on my screen. Can't even ctrl- alt- dlt. I'm just stuck there watching everyone leave base. And renek too starts spanning chat: \"REMAKE, MAKE THIS GUY LOSE\"\nWhile my duo is trying to explain that I'm having tech problems.\n\nAnd with no other option all i could do is just shut my cpu off and just kinda give up on life.\nBy the time I reset my computer I'll get the  status and be banned for a day or however you guys go about the punishment system.\n\nIs there anything you can do to help\n\nUpdate: I just tried to play a game to get the low priority queue out of the way. Put fill and got support and all. Game doesn't want to go into loading. By  time I get it to work /remake out of loading.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T16:51:57.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely sounds like a crappy situation, and I'd like to help get this resolved so you can climb back up that ladder.  Some troubleshooting is certainly required here, otherwise, you'll keep getting errors and continue to escalate your [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) level.  Your specific issue sounds like your network is having problems connecting to the game server, which may result in that error or a black screen.
