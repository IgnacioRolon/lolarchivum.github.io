It would be grate if you could actually report players that do this but riot does not care because its silver and that&#039;s where they keep the bad players. personally i think that you should be able to quit the game you are in if you get trolls that just want to throw and don&#039;t care is they lose. Now if i get into a game like this i know the game is lost at the 5 min mark but still have to sit through the next 15 min just to be able to start a surrender vote (witch we all know will get rejected because the trolls just want to see you suffer) and then have to wait for the enemy team to be tired of having fun killing you at founten over and over and finish the game. i just want riot to fix this by making it able for players that actually want to get wins and get out of silver to maby just maby quit out of a lost game or not lose lp if these games happen. i know riot wont read this but i just want to let people know of this annoying thing that ruins the league of legends game for so many other players and is the reason that some players don&#039;t get to the division they should be in. Thank you for reading this if you got this far that is.","replies":[{"poster":"x R e n g a R x","date":"2016-05-26T23:06:54.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep complaining. I went from s2 to gold 4 in like a week and a half SOLO. You're just not good enough dude. \n\nEvery bronzie and silver scrub think they deserve a gold and plat border. 70% of low elo players are delusional. \n\nI've even overheard people talking about league at uni and they say the same thing 'yeah im silver but i play so much higher than that'...blah blah blah.\n\nJust stop. STOP it.\n\nNot even when I was in bronze did I think or say I should be at a higher elo. I worked for it and improved and got there EASILY when the time came. \n\nSick and tired of seeing delusional people posting the same nonsense as this all the time for YEARS.\n\nJust stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Athyglisprestur","date":"2016-05-27T18:20:32.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im saying that if silver division was not full of trolls than everyone would get to higher elo im going back and forth from s1 to s2 because of trolls i win 90% of games where i dont get trolls so i if there were no troll i would be in gold easy. you got to gold by not getting trolled every other game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pentarina Only","date":"2016-05-26T22:37:16.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I hate the most is that 1 individual that convinces the team we can win even though we've gotten none of the enemy turrets and they've gotten 2 of our inhibitors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2016-05-26T22:38:12.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Try being support main in silver.
