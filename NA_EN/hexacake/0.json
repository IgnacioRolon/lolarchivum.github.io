Also, TheOddOne said that whenever he heard the crowd clap or cheer when they didn't have vision he'd just time dragon, so it *really is* ruining the integrity of the game if there are not sound proof booths for next season. \r\n\r\nIt just seems like Riot is being stubborn about it even if it is ruining or altering the outcome of some games.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-07-31T16:52:21.332+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think 100% sound proof booths would be ideal, the fan interaction is imho necessary when trying to make a game into a spectator sport which is how LoL has to be to be a successful (profitable)  staple e-sport. \n\nThat's not to say that it isn't a problem. While I don't know if this is already the case or not but there are sound deflection screens (you can see them around drummers in a lot of bands for sound balance) that could be easily implemented to reduce the overall oppressiveness of the crowd's cheering.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2014-08-04T01:06:24.619+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"From my experience on stage, the crowd may encourage the players, but the noise itself doesn't help the team's play. \n\nMost of the live game runs on a delay of several seconds. Actions in the moment occur well before the crowd can possibly react to it, and by extension, if a player could pull any information from the crowd noise it would not be useful. That information (noise) isn't actionable.\n\nA few people (including OP) mentioned pro players who set a dragon timer when they hear a commotion in the crowd. The crowd noise/chanting is too unpredictable to be realistically used this way. Think about all the \"BALLS\" shouts you've been hearing lately on the streams. If you're on stage as a pro player, all you can really pull from the crowd is a binary noise vs no noise, because even something like \"BALLS\" usually comes across as \"edowifjndos!\" \n\nThirdly, the teams that do try to secure an advantage from 'bad data' through audience chatter usually pay for it in the game. With the boss headphones and white noise, its not terribly hard to ignore the external chatter, especially when you roll into the same studio every weekend. But occasionally I hear a player asking their team about what the crowd noise was for, and each time they get punished for paying attention to external factors instead of the live game happening right in front of them. The teams that trust their teammates and their own skill get by much better than those trusting the audience for guidance on plays. \n\nI'm not the Rioter who makes the call on whether or not to have a booth or deflection screen, but if that person came to me for my thoughts, I'd say that since noise vs noise is still an issue with these sound mitigation options, installing them is an unnecessary detriment to the overall LCS experience.","replies":[{"poster":"The Scyphozoa","date":"2014-08-05T07:58:34.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">But occasionally I hear a player asking their team about what the crowd noise was for, and each time they get punished for paying attention to external factors instead of the live game happening right in front of them. \n\nBut that's a problem, isn't it?

Touching on a point from a different comment tree, this feels more like an issue with perception v. reality when it comes to booths.

Using booths in conjunction with the headsets *seems *like it would work, but apparently sound doesn't behave that way because of science and I don't want to stray too far from my expertise. :P\n\nGiven that the current methods already obscure the noise of the audience, the case becomes players hearing any external noise vs players not hearing any external noise. If you want to cut out all external noise from the pro players, a booth isn't going to cut it.

Thinking about my own experiences attending traditional sporting events(non esport)  I have found that crowd interaction only enhances the experience.  Growing up in Minnesota I grew accustomed to attending professional events in the Metrodome,  a venue famous for its pretty ridiculous ambiance and found the player/spectator relationship is what makes the experience entertaining and special.  The game is made for the players,  while the sport is made for the fans. Fans dictate the popularity  of the sport,  and for the interest of the sport and Riot as a company,  making fans feel like they are a part of the action should be top priority.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VayneThePain","date":"2014-08-02T02:36:01.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2014-08-01T04:36:27.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":">On multiple occasions the players have said that they can hear the crowd whenever they start to yell/chant something (Curse vs. Col game the crowd yelled \"fight!\" and the players couldn't hear each other). Is it really worth it to sacrifice the competitive integrity of the LCS just so Riot can have \"more fan interaction,\"\n\nThis is a poor example. When the crowd is loud, **both **teams cannot hear anything. Neither team gains an advantage. Competitive integrity however can be lost during  surprise plays, particularly during early games. \n\nUltimately though, when it comes to sound booth it needs to be a decision made by pro players. The *16 teams going to the World* should vote on this and other controversial matters. It is not the say of fans, nor Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Strossus Gran","date":"2014-08-06T19:27:50.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the teams should give their input...but uh...yeah no, it is Riot's say, 100%.  its their deal, not the teams.  If it fails because of stuff like this its on Riot, not the teams, which is why they should be interested in gathering input (until I hear an emphatic 'no they refuse input' from the ownership of the teams participating, I will assume Riot does get their input because they do a lot more things than they stand up and say they're doing because its mostly mundane).","replies":[]}]}]}
