Please Help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello fellow League players, or staff!\n\nI have been having some major problems that are just occurring today, April 23, 2017. This has only begun to happen today, and I am super sad to be having such a bad experience. Before I continue, I just want to say that I have used the same client so far, and I haven't had this issue at all since I've been playing. \n\nWhenever I want to play League of Legends, it is always normal for me to go into queue for either Ranked or Normals, and I will usually go through the champion select perfectly fine. \n\nMy only problem is loading up into the loading screen before the game starts. Every single time champion select is done and we wait to go into the game, I am always met with a crash, and bugsplat loading up, explaining to me that there has been an error. Typically, I send an error report, and try to reconnect.\nOnly this time, it does it again, and again, and again.\n\nIt crashes so many times to the point where I can't even play the game, resulting in remakes, and players reporting me.\nCurrently, I am in a 20 minute low-priority queue because of this, and I am very unsatisfied with this.\nCan anyone tell me what is going on, and how I can fix this?\n {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-23T23:05:46.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're seeing that bug splat, it sounds like something might be corrupted in your League install directory. Check out the steps in our [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) and you should be able to prevent those crashes in the future.\n\nI definitely don't want you to be getting those low-priority queues, so let's be sure to do this troubleshooting in a custom game or with the practice tool.","replies":[]}]}
