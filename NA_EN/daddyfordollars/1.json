We&#039;re talking and hitting it off for a bit. She asks me where i&#039;m from, okay that&#039;s cool. I tell her i&#039;m from where i am (about 10 minutes from her) she&#039;s like &quot;oh cool&quot;. She tells me how she&#039;s from a city that is like an hour or two away and so obviously i&#039;m assuming she&#039;s swiping on tinder in an area far away to... meet up with people she likes and go out! Obviously she liked me if she swiped right on me! She even started the conversation off very interested!\r\n\r\nSo we&#039;re talking yada yada and i start pressing how we should hang out. After all she&#039;s only gunna temporarily be here y&#039;know? And she kinda ignores it. So i press a bit more and i just flat out say &quot;how does 9 sound?&quot; because most dating experts recommend being forward and getting to the point.\r\n\r\nSo i get blocked/ removed off tinder. No problem, just deleted from her/ out of her life to never see her again.","replies":[]}
