We talked about the past, we showed each other our phones to show we weren&#039;t talking to other people and we chatted and laughed mostly. We argued a bit. It got late and the night ended on a slightly bad note cause we started talking about something i wanted to talk about, but nothing serious. We even hugged and got close to each other. Overall,  pretty well.\r\n\r\nThe next day she had college classes- 9-3:15. So i messaged her around  1230 and said something basic and nice  &quot;have a great day today&quot; and figured she might actually be busy so she&#039;d respond at like 3:30 when she got out.\r\n\r\n3:30 comes around and nothing. So i wait till almost SIX and finally i have to reach out to her again. I make something up so it seems like i have a reason to contact her and i say &quot;hey, theres an event going on in X and its gunna be for a few days, wanna come with?&quot; She starts asking details and then hits me with a &quot;i&#039;ll let you know whats going on.&quot;\r\n\r\nI get annoyed and say&quot; can&#039;t you just LITERALLY look at your work schedule and see when you&#039;re off?&quot;\r\n\r\nShe ignores this and said she went to her friends house to do schoolwork. I later asked her if she&#039;s gunna check her schedule and what her snapchat is. \r\n\r\nShe proceeds to respond to those questions with &quot;im at dinner&quot; notice how she&#039;s not telling me when she&#039;s free (PURPOSELY BY THE WAY. I SAW HER MESSAGES TO FRIENDS  ON FACEBOOK AND SHE TELLS THEM WITHOUT HESITATION HER SCHEDULE) another thing to note is that i got onto her FB before and saw that she looked up other guys (usually bigger dudes with beards &quot;manly guys&quot; but almost NEVER looked me up. i don&#039;t doubt she may have had another profile for this, but still.)\r\n\r\nSo now i&#039;m getting ANGRY and i start mocking her and being childish essentially. She proceeds to just  say &quot;stop. im at dinner.&quot; which, by the way guys, i had NO way of knowing she was at dinner because she purposely withheld this information from me. So i&#039;m confused as to how she expects me to KNOW this. Then we just argue.\r\n\r\nWhat happened? Where did i go wrong? I had this vision in my head where we would slowly start going on dates and rebuilding attraction. Was she just looking for closure? She was &quot;too busy&quot; to text me all day but not busy for her friend or going out to dinner or doing all sorts of &quot;fun activities&quot; but had no time to send a simple text?  &quot;Dude she&#039;s not intersted&quot;  \r\n\r\nIf she&#039;s not interested why has she not been with anyone else sexually aside from me( i&#039;m her first) and why did she agree to meet me late last night and spend hours talking? Did i overthink it? Is there any hope now?\r\n\r\nThis girl doesn&#039;t realize i&#039;m risking a lot wasting my time in the current state (like i live in florida where theres no job opportunities) by staying with her and  she doesn&#039;t understand/ care about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know i&#039;m a bad person guys, but i&#039;m just really distraught about this. I had a vision of what was going to actually happen and it didn&#039;t happen like that at all.\r\n\r\nI know i &quot;shouldn&#039;t have blown her up&quot; but it&#039;s SO obvious she&#039;s purposely ignoring me. Even you guys can tell this. Of course she&#039;ll say&quot; i was seriously busy&quot; but c&#039;mon. We know the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere did i go wrong? I tried to truly and geniunely apologize to her. I really wanted a fresh start with her and had a vision we would start going on dates again and having fun and she&#039;d eventually start coming back to my place. Instead i texted her &quot;have a good day&quot; and she ignored me the whole day. Literally. On purpose. Then she says i&#039;m &quot;harassing her&quot;. Dude! We just had a 3 hour long talk last night at a dunkin donuts! What the fuck I&#039;M harassing YOU!? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT IF YOU DIDN&#039;T WANNA FIX THINGS?!","replies":[]}
