A shitty combination, that&#039;s what.\r\nPerfect example. I&#039;m browsing facebook and i see this cute girl that lives a city over. We&#039;ve got a mutual friend. So i add her and message her. People add people they don&#039;t know all the time. It&#039;s a social app, designed to meet and talk to people. \r\nSo i add her. She declines it. So i message her &quot; oh true&quot; and she is all like&quot; do i know you?&quot;. Okay, first off. Watch your tone with me. Second off, no you don&#039;t that&#039;s why i&#039;m adding you to get to know me. Common sense, right?\r\n\r\nSo i proceed to talk to her briefly and she states how she has a boyfriend. Her profile literally says single. Right there.\r\nNow, there is nothing odd or off about me. I&#039;m not creepy (well usually) and i&#039;m not bad looking at all. Maybe not HOT but not bad looking or creepy.\r\nSo i call her out and she says something i can&#039;t remember what (i deleted the convo) and i proceed to get annoyed and call her ratchet. She then says how  i&#039;m a fake account and to like buzz off or something and blocks me.\r\n\r\nIdk guys, i know this is a &quot;dear diary&quot; type thing but it just bugs me. I know she could&#039;ve just not been attracted to me, etc and i should just let it go.I know it&#039;s really petty but it just kinda... hurts my morale i guess.\r\nI could go on tinder or on facebook and swipe right and add people all day and try every strategy in the book. But there are just so many men and so few women on these sites. On top of that, more guys have become dicks so chicks are more on gaurd.\r\n\r\nI feel like i&#039;m just blowing smoke and wasting time trying to talk to anyone. I feel like women play way too many games too. Just kinda annoying. \r\n\r\n#RANT OVER","replies":[]}
