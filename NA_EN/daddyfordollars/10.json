IV drips calculations, etc.) and must not be a teacher for a subject.\n\n\nExample- English major and i only take english classes, then go teach english but that&#039;s ALL i can do.\n\nEDIT- I CAN DO BASIC MATH AND BASIC EQUATIONS. UP TO GRADE 12 ALGEBRA. SOME PEOPLE ARE MISINTERPRETING THINKING I CAN LITERALLY DO ZERO MATHEMATICS AT ALL.   I CAN ADD SUBTRACT AND DO BASIC ALGEBRA PERFECTLY FINE.  ","replies":[]}
