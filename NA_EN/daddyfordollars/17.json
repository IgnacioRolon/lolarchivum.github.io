Was like 5 shots including the immunoglobulin.\r\n\r\n Recently a bat flew by me again and i&#039;m unsure if it bit me or not but i know the tiny bats that are common where i live (florida) don&#039;t always draw blood from a bite.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve heard mixed things and i know the standard protocol is you get another 2 doses of the VACCINE if you&#039;ve already been treated before.\r\n\r\nDo i realistically need it or should i be immune if i had all those shots only 4 months ago?","replies":[]}
