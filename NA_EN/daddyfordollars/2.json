Should i be worried?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Not league related, but long story short like 6 days ago i got my blood drawn and the lady who did it acted just really odd/off. She didn&#039;t really look at me and when she got all the stuff ready to draw my blood it was almost as if she PURPOSEFULLY did it out of my line of sight. I don&#039;t  remember really watching her draw my blood either or checking to make sure she used new stuff. I know the protocol everywhere is single use needles. However, i called the lab and spoke to the supervisor about it. She explained that all needles are single use and that they &quot;automatically&quot; retract after drawing blood. Also, the ones that aren&#039;t automatic there is a manual sheath that goes over the needle after drawing blood. Also, she said they have syringes and vacutainers. A vacutainer can only go one way. Ie- you can&#039;t inject someone with a vacutainer. \r\n\r\n I know i sound really paranoid and a lot of people would ask &quot;why would someone risk their job to do something like that?&quot; but people do weird shit ALL the time that makes NO sense. Do you remember in the news when hiv infected people were putting hiv needles under gas station pump handles? Yeah.  I&#039;m not a complete nutjob.\r\n\r\nSo, should i be worried at all? She acted really off. It was near the end of the day so that could explain her behavior. Her supervisor called me and explained stuff out, so i have the supervisor&#039;s number. Should i call her back and ask what the person who drew my blood said and what the result of that encounter was? Do you think she won&#039;t discuss that? Could it hurt to ask? Also people (probably even you guys) seem to have this misconception that they record blood draws and there are cameras. That violates patient privacy/ privacy laws, there are no such things. In other words, it&#039;d be impossible for me to prove if this lady did something. You would have to be informed you&#039;re being recorded in a medical situation like that.","replies":[]}
