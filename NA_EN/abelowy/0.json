Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:\n\nNA: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\n\nKeep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.\n\nWe won't be able to go into the specifics of an account's exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\nMebuChan\nPlayer Support Specialist\nRiot Games\n\nI am really pissed.  I have been playing since Season 1, always completely legit.  The only thing I have done differently was that for one game a friend of mine wanted to use Curse Voice chat, I updated Curse Voice and used that instead of Skype/Ventrilo/TeamSpeak because they said their computer runs better with Curse Voice.  Now my account is banned forever... every champion unlocked, over 500 skins, 20 full runepages, COUNTLESS HOURS of playtime, over 3000 \"Normal game\" wins.  All gone because I used voice comms?  I have lodged my complaint already in appeal to the ban, but I am posting here as well.\n\nDO NOT USE CURSE VOICE.  Somehow Riot will think you're gaining an \"unfair competitive advantage\" and ban you FOREVER.  If this ban on my account is not removed I am not contributing a single click, view or dollar to Riot, ever again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T21:09:45.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been a tricky topic in the past, but I will do my best to answer it:\n\nThe short of it is yes, it's ok to use; using Curse Voice will not get you banned.  However, 3rd party programs sometimes implement new features that do violate our terms and guidelines.  Even if you don't use this feature specifically, it can get your account penalized.  Just keep an eye out for any features that may give you an unfair competitive advantage in game.\n\nHope this helps!  Let me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Dream Diver","date":"2016-05-18T02:22:37.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account got banned for using a 3rd party program. the only program of that kind i have in my pc is curse voice and it got perma banned. u think there is any way to get it back? tbh i didnt knwo curse voice is ilegal to use","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hamed Red Hat","date":"2016-06-24T07:11:12.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hi dear support, \nI wanted to ask u and riot a favor. It's true that i used a third party program for lol but i used it handfull times. Then i understand that this progrom would not help me or any other person. The game didn't have any excitement for me anymore. And i felt bad about the other players too. So i deleted the program and never used it again. Then after a long period of time you banned me. \nI wanted to apologize and ask u to unban my account. I promise that i won't use any third party programs. \nAgain I'm sorry for my actions and i am ashamed for what I've done. Please forgive me and let me play again.","replies":[{"poster":"REfire37","date":"2016-06-24T09:24:50.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi,i want you to ask about your ban...how long you lasted up to receive your ban?\nlike 2 months or more?","replies":[]}]}]}
