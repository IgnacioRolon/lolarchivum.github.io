So can i change my hotkey for displaying my na lcs thing or am I just dumb and you can't display it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T01:35:51.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The hotkey for those Tier 2 MSI icon emotes is the same as the mastery emote which is ctrl+6 by default. I went ahead and pulled up your account, and it doesn't look like you've bought the tier 2 version which is why the emote isn't working. The emotes are only attached to the tier 2 icons.","replies":[]}]}
