However, unlike my main, my account didn't get either blue essence mission, including after I hit 15 with it today. Is this intentional? If so, why is it intentional? Is there ever going to be a point where I feel like I have enough blue essence on this account?\r\n\r\nRunes were intended to improve the new user experience. Runes may have been seen as a barrier to entry. But the cost of filling out 2 rune pages correctly was around 2000 IP, and IP was easier to obtain. Those two pages were usually versatile enough for an AP page and Tank page or AD page and Tank page, and generic enough to fit ~15-20 champions each.\r\n\r\nI love the new diversity in runes. It's really cool to play with. However, with no essence rewards in sight for \"new players\" and sometimes drastic differences between necessary rune pages, this feels even more punishing than it did before. \r\n\r\nIn sum, if I was intended to get the BE rewards at 15, please let me know the status on that and whether they can be restored. If not, I'll be forwarding my plight to developers.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-16T02:10:04.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The BE missions was specifically used to convert all of your old runes into BE as a refund since they're no longer usable. I double checked this account, and the reason you aren't seeing the mission is just because this account [**didn't buy any runes that qualified for the refund**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908-Preseason-Update-FAQ).\n\n> So, for runes you bought before the beginning of the 2017 season, we'll give you 100 IP for each regular tier 3 rune, and 300 IP for each tier 3 quint. For any runes you bought after the beginning of the 2017 season until September 1, 2017, weâ€™ll refund the full IP cost.","replies":[{"poster":"Tayschren","date":"2017-11-17T22:21:07.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having a similar issue. I have I believe completed the missions and checked my loot tab, but I seem to be missing all the rewards as well as about 40 000 BE. After not logging in for a while I checked back and my IP had been converted to BE as normal about 10k of it. After playing a few games and not purchasing anything I am now at 975 BE. Further I was told I had about 27k of BE from runes but i received no capsules. At least none that I can find.\n\nI'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but after reading around I can't figure out what.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lmcdo","date":"2017-11-16T04:40:04.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, that's fine. I'm just a little surprised due to the staggering cost of rune pages that there wasn't any sort of \"starter\" BE. Fingers crossed that feedback gets a response.\n\nThank you for your quick response!","replies":[]}]}]}
