If you close out the patcher before while it's trying to patch, then restarting it will cause it to rescan all of your files for corruption.  Your best bet is to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up.  Then let the patcher scan all of your files, so it can continue on to patch.
