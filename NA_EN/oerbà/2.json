Would you ever change the first half to match the rest of the skins? And why was his bow killing him in the first place?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-23T22:37:40.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all death animations are the same across each champion/skin - same with respawn animations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yoniame","date":"2015-11-20T15:16:04.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you read the whole lore on lol wiki you can see Varus made a pack with god/spirit, named Owl. HIs shrine was destroyed so now he lives in that black stuff on Varus and the bow, and grants varus power, but in exchange he has to kill once in a while. If he fails the quota Owl kills him.","replies":[]}]}
