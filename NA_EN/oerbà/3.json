Maybe not like electronic/techno sounds? Like maybe classical/rock/indie music like Classic/Pentakill Sona. Or RPG type of music would be cool as well.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-13T21:23:59.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think changing the genres of music completely would change the feel of the overall skin?

There's only so much you could do within one genre compared to a lot of them.","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-07-14T20:14:09.130+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's what her skin was centered around (the electronic music).  The style of her skin specifically relates to that genre.  Putting that skin with different genres would make her feel out of place in her own skin.  I just feel that if you want different music for her, then the only way to go would be electronic.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-07-13T19:06:07.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to be able to play this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39KK7bjL2s4\n\nAlso, make it where you can choose a single ally that HAS to listen to your music.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-13T21:24:58.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ROFL, pls no.

The music get repetitive and no one bothers to turn it on anymore. \nThey really need to atleast allow u to buy new music for it\nAnd I'd recommend harder music.
