And in ARAM it's really quiet because of all the trades and ambient map noise.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-16T00:08:38.179+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, okay.

The problem isn't the music layers, just that it sounds really quiet considering all the ambient noises and team fight sounds that go on, it's almost impossible to hear. It sounds more like background music, not a DJ making beats for a club.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-28T23:51:50.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hopped into a game with DJ Sona, and I was able to hear the music without issues, aside from in team fights, which is something we're okay with.
