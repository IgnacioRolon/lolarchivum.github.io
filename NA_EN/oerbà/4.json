An MF only effect might be a possibility though, I'll pass the suggestion on to the champion update team (can't make any promises however, it's possible they had a good reason for not including one I'm unaware of or felt the time was better spent on other effects).","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2015-08-01T17:17:14.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Visually (and as a MF-only thing), a potential way to display this information without taking up as much visual space as, say, Darius or Twitch stacks (since she can ultimately apply a few more stacks than they can) could be through a single particle effect, almost similar to Tristana's new bomb effect. For example, applying the first stack could create a small stylized beating heart at the front and center of the champion's model (like a single Twitch stack but in a fixed location rather than several random ones), and increasing the stacks could make the heart bigger and have it beat faster--with a little crack through the center and a \"break apart\" animation once maximum stacks are reached with an audio indicator like BC's armor shred.\n\nAs a mechanic that is currently so central to Miss Fortune's damage output, I'm surprised a visual indicator hasn't been implemented yet. That's some pretty important information that isn't readily visible to either her or her opponents!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bondage Bunnyboy","date":"2015-08-01T03:55:14.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LFlzrgEc,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2015-08-01T03:33:48.719+0000)\n>\n> We definitely wouldn't want to show a VFX indicator for Impure Shots for all players, the exact number of stacks on units isn't important enough information for non MF players to justify the screen real estate it costs.

I feel like her E is okay at 80 mana because it's a useful zoning tool in specific areas of the jungle, but her W scaling up feels odd.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-08-01T02:08:27.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar to the visual indicator for {{champion:122}}'s passive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2015-07-31T19:52:24.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"MF is not worth the effort apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2015-07-31T22:00:27.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Buffs to early game lane bully, a cool skin, cool lore story.\n\nAlso, stay on topic, this isn't about her kit being bad (PS it isn't.), it's about adding clarity/QoL.","replies":[]}]}]}
