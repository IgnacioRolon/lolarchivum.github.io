I hope to see a reformed player out of you so that you may continue to play. Lag is frustrating but remember to not take it out on your teammates since they were not responsible. If lag is causing you to rage because it's unfair that you're lagging, try to adjust your graphics settings or get better service to eliminate the lag. I myself throw temper tantrums at inanimate objects like computers and intangible objects like my Internet service. Just keep it out of game chat. Good luck to you and remember, if you ever get frustrated, you can come here and let loose some frustration as long as you keep it constructive.
