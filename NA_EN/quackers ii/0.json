Healing is garbage until level 11. Hey, a lot of new champs hardly have any mana costs anymore (e.g. 30-50 per ability). E, again, doesn't mean much till like 4-5 levels, and you almost never want to max that first. That W dmg reduction lasts like 1 second on a 20+ second cooldown. You won't feel the difference till he's got items.\n\nNasus sustain means nothing because he can't punish anybody effectively without running through a lot of mana. Two-shotting? In what elo? He'd need like 500+ stacks while sitting in front of a marksman, which is almost never the case.\n\nHaha, those slows are peanuts the second the enemy has tier 2 boots unless you've got your own + 100% crit and a ton of attack speed on you.\n\nWhy are we talking about other champs with ACTUAL counterplay behind them?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadWooo","date":"2018-10-12T04:19:14.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Urgot is overloaded.
