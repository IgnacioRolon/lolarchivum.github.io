I got this new router Linksys AC1200+ but I'm unsure what may be causing my lag spike to hit 1500ms in one line. Been getting it... but when I use ethernet Cat5e lan cable it seems to be running really smooth? I dont get it, no spikes at all.. Or something about the wifi radio signal causing it to do that? Could it be that my laptops wireless card is dying? no idea but just guessing... that spike really bothers me during game because when In a team fight or an initiate and my champion just starts walking forward or just auto them lol..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T17:42:39.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lag spikes can be caused by a variety of issues ranging from network problems reaching the game server, or packet loss due to how your ISP is routing to us.  I recommend going through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is in good health.  The traceroute you provided is alright, but doesn't provided specific information to see how you're routing.  For that I recommend reach that IP through the [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)tool which will tell us what nodes you are visiting to get to us.
