When I&#039;m on the client I have no sound. It literally just stopped about four days ago. The client was already open and had made noise up the that point, then one moment it just stops. I do still have sound in game. I can also listen to music or whatever else while i have the client open. The client itself just won&#039;t make any sound. I haven&#039;t changed any settings, and there was no patch right before it happened. I&#039;ve checked my options, but have found nothing that suggests that my sound should be missing. I would like to avoid having the reinstall for such a small issue, but after long enough it will irritate me and I will. Does anyone have any suggestions for what might have caused this and a potential solution?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-08T17:58:06.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey cuddlykitten4 - \n\nI'm not too sure what's going on in this case, but I have a couple options for you to try out. \n\n- Check your computer volume settings, and make sure the client volume didn't get turned down. (I sometimes do this and forget, and then wonder why there's no sound. >_>)\n\n- Check your in game client sounds. You'd mentioned you didn't change them, but just to be sure. \n\n- Try a client repair. Note: This will delete any custom item sets. (It's not a full repair, it'll just check for jumbled files.)\n\nIf you're still having issues despite doing these things, please shoot a ticket to [Player Support](support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to help you bit some more in-depth options!","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2016-02-08T18:06:33.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did check my settings, and nothing was awry. You say check my computer volume settings? Is there a setting that could potentially mute out the client and not the other things I have running? I wouldn't know where to go for something that specific. How does one do a client repair? Thank you for the response. I'm sure it's something trivial in the end, and it doesn't affect my ability to play so I'm not exactly hurting for it to improve. I've noticed other posts addressing different issues with missing sound. Is it possible that perhaps the last patch did mess with the game's sound? I konw a few people who have been having issues with their client after the patch before this last one, and that you guys have been having a few issues here and there. Not that it's a big deal, these things happen. I, of course, will have to report Riot for my lack of sound, but it happens :P jk, I know you guys are doing your best and that technology is just rude sometimes :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-08T18:16:11.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Volume settings for your computer should be located in the lower right hand corner of your taskbar -\n\nhttp://imgur.com/BXlrHjS\n\nRight click -> Open Volume Mixer and you should see this: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/ooaOw95\n\nThere should be one for the LoL client, and you can adjust the sound there. Apps like Skype may turn down your client sounds when you get into a call, so keep that in mind! \n\nAs for a client repair:\n \n* Open League of Legends (but don't log in)\n* Click on the '?' button that is located in the top right corner of the window\n* Click Repair\n* Wait. The repair function can take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 30 depending on the number of corrupt files it has to repair\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
