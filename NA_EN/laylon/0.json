This issue is unique to league of legends only and I have attempted to reinstall, repair, clean reinstall graphics drivers, tried playing in windowed, fullscreen, and borderless. All still while having the same issue. I've noticed it a few times happening after i was ignited or I just died. I have stress tested my computer in 3DMark with zero black screen issues. I believe this must be a software issue or a league specific issue between my computer and the client. I played Osiris: New Dawn for over an hour last night with zero issues.

The first is the Windows 10 Game Bar, which recently was updated to perform in-game DVR. This feature has been pretty problematic over the last month, so I recommend [disabling it](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if it resolves this.\n\nIf that doesn't resolve the issue, then I'd disable Nvidia Shadowplay, since it's been causing these types of issues as well. If you can't find a setting to disable Shadowplay, I recommend closing out or uninstalling GeForce Experience entirely to see if it fixes this.\n\nLet me know if either of those worked for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Laylon","date":"2016-10-04T01:26:48.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i did both of these and the issue still appears to be happening.
