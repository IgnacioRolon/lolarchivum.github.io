It eventually went away in the game so not that big of a deal; however, while it was happening it was definitely debilitating vision wise being a huge distraction as you can imagine.\r\n\r\nJust thought I&#039;d throw it out there as i&#039;m sure you guys are finding plenty of bugs with all the changes!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-16T21:37:53.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Legalisskull, \n\nThanks for the report!

He autos it and knocks it back, his next auto is queued up to attack, but the scuttle crab leaves his range because of the knockback and he cancels the attack to move forward to get another. Then he reloads which takes long enough to walk up to scuttle again and ... repeat...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skarf","date":"2015-11-14T09:44:06.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this too, and so did a teammate of mine apparently.\n\nCould give pretty much anybody epilepsy if they were exposed to it enough.
