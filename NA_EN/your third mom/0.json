If you pick a mage top lane when your team wants/needs a tank (for example), you will likely still be filling the top lane role to an extent that the team understands what you're doing; if you decide to go double mid against the wishes of your actual mid laner, *then* there's a problem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-01T20:08:57.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume you're referring the the \"Smite Nunu Support\" situation.

You can however report someone for not playing the role as intended if the team doesn't agree to his decision. \n\nExample: Abandoning bottom lane to go support top and create massive pressure leading to the first blood tower while keeping someone like Fiora from getting any farm and therefore scaling into the game is a viable strategy that would result in you winning the majority of the time especially if your marksman chooses someone like Ezreal and farms using his Q against a non aggressive lane (support soraka for example).

If enough people on your team decide they want someone to play a specific type of champion, and the other player doesn't, you are encouraged to report them for creating a negative experience for the team as a whole, as well as not sufficiently communicating with the team. If enough people end up reporting that person over time, they will be manually audited.","replies":[]}]}
