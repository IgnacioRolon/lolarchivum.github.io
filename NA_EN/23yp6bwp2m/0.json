Whenever I play a game of league however, my ping spikes and jumps at random every few seconds, making the game unplayable. It has been in this same state over the last few days, and the problem does not seem to appear on any other computer in the network. I have tried flushing dns, restarting the computer, and several other \"quick\" fixes, but nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\nI also run on wireless network and have no access to wired network due to modem placement.
