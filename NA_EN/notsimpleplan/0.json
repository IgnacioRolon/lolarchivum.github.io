The only reason I play league is for the toxicity. I heard league was toxic so I had to check it out. I really enjoyed playing the game and I realized it actually was very toxic. I got roasted for feeding because I didn&#039;t know how to play and I also roasted others who didn&#039;t know how to play. It is honestly pretty fun. Also, if people don&#039;t want to participate they can mute each other or ignore each other so there is really no problem with toxicity. It brings life to the game and I am only here because of it. I also feel like it encourages people to do better because if they are flamed once for feeding then they don&#039;t want to get flamed so they try to do better. I know that some people quit because of toxicity, (especially new players) but I feel attracted because of the toxicity. Are there any of you who also like the toxicity? I would love to hear what you guys have to say about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-08-04T04:04:47.577+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"More people would rather not deal with it.

Mostly people mute _reactively_ what means they already got kinda tilted of your flame, what affects their performance negatively\n3) this one really made me laugh \"I also feel like it encourages people to do better because if they are flamed once for feeding then they don't want to get flamed so they try to do better\" honestly I think it is typical flamer thoughts. The truth is **very few** will increase their performance. High likely the following will happen a) you both will start shittalking the whole game and waste time, lose focus, litter the chat; b) person will do the exactly opposite or will never do what you asked for, just because he treats it as \"revenge\" or \"idgaf what you say\" c) person will get tilted and perform much worse, d) worst scenario person will start inting to you (letting you die, taking your cs, walking behind you all the game e.t.c)\nYour assumption is that negative motivators work. While they might work, they have much more chances to make situation worse.\n4) flamers don't realize that even though some people do what flamer asked, they would do it, because it makes sense (if it does) they would do it as well,  if you just suggest it.\n5) As I mentioned before flaming litters chat and can decrease the team performance. That's the main reason why I don't flame and why I always mute and report flamers regardless who they flamed. You literally losing my fcking lp.\n\nThat the main points I could think of right away. There is much more to it.","replies":[{"poster":"NotSimplePlan","date":"2018-08-04T04:40:48.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now that I think of it I do agree with what you are saying.
