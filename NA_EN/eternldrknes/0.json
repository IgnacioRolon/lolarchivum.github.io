I've been playing since Season 2 and have never had this issue and have been doing all the fixes that I can find to potentially correct it but it still happens from time to time. Now I'm being penalized for something that is the server side's fault? Seems a little messed up that you want to penalize an account that has been active since Season 2.\r\nNot sure if my account can be reset or anything but I just wanted to say something at least so that if these issues persist and something worse happens, I can at least reference any discussion is this post. I also just wanted to reveal how ridiculous this is in an attempt to put it into words and speak out for those legitimate players that are wrongly penalized for server side issues. Although we may be in the minority and are part of the collateral damage, I'm hoping some improvements can be made.","replies":[{"poster":"EternlDrknes","date":"2016-10-24T01:28:16.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the generic response but it's never what anyone is looking for. The client has bugs, it will always have bugs. I already told you that I've been through the connections issues guides along with other player invented fixes on the internet. Drivers are constantly updated as is other software. The fact that it is happening intermittently over the course of months at a time within just this client and nothing else should prove it is server/client based. Even just before in champion select. I tried selecting my champion during my turn and it does not select. It will attempt to highlight it, but I can never select to the point of locking in. So the timer runs down and I get dumped out with a 6 minute penalty. I don't see anything in the connection issues guide about this one though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T15:17:54.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are having bugsplats, then you may be having driver issues or more severe hardware problems.

When you queue up for a match, the server is trying to grab everyone and group them together.  If you have a poor connection, you will lose sync and get left behind without ever transitioning to the game server.  I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if that can help fix this up.\n\nPlaying custom games may be the best option to get this tested out and fixed, so you don't get anymore penalties.

Once here, another time there, usually a bugsplat or just downright disconnection from the client. I don't lose connection to anything else but the client will just lose connection. I have restarted, reinstalled, and tried other fixes multiple times but it just is never a consistent issue that I can record. Some issues are even difficult to explain to the point if I'm not recording my actual screen, I wouldn't be able to get my point across. Regardless, it happens over months at a time. I do not know what kind of reset mechanism LeaverBuster has after a certain time without issue. The most recent issue that cause my lower priority queue I attempt to explain.\nEssentially, everyone was in champion select and everything was going normally. When the last player went to select their champion, it looked on my screen as if they did not and the timer counted down to 0. It then told me that people left the room in the chat box but nothing else happened. My client hung up in that champion select at the 0 timer for approximately 60 seconds before I was given an error message something along the sort of the group being disbanded. I then attempted to re-queue for another ranked match but received another error message with the client telling me that it looked like I was already in a game. It told me to restart the client, which I did. By that time however, the next time I logged in, I was brought to the match completed screen in which that game that I thought was disbanded started and the team chose to /remake. Therefore, giving me an unnecessary loss, IP reduction, and placed in a lower priority queue.\nThis has not been the first time this has happened to me either, but I choose to overlook issues such as this until it ultimately effected me negatively as explained above.","replies":[]}]}]}
