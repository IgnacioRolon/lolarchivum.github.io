Could use a color/shade change in my opinion. I keep finding myself evolving my R, just meaning to level it. Evolving wrong skills at wrong levels, even when you mean to evolve them by the end of the game, can be game losing. But maybe it is just me and I&#039;ll get used to the new HUD.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-21T21:11:22.293+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is thankfully working on this.
