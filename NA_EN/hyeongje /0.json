Rather than limit victory skins (it's my belief that there should never be something completely unobtainable for the future, especially on content that can never be traded or otherwise sold like real world collector content such as trading cards, autographs, etc), why not reward people who get to those levels with special, permanent accolades on their profiles and loading screen splashes denoting which seasons they've achieved gold or higher in? Those accolades are better for showing off because they'd be always permanent and always visible, regardless of whether or not you use the skin. This is the same thing as Young Ryze - these skins are so rare now a days that the efforts and energies are wasted on updating this content since an extremely little minority will ever even see it, and it's more frustrating having super limited content that, as I mentioned before, is 100% never going to be obtained if you didn't achieve this very very specific milestone in this very specific time period. With the game's player base as big as it is now, and many more new players flooding in, it's more of a detriment to players who see hear of fabled content that they'll never see in game and disheartening to people who would pay money to obtain it. How many players from season 1 would actually be pissed if Triumphant Ryze was available to other players who get gold in season 6? If there was adequate accolades that denoted that they obtained that rank in those seasons, I cannot see why there would be upset from them, especially if they're now in such a tiny minority. I see more people getting upset that they'll never be able to see or obtain this cool content for their favorite champs than I do people getting upset about those skins being available in later seasons. \n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, it would actually be BETTER for the game if people could obtain past victory skins because they would play harder, take ranked more seriously, and devote themselves to winning if they know for a fact that there is a skin they absolutely want.

Sadly I didn't get into ranked this season. Not because I thought this looks bad http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Sivir_8.jpg , which I don't. Its just that I was more afraid of the potential amount of rage that could be pointed at me if I got stuck jungling since it is probably my worst role. Not knowing how to lane against some champions at all. Or because I kept getting focused and they are gonna report me for \"Intentionally Feeding\". Once the Dynamic Que comes along and everyone could get into their preferred roles it will probably make Ranked queuing less stressful for me. And strangely I'm starting to feel more comfortable in the jungle after the changes it recently had. But that's just me. Still wouldn't mind finding someone who is willing to go over many basic (and somewhat advanced) tips and tricks for general jungling. It can be hard to try and farm jungle effectively AND make sure every lane isn't failing. Not to mention when I've had some lanes DEMAND for ganks constantly and then I'm under-leveled compared to the enemy jungler since they kept ~~asking~~ demanding for ganks that turn out unsuccessful.
