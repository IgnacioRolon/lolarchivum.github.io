Seriously I get hit with a leavebuster all the time because my only option once the client crashes and traps me in reconnect forever is to open my task manager, close the client, login, and try to rejoin my game before my team gets trashed in a 4v5  for the 5 minutes this takes. The cherry on top is actually playing through the game and then getting hit by the tribunal for dealing with this broken client. I used to enjoy LOL and actually thought I was starting to improve now I just cant stand logging in knowing that my high speed internet and $1500 laptop I own wont stop this game from dying during play. This is like shooting a soldier in the leg then shooting him in the other for not running back too the front fast enough. It really wouldn't be such a problem if I wasn't waiting 20 minutes right now just to join a game. salt in the wound.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-23T19:32:46.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's happening exactly when you crash?  Are there any errors and what do they say?  Leaverbuster will treat everyone equally even if you're trying to come back, because all leaves cause negative experiences for other players.  Give me some more details on what's happening.  In the meantime, you may want to stick to custom games until it's resolved to prevent further penalties.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"sktchease","date":"2016-12-23T19:54:43.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want a rioter to answer plz..
