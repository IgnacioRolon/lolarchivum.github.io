There isn't necessarily a best champion, but what's best for you.  For now, you will have a small set of champions to try out until level 5.  Once you reach level 5, your champion pool will switch to the [free champion rotation](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation).  Feel free to explore and discover the best fit for you.  Good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MiniLordOfEpic","date":"2016-08-31T17:19:18.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, thanks! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2016-09-01T01:27:25.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends what you are looking for!  If you want a champion that is relatively easy to learn and play I recommend playing Garen {{champion:86}}  in the top lane.  He is very forgiving and does a lot of damage.  He is also very cheap to pick up permanently after you get past lvl 6. \n\nIf you are looking for a champion that will be good when you get to lvl 30 you could try learning Jinx {{champion:222}} .  Jinx is an adc played in the bot lane.   She will take a lot of practice to be good with in P v P but she can do tons of damage and win you games when you get more experienced.\n\nIf you are looking for a champion that is fun to play I recommend Lux{{champion:99}} .  She is a mage played in the mid lane and can hit enemies from really far away and has a very fun low cooldown ultimate.  She was one of my favorite champions when I was new to the game.\n\nI recommend avoiding Kha'zix {{champion:121}}  and Ryze {{champion:13}}  until you are higher level as they are relatively difficult champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MiniLordOfEpic","date":"2016-08-31T13:33:07.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want, you could also divide them into groups(tank, mage, ranged, etc.,)","replies":[]}]}
