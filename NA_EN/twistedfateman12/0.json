This is a huge problem that cant be ignored, I wonder how many people start playing but leave due to the terrible community, if someone is doing bad rather than helping him the average player would flame him. Either the community needs to improve their attitudes to help new players, or a new system needs to be set in place.

I have over the years i have come to see how counter productive this activity often is :D one of the reasons i love moab's so much is for the diversity the game mode provides. If you want to be top lane you don't have to ever play a tank if your a jungle you can play a tank, bot can be melee or with a thresh support even a fiz :D. I came to realize that mastering your own play style is 99% of the time more effective than trying to play like someone else. Getting new people to work on last hitting and trade pressure in lane lane types like stalling pressing slow push and such are really all they need to be shown, the rest of the game skills like build will come with time. When you start to die in lane and you cant seem to win your match up its natural to build more tanky and well if you win your lane all the time as a high damage top your gonna start to pick champs that work to that style,{{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:122}}. this game is prob one of the more Noob Friendly games iv played since the roll balance changes means it don't matter what you play, just play good. You are not going to be able to change the community, but playing game modes like ARAM or vs AI really helps soften the blow of learning a new game.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2017-06-18T16:38:58.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Getting new people to work on last hitting and trade pressure in lane lane types like stalling pressing slow push and such are really all they need to be shown, the rest of the game skills like build will come with time. \n\nEhh well before working on last hitting it is more important to help them understand and use the shop well... since gold isn't all that useful if spent on the wrong item or if it isn't spent at all\n\nLike {{item:3089}} on Riven doesn't do much","replies":[{"poster":"CpI Nobby Nobbs","date":"2017-06-20T03:51:05.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ap ad is a little hard to grasp for a new player, but if you look at your recommended items its prit clear right off that your champ uses one or the other. anyone who's new shouldn't be crafting new builds and should be just using the recommended aria. the item set crafting and custom builds is a more advanced skill and not really for noobs to be working on.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2017-06-20T13:29:55.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there are also when to buy what recommended item.... like being a tank and laning against an AP champion and buying Sunfire first might not be the best...\n\nDamage items are easier since they are always equally as good regardless of who or what the enemy is the only exceptions to this are {{item:3035}} {{item:3135}} (it is still okay even against targets with low MR) {{item:3071}} (It is pretty much never bad if the champion work well with BC)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lustdemon","date":"2017-06-18T08:30:38.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off I understand.2nd I too know people that are just joining with same issues.They have no clue about mobas or what that means, build diversity nothing.This for me is a issue cause I want to tell them how to play but must hold my tongue.I  mean 1 of my friends doesn't understand the consept of being a tank or anything , but he trys.Punish him for this nope I won't.Also I have noticed many folks just don't care and play the game the way they want to.So keep in mind we have those types also.\n\n\nI can't vote on your poll because the game may have flaws but people do to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T02:15:57.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While there are a lot of finer aspects to MOBA's like warding and such, we have implemented a practice tool recently which is a great way for you brother to play around with the game mechanics and get a general feel for MOBA's.

And side note: I love how you're so dedicated to helping your brother pick up the game ^_^! I myself actually started teaching my fiance's sister how to play just last night.\n\nSince you want to help guide him through the game mechanics, I would suggest going into a custom game with bots, or Co-Op vs AI. That way, there won't be too much pressure as those game modes are generally taken less seriously.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
