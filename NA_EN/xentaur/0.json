I&#039;ve read several stories of people getting permabanned after getting off suspension for not doing anything at all. \n\nOf course those stories should only be taken lightly with a grain of salt because they could be lying, but a friend also says that it&#039;s possible even if I don&#039;t say anything in chat. \n\n What happens to end of season rewards as well? My suspension ends tomorrow. \n\nI know that once I get my account back I&#039;m going to be too paranoid and nervous about hitting that &quot;Play&quot; button. I know I&#039;m most likely never ever going to type anything at all for the rest of my LoL career, but I fear I may still get hit by the ban hammer on a whim.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-06-06T09:27:20.004+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"You won't get permabanned for *nothing*, but you are on very thin ice and must tread carefully. It won't take much toxicity on your part, whether you start it or are retaliating.\n\nI recommend making liberal use of the Mute buttons if you feel like responding to negative people, and just keep in mind that your account is not worth losing over some kid you'll never see again once the match ends.\n\nYou will decay punishment tiers as you play games and show you are not going to be toxic, but this will take a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2017-06-06T14:32:20.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a two weeks suspension when i was stuck in silver 2 seasons ago. It was pretty eye opening when i got my chat logs and I thought, is that what I look and sound like?!\n\nNow I focus on my gameplay and dont flame, and it's gotten me through silver and gold. If you decide to clean to not be toxic, then you won't get banned. If you don't clean it up, you will.\n\nYou can do it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunnymap","date":"2017-06-06T12:33:46.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you cant hold yourself back from being toxic, you probably should just /muteall at the beginning of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-06T11:19:31.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's because all those people who said that were toxic the instant they got unbanned.\n\n\nIt's not a clean slate once the ban is over, you're still at ban edge, be a decent person and nothing will happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-06-06T10:22:15.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best advice we could give you is to not press the enter key ever again.\nAlso dont sell all your stuff to buy tears, even if game is lost.\nAnd dont run down mid to feed.
