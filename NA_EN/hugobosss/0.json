All 3 times I have been kicked off of the loading screen telling me to check my internet.  I then log completely out of the game, because my internet is fine and I figure it has something to do with the game, so I give it a quick restart.  The client then goes on to tell me it has restored my game to a previous patch for some unknown reason.  I then cannot log in due to my password being incorrect, which it's not.  \n\nThis leads to me having to restart my computer in order for the game to do what it used to do... WORK.  Of course, the 5minutes it takes to restart and re-launch league, I've been kicked from the game due to leaverbuster/remake.  This has not only caused me to lose about 15-20LP every time, but, it has also now impacted my account, which I am not OK with.  I have now been placed in low priority queue which I have done nothing to deserve.  I've played this game for about 6 years or more now and I have never once been chat banned, banned due to abandoning, cheated, nothing, I've done nothing.\n\nPlease tell me Riot, that you have someway of compensating players like myself that have been screwed over due to your own patching errors.  This isn't fair to me, or the players that have to have their game remade because I cannot reconnect.  Most of us have jobs and can't play all the time like some of the younger players of the community and this is negatively impacting my experience playing this game.\n\nStarting to wonder why I stopped playing Counter-Strike.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T20:41:38.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that you've gone through some pretty frustrating experiences, and I'd like to help.  From the sound of it, it seems like you've got a more serious connection problem leading up to this. If I understand correctly, you had a series of disconnections until you got the patch mis-match error on the third attempt. \n\nMy suspicions tell me that your network is having some problems reaching the game server and into the match.  Regardless of how perfect your internet might be, it doesn't make you immune from local or routing issues reaching us.  I highly recommend taking this time to go through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure there are no blocks on the way.  Make sure to test it out in a custom game and prevent anymore penalties.\n\nThe login error issues, however, is something that's we've been tracking and a result of being on the wrong patch version.  Restarting the client should help, but other options include a force repatch via the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) or a more manual approach:\n\nLocate LeagueClientSettings.yaml within C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nOpen it with a text editor (such as Notepad, TextEdit, or Notepad++) and find gameflow-patcher-lock. It should have a number there.\nChange the number to read \"null\" (without quotes)\nSave the file.\nRestart the client.\n\nI can't really offer compensation or control the quality of your connection, but you can definitely reach out to the tech team in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for consideration and additional support.  Hopefully, the info I provided here might prove helpful for your case.","replies":[{"poster":"Hugobosss","date":"2017-05-24T21:19:07.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can assure you it is most definitely not my connection.
