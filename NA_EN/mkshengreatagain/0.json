The best time to step on the plants is after she has used her E (Grasping Roots). You can step on the buds, and even get some hits on her because without that E she is literally powerless to stop you. Her new Q has a narrow hitbox, so moving up or down can really throw even a good Zyra off her game. Lastly, the plants die very quickly. Sometimes it's best to cut your losses and retreat for a better opportunity.\n\nRemember, Zyra is the squishiest and slowest champion in the game!
