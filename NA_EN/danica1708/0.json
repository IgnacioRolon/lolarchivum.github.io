One of my friends in the same game was playing Teemo top and went 2/0/1 with 151 creeps and got an S-. My ADC (Jhin) went 8/1/5 with 114 creeps and did not get an S (probably got an A, but I don&#039;t actually know, he was a rando). This seems to me to be very inconsistent and flawed. I don&#039;t feel my friend deserved an S-, I feel like I deserve at least an A+, and I feel that Jhin deserved an S. I&#039;m not sure where the consistency is with it. Does anyone else have problems with the grading system?

Those could range from CS, kills, deaths, assists, ward placing, objectives, and many more.\n\nIt has been said by Riot themselves that you are compared with the other players of your champion in your region, so that means you need to really try your best in games (obviously).\n\nOf course, the formula for each role varies. Supports would be getting a higher grade if they had reasonably low CS. However, if you're a Relic Shield support, more CS would be more reasonable.\n\nRiot said themselves that they won't be releasing any information on these, because, for example, if people found out high CS = high mastery grades (which could be a factor), they'd afk farm and stray away from teamfights.\n\nAdditional information could be found [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/ask-riot-how-you-get-s-urgot)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-28T03:05:54.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grades are based on the performance of all other players playing the same champion+lane in your region.\n\nThis is why shit like AP yorick, ADC ahri or LB, and top aurelion is free S+ for people that understand the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-09-28T02:50:06.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grades aren't judged based on the other people in the match, but on other people playing that champion.
