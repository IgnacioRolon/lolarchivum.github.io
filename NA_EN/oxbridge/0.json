One, what's going to happen with skins like Riot Squad Singed, PAX TF, PAX Jax, and Silver Kayle? Two, I have a few skins that I don't have and I was wondering if there were any way for me to obtain the following skins: Traditional Karma, Goth Annie, Huntress Sivir, and Silver Kayle and Riot Squad Singed? I excluded Judgment Kayle, King Rammus, and Championship Riven because I don't think I'm likely to get them... it would make me so happy to be able to further my skin collection. I am more than willing to pay increased RP costs and/or offer volunteer services to Riot to compensate. Thank You!\r\n\r\nPS: What is the actual reason why Riot Squad Singed is Limited? There is no information on this as far as I can tell.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-09T17:44:09.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nLooks like Wuks was awesome and took care of most of these questions.\n\nRiot Squad Singed, like PAX skins, was something that was handed out at events, which is why he is limited.\n\nWe've got a guide to legacy and limited skins you can check out [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins), if you have additional questions about them! \n\nSide note, Hippalus [did say](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/H004gAPw-ecommerce-qa?comment=00350002) - \n\n*Yes I think Championship Riven will come back someday. Most limited edition skins took four years to come back after release, and it's been two years for Riven so far.* \n\n(This was a year ago, so it's technically three now).\n\nHope Wuks and I have been of help!

These skins, like Silver Kayle, are earned by doing something specific, and is a type of milestone/achievement. PAX skins are for attending an event and you met a Rioter, or participated in a Riot/League activity at PAX. \n\nIf we did bring them back, we would need to make it so players who earned the skin felt like it was still special, while at the same time, accommodating people who would be purchasing the skin if we unlocked it. It's a tricky line to walk, and it's something that's been in discussion - but we haven't come to a consensus as to what a solid solution would be, which is why we don't have plans to bring these skins back at this time. \n\nWe've only [done this once before](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/plan-vintage-limited-edition-skins) where limited skins went legacy, but this may not be the best option for more rare skins. In the case I've linked, we just made annual holiday skins legacy. The skins you're mentioning are a bit more tricky, as some skins were never available in the store before.","replies":[{"poster":"Oxbridge","date":"2016-02-09T19:46:22.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for the explanation.\n\nWhy not use the PROJECT idea? Have special borders within the loading screen slices/splashes that indicate \"future\" availability? (I put the word future in quotes to suggest a link with PROJECT lore). The original skins would remain untouched and preserved much like paintings and sculptures in museums but replicas would be made available to the general public with something akin to a watermark? Personally, I'm completely okay with having the Limited Skins with special borders inside to indicate that I obtained them through the store. What do you think?\n\nThe colour of the border could be the same as the Orange button for the shop?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-09T19:49:50.216+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vintage borders are what we did with limited to legacy and it seemed to go pretty smoothly. That said, players bought those skins in the store.

There is a possibility that a Limited Edition skin is reclassified as a regular skin or a Legacy Skin; however, this will likely be done in rare situations (like the Vintage skins and maybe Championship Riven). \n\nTraditional Karma can be obtained via Mystery Gifting, as she's Legacy and not Limited Edition. \n\nGoth Annie and Huntress Sivir can be obtained by purchasing the respective bundles in the PVP.net store (client shop under bundles). \n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Oxbridge","date":"2016-02-09T06:23:02.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is Riot Squad Singed a limited skin? There is no reason given on this website: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Champion-Skin-Types\n\nI'm not eligible for mystery gifting anymore because I have less than 10 unowned skins in the pool. Surely there can be another way to obtain Traditional Karma?\n\nThe bundles which have Goth Annie and Huntress Sivir have champions that I don't want in my playable champion pool. Right now, the Champions Bundle (Sivir) would cost me 1964 RP and the Digital Collectors Bundle (Annie) would cost me 1399 RP. That's a total of 3363 RP, a little over the cost of an Ultimate skin just for two skins which are likely worth only 975 RP each. Surely there's a better way to get those two skins than buying both bundles and then submitting a support ticket asking for the champions I don't want to own to be removed?\n\nI recognize the fact that I'm extremely unlikely to obtain the following skins: King Rammus, Judgment Kayle, PAX Twisted Fate and PAX Jax. Which I'm grudgingly fine with, lol. But for Riot Squad Singed and Silver Kayle specifically, it just seems wasteful to keep them limited.

Once you have all of the other champions in the Sivir bundle, it'll be 975 for the skin; once you buy the Goth Annie skin, it'll be available for a lower price as well. \n\nRegarding Traditional Karma, as Riot releases more skins, you'll be able to continue trying your luck at the Mystery Gifts. \n\nI believe Riot Squad Singed is a Limited Skin because it was the first Riot skin released, and Riot prefers to not reclassify skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Oxbridge","date":"2016-02-09T08:45:06.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, but there are specific champions in both Bundles that I do not want in my pool of available champions to play for various reasons.
