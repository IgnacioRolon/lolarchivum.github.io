I used to get from 100-150 FPS on max graphics, now I only get 50-60 and down to 20 in teamfights. This only happens on this game. I have updated to the most recent graphics driver. Also, temperature is not a problem. Are there any suggestions or drivers/software that should be downloaded?\n\nSpecs:\nWindows 7 64 bit\nGTX 660 ti\nAMD FX-6120\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"PenetrationPaul","date":"2015-01-16T05:02:39.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is basically what happened to me but after patch 4.20.
