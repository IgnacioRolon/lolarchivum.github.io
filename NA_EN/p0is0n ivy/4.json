Given that URF is a temporary, time-sensitive queue - Riot doesn't need to control the meta as much but will still deal with outliers if they're way out of line and making the side they're on win/lose hard. A limited champ pool was then introduced to also curbstomp accounts who only buy specific ARAM/URF strong champs and don't specifically have any weak picks.\n\nNow, this champ pool was made from champs who have a Christmas skin, ice skin or a festive skin at the least (Whistler Village Twitch, Festive Kassadin). Lissandra actually uses her base skin from what i saw. This champ pool is maybe not to your liking but it being an AR mode already removes the choice of your picks so there should be no problems there. And even if Riot picks the comps, there are still champs that can be classified as broken, currently being Mao/Fizz, Sivir. So it's not really Riot's handpicked team that forces people into playing underwhelming champions. \n\nThe inclusion of Snowball also helps equalize melee champions in terms of ranged vs melee comps. What is most dissatisfying is that ranged champions often can spam their things from a safe range and if you ever get dealt a melee champ that can't really do anything but take the abuse, you're going to have a bad time. The snowball allows you to reach your lane faster and it also serves as a reliable gap closer to those ranged champs to feel threatened.\n---\n\nURF has been dead to be after the first time.\nSure, spamming things is nice but there's only so much i can enjoy the spamfest before it gets boring really fast as most of the champions i don't want to even try there. In any case, i was much more interested in Poro King as i could've picked Kindred and Quinn, which i wanted to try to learn how to play for a while. And it saves me the trouble of having to run SR games and i could've avoided ARAM as well.\n\nI played ARURF still (for the missions) and i enjoyed it as well.\nEven as i played Nidalee (against Jax, Fizz, Kassadin and Zilean), i got shafted so hard because playing an assassin that relies on a skillshot that you can't ever hit on those targets is just...terrible. However, with a score of 0/13 from that game (loss), i expected to come out as salty as the Dead Sea.  But surprisingly enough i still found the game enjoyable and funny for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2017-12-21T09:00:26.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"? \n\nSpewing theoretical bullshit doesn't do jack.
