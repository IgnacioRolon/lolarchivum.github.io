So if I already have Xayah, does the RP from the bundle that accounts for buying her get removed or is it still the same price? I won't be able to afford the bundle if it doesn't, so I just wanted to be sure so I could save my RP for later since I can only afford a $25 card now. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T17:38:31.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"These bundles  should be flexible, so it should discount based on what you've already unlocked.  For example, the Cosmic Dusk and Dawn Bundle is 3675 RP in total.  Since I already have the champions but not the skins, it's 2701 for me instead.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"MielIa","date":"2017-04-25T21:56:53.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=XF1LA0yh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-21T17:38:31.819+0000)\n>\n> These bundles  should be flexible, so it should discount based on what you&#x27;ve already unlocked.
