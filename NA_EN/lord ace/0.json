NACS","subforum":"Esports","up_votes":81,"down_votes":14,"body":"Hey Everyone, Tiza (RIOT) referred me here to discuss what went on to defend my team from being DQ&#039;d. So my mid laner has an emergency before the match, and we search for the mid lane sub, who isn&#039;t responding to his cellphone. We get the top lane sub to play for mid, but he gets in at 3:10. Not before 3:10. \n\nWhy this matters? \n\nAccording to the rules stated by this link at &quot;https://battlegrounds.s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/pdfs/csoq/rules.pdf&quot; \n> \n>  We recommend that teams be online 10 minutes prior to the official start time to provide ample time to\n>  enter the custom game lobby and get ready. Five members from the team roster must be in the lobby\n> at the stated time. Fewer than five players will not constitute a valid team.\n> If a valid team is not in the lobby 10 minutes after the tournament start time, the team captain must\n> contact an adjudicator via the game chat lobby that is provided through email so that the adjudicator\n> can enter the game and confirm the team has failed to show.\n\nAt 3:10 our sub is in the game, which, if Tiza had joined, s/he would have seen that and we would have been able to start the match. My team had even asked if the other team is ready, at which point the enemy team said no, and then got confirmation after 3:10 to leave the match. After an hour, the other team played to the better side of Tiza in hopes of a good decision for them, which they received. All this for a few seconds. The other team was available to play, but the decision had been made. Now in the time of an emergency, a few seconds delay to the deadline, is a DQ. This team had high chances of becoming top 2 for this tournament, and due to a few seconds, apparently it is not so. \n\nWe provided reasoning, even utilizing the rules provided, for the tournament to be played. I was told that I was arguing and being nit picky, albeit all I did was use the same article of the rule being used against my team. We offered to lose the first match, which is a huge disadvantage in a bo3, and Tiza didn&#039;t even allow for that. We would have given up anything to play this official match. This is the only shot for our team, which has a long time until the next split to have a chance, to have a chance at getting into the LCS. Do I have to be a millionaire to field a team into the LCS?\n\nIs there anything we can do to play a match? Or is it a few seconds too late?","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2015-12-13T03:39:33.904+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":100,"body":"Posting my reply here as well as your Reddit thread:\n\nHey all, wanted to clarify some of the points here. OP's team, \"Spooky NA Team,\" was disqualified for being late for their match today. The game was scheduled at 3:00pm PST, and they were not in the lobby at 3:00pm. As they state, they did not get their 5th player into the lobby until after the 10 minute grace period had expired. While we are very sympathetic to the circumstances, we cannot have a slippery slope by giving extra extensions past the 10 minute grace period.\n\nThe purpose of having an Adjudicator join the lobby is to verify the no-show and have an official witness in case of a dispute. In this case, there is no dispute - both teams agreed up front that OP's team missed the cutoff. Additionally, the opposing team provided timestamped screenshots and a video recording that corroborates the timeline.\n\nUltimately, the 10 minute period is designed to provide ample cushion for real life problems. While we know there is always high stakes for CS tournament matches, we have to draw the line somewhere and hold firm.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-12-13T04:13:54.675+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":10,"body":"1: 10 minutes isn't enough.

All we do is study and debate ethics and ethical theory behind grey area matters similar to this. I mean no disrespect, but these are the problems I see with your statement.\n\nFirst, any argument that hinges on a \"slippery slope\" is recognized as a logical fallacy; a slippery slope cannot and should not be used to justify any position, because it is founded upon the assumption that simply because one event happened, another is bound to occur, without any justification of the latter happening. In this instance, you make a point that it would be a \"slippery slope\" to give extra extension past the grace period (note: for less than a minute over), implying that it would encourage others to also be tempted to ask for an extension. However, this is clearly not the case. We cannot make the assumption that, \"this sets precedence where we'd have to make the new cutoff time 11 minutes, then 12 minutes, etc.\" because:\n\n1. This is not something incredibly typical, it is an edge case, which generally *should* be treated slightly different than standard cases.\n2. The time given poses an insignificant margin past the current grace period.\n\nAs a short example, consider purchasing alcohol in the United States. The US is incredibly strict about making sure the person buying alcohol is 21 years old. However, I was born at 4:10 PM EST. I was not legally 21 years old until 4:10 PM on February 6, 2015, yet, I purchased my first drink legally around noon. I guarantee that if I told the bartender that I wasn't born until 4 PM, he would not restrict my purchase; it is an edge case that is treated with leniency, because it's a negligible period of time. I was not 21 years old yet, and somehow I was still legally allowed to purchase alcohol. In fact, this **can be further extended** to a more extreme case in which a person was born at 11:59 PM on a certain day and purchases his drink at 00:01 that same morning (not two minutes later, rather 23:58 minutes prior). It's not a matter of whether the person is 21 or not; it's **not important.**\n\nSecond, I'd like to address your statement regarding \"drawing the line somewhere and holding firm.\" This is another poor consideration, considering the precedence within much more heavy situations than a simple disqualification. As a far-fetched example, in several states, children as low as age 16 can be treated as an adult, despite their minor status as recognized by the government. This is a bending of the typical rules in an edge case matter.\n\nMy father always used this wonderful analogy of exactly, to the letter, what you described. It involves the classic \"spirit of the law\" vs. \"letter of the law.\"\n\n\n> There is a subway station in New York that doesn't allow sleeping in the station at night. There are two men sitting on two separate benches. The first man is sitting up, dozing off while he waits for the last train after a long day of work. The second man isn't asleep, but he has a blanket, pillow, some food, and is lying down on the bench. Which person gets punished?\n\nIf what the OP says is true and the sub was there at 3:10, maybe a few seconds late, **you are arguing that we should punish the man who was simply dozing off**. Was that what the **intent** of the law was trying to prohibit? Obviously not; the law was there to prevent people like the man who wasn't yet asleep, but was setting up camp. If, however, the sub legitimately was late (I know people tend to exaggerate on these forums), then I stand by your ruling. But saying that a team should be disqualified for being ready at 3:10:20 rather than 3:10:00 is a little absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Mofl III","date":"2015-12-13T10:20:01.619+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually in your example you have a clear case of stright enforced rules.

Just because the goverment doesn't care at which hour you were born doesn't mean that the lowest unit they use is fluid and forgiving. It is more a tradeoff between accurate information and administrative costs to get them (against their value). You don't even consider the differences in timezone for your example. The goverment would for example allow one person to drink while the other person isn't because one was born at 1:30 at the east coast and one 3 timezones to the west at 22:30 (assuming they use local times for birth certificates). They are exactly the same age if they try to drink together and still one is served and one isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-12-13T09:01:28.847+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I love logic so ill be the devil's advocate:\n\nThe United States law (its actually state law which dictates 21 as the year, but whatever) recognizes that time can be measured in different intervals. Technically, you could count down to an infinitesimally small unit of time to measure your age. They could have measured it by the month, so in February you could have purchased a drink. They could have measured it by the hour, so you might have to wait until 4 to purchase that drink. They could have measured it to the minute so you would have to wait until 4:10. They could have measured it to the second so you would have to wait until 4:10:XX. But they didnt. They decided to go with the DATE of birth, not hour or minute of birth. \n\nIts not an edge treated with leniency. An edge treated with leniency would be like purchasing your first drink on 10:00pm the night before your birthday. In this situation, the cutoff point was when the clock strikes 12, not because it was the actual time of birth, but because state legislature recognized it was the easiest and simplest way to keep track of age. The laws are written with a 24 hour window in mind. If youre in that window, you qualify to state that day as your Date of Birth for purchasing alcohol, even if you are at the extremes of both ends. \n__________________________________________________________\nSlipperly slopes are a informal logical fallacy, not a formal one. Formal logical fallacies are fallacious by nature, and should not be used to argue a point. But keep in mind that violating the fallacies doesnt always mean its false. \n\nTake the classic example of a formal logical fallacy: If its raining outside, I will get wet. I got wet. So it must be raining. This is a fallacious argument since there might be other causes of getting wet. Does that mean its not raining? Not necessarily. It could be raining, which is why i got wet. But it could have been from another source of water as well, so the logic is false whether or not your conclusion is true. \n\nInformal Logical Fallacies are fallacious, but not due to logic. They are fallacious by relying on human tendencies and generalizations. Again, this doesnt mean they arent true or dont describe the world correctly. its an informal logical fallacy because its something to keep you suspicious of the argument, not outright denying it. (Outright denying Informal Logical Fallacies is a fallacy in itself, BTW). Informal Logical Fallacies require more insight to determine truth than formal logical fallacies, since nothing about the claim is inherently false. \n\nFor example, take this argument - The sun rose every day for the past million years, so the sun will rise again tomorrow. Thats an informal logical fallacy. Is it false? I dont know (and nobody can). But would you bet that I'm going to be wrong? Informal logical fallacies are everywhere, and cannot be avoided. Whether you recognize it or not, you rely on informally fallacious reasoning every single day.\n\nSimilarly slipperly slope arguments arent always wrong, I wont give an example, since it would make this post about 3 times as long, but there are instances in Law where it occurred. If you want one, ask and i shall give. \n__________________________________________________________________\nLetter of the Law vs Spirit of the Law is an interesting debate. For better or for worse, generally the Letter of the Law wins, because one of the main focuses of written law is having the ability to read the law if you so desire. If the laws were not codified by statue, you would never know when a law changes. Unfortunately, the Letter of the Law isnt always clear, coherent, or legal (due to many factors, primarily that Legislatures dont know the law, dont account for how its interpreted, or that laws go through dozens of amendments before being codified, so the final product doesnt look anything like the original). Then the courts can go to the \"spirit\" of the law, evidenced by congressional debates and briefs, as long as it isnt blatantly in conflict with the letter of the law. \n\nthis is my roundabout way of saying that in this case, the Letter of the Law states that anything past the scheduled time is late, but you get a 10 minute grace period. We can argue about what the Spirit of the Law is (and only the person/people who wrote the rule will know) - is it to discourage \"dozing off\" opposed to \"setting up camp\"? (i dont understand that metaphor). Or is it to discourage being late in any way shape or form, but knowing that an absolute no-tardy rule would be too absurd? What happens if 2 people wrote the rule, one thinking that it was to discourage \"setting up camp\" and the other thinking it was a no-show rule? \n\n________________________________\nEDIT  - my bad, i didnt read your post thoroughly enough. I get your letter vs spirit metaphor now. I would say that neither are in violation of the law. The law prohibits sleeping, so the one setting up camp isnt sleeping, and therefore, isnt in violation of any law. The other, who is dozing off, isnt not in the proper mindset that his consciousness is lost to be \"sleeping\". \n\nAnd secondly about your point with Juveniles, there IS a hard cutoff. Most states have a codified rule with the exception at 16 (some at 13, some that have another exception for murder). Juveniles under 18 are charged as Juveniles with more lenient sentencing, but the system codified a 2 year buffer for serious crimes. This situation is similar with, with the rule at 3:00 but with a 10 minute buffer. In the states where a 16 year old may be charged as an adult, a 15-and-11-month cannot.

Losing bans or even losing the first game of the Bo3 as they suggested sounds like more than enough to make up for teams being slightly late.","replies":[{"poster":"Mofl III","date":"2015-12-13T10:35:11.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The applicable rule is the following rule for disqualification: \n\n> OQ Discretion​.

They don't even have to confirm it theoretically. There is no requirement for them to reach any stage of confirmation. \n\nIt sounds like someone else just wrote a pretty crappy ruleset and the admins are now stuck with it and have to follow retarded procedures that don't belong in the rule (like showing up at exactly 10 min without earlier notice actually which is unpossible anyway) while actually disqualification reasons like not showing up not actually mentioned.\n\nIt is not Tiza's fault most likely that the rules are the way they are.
