Teamwork isnt really a thing in this game. Its just \"Oh I spammed the fuck out of my abilities and got more damage than you\" thats it thats fucking it. That's all I have really learned by playing damage champs and hell even certain supports. \nEven call of duty has more strategy than this and its mostly just pew pew! I shouldn't be crowed a victor because I smashed my face into the keyboard. Hell I let my little brother try the game on his older brothers abandoned account  (he has no moba experience what so ever) and he even figured out that all he had to do was spam his abilities...and he is only 6.

Draven and Lucian were early game lane bullies and dropped off due to their kits. Quinn is the only Marksmen whom is a early game bully and drops off now.\n\nMarksmen also had to strategize which items to get back then, as in buy a defensive item. Usually GA and it didn't give damage. That was enough however because Marksmen power budget was based on being protected by their teams. Only lane bullies like once again Draven and Lucian, with the exception of hyper carry Vayne, could duel. Even then Vayne had to becareful not to duel tanky champions with Thornmail while Draven's and Lucian's kits were designed to get past Thornmail. I feel like only Jhin has to becareful when it comes to dueling now, and Marksmen power budget is no longer based on teams protecting them.
