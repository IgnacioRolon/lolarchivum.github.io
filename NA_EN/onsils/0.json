For Trick, this risk may be worth it. He makes a living streaming. Customs skins may literally make him money. He has multiple 30s. Losing an account wouldn't be that big of a deal to him. But for the average player, who may have thousands of hours on their only account, the risk of losing it for just a custom skin is probably not worth it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2016-06-07T01:16:53.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason they advise against it is there's no way of knowing if something besides the skin is affecting play. There could be some hidden piece of code that violates the terms of agreement, even if the only noticeable in game affect is the custom skin. They would rather you not take your chances of being suspended or banned for something you literally did not know about.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"He4rtkiller","date":"2016-06-06T21:47:18.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello dArtagnan!\n\nI really want to know is there any app for changing in game VO (in my case I want Japanese VO) that is safe to use?

However, this can seriously corrupt your installation so we do not recommend doing so.

Say i switched katarina's old ability icons in client and game primarily because they were easier for me to understand? Not that it has effected the champion. :D any help would be great.","replies":[]}]}]}
