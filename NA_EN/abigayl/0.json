Because of this, I&#039;m no longer able to say gg to the other team at the end of the game. I understand that I could do it in the post game screen, but people so rarely read the post game chat and often click away from the screen immediately so I feel as though my offer of respect towards them is lost. This could just be a feeling that I am alone in, but when ending a game in the winning position and I notice that the other team has not said some form of &quot;GG&quot; at the end of the game, it leaves me feeling bad as I worry that they did not have fun playing the game. Likewise, when losing the game and the other team does not say it, I&#039;m a little put off because I felt like I&#039;ve played against people who are not gracious winners, and these are not feelings that I wish to push upon the people I play with.\n\nThe point of this post is to ask if Riot could look into a way for me to still be polite at the end of the game without forcing me to enable all chat for the entire duration, as I feel the small offer of respect at the end of the game often has a larger importance than someone would normally think. It could just be me that feels that way though, as I understand many people don&#039;t care to say GG at the end of the game as they see it as just a waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-11-20T17:00:33.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't see this being a priority for them. As you mentioned, there's already a way for people to say \"gg\" to the enemy team even if all chat is off.\n\nIf you're looking for all alternative method, you could turn all chat back on and mute the enemy team. You'd still be able to send your \"gg\" at the end without seeing anything they said.","replies":[{"poster":"Abigayl","date":"2016-11-23T23:17:32.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I specifically do not like seeing my own team use all chat as well, so I don't think this would be an option.

If the losing team doesn't gg, neither should you. I understand your intentions, but saying gg first as the winning team is actually bad form. Specially while the game is still not technically over (ie before the post game lobby). It smacks as humblebrag.
