Upon asking the enemy team to report them as well, I was met with \"fuck you\" and \"no\"s.  One of them even felt the need to type \"gg ez\" at the end of the game and in the post-game lobby. I blacked out the enemy's name since I didnt want to show their names without permission. (I Was the Azir).\n\nEDIT: Whoops, Image 1 and 2 are switched around.

AFK's/DC's are a similar case- if they aren't caught/reported, they only really harmful towrads the people on the receiving end; the 3-4 left on that team.

It's only bad when you harp and tell on every little thing, even the things that aren't even bad or punishable.
