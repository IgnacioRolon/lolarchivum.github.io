For a few seconds, the mouse continues to work, but all sound cuts out to a buzzing, and all background processes stop. No other game that I have crashes (running Witcher 3 on medium settings) so it doesn't seem to be my graphics card. I have run a full system scan using Avira and found nothing. I've uninstalled programs so that I have enough disk space. I have turned off the xbox gamebar. I've opened my desktop and cleaned out the minimal amounts of dust, even though I'm monitoring the temperatures and nothing seems to be bottlenecking.  When the game crashes, I cannot open the task manager or force quit the game, no keyboard prompts work. Any tips on what to do to fix this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-30T00:46:19.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With all of that buzzing and the entire pc freezing, it really sounds like something is critically failing within your system.
