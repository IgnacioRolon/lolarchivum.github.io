Silver - Gold Only Join Now! **","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Player Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Clan to bring Silver and Gold players together!\r\nThe #1 goal of Bad Cat is to make new friends, have a great time playing league, and help each other improve!\r\nOf course there are other fun perks as well :)\r\n\r\nThe 4 rules of the clan are:\r\n1) NO FLAMING/RAGING - If you have a hard time with this, please dont join. I dont want drama just because someone fed a game, it happens to everyone. Im a really chill dude, but I will kick you if youre a rager or very negative. This is the main rule.\r\n2) Be Active - talk and get to know people, play with your clan mates. The whole point of this clan is to make new friends to play league with; a group that you can become close to. Doesnt mean you cant solo que when u want to play by yourself or someone else, But at least play with us once in a while. Doesn't make sense to join if you never talk, never play with us, or you're always offline.\r\n3) Silver or Gold Only - no smurfs, I will know by the way you play if youre a smurf, you will be kicked - This makes it easier to pair people in tourneys and stop cheating. Maybe down the line, we will expand to more divisions/tiers but this rule stands for now.\r\n4) Repost! - This one is simple :) repost this thread when you join - so the clan can grow! Lets max this shit out.\r\n\r\nFun Stuff:\r\nFace off - Occasionally we can make custom games vs eachother, on any map, our own voted rules, for shits and giggles :D (Like ap adc's on treeline, or team void vs team yordle)\r\nRanked 5's - If anyone is interested in making a ranked team within the clan to try and climb the ladder, I'd be down to start or join one.\r\n1v1 Tournaments - When we have enough people in the clan of course (Maybe 20), we can start doing tourneys. Occasionally someone (including me) can sponsor a tournament. We will pair people vs eachother based on elo and skill level - winner can get some RP or a Skin of Choice from sponsor. Rules for tournaments and sponsors are as follows:\r\n1) Only one tournament at a time - to avoid confusion about who needs to give who a skin\r\n2) Only one person may sponsor a tourney at a time, if there's multiple people wanting to sponsor, they have to 1v1 eachother. Winner will sponsor.\r\n3) The one sponsoring must buy a skin of choice for the winner of the tourney. (975 RP and up) You must announce the RP value of the skin in clan chat before the tournament. If you choose to do a legendary skin or higher value than 975, you do so at your own risk, because the previous sponsor must only gift you a 975.\r\n4) As mentioned in rule 3, The previous sponsor must but a skin for the current sponsor - the price must be 975, choice of current tourney sponsor.\r\n5) No taking the cheap way out and buying an \"On Sale\" skin or low priced skin UNLESS that is specifically the skin the winner or current sponsor wants\r\n6) If you win a tourney, you must sit the next one out. If you continually win its not fair to others, and youre probably smurfing >:0\r\n7) If you win a tourney, you may not sponsor the next one. - Ex: I give you a skin for winning, now i need to give you a skin for becoming a sponsor as well.\r\n8) If you wish to be in a tourney, say so in clan chat, It will be up to the sponsor to organize the date, time (mention time zone please), and roster.\r\n9) Tournaments will be draft pick, so that you can ban, and you cant complain about who someone chose lol\r\n\r\nBeing a sponsor means you get a skin, and give a skin.\r\nPrevious Sponsor, Current Sponsor, Last Winner will always be displayed in clan chat\r\nWe will alternate between silver tourney, and gold tourney - so that a silver 5 doesnt have to face a gold 1, at least from gold 5 to gold 1 for example, the mechanical skill gap wont be very big, and it can pretty much be anyones game. (Ive seen gold beat plat)\r\nFor now there will only be 1v1 tourneys until we figure out a system for 2v2's, 3v3's etc.\r\nAny additional info will be discussed in clan chat\r\nSO IF ANYONE SILVER OR GOLD READ THE ABOVE AND WISHES TO JOIN, ADD \"XMADO\" AND ASK FOR INVITE\r\nTHANK YOU AND HOPE TO MEET YOU SOON :)\r\n\r\nP.S. we can set up discord, curse voice, or skype for anyone who wants, its not mandatory as long as youre active :)","replies":[{"poster":"CreeperKatie","date":"2016-05-09T17:45:00.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can add me.
