Since Season 3 I&#039;ve mained fizz and always held a 58% to 59% win rate on him. However, since the start of preseason my winrate has dropped to 53%  mostly since the new runes now allow for a free zhonya and hexdrinker passive on anyone. Needless to say, Fizz isn&#039;t in a good spot right now. I can probably still climb the rest of the way to Diamond by continuing to play with my 53% winrate but its gonna be really slow and not the smartest way to go. So basically my question is this...\r\n\r\nTLDR - For someone who has pretty much only played fizz (assassin playstyle) since picking up the game, what champion(s) do you suggest putting some time into learning that are doing well in the current META?\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback! :)\r\n\r\nOPGG: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=xMado","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2018-01-10T01:30:58.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as styles that are similar to Fizz, I've always had good luck switching back and forth between him and Ekko. But neither one of them seem to be picking up extremely well in the current meta. ( The electrocute keystone procs a little too slowly now that Ekko can't garner attack speed from runes, but other paths leave him weak in midlane against ranged opponents without the extra burst.)\n\nIf you'd just like to play to win, pushbots like Malzahar are fairing well at the moment. Even into your main, Fizz, he could get a banshees and be completely immune to your combo if played correctly. I think it comes down to if you'd be willing to take on a different style of play. When looking for what is a strong pick and can carry you up, a good place to begin your search is a site like [this one](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/) where it tracks champion performance, pick ban rates, etc. Good luck.","replies":[]}]}
