In case it hasn't, Minkonde (1 Nkonde, 2 Minkonde) dolls originated in Kongo. They are hideous dolls believed to pursue wrongdoers - specifically witches, thieves, adulterers and betrayers - at night. To activate a Nkonde, one must drive several nails, blades or other pieces of iron into it so that it will deliver the same punishment to the wrongdoer. See the connection?","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrocerebus","date":"2015-02-21T02:55:59.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats actually pretty cool relation","replies":[]}]}
