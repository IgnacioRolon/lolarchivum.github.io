What happens is you can't focus if it's too loud, and turning down league itself isn't a good solution because if you forget you turned it down, then you may not hear the game start. It's just very loud and needs to be nerfed. lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nybx4life","date":"2015-02-05T01:14:37.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ditto.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Javane","date":"2015-02-04T22:58:48.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking this myself when I was trying to listen to the other League of Legends music.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reynard the ƒox","date":"2015-02-04T22:49:09.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont like the music itself","replies":[]}]}
