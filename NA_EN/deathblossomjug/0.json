Make sure your monitor cable is plugged into your AMD card, and not your motherboard\n2. Install AMD's auto-detect tool which will automatically find and install the best driver for your card from http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/auto-detect-tool\n3. Run Windows update\n\nIf the above don't work it sounds like a potential graphics card issue. Check if you are having graphics issues with other games or applications & contact AMD support if this is the case at http://support.amd.com/en-us or alternatively either Cyberpower support or the support team from the GPU vendor (e.g. XFX, MSI, Sapphire...)","replies":[{"poster":"Gluck","date":"2017-05-27T16:04:53.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am assuming this is a copy of League of Legends which you freshly installed on this system.
