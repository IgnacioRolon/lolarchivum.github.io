Today my account was permabanned, when it wasnt really my fault. I&#039;m aware that its almost impossible to recover my once loved account, but its still worth trying. What im going to say does not justify what happened today but, it wasnt me on my account, it was in fact my brother. I left home around midnight and didnt shut down my computer, and when i got back, i was permanently banned because of his behavior towards the teammates/enemy team. Like everyone, we get warned 2 times before getting permanently banned, i must say that those 2 time were on me, but after that, i stopped flaming, and tried to be as much polite as i could, and now this happens. If im right, i&#039;ve spent more than 500$ on the account, i was hoping i could get some help, since regardless knowing that what happens on my account is on me, i couldnt actually imagine that my brother was going to get me permabanned for flaming. I was hoping i could get some help, since i kinda find this unfair.
