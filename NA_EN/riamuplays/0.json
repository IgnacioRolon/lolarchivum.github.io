Lets start from the top, shall we?\n\nSo, a couple moths ago, when the Beta Client got launched to players, I upgraded cause I'd seen a few videos on it and it looked amazing. So I upgraded it, play a couple games, then didn't play for a couple of days. When I started the updater, it told me that I had to switch back to leagacy Client.  I thought it was weird but whatever. Didn't know how, so I just uninstall.jpg'd and reinstalled. All went well until I tried upgrading again about a moth later, I pressed \"Yes I would like to join the beta\" or whatever it says from the updater, and it just sat there and did nothing. So I went, \"Sweet it must have done it instantly! Coolio!\"  **NOT** the case.. In fact, it told me to go ~~fuck~~ and reinstall the legacy client again. \n\n\"Great\" I said to myself, and for the next couple of months I tried every once and a while to install the beta client and it never worked, so I would uninstall.jpg and reinstall the game every few days. NOT THIS TIME.\n\nNo, this time when I went to do it whilst it was updating, NOT ONLY DID IT TELL ME TO UNINSTALL AND REINSTALL, WHEN I DID IT TOLD ME IT COULDN'T OVERWRITE rads_user_kernel.exe\n\nOkay, I thought to myself as I went to the folder where LoL is on my computer, \"all I have to do is drag this folder into the garbage bin, empty it, and reinstall again.\"  I went and attempted to throw the folder into the garbage, It got half way when it stopped and told me \"You don't have permission to delete rads_user_kernel.exe\" AND I KNOW ITS NOT MY COMPUTER CAUSE I HAVE FULL ACCESS TO EVERYTHING ON THERE. Some where along the line of uninstalling and reinstalling this last time, something has **LOCKED** rads_user_kernel.exe\n\nI've done a solid couple hours of research and I have no idea what cased this or how to fix it.\n\nCan someone please help me.\n\nI'm on windows 10, and I have attempted to override my computer completely and access the file, but it keeps saying I dont have permission.\n\n\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T23:24:35.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen the notification about having to return to the legacy client, but you're really showing signs of a security setting that's blocking the updated client from installing properly and running.

Thank you very much for your help. It seems as though I had messed around with my Hard Drive a little to much. Won't happen again. I have fully reinstalled LoL and will **_NOT_** Be attempting the new Beta/Alpha Client till it becomes forced.\n\nAgain thank you so very much for your help\n\nHave a great evening.\n\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[]}]}]}
