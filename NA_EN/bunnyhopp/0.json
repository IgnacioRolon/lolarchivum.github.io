Once they're out, you'll have an eternity to buy them.\n\nThough there is some form of loading screen border that comes with these skins, so I think that might be limited-time offer. Or it might be based on a quest, I have no idea. In any case I don't give a fuck I just need my Star Guardian Syndra.","replies":[]}]}
