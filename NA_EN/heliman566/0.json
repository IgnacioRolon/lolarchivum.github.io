I'm not not 100% sure if it will be correctly recognized by the game since it's not our product and I haven't personally used it, buuuuuut I did find one of our players that absolutely LOVES it. I'm gonna copy pasta his response as well and the link to the old forum post for you to reference and think about!\n\nHope this is helpful ^_^\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3153787\n\n> I use a logitech G13 for LoL, and I can't imagine playing without it. The first week or so was awkward, but once I adjusted to the feel of the new key locations it just feels so much more natural (also, having that thumb joystick to control map movement is a godsend). Figuring out where you want to bind what actions is a long process of trial & error, but having a second monitor makes this process much easier. Also, the G13 configuration software is really simple (keys can be adjusted in seconds) and since you assign normal keystrokes to the G-keys, you can keep all keybindings in-game as they are so you can switch between the G13 and the normal keyboard w/o having to adjust anything in-game. \n> \n> PROS:\n> Comfortable Feel\n> Easy to adjust on-the-go (w/ a second monitor, this takes seconds)\n> Access to more buttons (I have small hands and can't use my pinky for shift/ctrl efficiently)\n> Seamless switching between G13/keyboard (based on your in-game bindings)\n> Joystick for camera movement\n> Backlit Keys (w/ customizable colors)\n> Macro support\n> 3 separate configurations (I use 1 for smart-casting, 1 for normal-casting, and 1 for pre-game macros (calling lanes, etc.))\n> Price (Cheaper than most gaming keyboards)\n> \n> Cons:\n> Takes time to adjust to the new feel\n> Process of perfecting your keybindings can take a while (trial & error)\n> Without a second monitor, adjusting keys takes longer\n> Cannot type in chat w/o switching back to your keyboard (though, this will discourage raging if you're prone to do so, since it's more of an effort to type)\n> Joystick is small (you get used to it, but a larger joystick would be so much nicer)\n> \n> Overall, G13 is well worth the money, just be willing to commit a week or so just to get used to it (please don't play ranked) and customize it w/o getting discouraged because it will initially feel very foreign and unnatural, but the end result is more than worth it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irenic Redeemer","date":"2018-01-07T11:30:13.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's currently a bug with the applet that runs when you're in League.

I got the G13 for Christmas, and I'm quite disappointed that the display doesn't work, but the keys work fine.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/fzkfu2jB-logitech-g13-lcd-screen","replies":[]}]}
