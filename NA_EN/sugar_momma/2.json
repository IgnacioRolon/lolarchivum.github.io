They convince themselves it must be on purpose, and often they take it as a direct affront against them (thus they get toxic toward the other player).\n\nNEWSFLASH: The world doesn&#039;t revolve around you. Matchmaking isn't perfect, and people have different skill levels. And everyone, regardless of skill, has bad games. Very, very few people intentionally play badly. And the few cases people DO intentionally play badly, they are likely provoked by someone being passive aggressive toward them for their previous un-intentional bad play. \n\nTrolling and having a bad game/being a bad player are not the same thing. Almost everyone who seems to think so (not coincidentally) have their own large share of mistakes as players, and would be better off focusing on improving themselves than trying to rationalize the bad play of others (by saying \"oh they must be a troll\").","replies":[{"poster":"Winters Dawn","date":"2017-08-02T21:14:57.269+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":17,"body":"There is a line between playing poorly and just being brain drad stupid. \nA legit inting troll who runs down lane and feeds 0-15 is JUST AS DAMAGING to the enjoyment and experiance of the game as someone who is going 0-15 in lane just because he is \"having a bad game\". \n\nThat player who is \"Just having a bad game\" is just as bad as an intentional feeder imo.

I don't try to keep spirits up but I don't flame them either. I just play doing the best that I can to carry, knowing its unlikely I win. And I win some of those games. Sometimes its too much, your team is too heavy and you aren't good enough, but if you aren't good enough to carry then thats on you, not them. If you want to CLIMB you gotta CARRY the shit players.

This is most prominent after a season reset, but it's true all year long, there are always people who didn't grind enough and who are lower than they should, or people who took too long of a break and are not as good as they were, so their MMR doesn't correspond to their displayed rating.\n\nTwo, the longer you wait in queue, the wider the range of MMR the match-making will accept to find you a game faster. This is most prominent at high MMR or in the very depths of Bronze 5, but it can play a role for everyone if you play in the little hours of the morning.\n\nThree, and most importantly, fucking premades. As of today, a Silver 5 is allowed to queue with a Gold 1. So you get Silvers in Gold games, and all the stupid stuff like that. It gets even worse if you factor the first point above: a Silver 5 *with a Bronze 2 MMR* is allowed to queue with a Gold 1 *with a Plat 4 MMR*. This is fucking ridiculous, and THAT is a good reason you should complain to Riot, because I am definitely NOT saying their system is perfect. Queuing restrictions should be based on MMR, not Rank. (And that's also a good argument to make MMR visible, not hidden as it currently is, while you're at it.)\n\nBut imagining a conspiracy to keep you down at a 50% winrate, by giving you \"bad\" team-mates on purpose when you're on win streak? That's just fucking stupid. That's bad business, that's bad for competition, that's bad on each and every account. Riot has not a single bloody reason to do that, and they are not doing that. That's as clear a fact as can be.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-08-04T19:13:41.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">One, it's the MMR that matters, not the displayed Ranked.

I mean, what reason _would_ a casino have to put customers on a huge win streak and then break it on their own accord? Of course no one isn't gonna want to play at a casino because they lose right?.... RIGHT?! Seriously, Riot is a business so I don't expect them to never cut corners or do anything shady.\n\nYou can continue to say they don't force a 50% but looking at all the factors of matchmaking and how trolls can actually be put in high mmr games as well as people on losing streaks I kinda have to go with my gut on that.\n\nWe might just have to agree to dissagree","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-08-04T21:18:26.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Contradicting your very first statement about \"...because they're ALL from the same MMR as you.\"\n\nOh come on, give me a break... Obviously, what I meant was, \"...because the system tries its best to get ALL players from the same MMR as you\". Except it's a quite a mouthful, should be obvious to everyone using half their brain and with a modicum of good faith, so I took a shortcut.

My initial claim was that \"no, the system doesn't give you bad teammates to balance out a good player\". I set out to dismiss this myth, nothing more, and I never talked about the general quality of the match-making system before this last comment.\n\n> Seriously, Riot is a business so I don't expect them to never cut corners or do anything shady.\n\nI do expect them to make whatever is necessary to maximize their gain *on the long term*. What you describe is just a catastrophe in waiting, and they would never endanger the health of their business in such a way. That would inevitably backfire at some point, and they may be \"greedy\", but they are not stupid.\n\nAnd come on, Trolls can be placed in high MMR? And that proves what exactly? Tyler1 got to Challenger, if I recall correctly. Is it because Riot gave him a free pass?

In the other you speak as if the system _has_ or _always_ does this. It's not a half a brain thing.
