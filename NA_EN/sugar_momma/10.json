This makes queue times larger when compounded by the fact that you have to match GROUPS and not INDIVIDUALS together.\r\n\r\nHonestly, how many people played solo vs. duo before? Very very few people played duo exclusively. Most people have played solo and will play solo again...Even if it means we can only do it. Why are we having Dynamic forced down our throats?

Don't tell me you have forgotten about those games you lost because one person failed to cooperate. Instead of continually bashing the system, maybe you should try to be friendly enough in your games that you can meet 4 other people that wouldn't mind playing with you. You don't even have to make \"friends\" you just need to find 4 other people that enjoy winning as much as you do to do what's necessary to improve at the game.","replies":[{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-03-24T17:34:40.307+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is definitely not true. with dynamic queue it's incredibly easy to carry people out of their rank. i'm saying this as someone who has a smurf in low silver that i use to carry my bronze friends out. they want end of season rewards, i put them in gold despite the fact that they're still at a low bronze skill level.\n\nhate me all you want i'm just legally abusing the system that riot gave to me\n\ni'm not doing it for money or anything, but dynamic queue definitely benefits boosters more than anyone else. a team of smurfs can put anyone at any rank without that person being good AT ALL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2016-03-24T11:24:07.372+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> How are they cheating their way to a certain rank?\n\nBecause you can be matched against people with less or more people in a premade. Riot even admitted that while there is only about a 1% chance, you still can get matched up with your team being all solo queue players while the entire enemy team is one single premade. Dynamic Queue is cheating your way to a certain rank because it represents the skill of your entire team, not you. You can be a not-so great player but still achieve Platinum easily simply because your team is composed of well rounded players who know how to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-03-24T22:16:46.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2016-03-23T21:41:05.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly!
