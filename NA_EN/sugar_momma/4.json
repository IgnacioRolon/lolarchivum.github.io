This post is meant to look at these changes objectively and explain why they are actually going to help Karma quite a bit.\r\n\r\n{{champion:43}}  is a wonderful champion, but she has issues at the moment as a _support_. She doesn&#039;t have enough utility scaling to justify picking her over similar champs like {{champion:40}} , {{champion:37}} , or {{champion:117}} .I love my mid Karma and top Karma (which are fine atm), but I&#039;ve been missing my support Karma. The changes on the PBE not only help support Karma but don&#039;t change mid/top Karma.\r\n\r\nThe change to her R-W is _in addition_ to the healing component; it is not being removed. Basically instead of her R-W doing bonus damage, it now roots for longer. Honestly, this is more in line with the spirit of the skill. R-W was always a bait skill. Now you can bait even harder with the longer root ON TOP of the heal.\r\n\r\nThe shield on her R-E is going to be enormous. On live it&#039;s about as strong as locket, with a lot of AP, a bit stronger. Now, she will be giving close to a {{champion:40}}  shield to the entire team...\r\n\r\nThe loss of dmg on her R-E is offset by the buffs to her passive late game. Not sure how the numbers will work out, but everything looks fine. Honestly, sometimes you don&#039;t even damage any enemies with R-E because you use it to engage (much like {{item:3069}} ). \r\n\r\nTwo things affect solo lane Karma here. The loss of dmg on her R-E affects her because she loses the wave clear from it. However, she can still wave clear just fine with her Q and R-Q (which thank god are being left untouched). \r\n\r\nAlthough she lost this wave clear, her W is getting its AP ratio buffed to 0.9 from 0.6. This means her MAIN damage combo (and the main damage combo for support Karma), Q - W - RQ is being buffed by 0.3 AP ratio, which is huge!! That&#039;d be like if Lux&#039;s ult went from a 0.7 AP ratio to a 1.0 AP ratio...You&#039;d be able to tell the difference.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure some of the numbers will still get tweaked. Also shout out to the W change to affect monsters!! Loving that.","replies":[{"poster":"aquaticwonder","date":"2015-05-19T00:04:03.384+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karma Jungle incoming! {{summoner:11}} \n\nThese are the best iterations of the changes that have been presented.\n\nThe issue with the previous changes were the removal of damage without adequate compensation to the rest of her kit. The buff to W allows for her to have sufficient damage to solo lane.\n\nAlso, I just wanted to say that I am really excited for the new support Karma and I am really excited for the RE mega shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2015-05-19T00:38:14.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karma jungle 4 life\n\n{{champion:43}} {{summoner:11}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-05-18T20:45:58.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"She has a lot of Issues, she just doesn´t scale that well as a Sololaner currently - and they just amplify that further by taking away the dmg from w/e mantra. You need to deal some dmg in order to be a viable mage later on in the game, with these changes she just adds less utility than Lulu and less dmg - and has the less frightening laningphase to play against anyway. So i don´t see how this will ever help her out, besides as a non-competitive support.\nShoehorning her into one role is really not the path they should go down - or if they want to do that, they should just (re-)release old Karma as a new Champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2015-05-18T22:06:07.431+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not being shoehorned into one role. \n\nShe actually scales VERY well as a solo laner at the moment.

To play mid/top Karma effectively, you should help peel for your adc most of the time honestly. The amount of dmg you do combined with your utility make it very hard for your carries to die, especially if you have another support.","replies":[{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-05-19T02:35:09.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not meant to?
