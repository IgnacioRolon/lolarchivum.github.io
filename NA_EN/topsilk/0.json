It could be due to some stability or maybe some update that is forcing your connection to block off these services.  My suggestion would be to use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, along with the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help auto-configure your firewall settings.
