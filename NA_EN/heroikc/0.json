It doesn&#039;t really prove either side of any sensible argument.  It sounds more like your threatening to chop off your own legs unless I admit I&#039;m wrong...typically for something as trivial as whose taller.  Like you&#039;re just desperate for the argument to end but too prideful to concede it or to even mute the other.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please enlighten me on what&#039;s up with that?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-07T03:47:04.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they are trash.
