League isn&#039;t fun anymore because Riot adds more competitive elements to the game every year to the point where every game feels like a life or death scenario. Even the games you win all you can really think about is &#039;&#039;oh my ADC was so bad that game.&#039;&#039; We&#039;ve gotten to the point where only winning matters and every little mistake you make puts you on tilt as you aren&#039;t performing your best or a horrible teammates costs you the game and you get salty because you didn&#039;t win. Game is just really stressful and that&#039;s why people are moving to the battle royal genre because your mistakes don&#039;t matter you queue up for another game and start off fresh but a league loss means so much more. The balance team also makes pretty bad decisions I feel like they have a tendency to buff champions they play and I really hate dodging games all the time in champ select as in reality games are won by the champions you play picking non meta champions honestly loses you games which isn&#039;t fair I feel players should be able to play whatever they&#039;d like so yeah there is no balance in this game. I think if they made dodging games nonpunishable or you only lost 3 LP every time instead of getting a timer that could help things a lot but at the same time people would abuse the hell out of it so I have no idea how to resolve this issue. Best resolution in my opinion is to change the whole LP system and implement something new because it sucks so much it actively works against you climbing and also duo queue shouldn&#039;t exist either I hate duos so much they are always terrible. The punishment system needs to be addressed I&#039;ve seen a lot of guys straight run it down mid all the time without punishment but the instant they curse they get punished, personally I don&#039;t care how hard you flame as long as you try to win that&#039;s all that is important. AFKers get punished but the support team does nothing against feeders at all and if you flame them and they report you you could get punished instead.","replies":[]}
