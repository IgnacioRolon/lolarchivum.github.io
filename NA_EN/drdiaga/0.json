He is one of those champs where if a bad lane feeds him, even if I&#039;m personally doing well, I feel like there is nothing I can do to stop him.\r\n\r\nThis is likely a bronze problem since getting your team to work together is a nightmare, but as a solo player once someone feeds tryn its incredibly frustrating to deal with.\r\n\r\nEven if I could have potentially killed him, he ults and usually can win that fight.\r\n\r\nNot saying he is op or anything, just feels impossible to deal with if someone on your team feeds him.","replies":[{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-04-26T22:41:24.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes a stak check champion. but he also has all the tools he needs to win a 1v1. he can reduce your ad. you can't really one shot him because of his ult. in a prolonged fight he gets more and more power. and he reduced your ad with his w. he has heal and a kayle ult that lasts 2 seconds longer. also no resources to worry about .hes pretty poorly designed\n\njust play teemo. get frozen mallet and kite him he cant do much at all against teemo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2016-04-26T21:33:36.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play someone with alot of waveclear and force him to stay at tower.

If you mean youre playing in another lane and your top laner feeds him, then you need to out split push him. I used to have that very problem but i learned to pressure harder than him, and he WILL come deal with you. All trynds think theyre 1v1 gods but if you can kite him , no matter how fed he is, he becomes useless. I havent struggled against a trynd in like 2 years. To me, he feels like teemo. Useless if you dont play into their games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SlaktarTasken","date":"2016-04-27T09:21:32.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, any champion that get's fed is going to give you a headache. \n\nZed will give you a headache if he get's early kills, Fizz will as well. \nPretty much any champ that gets ahead gets a power buffer. \n\nOn the contrary, I'd say Tryndamere is easier to deal with than many champs even if he get's ahead because he can literally do nothing to you unless he's smashing you head in with autos, unlike a fed mage, assassin or adc, who will just delete you in a the blink of an eye. \n\nOr a fed tank, who will soak your entire teams damage while doing good damage and allowing his team to mop the floor with you. \n\nTryndamere can neither burst you from a distance, ravage you with dps from a distance or just insta assassinate you with abilites, he needs to connect to do anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JerulEon","date":"2016-04-27T04:58:44.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to identify your win conditions. Either send 2 to kill him top or 5v4 against the rest of his team to win a team fight. It is really situational, which is why beating Trynd takes some good map awareness/decision making.\n\nItems that can help counter him are {{item:3143}} and {{item:3512}}.","replies":[]}]}
