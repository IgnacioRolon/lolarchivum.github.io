I made the mistake of updating Windows 10 before  I went to bed. Today, queuing up for a game causes my whole computer to freeze. I tried turning off SmartScreen but that didn't work. I'm losing LP and got put in low priority queue over something that isn't my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T03:33:25.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm let's go ahead and double-check that the XBox Game DVR hasn't been turned back on as well. Some players have noted that each Windows 10 Creators Update has reenabled it, causing some pretty weird FPS and graphics issues. Check for that, turn it back off if needed, and let me know how that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"SEAMANSPRAYER","date":"2017-08-07T03:39:43.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for replying, I turned off the xbox game dvr too and my whole computer violently shut off again. The screen turned into a bunch of blue and yellow rectangles then it restarted. Only happens when I have the league client open","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T04:20:17.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh lordt O_O! That definitely can't be good.
