If you read properly, he said that his keys are working perfectly fine out of game so i dont think this is a hardware issue. A lot of people are having the same problem, so please if you could look into it more seriously and get a fix out of this because it is really frustrating. Everything was good before the new patch so there is definitely something not done right. We really want to resume our gameplay asap. Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T17:36:25.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changing hardware can still help, especially in cases of specialty brands that offer software alongside so it doesn't hurt to try.  If you're having this issue, did resetting your config work?  \n\nTo clarify, I'm not trying dismiss anything and if there is a possibility of an issue occurring for players then we need to troubleshoot and figure it out together.  There could be a few factors causing this, and we won't know more until we work it out!","replies":[{"poster":"Racy","date":"2017-01-12T17:45:29.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are missing the point here. If this problem only came after the new patch, and that everything was working fine before why is there a need for a change in anything at all?\n\nPlus, I don't see why hardware would cause the in-game controls not to work but when you're out of it, everything works fine... But you are right, it doesn't hurt to try. Maybe he'd get back to you on that but I doubt it'd fix his problem.\n\nThe mac community just needs a response from riot that they are indeed looking at this issue and fixing it asap as it disrupts our gameplay terribly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Afro Disco","date":"2017-01-13T01:37:13.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=3kmo6Edn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-12T16:49:02.541+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d first suggest swapping keyboards just in case to rule out any hardware possibilities.

Im using macbook pro to play league so i don't have spare keyboards that i can use to swap, but, just to let you know, i have no problems with my hardware.

This is still a serious problem and it looks like you don't even care about it. Let a senior member tackle this problem please. I notice that I play a lot less games now because of this annoying bug.

I got the exact same problem. In game it looks like the game isn't on the full screen modus while it is. On mac we have such a thing as interactive corners. Here you can pre set what your computer has to do when you go with your mouse to a certain corner. I got my upper left corner set as home screen. So every time I am in game and i go to that corner it goes to my home screen. Whilst this was never a problem before. And like mentioned above in game itself the controls are ***. We can't use our spells/abilities, because it looks like the computer thinks we are not on full screen modus or something. It operates the screen behind the League game, while League is on full screen modus at that point. So basically we are unable to play a normal game like this. The problem started after the newest update, 7,2 I believe. Riot please further investigate this because I know a lot of Apple users that are all having the same issue at the moment.
