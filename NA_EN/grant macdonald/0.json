In some games I will have this weird lag where my inputs take ages to work on the screen, or things stop moving and then the game catches up. The thing is my ping is at a stable 23 and my fps has been sitting fine at 60. And it isn't every game, it seems to be random. Anyone experiencing the same thing/ got any advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T17:10:19.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kind of input delay could be due to packet loss which will cause your game to stutter.
