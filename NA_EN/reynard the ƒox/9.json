Had 2 ppl on my team, in the same game, that were afk. So it was a 3v5 and obviously we lost. I then lost 17 LP for it. How should i be punished by losing LP for something someone else did? And the best part is, while those of us that stick it out and honorably surrender, lose LP for it....the people who actually go afk and ruin the game get away and never receive punishment.","replies":[]}]}
