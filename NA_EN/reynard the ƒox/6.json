For cs'ing, use your waveclear when the minions are low, and stay out of Annie's range. If she walks toward you, you can walk away because her range is reasonably short. She'll take minion aggro, and if you're someone like Ahri, you can cc her with a skillshot that outranges her.\n\nAnd if she doesn't take that kind of bait, and just sits on her stun, you can just play the patience game and see if she starts using her Q to last-hit. Her W is waveclear, but her Q is a common last-hitting tool. Trust me, not all Annies just sit on their stun for five minutes and never cast spells.\n\nNot to mention she's immobile, short-ranged for a mage, and her cc is on her passive and can be predicted (and see when used for farming, giving you a window of opportunity).\n\nDon't act helpless, you have an item to block her spell if she actually sits on her passive for that long without casting spells, and many champions that completely outrange her. If she sits on her passive, she's going to be pushed if she doesn't push back and waste a Q or two on minions. Then she'll miss out on cs if she doesn't use her Q if the tower takes minions.

All of those basic tactics for laning work on her and as a champion, she has little ability to outplay.

The inevitable lvl 6 jungle gank with tibbers started a huge snowball, it's like people have forgotten the damage a Deathcap Annie can do.\n\nIt doesn't really help the OP, but any character that can flex two lanes like that is super strong.  Even if the secondary lane you'd choose might be weaker it gives you the opportunity to use your last pick to counter two different lane matchups.
