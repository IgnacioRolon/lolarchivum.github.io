I would be REALLY surprised if that was the case. I suspect it's just Riot diversifying their interests.\n\nThey may make it a 'recommended voice option', but I don't see them incorporating it full off.\n\n(EDit: I just hope Curse uses that money to invest in some improved network security... since they've historically been REALLY bad in that area)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2015-07-14T20:07:05.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats why Wow has teamspeak......yet league has.....nothing, but for you to download skype","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-07-14T20:14:08.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Radnar the bold,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=eiFAmy7o,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-14T20:07:05.044+0000)\n>\n> Thats why Wow has teamspeak......yet league has.....nothing, but for you to download skype\n\nLeague has teamspeak, vent, mumble, etc.\n\nWoW has built in voice chat but... I think the last time Blizz talked about it something like 0.01% of people playing the game actually opted into using it because most people preferred to use their OWN voice options.\n\nIn this day and age building a voice chat system into a PC game is counterproductive. There are so many options out there that are FAR SUPERIOR to any built in vc that you might as well just let people use the one they want rather than wasting money on it.\n\nRazer Comms, Vent, Skype, Mumble, TS, raidcall, hell you can even set up your own private server for relaying voice packets... there are so many choices and every single one of them is vastly superior to ANYTHING that is possible to do using an in-game vc system since they're not tied to one game.","replies":[{"poster":"Snazzy Bowtie","date":"2015-07-14T20:20:33.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree there are lot of options for voice chat but not with randoms.

There are simply too many barriers to communication that are present with voice but not with text. I will never want voice chat with someone I don't know. Ever.\n\nAnd again, it's not because I'm afraid of toxicity. I don't care if Jimmy, the 12 year old noob, wants to cuss like a sailor. Have fun with that. What I care about is the other shit. Language barriers, speech impediments(I, myself, have a minor lisp), strong accents, and noise pollution. When playing with friends, we'll have a pecking order. We'll know who is talking and when people can talk. It'll be fun. When playing with strangers, it's just a recipe for a headache. And it's a headache I don't want to deal with.\n\nAlso I prefer text chat since it leaves a timestamp. Timestamps are AWESOME.","replies":[{"poster":"Snazzy Bowtie","date":"2015-07-14T20:26:45.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think a team using voice chat has a higher win rate against a team with no voice chat?

I think a team that is NOT used to using voice chat will have an approximately equal win rate provided that the team using text chat actually uses text chat to their advantage and both teams use pings.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-07-14T20:04:41.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also, communication in league is counterproductive because of the report system anyways","replies":[]},{"poster":"ofc2000alex","date":"2015-07-14T20:29:21.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there was voice chat, you'd get whiners and trollers and cussers.
