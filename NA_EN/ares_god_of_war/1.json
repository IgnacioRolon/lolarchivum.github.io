If it turns into the Windows cursor, it's likely some kind of overlay from Discord or something taking control of the screen, which you can fix by turning off Discord.\n\nIf it's still the League cursor and you just can't get anything to work, I'd try a quick config reset to see if your hotkeys are going all wonky for some weird reason.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Ares God Of War","date":"2018-01-30T22:25:24.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty i think that solved the issue much appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T01:22:18.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweetness! \n\nPS I couldn't resist because of your Summoner Name, did you see the new God of War trailer fam?\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ares God Of War","date":"2018-02-02T03:30:21.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah looks lit","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
