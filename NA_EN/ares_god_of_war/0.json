If so there's a really good chance some other program in the background is taking the focus of the window away from League. Make sure nothing like Discord is running in the background so there aren't any overlays causing problems. \n\nIf it's not the Windows cursor thing happening, it might just be your hotkeys going a little wonky. In that case, a good config reset would do the trick.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
