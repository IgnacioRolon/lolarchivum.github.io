You can use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically configure your firewall settings, but this may actually be less about your network and instead your permissions.  I suggest going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure your PC is allowing league access.
