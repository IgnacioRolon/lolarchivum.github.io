First of all, I know - this is alpha.\n\n**Lobby:**\n1. Game mode selection is not obvious and a bit clunky. I highly prefer the old one (I mean tree-type menu with mode selection when you press Play button).\n2. Comparing to old lobby there is lack of animations and no eye-candy at all. I mean initial screen where you can chat and invite your friends is so simple and not alive.\n3. Role icons is terrible and unclean to read. Old ones are way better.\n\n**Champion select:**\n1. Chat window is too small. Old chat have more visible strings than new one.\n2. If someone dodge then chat cleanup and I can&#039;t read logs or conversation from previous lobby anymore. This thing helps to do some target bans if you remember your last team intent picks and don&#039;t see them in your new team (they most likely in enemy team now).\n3. There is no minimap in right-bottom corner. This map was a great tool to get info about what side of map you will play (Blue/Red). Also I used it to know which champions have picked by my teammates while browsing the web.\n3a. You can&#039;t really know on what side of map you will play if you miss initial screen with map preview.\n4. Now I can&#039;t choose my skin after locking in champion. I forced to wait until all 10 players will pick their champions. I can understand this because of graphics disign but this is really uncomfortable. With old client if I have 1st-3rd pick I used to lock it then choose my skin and then freely afk 1-2 minutes before game starts. Now I forced to sit while others picking.\n5. I enjoy ban quotes but there is no other sounds that was used in old client. I think for clarity sound overlay in champion select should be the same.\n6. Team sidebar with role, nickname and champion is unclear. What I mean: for now there is huge accent on player&#039;s role (big capsed text) and small text with nickname and champion name. In old client nickname was major thing. If someone write something in chat I see his nickname but it&#039;s a bit hard to know what role this guy have and why he ask me to change roles. I think nickname and role labels need to be swapped on sidebar. Otherwise add role in chat strings, for example _&quot;RivenMain420 **(Jungle)**: LET ME TOP RIVEN OTP???&quot;_.\n\n**Postgame screen:**\n1. Honor/report buttons is non-obvious.\n2. I think everyone agree that &quot;Damage dealt&quot; graph is the most common thing that people check after game. For now to get this graph you need to click &quot;Advanced info&quot; button and then choose &quot;Graphs&quot; tab. I think better if clicking &quot;Advanced Info&quot; would show Graph view by default.\n3. Also chat is too small. You know that after hard game this chat is the most juicy thing. It&#039;s hard to read now.\n\n**Others:**\n1. Mastery/Rune tab: I really think that ComboBox have very low usability level if it&#039;s usage rate is more than 1 /per session. I think dedicated buttons for every mastery/rune page way more comfortable to use. Imagine situation when you need to compare you pages: how many clicks you will need to do with ComboBox (new client) and with buttons (old client)?\n2. Window resize is a great feature. However I would like to see more size presets. For example I have 1920x1080 screen so default 720p client is too small for me but I hate to use fullscreen windows. Something like 1440x900 would be awesome.\n3. Friend list hint is lack of information. I don&#039;t see friends rank, mastery pts or queue etc.\n4. Champion select/ban quotes should have separate volume slider. I don&#039;t know why but even if I set SFX and Music volume to 10% (like I always do) champion quotes are still way too loud like a thunder.\n\nThank you for reading I think this feedback will be useful!

So say you are playing on a 1920x1080 monitor it will change it to the closet client resolution to match that instead of someone having to redo it all the time. The client being by default @ 720p just feels so small compared to what the main client size is at the moment.\n\nPlus there are league players who hardly go into their settings and will probably not even notice that they can change their client resolution now because you could never do it before. It's something small but I would like to see it be added. Besides that, I'm really liking how modern this client feels compared to the main one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrevBoss","date":"2016-10-13T23:21:59.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh man this post is swimming with rioters xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anonimly","date":"2016-10-13T23:22:07.416+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with most of this, but I would like to add in one thing that the old client does better, that is mastery selection.  In the old client it is much faster to pick through your masteries and adjust them to the team comps.  I was third pick on red side when I noticed this, and clicking through my masteries took from my lock in until the last person on blue side was locking in and I knew what I wanted in my masteries, the client is just slow.

I wish they could get rid of the always-open friends list (which I have no interest in) and just put the post-game chat there instead.\n\nOverall, I think the always-open friends list is detrimental to the rest of the client - it takes up such a large percentage of the screen real estate that a lot of things throughout the client feel a bit cramped to make room for it.\nThe post-game chat is just the place where it stands out the most.","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-10-13T20:34:38.424+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes! the always open friendlist is kind of annoying, I think it's because we're used to it being closeable but looking at it from their perspective, I think that having an element that appears and dissapears can clutter the screen a bit at times, for example friendlist on current client is sometimes over youtube content and in champ select it blocks the enemy champion picks... that's where it gets also annoying.\n\nI think it would be ok for friendlist to dissapear if the space behind it would NEVER have any content on it... so in the end they'd need to increase the client's size either way :S","replies":[{"poster":"Breaku","date":"2016-10-13T21:04:42.088+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I mean, I only open it when I need to look at it otherwise it's useless information.\n\nSo, if it's covering anything, it just goes away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gin Cao Khum Lao","date":"2016-10-14T04:31:33.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also would like for the friend's list to be somewhat retractable.

For example, you have to go to another window entirely to choose ranked, draft, or blind. In the old client, they were all in a line, in a flow chart sense, which meant you could open the client and, with relative ease and speed, you could be in a queue waiting to play.\n\n-The friend list: I do not think that it should be open all the time (un-shrinkable), mainly because some people, i don't know the numbers, probably do not have friends on lol, and for those who do, they mainly use it for checking to see who's online, chatting, spectating, and inviting them to games. This, in my opinion, is a good reason to have the chat be customisable to the individual user's preferences.\n\n-Mastery page: In the old client, you could change mastery pages, mastery's themselves, and adding/removing pages much easier than you can in this one. Also, it seemed a bit cleaner with them all in a line, so you don't need to click and scroll. Maybe you could add the titles in a vertical line down the left side? Also i saw somewhere that it might be a good idea to implement a drag and drop system to customise where on the list each page appeared, for ease of access.\n\n-Profile home page: I think this is mostly personal, but i loved the feature where you could rotate through the game modes and see your rank for each one. The main one being norms, mostly because it shows what rank you could get up to(i am lower rank in ranked than i am in norms-bronze/plat-) from where you currently are or were, kind of as a motivational thing.\n\n-Rune page: No constructive criticism this time, just wanted to say i loved the feel of the new one\n\nso ye i hope this helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"supertoxictoast","date":"2016-10-14T02:00:18.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if this was already said, but I didn't see it clearly above, but i think that the window where you have all of your suggested friends to invite is a little small.
