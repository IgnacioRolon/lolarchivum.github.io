There are probably reasons why Runeglaive is a better pick on him that would be more apparent if I played the champ, but my point is that runeglaive getting nerfed because \"it gives clear to champs who shouldn't have it\" doesn't make sense when a similar item that does the same thing has existed for awhile now.\n\nMy guess is that AP Ez isn't getting nerfed because of his synergy with Runeglaive making him OP, he's getting nerfed because runeglaive made him get popular and brought to light some of his issues that Riot was able to ignore before.
