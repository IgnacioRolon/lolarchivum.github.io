I saw my match history before I used the tool, and I saw they did remake.\n\nI don't want to get another penalty just because some game files were corrupted and I didn't knew. Like come on! \n\nCan I skip the penalty or not? {{champion:32}}\n\nEdit: Nevermind. I didn't got the LeaverBuster. Although, now that I think of it, there should be something that the Devs can do to make players that had the same issue has I did, or that got some error during a match, not get penalties. I mean, it's not their fault they got the game broke. And let's not forget about those who are on their team.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T22:44:43.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) can only be removed by playing through the required games.  I know leaving wasn't intentional, but it's going to treat all leaves equally due to the negative experiences they still cause others.  I'm glad to hear you didn't get a penalty, but it's really important to take a break from matchmaking until this issue is resolved.\n\nWhat exactly is happening, are you crashing and is it at any specific point?  Are there any error messages or a bugsplat?  Let me know, and I'll try to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Greyscarr","date":"2017-07-26T12:04:26.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now everything is running smoothly, so there is no problem atm. But whenever I format my computer, and download League of Legends, it says that I have corrupted files. And it only pops up when I enter an online match. Interestingly, the game didn't crashed when I did a custom game with another person that was on my network, and it was actually running pretty fine.\n\nOnce I try to enter a match (after the champion select) the game pops up a BugSplat report. Then I close League and open again, and it tells me I have corrupt files on my game folder. \"Ok, fine. Just fix it quickly, the game is almost starting.\". Then I enter the launcher, I go to see my match history and there is right there a remake. I'm really pissed at that moment, because I remember that I got a LeaverBuster for the fact that my team remaked and I had to wait 20 min and do a match 5 times. Interestingly, I didn't got the LeaverBuster, even tho I got it by doing the same thing before.\n\nI don't know why the files get corrupted once I install League.","replies":[]}]}]}
