Like, my win rate is higher then 50 percent (it's 52.7% out of 277 games) but even when I do get fed, I feel like the top laner can always one shot me due to the fact that nobody peels for me. But what's your opinion on what role can carry the hardest in Bronze 1 - Silver 3 elo?\n\nEdit: After looking through the comments, it seems like the solo lanes and jg carry the hardest. Since I already have friends that play in the jg and mid lane, what would be a good champion to play in the top lane? Preferably a one trick (cuz i think one tricks are really cool)","replies":[{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2019-06-16T08:43:30.618+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle by far, carry via objectives and map control is really the best way.","replies":[{"poster":"Feel Apathy","date":"2019-06-16T09:10:16.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nYou have impact on the whole map, shelly &amp; dragon can provide good bonuses for your whole team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2019-06-16T04:10:25.349+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The answer is yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Tekknical","date":"2019-06-16T04:11:13.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah ok.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-16T03:48:50.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh low elo games have been so unpredictable for me sometimes they are super easy and enemies play like bots and sometimes they play like smurfs people will try to give u a one tip that fits all but i don't think it's that simple","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-16T04:42:17.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jungle, since people will be out of place frequently and you can capitalize on their greed.
