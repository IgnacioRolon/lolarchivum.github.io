Being cocky does not equate to a lack of empathy or morality, and trash talk is a part of all sports whether you like it or not. Vocalizing/communicating your emotions to others is definitely not a sign of sociopathic behavior, it's just rude.\n\nWhile it can sometimes be offensive; it doesn't necessarily constitute de-humanization. I actually interpret the opposite due to the fact that a person is taking pride in the fact that they are better than others, thus the shit-talking. It would be different if someone were raging at an NPC or the game bugging, but in a competitive game like league of legends, it should be fairly obvious that in order to take pride in your own skills you need to be better than \"someone\" else. A person who rages or shit-talks others is an asshole, but he is definitely not a sociopath.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2019-02-16T11:25:27.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, hold on.

Psychological disorders are not something to be thrown around lightly.
