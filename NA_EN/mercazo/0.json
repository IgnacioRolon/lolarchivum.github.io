On my littler one I can play LoL perfectly with no issues. On my bigger one, LoL is completely choppy and laggy, on top of that for some reason it also makes my ping well over 1k, I've tried fiddling with settings in a custom game and on the display settings for the big monitor itself, but i cannot seem to find out how to fix it, if anyone knows or can think of a solution, i would greatly appreciate it, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T04:32:16.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange.
