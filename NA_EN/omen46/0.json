Can't play anymore.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, posted to the wrong site just a second ago...\r\n\r\nSo to repeat the story, I changed to upgrade alpha client because the idea of the free roam practice tool sounded amazing and it was! i learned a lot of things but It was nice to mess around it just with something like full ap {{champion:12}}. unfortunately, I am now getting a send error report every time i open the game. before that, i happened to have issues even entering a game. i couldn't accept the AFK check for some reason while i was chatting, (and i chat a lot,) so i can't play games because the client refused to allow my to play.  I went to fix it with the hextech tool, and it didn't help. The next time i decided to get rid of it and tried to use the hextech tool to re-install the game. mid unistall my tool crashed. I re-installed on my own. and uninstalled my hextech tool. i reinstalled the game. deleted the folder of league of legends on my comp manually. my games are normal most the times. but the last couple games were something else. permenant 200-400ping and flashes of the game freezing entirely. Everything stops moving except the health bars. I can't even tell i'm getting ganked because nothing moves except my hp bar. I can't play the game like that!!\r\n\r\nI keep getting a 'send riot info on a crashed file' and sent them email and everything and they ignore it every time. I'm hoping someone here can help me search for this new problem. I haven't laggedd like this since i was playing of McDonalds free Wi-Fi \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T21:33:11.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have an odd combination of issues here, if you're having both high ping as well as bugsplat errors.  Are you on a Mac or PC?    These bugsplats can happen if you have bad game files, outdated drivers, or failing hardware.  Since you used our HRT and reinstalled then I suggest going over each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot.  This will help rule out possibilities!\n\nRegarding your higher ping, run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure you're able to get through to our game servers without issue.  The HRT should have a firewall config option to help with that!\n\nTest these in a custom game, and let me know the results!","replies":[{"poster":"Omen46","date":"2017-03-08T07:50:44.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um.... is it too much to ask for a hand with this? I can handle fixing up hardware but when it comes to programs and software you might as well be asking {{champion:150}} to fix a computer. I'm gunna have a hard time with this. I'm not asking you to drop whatever youur doing at whatever moment! but if you got a second... I'll be here.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T16:37:20.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We got you!

The current game is decided in both top and mid lanes. An effective adc makes _some_ difference but in the end a top laner or midlaner will always destroy them if they get caught out because of all the gap closeing abilities they have. Then there is the term I keep hearing of 'carry champions'. Does that mean that without any of those kind of champions there is no way to win a game? To follow up, shouldn't any champion be able to fight any other champion? Is it truly going to be useless to take some champion like {{champion:110}} and try to tank them anymore? Is riot going to force Meta gameplay to a point where there is now longer any reason to attempt difference?\n\nsorry but this is the first time i heard from an actual riot employee and it really bugs me to try and think about this. If it bothers you or is too difficult to answer I'd prefer you just ignore it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
