I&#039;ve been using FB instead of DB because my fingers can only stretch 9 keys, and DB is 10. I&#039;ve also tried using the right hand to stretch from high A to B, but that&#039;s also 10 keys wide. Was the composer able to make the stretch? And, if not, is it possible at all?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5A4W9yS.png","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-11-13T16:04:08.105+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Arcade Gumiho,\n\nI'm not sure where you found that particular copy of the sheet music but there are mistakes in the version you've posted.

When I wrote Kindred's theme I went pretty all-out in terms of the piano writing. I'm afraid there isn't much room to incorporate the cello part without reducing the density of the original piano part dramatically (or growing an extra arm).","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-11-15T20:48:33.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prxzm","date":"2016-11-15T13:28:08.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely!\n\nIf you're interested in viewing where I got the sheet music from, here's the version I learned of it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlot5Unzjjc\n\nI'll, without a doubt, go back and learn thee original composition sometime though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anski","date":"2016-11-13T11:25:29.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you move your hand to the side of the keys instead of on top of them you can pull the two lowest notes down with your pinky and thumb without pushing any other keys down.\n\nI can't imagine that chord has a lot of practicality.
