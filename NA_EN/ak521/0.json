I caught Riot AdamUnicorn this morning, who had a bit of time, and he touched this up (it was a super quick fix!)\n\nI just verified that the fix works, and it'll be on PBE tomorrow. This should hit live in 7.19. :)\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"ak521","date":"2017-09-16T11:28:59.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
