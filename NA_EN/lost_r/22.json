I support main in the first place because it's more convenient to just remove that option, THE most hated option, from what everyone else will have to choose from (barring duo bots). I had to do this starting back in Season three when people would have literally violent physical reactions to even the idea of being the support, and would throw games and go full tilt apeshit over it. I used to do it just so I could POSSIBLY play a normal game. Now I do it out of habit.\r\n\r\nLately, though, I've been trying to play other roles as a chance of pace, but I keep encountering games where people vehemently reject going support. Not sure if it's just me and I keep getting the leftovers from Season three, or if this speaks to a broader narrative and the support stigma is still strong. The support is an important role in the team; one of the most important roles, really. They're basically doing everything the rest of the team isn't or can't; buffing, debuffing, warding, setting up kills, tanking, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is still a strong negativity to the role, and you still have the leftovers of prior seasons who use the support as their personal punching bag and see them only as ward mules and intentional feeders to report should you lose the game, along with a list of other names we will not mention in polite company.

So experiences are out of date.\n\nSupport has some issues that tend to make people shy away from playing it, especially in solo-queue.\n\n1) Even when you and your team are doing very well, you tend to fall behind players not only players on your team, but the enemy team as well. Supports are almost always under-leveled at the end of the match, and even with amazing scores will have less gold than the enemy midlane who fed all match long. It can take a bit of wind out of your sails when you look at your 0/1/17 only to see the 0/9/3 Fizz had more gold than you because he could use E on the caster minions.\n\n2) Given the typical (or perhaps expected is a better word) support itemization, you will usually end the game with an inventory that feels underwhelming.\n\n3) Combining 1&2 tends to mean that the support is incredibly squishy. Even compared to glass-cannon ADCs, many supports end up being squishier due to being behind on levels and lacking reasonable sustain. It might be good for the team when the enemy assassin wastes his ulti targeting you in a fight, but your still staring at a grey screen in the time it takes you to blink. \n\n4) There are still a surprisingly high number of people who think a support should somehow have wards up covering the entire map, save the ADC who walks into melee range of 5 enemy champs, and generally answer the beck and call of anyone else on the team. \n\n(You know how junglers get a lot of guff in the laning phase? That frequently switches to the support once \"jungler should be ganking\" is no longer a viable excuse)","replies":[{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2014-10-07T23:10:49.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1&2: I know that.

One of my best strategies is to bank on that happening, and then punish the enemy for that (Flash away right as Lee Sin flies in, dragging him somewhere he *really* doesn't want to be, throwing Aqua Prison down on myself as Zed ults in, tossing up every shield item/spell I have to force the enemy to focus me for too long, etc.). \n\nThe most recent case of this strategy was my last game with Braum. I stayed behind to guard the outer turret as Lucian recalled. Tristana and Soraka came in, and of course I couldn't hold them off for long, especially because I had less than a third of my HP left. I was about to withdraw as I saw Lucian making his approach past the inner turret at this point, so I stood my ground. Right as the turret blew up, Tristana jumped on top of me and threw down her entire salvo with Soraka bringing up the rear. I threw down both shield buffs and Face of the Mountain and Exhaust on Tristana. Right as that happened, Lucian (who I can only guess used his dash and flash followed up by his heal once he was within range to close the gap so quickly) barreled in with his ult, blasting through the remaining enemy minions, shot through to Soraka while I held down Tristana with my passive and ult, vaporizing the former within a few seconds before finishing off Tristana before she could jump away, both of whom were at near full health when that fight began.\n\n4: Unfortunately there's little I can do once I hit my ward limit, and it's astounding how many people outright refuse to ward even with the free trinket given to you at the start of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Soleka","date":"2014-10-08T05:59:20.908+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate getting the following line \"Support needs to ward more!\" I've already thrown down my 3 wards in the best areas to protect against ganks and to see movement.

The most common build I see on them are Boots of Mobility, Talisman of Ascension, and a Sightstone. These are the first three items they build, which is basically rushing (and investing in) the ability to grab the enemy for free kills. It's an all or nothing build and strategy (which makes Blitz toxic and why he needs a rework. For Thresh it neglects and speaks ill for his other abilities) that I see work only rarely, and usually that's because one person or another gets complacent. It doubly annoys me when said Blitz or Thresh says they're going to tank, and then don't build any tank items until their core build is completed, especially if Thresh isn't collecting souls. It makes them a glass tank that invests too much into making the grab for free kills.

You didn't manage to out-duel Zed, you ungrateful ass, your support Exhausted him so he was only dealing 60% of his actual damage. You didn't \"outplay\" the other ADC, it was the shield/heal from your support that gave you the extra health you needed to actually kill him. Don't mock the enemy jungler for wasting his time in the bush, as if you had outsmarted him, the only reason you can see him is because your support warded it. Don't pat yourself in the back for that doublekill when 90% of the damage they took was from your Zyra/Karma/Zilean dishing out truly disgusting amounts of magic damage and then holding back at the last second so that you can get the kill.

This season, I have 70 Lulu games, 30 Nami/Leona games. I'm currently in Gold V. Used to be a support main before I reached Silver I. The Lulu nerfs really put a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI don't feel like support is a very fun role to play, especially at lower divisions. You are always dependent on your ADC early game. Even if your opponent has terrible positioning, if your ADC refuses to help you, you can't do much. It's much more difficult to dominate as a support and they never have a power spike like they do in other MOBAs.\n\nWhen you come out of the laning phase and top/mid/jungle are fed on the enemy team, you have nothing to counteract that in terms of items, whereas every single other role in the game does. Even if you land your abilities, you do a negligible amount of damage. It's like playing Ahri with no gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-10-08T19:16:49.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The support position is still wonky at best.

You can get away with building AP with a lot of support mages and in fact are incentivized for this because Riot added ratios to their abilities. You have more AP, you have more heals or shielding, and your natural utility goes up. Taric deals more damage the more armor he has, and by proxy provides more armor to his team and can strip away from the enemy, so he's encouraged to build a pure tank path.\n\nUtility items are pretty limited as it stands, so the supports have to mostly rely on their own abilities to keep themselves and their team alive. If you build boots of mobility, talisman of ascension and ruby sightstone as your first three items, you aren't going to be able to take many punches for your team, which is especially bad if you're the tank, and your utility will mostly hinge on the ability to land one spell.\n\nThe idea is to capitalize on what your champion can do best, and investing in giant stat sticks, while it works on the AD carry or assassin or bruiser, doesn't apply evenly to the support. For example, Braum's greatest offensive strength is his passive. The problem is landing those blows in a short enough time. Hopefully you aren't dueling an enemy, but in a teamfight, a second can be the difference between life and death, victory or defeat. A good item to build that will assist with stacking the passive and increasing your tankiness is Wit's End. It gives you the attack speed to stack concussive blows faster, a little bit of magic damage to make you a tiny bit stronger, and magic resist to aid you against mages while stripping away the enemy's defenses. It goes a very long distance for being a commonly overlooked item.\n\nNami is especially good at bursting if you can land her stun, charging in briefly to lay down Ebb & Flow and Tidecaller's Blessing while they're stunned and running back to safety before they can retaliate, aided by the brief but powerful speed boost from her passive. While the recommended items includes the largest stat stick for mages, the Rabadon's Deathcap (and it is a good investment, since everything she has scales off AP, which means more heals and speed for your allies), an equally good item for her (possibly even better) is Lich Bane. It gives her a large boost in AP, extra mana for her utility abilities, extra movement speed, and of course the Spellblade passive to amplify her bursting power.\n\nLulu has a passive that boosts her basic attack damage and scales off her level and 15% of her AP. What's more, she can throw this on her allies (always check your allies' stats to see who has the highest attack speed. They'll make the most of Help, Pix!'s secondary ability). This is the primary reason Machinegun Lulu is so popular and memetic. While boosting ability power is a good idea, she won't always be able to give this ability to an ally, but needs to be ready to cast it at a moment's notice. Nashor's Tooth is a fantastic item on her. It gives her enormous cooldown, ability power, and a passive that also scales off of AP. A properly built Lulu can both provide enormous utility to her team while being a surprisingly competent duelist, using Whimsy to disable the enemy champion while she blasts them away with basic attacks, then shielding herself with Pix and healing herself with her ult when things get dicey.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-10-09T22:21:52.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You hit the nail on the head with your second paragraph.

GP5 items: wait before you crucify me. yes gp5 is a great item for character who do not get gold via minions it enables everyone who doesnt get minions to get pretty close (in some cases more) to average team gold. \nbut let me ask you a question: Why does a support need gold? riots #1 point of support class was that they did not need it to be viable.\nadditionaly since the introduction of these 3 new gold items psudo-supports and even kill lanes are more prevalant because they are able to get the gold that they would normaly be getting and that they need. \n\n2. support items: in general as we have touched upon support items are lacking horridly. because ay item that is great would be taken in other lanes. a number of items are extreemly niche and some are just not usefull in the long run. censor for example is barely ok to be used by a few champions and even then a good portion of champions its worthless on, lets give atack speed to mages woo syndra gets 25% increased attack speed. crucible is an ok item, personaly i would preffer the 10% cdr, 60 ap, and the kill/assist passive on grail. the biggest problem with crucible is its cooldown, the heal is ok but its main function is as an Ally targeted QSS, for a 3 min cd it is extreemly underwhelming. use it in one teamfight and its down for the next one. \n\n3. Nerfs: overall the support class has been the target of signifigant nerfs. due to the fact that devs (*cough* morello *cough*) dont want main supports in any other lane at any time ever (mid/top lulu, mid janna, ect). the reason that supports often able to go to different lanes is due to a great earlygame because their base's are amazing. so they can often turn into bruiser's. lulu with a AA, 3 ROA, and rylias, run the hell away (ik crappy build but im not posting my good one). due to that they have been hit with the nerf hammer overly much.","replies":[]}]}
