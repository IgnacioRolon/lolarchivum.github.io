I dont know why. But i am watching replay of your game atm. Noone flash dived u at lvl 1. Your Kindred ganked when u were lvl 3 and u didnt move a bit to help and he died. First time u died was at minute 6:30 from Malzahar after u killed Ashe. And that death was your fault, u took minion aggro and u tunneled ashe, ignoring Malzahar, instead of letting Kindred finish Ashe and backing off. Then at minute 10 u overextended to get 1 ranged minion and u got caught in Malzahars ultimate and Ashe ultimate. Then at minute 13 u moved away  from your team on 30% hp and walked into river for no reason. Leblanc killed u.  And u constantly went bot and bot and bot. And constantly died there. Also your positioning was bad, you werent \"far behind your team\" , every time u tumbled into enemy team. U were practically in melee range every fight. At minute your team was positioned behind your blue buff camp, ready to contest baron if enemy team engages. U walked past your team and facechecked bush. Leblanc was there, you survive on 10% hp, and your team lost 4v5 fight cause u had to run. And again at minute 31 u tumbled into enemy team and died.\n\nI agree you didnt intentionally feed, you didnt break any rules, but you played horribly. Not your build but your gameplay. I understand your teams frustration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Young Jerk","date":"2016-06-22T07:10:05.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Man oh man\nIf you talk like you type, you are never getting laid buddy","replies":[{"poster":"Around999People","date":"2016-06-22T07:24:10.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seems normal.
