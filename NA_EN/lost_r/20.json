Actually, that doesn&#039;t truly put the epidemic into perspective. Only one or two games wasn&#039;t decided by a surrender at 20. Actually, THAT doesn&#039;t truly put the epidemic into perspective, either. Before the 15 minute mark, someone up and decides, be it on my team or the enemy team, that the game&#039;s impossible, that the enemy is too fed, that they&#039;re too far ahead, that it&#039;s too difficult and impossible, etc. Actually, that still doesn&#039;t truly put the epidemic into perspective. The players came to this conclusion BEFORE FIRST BLOOD. You know what? That&#039;s still not accurate enough to the size of this epidemic. It&#039;s not just one person doing it most of the time. It&#039;s half of the team or more who end up whining about how difficult or impossible everything is and spending the entire game harumphing and grumping in the fountain or halfway into the lane.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s gotten bad. Really bad. With the update that added the Black Market Brawlers, the problem has gotten WORSE. I&#039;ve actually attempted to rally the ENEMY to continue fighting us, that&#039;s how bad it&#039;s gotten. What the hell is going on? What fueled this new surge of defeatism, or have I just encountered a particularly bad section of this tide of depression?","replies":[{"poster":"Arch Mage Magnus","date":"2015-07-31T22:21:29.858+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":9,"body":"Call me Nostradamus, but I can generally tell a win from a loss straight from the pick and bans.

Then after your 3rd attempt, you finally try putting in that futile effort, drag the game out to the 40+ min mark and still lose because of the same reason the enemy had such a huge advantage at the 20 min mark: no teamwork.\n\nI don't like to surrender unless I've identified that a game is truly over. A game isn't 'over' if you are 1-5 a game isn't over if you are 10-20. A game is over when your team is no longer playing to win, and has begun fighting among themselves. A game is over when your team cannot/will not prioritize objectives and consistently throw away hard earned advantages. It's about identifying player behavior patterns, not what score is shown on the score board.\n\nThat being said, I do agree that players surrender far too often. Much more than is necessary. The hopelessness is genuinely frustrating, as it makes rallying your team to pull through so much more difficult. It also doesn't help that riot has been on a trend of nerfing the champs that can hard carry, and that league is currently in a meta where teamwork is much more important that in previous seasons; so getting fed and carrying is much more difficult and less reliable than before.\n\nI think the core problem here is that there is a stark lack of **trust** players have for each other. People have spent so much time looking at what others do that all they see are their mistakes, and thus are prone to not trust anyone due to expecting these mistakes to be repeated. This lack of trust and cooperation is crippling in a game dependent on working with your team to achieve a collective goal.\n\nLast thing I have noticed, is that the more you play the game, the less you look at yourself and the more you look at your allies.

But now that I'm comfortable with the champs I play, I no longer feel the need to put so much focus in learning the mechanics that I have more spare time to give glances at other happenings, and thus I look to my allies.

Some people look to the outside to blame for their frustration. Other people, ME, don't really care. I don't feel mad at a feeder, as I know I've done that before, I know it happens -- It's just that some people when they're doing good they think they've changed and are different now, that they belong to a different flock, poor delusional sheep.\n\n\"Maybe this guys is better then the rest of us, maybe he should be judging others!\" -- So I went to check your match history and.. ayyyy lmao I'd love to see them replays.\n\nIt has nothing to do with experience, it has to do with arrogance.

Comparing ourselves and our teammates to people way beyond our skill level/experience level is a recipe for frustration.

It happens people make mistakes and you can sometimes come out of a horrible game with a victory because someone on the team made an error or got cocky.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Biff Manly","date":"2015-08-01T04:27:43.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot could add a gamemode that DIDN'T take half an hour plus to play, I feel like all the people who surrender for time purposes could all enjoy themselves over there, rather than flailing around for an extra 15 minutes, fighting a losing battle with their ~~idiot~~ hyper-optimistic duo-queue bot lane that refuses to surrender.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellmet","date":"2015-08-01T02:14:47.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's frustrating when people quit early in the game but honestly I would prefer to be able to quit at the 10 minute mark.  I'd also like a 5 minute vote where if 9 players out of 10 said surrender the game would end with no winner.  The game is supposed to be about fun, and quite simply it's no fun when you get some tool bag troll picking at the beginning, or somebody goes afk and doesn't return by the 5 minute mark.  Or worst when 3 players on your team never join the game.  These situations are f'ing terrible, you are basically locked in and you just lost 20 minutes of your life and there is no way out.  What's really sucks is when it happens 2 or 3 games in a row to you.  \n\nPlayers should be able to get out of games that aren't setup for the player to have fun.. playing 5v4 or 5v3 is a perfect example.  Something should be added for these situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zyorhist","date":"2015-07-31T18:21:24.160+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"this match right here\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1904676976/40293208 \n\nI was slowly picking up steam...meanwhile everyone on the team ranting and raving about teemo getting fed on their top lane.  Our jungler dc and they trying to surrender over and over and over.  I said no because I was pretty fed and no one stopped long enough to notice.  My support is the only reason we didn't end in a surrender then when our jungler came back and I proceeded to carry the game the other two were like...\"gg ez\"  \n\nLong story short, don't surrender without evaluating the whole situation, a fed graves beats a fed teemo.  no need to surrender.\n\nalso I was a little angry about carrying the team and the two with the worst attitude all game were the ones talking smack.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-08-01T01:46:21.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everytime I see this topic I have to agree and disagree with it out of my own experiences.\n\nI hate hate hate hate people that want to quit because you are losing 4-2, or someone has died a few times in lane. Not that big of a deal, realistically.\n\nWhat I hate equally is when you ARE losing ridiculously about 35-45 minutes into a game and people refuse to surrender the same as the people that want to quit at 7 minutes. I don't want to hear the \"I've won a 3v5 this one time\" or any of that, because you know what I mean.\n\nDown nearly triple the amount of turrets, 4-0 dragons, enemy team has baron, you have 1 inhib turret left with 2 inhibs down, and still those 2 guys \"we can still win\" who are both like 1-7-2 with 110 farm at 45 minutes and you just want to face desk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Really Big Dog","date":"2015-08-01T18:00:36.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally only want to surrender under a few circumstances:\nA: The game is undeniably lost (something in the ballpark of 40 minutes in), or the enemy team is incredibly toxic and I feel like swiping the win out from under them as a minor act of spite. I am well aware that this is incredibly rude, but sometimes you just get that feeling that \"these people don't _deserve_ a win treating everyone like this, screw it FF\"\nB: Our team is incredibly toxic and I want nothing more than to be away from them and doing something else. **League is a commitment**, and being committed to awful people sucks. I don't want to just go and feed either, because then that makes me no better than the people I have to play with.\nC: Half the damn team already quit.\nD: I am playing with a group of friends (we make up the entire team) and we aren't feeling it. Some days you just aren't on your game and its time to pack it in.\n\nI do notice people wanting to surrender over the smallest things, though. I joked a couple times that the ADC would quit if I accidentally took a kill as the support, and its happened where the ADC immediately calls for a surrender, it fails, and then he/she afks in base shit-talking everybody down. Other times, we see that an enemy laner just up and quit because they didn't like their matchup, or something happened early game to stunt them, like a gank or getting caught out in the jungle somewhere. Quitting on your team just makes everybody else worse, and while sometimes it can be a benefit, usually it just drags down the morale.\n\nThe mentality that you can't have fun in League if you're losing is kinda dumb, but I feel like a lot of players who worked up to level 30 playing against bots are trained into it, and refuse to play a losing game.\n\nOn top of the awful minority of players in the game, who just treat everybody like garbage, its easy to get pretty down while you play league and just want to quit.\n\nCompetitive scene doesn't help either, but I don't think I need to go into that.. hasn't it always been a negative impact on regular matches?\n\n**tl;dr** surrender epidemic is a sad thing and it doesn't look like its going anywhere anytime soon with the community the way it is","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-08-04T06:48:32.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its been like this from November last year no body wants to work for a win its supposed to fall in their lap and if it doesnt seem like its going that way then they want to hurry see if the next one will fall in their lap game has laneing phase early game mid game and late game. if they dont seem like they are going to win from early game or if it seems the enemy is ahead early they give up and want to get to next game. i even have had games where we were winning and snow balling  in 2/3 lanes or 3/4 and the my team that was winning gave up with no loss of towers or 1 max.","replies":[]}]}
