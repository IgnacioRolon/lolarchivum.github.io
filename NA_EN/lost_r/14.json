Like it or not, here I come!\n\nBut there have been games where even that is not a viable option. I get within twenty yards of the lane and the enemy is already pulling back like a turtle withdrawing into its shell. I've even been the jungler in games where I end with 0/0/0 and my team still scores a crushing victory. Well damn it all!
