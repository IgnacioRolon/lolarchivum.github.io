Not just any ordinary trash talk or chiding, though. It&#039;s been going zero to a million just in the champion select screen, outright death and rape threats, looking for any excuse to throw the entire game, even by autotilting and triggering themselves over a person&#039;s bans or something even pettier, and overall just being incorrigible little shits. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know who encouraged this behavior, but it has already spiraled out of control. Whoever is responsible for it, ban them forever, ban everyone on their friends list forever, and anyone who even so much as THINKS about their name should also be banned forever. It&#039;s time to show that you are not going to tolerate this shit for even a nanosecond, Riot. Make people fear for the security of their account every waking second of their lives, and every last one of their smurfs, and any new account they even think about opening up once their main ones get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Gamer Girl Katie","date":"2016-08-24T12:53:16.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXiAayQ8KRA","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-24T03:43:42.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a new trend..?\nYou must be new here.

RIOT is punishing ass backwards and not effectively limiting the idiots that cause most of the chat toxicity in the first place. My punishments have always been the result of some asshole doing the above listed garbage. That garbage exists because the punishment for that type of stuff are rare or just a slap on the wrist (LPQ). RIOT needs to use common sense.\n\nPeople feel helpless when they get one of these offenders because not only is that person wasting others time, something rarely happens to them, punishment wise. I don't understand why people don't see this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FenricsShield","date":"2016-08-25T17:17:38.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say it's about half as bad as it was back in S4 when I started playing.
