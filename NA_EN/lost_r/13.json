This new one is unforgivable. More than that, you have proven me exactly right in my ongoing narrative of the institutionalized support maltreatment.\r\n\r\nSo during the draft pick again, I agree to trade with (who else) Xin. I&#039;m the support, as always, and I prefer to go last so I can better compensate for whatever shortcomings we end up having, because that&#039;s just another job the support has to do. I want Nami. They don&#039;t have Nami. I list a few other champions I would prefer. They pick one that I didn&#039;t list. One I didn&#039;t want. One who I almost never play. The absolute worst one, considering our and the enemy&#039;s lineup.\r\n\r\nAlistar.\r\n\r\nWhy? In Xin&#039;s reasoning &quot;Alistar is really good right now. I want Alistar.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe locks it in, even after I tell him no. Then he and the rest of the team proceed to belittle and berate me every goddamn minute of the game for over an HOUR. Then I get a four man report at the end of the game and god knows if they were able to convince the enemy team to report me (god knows they tried), even though we won, even though I pulled more than my own weight in that game.\r\n\r\nAnd no, this isn&#039;t a matter of &quot;oh, you just ran into a troll premade&quot;. That&#039;s the community&#039;s excuse for everything. Not everyone out there is premade, and this isn&#039;t the first and sure as shit not the last time this has happened. Literally no other role out there gets treated this poorly, not even the jungler. No one else would dare give a mid-laner Lux over Zed, but because it&#039;s the support, people think they are entitled to just about anything and everything. They think they&#039;re allowed to hold absolute command over the support, telling them who to pick, what to build, and whether or not they work in your favor, once you&#039;re done with them, shoot them and go get a new one. After all, they&#039;re only a dime a dozen, it&#039;s really easy to just go find a new one, right?\r\n\r\n........right?!\r\n\r\nHow long was your last queue? I keep hearing stories about how it takes people 20-30 minutes just to find one match. Want to know why it&#039;s taking so long? Because you have turned the support into an endangered species. Not only have you failed MISERABLY to change your behavior, even as you have begun to feel the ill effects starting this season, but you have actually gotten worse. It seems to have become a challenge by the community to drive the support role into extinction. \r\n\r\nBecause of that, I hope Riot doesn&#039;t release Solo Queue. \r\n\r\nIn fact, I want them to get rid of everything EXCEPT Dynamic Queue. \r\n\r\nI want you all to experience the effects of the years of constant maltreatment and disenfranchisement you have cast on the supports. \r\n[\r\nI want the lobby to be your blank screen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9aHXzft-_Y) \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t Riot&#039;s doing; it&#039;s all you.\r\n\r\nAnd I hope you pay dearly for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-03-07T12:07:53.650+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":3,"body":"That was intense.\n\nAs an ADC main, and someone who is terrified of going as support because I know how pivotal it is, I extend what apologies I can.

But, u still have to respect that every player has their own varying champion pool.  At my elo, supports are much more respected because they are the enablers of the team.

They can roam to open up to plays for the other laners as well.\n\nlong story short, your negative experiences are due to the ignorance of the players of lower elo. Supports enable their team to make the plays. I understand this because im an adc main that learned support to help me improve at my own role.

The adc does a shit ton of damage and \"carries\" the game, the mid laner usually can make flashy plays with tons of damage, the jungler can gank lanes and get objectives, the top laner can split push and make {{summoner:12}}  plays, while the support gives vision, peels, and sets up kills. While I believe support is just as, if not more, important than other roles, it's just not that noticeable compared to all of the other roles in the game. So, I don't believe it is the community that makes this role so \"rare\" it is just the role in general. I used to main support and now I main jungle and I've seen my fair share of assholes complaining about both roles (although, I believe more people blame the jungler). Oh, I've had someone try to trade me {{champion:421}} before when I was jungling (I don't own her) so that isn't a support thing, hell I saw a guy instalock {{champion:69}}  for our mid who wanted to play {{champion:268}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Beldair","date":"2016-03-07T21:35:34.169+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So true with the Jungle blame...\n\n\"Where the hell was my gank?\"\n\"What the hell are you doing jg?\"\n\nI could go on but it is similar to Supports.\n\nAnd the other roles get some blame but support and jg do get a lot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-03-07T14:17:59.133+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even play support often (I try to avoid it) and I can't say I disagree with you. \n\nPeople need to grow up and treat roles with respect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Szunray","date":"2016-03-07T18:20:05.629+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The moment they locked in Alistar, you should have taken smite and just Jungled as Xin.\nSeriously, how dare you fuck up an hour of my time by going rogue on our agreement at the last second.
