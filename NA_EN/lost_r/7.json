My previous experience with him is basically rendered moot, so it&#039;s only fitting that the Mastery level be reset to zero to reflect this.

Best of luck on the Fields of Justice!\n\nI&#039;m probably an extreme case here, given how eccentric I am, and how I am probably the only person in League who asked to have a champion&#039;s mastery reset (usually players just ask for refunds). But by my logic it makes sense. What do you all think? If one of your favored champions had a Sion-grade overhaul, would you ask to have their mastery reset?","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-19T02:19:33.833+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they gave the option (as in you could chose not to), then sure, I could get behind this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fives55555","date":"2016-04-19T20:13:21.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, sure, I don't know why Riot shouldn't introduce this since it gets them no money anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-19T04:38:48.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im with avantelwings on this,  I would appreciate the option if riot decided to give us it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-04-19T02:12:49.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya actually, I really like this idea man.
