As a point of reference, League should be installed to your **C:\\ drive** in the default directory suggested during installation **(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)**, as any other installation locale can cause problems. Additionally, it should be installed as admin (right click installer, run as admin) to ensure it installed all the correct components. \n\nFinally, any Firewall present on your system should have League whitelisted or added as an exception to the rules so the Firewall doesn't unintentionally delete crucial files in the League directory. I recommend grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and running a clean reinstall of League. Simply run the application, check the boxes for **Reinstall** and **Clean Uninstall**, then let the tasks complete. \n\nLet me know if this caused any change in your issue and be sure to test any changes in a custom match to avoid penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"Cantorona","date":"2016-09-15T22:07:21.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No actually it keeps happening","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T17:35:49.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case, I suggest reaching out to our tech team in a [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) If you attach a set of logs to your ticket using the HRT you used for the clean reinstall, it will expedite your ticket service.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
