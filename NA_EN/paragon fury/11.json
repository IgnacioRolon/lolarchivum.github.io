For months, the &quot;mature content&quot; bar seems to be &quot;Wherever the fuck the mod on duty feels it is at that particular hour&quot;. Especially since your moderation, even for one person seems to be random on the best of days.\n\nFor example I&#039;ve had this thread *for literal months*:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/xY5Ytl8i-monster-musume-is-getting-an-anime\n\nAnd it didn&#039;t get a single warning or content removed. \n\nBut THIS picture that was in my last thread?\n\nhttp://img \\ ur.co \\ m  /\n\n(Remove the \\ if you want to see if) got me a 1 day suspension.\n\nBy the logic used to give me a suspension for that, I should get a suspension for posting these;\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WKbaxim.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Jv8h29Z.jpg\n\n\n\nEven though they&#039;re official artwork by Riot that is exactly the same level of &quot;risque&quot; that I got suspended for. And what about cosplay? Cosplay falls 100% under what is supposed to be allowed under GD&#039;s discussion - but apparently according to the logic you&#039;ve removed and suspended from topics, Tasha&#039;s Syndra cosplay:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ATyFrcy.jpg\n\nAnd Enji Night&#039;s Nidalee cosplay -\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hxE4Wd5.png\n\nAren&#039;t allowed *even though they are 100% accurate to the characters in-game*. So what is the standard mods, when the things you&#039;re removing from the boards are the same or sometimes even tamer than things *that are two clicks away on the same website you&#039;re removing from?*\n\n**OH HAI THERE, FROST QUEEN JANNA SPLASH ART!**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IB8AjOO.jpg\n\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\n\nHOLY FUCKING SHIT MODS. ARE YOU SERIOUS?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zEzGwRQ.png\n\nThat Bayonetta pic was A: Not anymore risque than *the video in the goddamn OP*, but B: WAS MADE BY MOTHERLOVIN' ZERONIS, A GODDAMN CONCEPT ARTIST FOR RIOT. THE GUY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OFFICER VI AND DEMON VI CONCEPT ART:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/aZY4E\nhttp://imgur.com/xthVQyA.png\n\nYou literally just said the artwork done by a **RIOT EMPLOYEE IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE RIOT BOARDS.**","replies":[]}
