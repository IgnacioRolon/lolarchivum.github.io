It done gon' go and get deep in the mess here, so put yer waders on.\n\nI'm going to do everyone a favor and put the TL;DR right at the start.\n\nTL;DR - Riot's newfound obsession with cleaning their boards of \"mature\" content is undermining their fanbase, is hypocritical to their own game's content and is destroying what is actually an almost singularly unique and needed Forum culture that is basically not present elsewhere on the Internet.\n\nSo Riot has apparently found itself a new set of balls, and is currently going on something of a \"purge\" on the forums. And while there are undoubtedly people who have more than earned themselves a lifetime ban (Lanjeen, \"Mr. President of GD\", and others etc.) Riot has also taken to deleting or getting rid of any threads containing content they deem \"mature\" or risque for their forums. This has brought up more than a few problems - mostly because Riot's definition of \"risque\" and \"mature\" content seems to be wildly different than everyone else's; and hypocritical to their own game's design.\n\nTo start off with:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EvCTOe8.jpg\n\nYes. That is official Splash Art of Evelynn, done by Riot Games themselves. Just so we know what we're working with here. And that isn't even the worst one.\n\nRiot ought to know by now the majority of people playing this game are in the 15-30 year old range; like MOST gamers are. And they have a game that due to its own content gets a *very, very strong* T rating from the ESRB - its honestly only a couple of steps below a full \"M\" rating. As such, the game is going to attract people interested or able to deal with more \"mature\" things than other games. In addition, the game has more than its fair share of *extremely* attractive men and women in the game - a couple of characters literally have their *SEX APPEAL* as abilities:\n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:21}} \n\nSo people are going to come on here, seeing the art and the characters with a certain mindset. But you know what happened on GD? Rather then diving straight into the utter, total creepiness of other forums or the total crapstorm that other forums are - it *stabilized*. General Discussion (and to a lesser extent, the Story and Art sections) became places where people could share content - *even more mature content* - without having to deal with the perverts, creeps or weirdos you'd get on other forums, and without being insta-banned like they would on more \"proper\" forums.\n\nRiot Games had something fairly unique on GD; a forum where someone could say \"Hey, look at this sexy fucking picture of Sona I found\":\n\n---\n\nAnd people would be like \"FUCK YES, thats amazing!\" without any of the other weird implications or creepiness that comes with other forums. It would come, it would go and people would enjoy or ignore it.\n\nRiot had created a professional maintained, working forum that people could come to and discuss anything that didn't involve something illegal or actual pornography; and indulge in their own little fun with pictures like the above. Probably the only combination you'd find of those things on the whole goddamn *Internet*.\n\nBut something Riot didn't probably anticipate is that the art style and gameplay of League would also intersect with people who like anime and manga. But for the longest time, they didn't have an issue - its seemed that as long it A: Wasn't explicitly pornography and B: Didn't involve something illegal, it fell under the same banner as anything else in GD.\n\nBut as Wookie seems to have indicated in that other thread; that no longer seems to apply. Anything \"vaguely mature\" that cannot be deflected as being Riot's work is removed or deleted and the User almost certainly banned. And their definition of \"mature\" seems to be pretty...strange to say the least. Apple Girl being the prime example.\n\nRiot's mods and employees are now seeming to consider anything that is vaguely \"mature\" involving anyone who is *young* or in High School \"mature\" content...despite the fact that in many (all) other places it isn't.\n\n---\n\nThat's *High School DxD* - that isn't considered \"pornography\" anywhere - you don't even have to provide ID to purchase it in a store.\n\n---\n\nThat is the trailer for *Freezing* - its gets it mature content rating *for blood and gore*. Still don't need ID to purchase it.\n\n---\n\nThat's issue #2 and #3 of Monster Musume - *which despite being an explicitly ecchi manga with naked breasts clearly in it, its not considered mature content*. They sell it straight on the bookstore's shelves - its not even *shrinkwrapped to prevent people from flipping through it*. It gets a rating of \"Older Teen 16+\", which nearly everyone playing this game qualifies for. \n\nYet according to Wookie, all of these things are suddenly now inappropriate; to no one's apparent benefit. Yes, they all contain sexual content of some kind...but many of your players are in high school/college, which is exactly the age group most of these are aimed at (for the most part). In addition, we shouldn't need to be reminded Riot directly sells content to us based on sex appeal:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AuxbjvK.jpg\n\n*cough*\n\nSo it seems more than a bit hypocritical to go to the *forum that is meant and designated as an almost anything goes forum, and start banning people for not actually breaking any rules*.\n\nBy all means, ban people who are actually cruel, mean or insulting or who post actual/intended child pornography...but banning people for sexy images, bad jokes, negative opinions and other things that people in this game's audience would naturally be interested in...well, thats a pretty dick move. After all, we all love:","replies":[]}
