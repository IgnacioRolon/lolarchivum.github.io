I&#039;m totally up for a game where we don&#039;t have an ADC at all. Unless Corki gets obscenely fed during the laning phase, he is basically a non-issue and enemies will just straight up ignore him and walk by him because he is basically tickle-poke-fun-time to most champions.\r\n\r\nPeople love to go on about his early lane damage...but then if you wanted early dominance {{champion:119}} {{champion:51}}  or hell even {{champion:21}} {{champion:236}} . And those champions become nightmares when fed, while Corki just becomes merely &quot;a threat&quot;. And they stay relevant throughout almost the entire game, whereas even full build Corki at the end of the game tends to just be &quot;Could you just stop poking me? It&#039;s not doing anything and its just annoying&quot;.","replies":[]}
