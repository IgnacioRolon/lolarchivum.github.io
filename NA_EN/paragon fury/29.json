Mid? Like it. Support? Fucking cool. Top? I can dig. ADC? I'm...not that great, but I can tower farm, play safe and I don't hate it.\r\n\r\nBut fucking Jungle? I just hate the role, and I'm no good at it. I don't like a single one of the good Junglers except Sejuani (and I'm not that good at her), and I don't really *like* any of the Junglers to play. But inevitably get made to Jungler when I'm near or at Promos, get my ass kicked and now have to start over. Just lost ANOTHER Promo and am now back at 63LP, probably going to go from getting +24LP a win to +16 or +15 or something and have to slog through again.\r\n\r\nIts like playing Soccer and you prefer Offense or Defense, or Goalie if you have to, but the Coach insists on putting you on Midline even though he knows you hate it and underperform every single time you go there.\r\n\r\nAnd then people bitch you out for it.","replies":[]}
