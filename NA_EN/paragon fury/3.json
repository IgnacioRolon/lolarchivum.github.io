I only vote at this point because its my duty as a citizen and picking the least r%%%%%ed option of the two is still better than not picking at all - especially since lives are on the line because of their decisions.\r\n\r\nAnd both sides disappoint me equally; for different reasons. What's worse is that no one actually capable of doing the right thing or something better than we have now because Americans have become so stupid, with such sort attention spans and so goddamn clannish that they wouldn't have a chance because their ideas wouldn't sell because they don't stir up emotions or make it an \"Us vs. Them\" narrative.\r\n\r\nBut to hell with it, right? I only gotta make it through 60 more years so that I can die of old age and be done with this. \r\n\r\nWhich will suck still, because none of the things I ever hoped to see achieved in my lifetime that inspired me as a kid will ever happen. Or they will; but they won't be planting a US or U.N. Flag on Mars - it'll be a BP flag.","replies":[]}
