By any sensible logic, this game should be absolutely deserted and Riot a mockery of the development community. Let&#039;s take a look at the last *30 days*, shall we?\r\n\r\n- Daruis becomes broken; disabled\r\n- Caitlyn gets a new bug; disabled\r\n- Runeglaive real eased without proper testing; unleashes havoc on Jungle and Mid Lane {{champion:81}} \r\n- An item has to be disabled for literally breaking the entire game\r\n- devourer changes go through despite the community complaints; breaks every single lane and Jungle\r\n- Zed gets a massive bug; has to be completely disabled\r\n\r\n*And that is just 30 freaking days*. There are goddamn Betas that perform better than this.\r\n\r\nNot to mention the absolute litany of other problems the game and Riot have. So seriously; why the hell is this game still so popular?\r\n\r\n*&quot;But muh gameplay.&quot;*\r\n\r\nPeople don&#039;t even seem to enjoy the gameplay that much, in-game or in communities.","replies":[]}
