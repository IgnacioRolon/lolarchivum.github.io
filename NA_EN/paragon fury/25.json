Especially when you&#039;re not looking in high-quality, luxury apartments. \r\n\r\nLooking today and all the options are like, hey, you want a single bedroom small apartment? Well, either they don&#039;t exist or they start a like, $1,500 a month before utilities *which it should be noted is more than what many people would pay for per month for a semi-nice house*. Even the Affordable Housing rooms are like $837 per month which means that at the maximum income you can have to be in one of those (Approx. $34,000 per year income) you&#039;d still be spending 1/4th your income per year on just the rent, not even utilities - made even worse of you make less than that.\r\n\r\nAnd the States that do have cheap rent? Either they have no jobs...or there is a reason no one wants to live there.\r\n\r\nI always hear the Governors and Senators for different States saying they&#039;re trying to keep young people there to boost the economy instead of them just getting and education and fleeing the State...but never hear them say or do anything about affordable housing or rent control; something that would be a pretty strong driver for young people who don&#039;t have a lot of money to stay in your State for, because they could actually make those $8 dollar an hour, $12 an hour starter jobs actually get them decent shelter and living quarters.\r\n\r\nOh wait. Is that that logic thing we&#039;re not allowed to do?\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/gGO8ExW","replies":[]}
