In reality, wouldn't the knowledge of the thought process and work style be more important than the code due to many jobs handing you text anyways to learn whatever language they use. I am not sure how it works at gaming companies, but I've heard a lot of software companies use different languages and just give employees the textbooks to learn the language they want. \n\nAnyways, was just curious.
