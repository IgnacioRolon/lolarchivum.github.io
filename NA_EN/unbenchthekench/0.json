Why am I tagged as a leaver when I never even connected to the game in the first place??? Its not my internet that is the problem I was at a constant 47 ping and the client wasnt broken either the circle at the bottom right kept loading except it didnt load me into a game. This happened the game before only it was a normal and now it happened again in a ranked and it made me take a loss for it. Why is it set up like this??? How come I am made to lose a game in my series and put on a low priority queue when I never even connected to the game to begin with","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T22:02:45.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You might be having a connection issue that's failing to get you into the game.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system would only apply if you've had a history of leaves and not just 1 game.  Even if you didn't mean to leave, it will treat everyone equally because all leaves cause a negative experience for others.  You'll want to go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot, and test it in a custom game.
