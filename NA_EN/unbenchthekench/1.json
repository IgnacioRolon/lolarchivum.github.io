Connection issues are pretty common for League since it's always online, but if there's something going down we definitely want to know.  As a first step, make sure to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities.  Starting there is the most important framework before moving forward.\n\nIf anyone is having a sudden issue like this, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to the NA game server: 104.160.131.1.  Run it for 5 minutes then post your logs as well as what ISP you're using.
