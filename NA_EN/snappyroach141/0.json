I've played dozens of games during this time frame and have not gotten a single key fragment the entire time so I've just been sitting here with 5 crates that I can't do anything with and I'm pretty annoyed by it at this point. I checked around and saw that sometimes you can have penalties placed on your rate of obtaining key fragments, but if I've been subjected to one of these penalties I don't know it. If anyone can help me somehow that'd be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-08-10T23:25:31.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line. With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide","replies":[{"poster":"snappyroach141","date":"2016-08-10T23:28:48.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info and link, but is it normal for them to not drop at all during such a long time frame? I mean two weeks without a single fragment seems kinda odd since I don't think I've experienced a drought like this before in all my play time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T23:24:06.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chance of getting a key fragment gets exponentially more difficult after each one you get. You aren't guaranteed to get one even if you played something like 100 matches in a week. As *ZombieMaster* mentioned, your droprate will eventually reset and you should see them again.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-08-12T02:16:58.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure about that? I'm pretty sure riot socrates confirmed on reddit (and possibly elsewhere) that their are protections in place so people can't get *too* unlucky i.e. after enough wins without a fragment drop you'd be guaranteed one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-08-10T23:30:53.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only get a total of 16 key fragments (So they said ; proven ; no ; fact: 12 is the actual number from my experience) per month, after the month resets you can start earning keys again, its really hard to earn the last bit of keys.","replies":[]}]}
