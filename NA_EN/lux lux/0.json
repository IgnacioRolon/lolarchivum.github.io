Why? ^^","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Time to learn about people's mains!\n\nJust some questions out of curiosity. I want to know how other people feel and think about their main(s). I also want to know if there are people out there that main unpopular champions. ^^\n\nSorry in advance for such a huge post! x)\n\nMost of the questions are subjective and you don't have to answer them all. Some questions may not have any answers. I'll be satisfied with just a very short answer if you don't have the time to answer everything. Anything will do. ;)\n\nI'm gonna respond to these too as an example. :)\n\nFirst question's first:\n\n#Do you main a champion?\n---\n##If **not**:\n\nWhy not?\n\nDo you consider yourself a jack-of-all-trades? Or are you just unsure who to main? Or maybe you're a new player looking for someone to main?\n\nDo you think you'll ever main a champion (or more than one)? Why?\n\nWhich champions do you play the most as of now? Are they meta, really strong, role-specific or do you just find them fun to play as?\n\nAnything else you may want to add?\n---\n##If **yes**:\n\nHow many champions do you main?\n\nIf you main **one** champion, do you consider yourself a one-trick pony? If you main **more than one**, do you have any preferences between your mains or pick one more often than others?\n\nWho do you main? Why do you main them? What do you love most about your main(s)? Is there something you don't like about your main(s)? Is/are your main(s) a popular pick? Is/are your main(s) mained a lot?\n\nWhich level are you with your main? How many mastery points do you have for you main(s) in total? Do you think the number of mastery points have some correlation to how skillful a player is with your main(s)?\n\nWhen did you start maining your current main(s)? How much have you been playing League? Did you have any other mains before?\n\nIn which roles do you play your main(s)? Who do you find **easiest** to go against as your main(s)? Who do you find **hardest** to go against? Why? Can you find your way against counters?\n\nDo you consider yourself **good** playing as your main(s)? Is it easy for you to spot mistakes made other players playing your main(s)? Do you know people who main the same champion(s) as you? Do you think they are better or worse then you (don't name them please ^^')? Do you have someone/something you can learn from (friend, coach, youtuber, guides, reddit, statistics etc.)?\n\nDo you think your main champion(s) is/are balanced right now? Is/are he/she/they going to get changed or reworked soon? If yes, how do you feel about the changes?\n\nAny cool random info (tip, trick, lore, mechanic, bug, anything really) about your main(s) that you want to share that many may not know?\n\nRate your main(s) from a scale of 1-10. Would you recommend your main(s) to other players? Would you recommend your main(s) to new players? Why?\n\nWhich other champions apart from your main(s) do you play often? Why?\n\nAnything else you may want to add?\n---\n#My answers!\n\n> Do you main a champion?\n\nYeah I do! I main **Lux**. Only **Lux**.\n\n{{champion:99}} \n\n##I absolutely **love** Lux.\n\nYes, I consider myself a one-trick pony even though my champion pool is not the small. I play her in half of my games and always have her as a pick when I don't really know who to play.\n\nHere's what's beautiful: she's mechanically simple to play, and very easy to pick up for the first time thanks to her very simple kit, but at the same time, she has a high skill-cap. This is mostly due to the fact that all four of her abilities are skillshots and her passive requires her to use her basic attacks on her opponents, something a mage usually doesn't do that often, especially the immobile ones.\n\nShe is this glass-cannon that can dish out high damage from such an incredible distance that she can pretty much have 200 hp and still be very impactful in teamfights. I like how she's able to severely punish slight mispositioning and how she can surprise people with that double-snare. The buff they gave to her Q a while back was really needed and the nerf they gave to her W made her pretty balanced.\n\nHer pick rate is about 7.1%, which is a bit lower than the average of all champions, and for that I'm quite happy. Her ban rate is about 0.5%, so almost non-existent, so also something I'm happy with. ^^\n\n> Which level are you with your main? How many mastery points do you have for you main(s) in total?\n\nI'm level 7 right now with only 605k mastery points. Trying to aim for that sweet 1m mastery points (but it's so far away T^T).\n\nWith Lux, the more points you get, the less meaning those points have, but I guess that holds true for most champions. As stated before, Lux is a mechanically simple champion, and thus the first points are really significant, since you learn a lot from just a handful of games. When you reach lvl 5, you should be at least decent with her. However, there are still things that can't be measured in mastery points, but determines a player's skill on Lux. For example, her skillshots: How good is your aim? Do you know the max range of her spells? Do you know their hitboxes? Do you know how to use them as zoning tools? Are you familiar with the cast times of her Q, E and R?\n\n> When did you start maining your current main(s)?\n\nFunnily enough, I started to main her when I was level 1. Right after the tutorial, I hopped into my very first Coop vs AI game. Since in the tutorial I played as Ashe, I wanted to pick her too. But you know what? Other players had the same thought. Ashe was already picked, so I was forced to play another champion. I picked Lux for whatever reason. Since that game, I enjoyed Lux a lot. She's the very first champion I bought. 3150 IP it was.\n\nThat was about a year and a 2-3 months ago, so I've been maining Lux ever since I first started playing League. I have never mained another champion.\n\n> Do you consider yourself **good** playing as your main(s)?\n\nYes I do. I don't think I'm a trash player. I think of myself as an average League player (maybe more casual thanks to my lag sometimes), and when playing Lux, I consider myself a better-than-average Lux player. In short - yes, I think I'm a good Lux player.\n\nI can easily spot a mistake or a misplay made by another Lux player. I can also see if that Lux player could've done a better job. **And**, I can also see if that Lux player is really good at the champion. But I can understand that they don't main her so I don't have many problems with that (if any). Plus I never flame so pointing out their mistakes is not something I do (unless they requested my help for improvement, in that case I'll be happy to explain their mistakes and teach them how to it properly).\n\nI currently am in a club with a few other Lux mains. And I'm always happy to see them play Lux and do exactly I would've done (if not slightly better or worse). Seeing other players play my main to a great level makes me smile. :)\n\nI have learned to play Lux and build her on my own, after all, she's a mechanically simple champion, and experience counts most. Item choices come in naturally.\n\nI can't tell if she's balanced right now or slightly underpowered. Maybe she **is** balanced but doesn't fit into the meta perfectly. She's great especially when queuing solo. Right now her winrates are pretty normal. She has a 50% winrate across all the ranking ladder, but declines the higher you go up the ladder. For example, her winrate in Silver is 49.6%, which is good, but in Diamond, her winrate becomes 46.1%, which is horrible.\n\n> Any cool random info (tip, trick, lore, mechanic, bug, anything really) about your main(s) that you want to share that many may not know?\n\nDid you know? Lux's ultimate **can't** hit targets she can't see. The out-of-vision champions get revealed by the laser so it's no problem, but if she gets near-sighted (like for example Nocturne R, Graves W or Quinn Q), her ult does **0** damage to targets she doesn't have vision of.\n\nThis also applies to invisible champions. She can't hit invisible targets (Teemo passive, Akali W, Rengar/Kha'zix R, Shaco Q etc.).\n\n> Rate your main(s) from a scale of 1-10.\n\nI rate Lux **11/10**. I love her too much to give her any less.\n\nShe's a champion I'd recommend to newer players, since she's easy to play. However I'd warn them about how easy it is to kill a Lux, so they'll have to be careful.\n---\n\n> Anything else you may want to add?\n\nI love Lux! Thanks for reading the entire post if you did! Have a nice day! I want to hear about your main(s) too!","replies":[{"poster":"Saving Grace","date":"2016-11-02T13:25:06.698+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Picked up Soraka 1 month ago and haven't played another champion since. Already got 200k mastery points so guess I'm kind of a OTP right now xD\n\nSuppose I'd be in the minority when I say she's the most fun champ I've ever used. \n\nAlso people sort of have her misunderstood as someone who just spams W all day (admittedly she does). But do you ever wonder why MF never ulted our entire team? Yeah that was my silence. Wonder why Jhin's ult was cancelled immediately? Yeah that was me. Wonder why Poppy didn't ult you halfway across the map? Again silenced.  I just think she has a lot more utility and usefulness  than people think.\n\nAlso I think it comes down to the fact I get a lot of satisfaction from helping others. I would get a much better feeling off pulling off clutch heals on my ADC in a TF and being the only reason they lived more than a second resulting in them getting a penta rather than me getting the penta myself. That's just me I guess.\n\nAnyway,\n10/10 <3 my Banana Queen","replies":[{"poster":"Lux Lux","date":"2016-11-02T15:08:13.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha! Someone that can understand Soraka! Respect. ;)\n\nI enjoy playing Soraka but it's for the reasons you mention that I don't play her that often. People (especially those who don't play Support) most of the times misjudge support plays.\n\nSure, you can hook someone, then flash + lantern and carry your ADC all the way into a free triple kill and everyone will notice immediately how great of a play that was (btw I'm a **terrible** thresh player, the only thing I know about thresh is landing skillshots - his Q, the rest I have almost no clue).\n\nBut then Soraka has to risk her life to get that Q off (especially after those range nerfs *rito pls*) just to give bonus hp regen to her ADC or to constantly zone enemies while also giving AA buffs from Ardent Censer, a team speed boost with Talisman of Ascension, MR Aura from Aegis of the Legion, the team shield from Locket, and most importantly, those game-changing silences that are capable of shutting down most champions in the area; all of these are (in my opinion) far more important than spamming W on low-health targets and pressing R on the right moment; yet, those are the least noticed moves by other team members.\n\nSure I can feel great about myself, but not giving my team the impression that I'm actually a great Soraka player (haven't played her lately but I'm pretty sure that I'm at least an above-average Soraka player ^^) really puts me down.\n\nBut that's just my personal preference. I think Soraka is a great champion that excels in what she was designed to do: disrupting the enemy while keeping her teammate's health bars from disappearing. The only drawback I can think of for Soraka is her lack of reliable CC, but she's strong enough in other areas to compensate. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Saving Grace","date":"2016-11-02T18:01:22.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally people who realize Soraka is more than just W.\n\nThank you guys <3.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-02T14:54:54.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love your post, main, and reasons for liking Raka.\n\nHail the Banana Queen!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-02T01:14:38.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Goodness this is a long post ^^ thanks for the warning.\n\nYes I do main a champion(s)\n\n>How many champions do you main?\n\n2-3 per lane. Jungle not included, I don't play jungle all that often.\n\n>If you main more than one, do you have any preferences between your mains or pick one more often than others?\n\nMid Lane: I usually pick Brand, but if I'm feeling cheeky I'll play my favorite mage lady Lux. If they play an assassin or Yasuo mid, then I whip out my trusty Viktor. Also my team comp matters. If we have lots of CC I'll play Brand. If we have little CC I'll pick Lux. If they pick an assassin I'll pick Viktor. For nostalgia I pick my old main Azir back up from time to time.\n\nTop Lane: Right now It's a toss-up between Garen and Ryze. Garen if we have an AP mid, and Ryze if we have an AD mid.\n\nSupport: Usually Taric. Soraka if I feel like chilling.\n\n>Who do you main? Why do you main them? What do you love most about your main(s)? Is there something you don't like about your main(s)? Is/are your main(s) a popular pick? Is/are your main(s) mained a lot?\n\nBrand: I main him because I like to explode people. I love his VO, his visuals, and his theme of fire. Only thing I don't like about Brand is his dependence on combos and long cooldowns. He isn't that popular a pick, I rarely see other Brands.\n\nLux: She has been my midlane bae since I started the game. I still suck at skillshots though ^^. I love her adorable voice (Yes even the laugh). I love her theme of light mage and her big bro the G-Man. Her quotes are so positive and upbeat they keep me from being tilted, and I love Lazers. Only thing I don't like about her is that she is _sooo_ squishy. Sometimes I feel like Sona can take more punishment than her lol. I don't see a lot of Luxes though, and the ones I do see I usually incinerate with Brand.\n\nViktor: He is an awesome cyborg with a cape, lazor, and russain accent. What's not to like? His Lazer is a little hard to land, and his CSing sucks early levels, or it's just me. I haven't seen that many Viktors.\n\nAzir: I love his VO, his theme, his thematics, his kit, his everything. Literally the only reason I don't main him now is because he's been nerfed too much to be useful in a team without tanks or CC. :(  Oh yeah, also he dies to a sneeze, that kinda sucks. I have only seen two other Azirs during my 6 months playing.\n\nTaric: His VO is relaxing to listen too, his theme of Protector is nice as a support. His kit feels nice and cohesive as well, I really feel connected to my ADC. His ult is just awesome to watch. What I don't like is he scales crap with MR, and he is so weak to magic poke it feels bad. Once again, I haven't seen that many Tarics.\n\nSoraka: Her VO is beautiful, her Dyrad skin is beautiful. Her personality is beautiful, and her story is beautiful. Her kit does what it should, and I'm very chill and happy when I play her. Her squishiness is an issue for me though, so I don't play her much when we need frontliners.\n\nGaren: http://imgur.com/W0wVY4c.gif?Noredirect Nuff Said.\n\nRyze: He's a decent top laner and while he's tricky I'm saving up for another AP top laner, so he likely won't stay. I've seen quite a few Ryzes.\n\n>Which level are you with your main? How many mastery points do you have for you main(s) in total? Do you think the number of mastery points have some correlation to how skillful a player is with your main(s)?\n\nAzir: level 5, 61K\n\nBrand: Level 5, 56K\n\nLux: Level 5, 46K\n\nViktor: Level 4\n\nGaren: Level 5, 30K\n\nTaric: Level 5, 21K\n\nSoraka: Level 3\n\nMains mastery point total: 42\n\nI believe that mastery points have something to do with it, but sometimes you just click with a champ, and you do really well from the getgo, and mastry scores then just become a way for you to prove it to others.\n\n>When did you start maining your current main(s)? How much have you been playing League? Did you have any other mains before?\n\nBeen playing since S6 in April. All the mains I mentioned I still play regularly with the exception of Azir. Garen and Lux were first, followed by Azir and Soraka, The rest followed shortly after. Nope, no other mains.\n\n>In which roles do you play your main(s)? Who do you find easiest to go against as your main(s)? Who do you find hardest to go against? Why? Can you find your way against counters?\n\nThe roles I mentioned before, not much variety for me as I have mains for the roles I like lol. I find skillshot champs easiest to play against, and assassins/outplay champs like Riven/Yasuo as the hardest, which is why I have Viktor. \n\nA lot of my champs rotate around skillshots, so mobile champs are a pain for me. I can find my way around them by playing a main that suffers against them the least lol.\n\n>Do you consider yourself good playing as your main(s)? Is it easy for you to spot mistakes made other players playing your main(s)? Do you know people who main the same champion(s) as you? Do you think they are better or worse then you (don't name them please ^^')? Do you have someone/something you can learn from (friend, coach, youtuber, guides, reddit, statistics etc.)?\n\nI believe I am decent at them, with the variety I play I consider myself lucky to be good at all lol. I'd rate myself a 7-8/10 for most of them, with a 5/10 for Azir, because man he is hard.\n\nI find it easy to spot mistakes made by other players of my mains, especially my own mistakes the second I make them. \n\nI know a guy who mains Azir like I used to, unlike me he didn't give up on him and is playing ranked with Azir and stomping. XD Then again he is Mastery 7 so...\n\n>Do you think your main champion(s) is/are balanced right now? Is/are he/she/they going to get changed or reworked soon? If yes, how do you feel about the changes?\n\nI believe they are fairly balanced, I doubt any major changes will come, and I will adapt and stick with them if they are changed. I fell in love with these champs for their thematic and style, not necessarily their kits or balance spots, so a rework won't devastate me.\n\n>Any cool random info (tip, trick, lore, mechanic, bug, anything really) about your main(s) that you want to share that many may not know?\n\nNot off the top of my head lol.\n\n>Rate your main(s) from a scale of 1-10. Would you recommend your main(s) to other players? Would you recommend your main(s) to new players? Why?\n\nAll of them 10/10, completely satisfied would buy again lol. Honestly I would only recommend the simpler ones like Lux, Garen, Brand, ect. to newer players. The tougher ones or the ones that need team coordination (or prediction on your end like Taric) I would save for the more experienced players.\n\n>Which other champions apart from your main(s) do you play often? Why?\n\nNone really. Save for the ones I play on ARAM.\n\nI would like to add that I am exhausted from typing all this lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Lux Lux","date":"2016-11-02T14:50:36.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another Lux player <3 Honestly, the thing that I least expected was many Lux mains showing up more often than others. Now with that said...\n---\nHaha! Now **this** is what I was hoping to see at least once!\n\nLong question -> long answer! I'll give an A for effort!\n\nHonestly though, I wasn't expecting people to respond with a big comment like yours (I mean, your answers are longer than my own xD), because I can understand that people may not have the time (or the patience) to read such a big post, let alone respond to all of it. ^^\n\nYou've started playing just before the MYMU (**Mid-Year Mage Update** which was at the end of April/beginning of May)! I hope that the drastic changes didn't affect you as much while you were still learning about the game :P.\n\nYou're pretty new player compared to most others here. I'm glad that I'm not the only relatively new player around here (I started about a year and a few months ago, which is somewhat new compared to most players), and I'm also glad that other newer players are responding! ^^\n---\nWhat you dislike about your mains are usually there for compensation and/or balance. For example, Brand's dependence on combos and long cooldowns; or Lux's squishiness (which, btw, you are right: Sona **can** take more punishment than Lux, it's just how squishy Lux is!).\n\nThere's almost always a good thing on those balancing drawbacks that a champion has. The good thing about Brand's long cooldowns and dependence on combos is that they require you to be more careful on when and how to use them according to the risks. If you miss your Q stun you'll be vulnerable. **This**, in turn, raising the skill-cap for Brand: better Brands will know if they can risk using their abilities (considering the mana costs, cooldowns and vulnerability when on cooldown).\n\nSame with Lux: miss Q and enemies have a very easy time jumping on you and killing you in a fraction of a second.\n---\nGood luck on getting level 6 and level 7 on your mains!

ME.","replies":[{"poster":"Lux Lux","date":"2016-11-02T21:01:14.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha yeah I know that feeling when your main becomes overpowered and everyone picks him/her. I hated it when Lux became FotM a few months back. Her winrate skyrocketed to 55% and she became so popular it was insane.\n\nGlad they immediately nerfed her shield pretty hard afterwards and suddenly everyone became uninterested.\n\nInteresting how some people start to main a champion they used to pick just as a counter. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Off Meta Evan","date":"2016-11-02T21:20:06.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think theres an extra love that comes from picking up a champ that shits on one that you hate. its like \n\n{{champion:133}} : everyone you pick is useless \n\n{{champion:85}} : nah fam i got you. \n\nty kennen senpai. \n\n\nbtw my GF mains lux and likes to go the damage support build, any personal suggestions? i reccomended {{item:3092}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3089}} but idk if thats still optimal.","replies":[{"poster":"Lux Lux","date":"2016-11-03T00:14:50.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your build suggestion is pretty good (maybe change the order but that's it).\n\nI personally find myself using a lot of this build:\n\n{{item:3092}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3117}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3089}}, this lacks penetration so I wouldn't suggest it if the enemy carries build resistances (OMG I HATE {{item:3155}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3140}} {{item:3139}}  SO MUCH ffs).\n\nBetween {{item:3117}} and {{item:3020}} it's always preference. I personally always go for Mobility Boots first because of the utility and cheap cost, and swap it to Sorcerers Shoes later in the game.\n\nI don't like the Eye of the Watchers since I would miss the ghosts from Frost Queen's Claim, however if you really need that extra item slot, go for it. Some Lux Support mains do this and it's also about personal playstyle.\n---\nIn short:\n\n#Core items:\n\n({{item:3092}} {{item:2045}} OR {{item:2301}}) + ({{item:3117}} OR {{item:3020}}) + ({{item:3165}})\n\n\n#Choose from these (4th-6th items):\n\n{{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3041}} \n---\nMejai's is most of the time **not** recommended. However if you're fed (like 2/0/8 within the first 15 minutes) or have a very great advantage then you may want to consider risking it. It's fun!\n\nI really like Zhonya's because once enemies start realising the damage you deal and the threat you lay onto their carries, they'll want to jump on your face. Zhonya's either makes them burn important cooldowns on you instead of your ADC or makes them not want to go for you in the first place.\n\nI don't think I would build anything other than the items I have suggested. But don't be afraid to experiment!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vitalita","date":"2016-11-02T19:21:14.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to main Xin, but I got bored of him, then I mained Rengar, haven't played him in like a month now though.
