I play for fun and I do play ranked but I am almost 40, have 2 kids and a full-time job in which I travel. I am not great by any stretch but I do have some skills and enjoy the fun that League has been. \r\n\r\nThat being said there has been nothing new when it comes to maps for 6 years.... And SR has become pretty toxic and very boring most of the time. Someone decides to rework champs and completely change their play style which doesn&#039;t change the game. It actually might drive some to play less as now they are thrown off, getting flamed because they have to &quot;relearn&quot; new champs.\r\n\r\nURF is finally a break from the monotony that SR has become. \r\n\r\nPlease make URF a permanent game mode that we can enjoy. Hell, I would even like to see URF ranked / tournament play. Even if you are skilled at a champ, URF can level the playing field. \r\n\r\n****PLEASE KEEP URF PERMANENTLY****","replies":[]}
