What it does is that hides the current application I am in with a combination of buttons. It works on all my other applications EXCEPT league. It even works for the client, just no the in game. Does anyone know a way to make it so the game will also hide when I click the correct button combination? Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T03:17:42.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I'm not sure how that program works tbh.
