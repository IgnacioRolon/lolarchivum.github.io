Instead of having tibbers instant spawn down on champions, keep her damage & range as it is, but make tibbers thrown and actually dodgeable over a 1 or 1.5 toss while he transforms into the large flaming beast as seen in: League of Legends Cinematic: A Twist of Fate (3:30) \nThis will be a big nerf, but a cool nerf rather than a lazy \"Erm, just bring stats down I guess\" Cmon Riot!!! You&#039;re focused too much on numbers rather than innovative changes.\n\nThe major complaint I hear about Annie when I play her is her instant cast ult - \"nothing I can do...\" and it&#039;s true! I don&#039;t get complaints about her harass/overall damage unless I get really fed and do a ton of damage (LIKE EVERY CHAMPION) you&#039;re nerfing the wrong way! Cmon! I&#039;m just gonna flash and ult, eating squishies, but now she'll be more of a **one trick pony** only useful when ult is up, thereby removing my ability to skirmish well with another mage when all ults/sums are down (including theirs). I can see this slightly effecting CS as well.

She could still get her combo off by stunning you with another spell and then throw tibbers in your face. I don't want Annie to get nerfed but the current flash combo instakill is frustrating and some more counterplay would be nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfram Oxford","date":"2015-05-14T00:59:31.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or give it a charge time for damage, it could show like a little circle that annie can move around until she releases R, then tibbers will be summoned. Buff the max damage on it to make it more rewarding and to make up for the lost damage while charging. Btw when I say charge I mean like she charges the spell and based on how much it's charged, it will decide her R damage, i.e. 250-650 damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-14T01:15:29.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nerfing Annie's ult would make her a shittier veigar.","replies":[]}]}
