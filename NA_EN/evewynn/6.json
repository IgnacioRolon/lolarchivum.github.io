The goal is to create weakness so he can be buffed in other ways that creates less gap between the character's skill floor and skill ceiling (though it is natural for there to be a gap, it is way too large currently). Anyways...\n\nAzir late game is fine, he is squishy with good mobility and DPS, but he doesn&#039;t make up for it with weakness mid-early game. He can stay back and push the wave until he gets a little\nBit of attack speed where a q+2 autos will chunk you for so much that you can hardly farm, much less kill him (especially with access to shuffle, ult, and usually barrier).\n\nWhat if q range was shorter early on? This would make it harder for azir to harass, giving more champs at the very least a neutral matchup with him. It would also hit his mobility early/mid game, making his more gracious shuffle distances saved for later on. \n\nIt doesn&#039;t matter how it&#039;s done. It could increase at random level increments, with ranks in either his q or w, or with ranks in his ult. I am personally a fond of the ult ranks, as there are fewer and very clearly defined steps that both he and his lane opponent need to learn for the range of his abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-07-29T20:19:49.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"But... he's already one of the weakest and worst mids in the game for any Azir player not at LCS-level/otherwise extremely experienced in him.\nThe last thing he needs is more nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-07-29T20:25:03.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, and I think that's a problem. But if he's strong, he just dominates all levels of the game. He needs a change that doesn't put him over the edge in pro play but makes him a little better for people picking him up. Compensation that shrinks the gap between his skill floor and ceiling, so to speak.\n\nGiving him such nice utility (maybe a little extra damage to minions for pushing? Throwing out ideas here) could be good in giving him fallback when he is behind, or something. I'm no design expert obviously, but I think that his early strength transitioning into late game death machine (especially in pro hands) hinders his ability to be balanced for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-07-29T20:38:49.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's oppressive and annoying to play against.\nHis skillcurve is also extremely punishing to all players basically except the ones who've devoted ridiculous amounts of time (hundreds of games) and/or are LCS level players essentially.\nThe game is balanced around LCS. Azir is too strong in LCS, hence nerfs. Hence, he becomes really terrible in anything outside of that for the most part.\n\nThe problem is, just about everything he has is iconic to him. His passive brings back a temporary remnant of his empire. His W is literally him being the emperor and commanding his soldiers. His Q sends them flying to a new location, while his E lets him reunite with them. His ult is the denial and shutdown of enemies who would try to break into his domain of power, sending them flying back with a wall made from his own soldiers ramming into them. His combos and various tactics are all flashy and iconic, which is also important to Riot's LC$ 'cool factor' thing.\n\nHence, the only way to actually nerf him more would be to just completely rework him and give him various buffs/nerfs across the board. Yes, he should remain oppressive to play against. That's fine. It's not impossible to play against him, nor is it anywhere close. That's good too. However, reworking him would actually allow him to perhaps become decent outside of LCS without being broken within LCS itself.\n\nThe issue is, Azir is such an iconic, flashy, LCS-posterboy champ that it's very unlikely he'll ever be reworked. Also, people cry and whine about having to play against him all the time, leading to excessive nerfs that neuter him into trash. The same thing happened with Tahm for example. He was incredibly good a long time ago. And as a result, he got nerfed. Then he got nerfed again. Then he got nerfed again. And he's trash now. Same thing with Azir.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-07-29T20:47:47.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's practically reworked compared to what he was when he was first released.
