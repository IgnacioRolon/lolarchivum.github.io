Titanic&#039;s entire existence revolves around this concept, with buyers being able to pick only this item while still outputting a high level of damage (especially in combination with S-Gauge), with the rest of the items being full tank. \r\n\r\nFiora has been a well-known abuser in combination of other parts of her kit, and other champions following the &quot;metagolem&quot; build have begun to arise, including the dreaded tank Akali.\r\n\r\nLong ago, a similar item existed that was removed for the same concept, called Atma&#039;s Impaler. I would venture to say that Titanic is much stronger than Atma&#039;s was during its time of removal, which really only synergized well on a few champs like Garen and Jarv. However, the concept remains; building almost full tank while also dealing considerable damage means that there is little trade-off, crowding out other builds and creating an overall negative effect on game balance. \r\n\r\nAs much as I like Titanic Hydra, it is the crux of these builds and the living embodiment of &quot;build tank, deal damage&quot; and something that I feel should be addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2016-03-03T02:16:44.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it should be changed. Perhaps it only increases base ad not bonus. That way champs like Yi or Fiora cant get it. Its also frustrating that it out damages ravenous hydra at like every stage.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-03T03:59:28.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think base ad is an interesting idea, but care has to be made for these kinds of decisions as any items that increase base AD by a large amount would drastically increase the power of sheen items.","replies":[]}]}]}
