You see, I don&#039;t really\r\nJungle, but I play a lot of champs mid that probably shouldn&#039;t be there. Some are more successful than others, and eve has always been one of those champs that could work Iif you did it right. I&#039;ll talk about old eve and how she played, then new eve.\r\n\r\nOld eve in lane was a chore. You expected to be harassed a lot in the first few levels, doing what you could to steal CS and maybe poke with a random q here and there. Spamming it could really hurt your mana, but at least the passive could help that somewhat. However, after a gunblade, she could go toe-to-toe with any laner, and had great roams. That strength would continue on into late game, where she would function as a pretty standard assassin.\r\n\r\nNew eve is way better in lane. No more does she need to cower hoping for CS; the damage potential at level 1 with q alone will deter even the ballsiest of enemy Laners. In addition, her all ins and roams are just as strong. I still rush gunblade due to the sustain and active, and I&#039;ve been having good results. Her level 6 is great due to the camo and having an ult that ACTUALLY CAN KILL PEOPLE. She also has no mana problems in lane, as q costs almost nothing, w is refunded, and e is only used during all-ins. She transitions great into late game, dealing just as much damage, although she is definitely a bit less safe. Overall sightly worse late game for a better early game. I&#039;d say worth.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m very satisfied with the Eve rework. That doesn&#039;t seem to be a very popular opinion, but I&#039;m sticking to it. She has awesome visuals, she has a play pattern that makes sense for a stealth character (psychological fear with w, dipping in and out of fights using her passive and ult), and she is just super fun. Maybe I&#039;m biased because I&#039;ve been playing her at a disadvantageous lane for so long, but I think it&#039;s important to have perspective with these kinds of changes.\r\n\r\nGood work, riot. You get my stamp of approval.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-10-12T16:26:32.423+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's new assassin designs have been pretty interesting.

I learned it the hard way: being hella fed I landed a full rotation on a brand, except for Q1, but I hardly took half his hp.\n\nI strongly dislike this extreme reliance on hitting Q1 for getting your damge.

Stealth took way too long to activate in lane; you were forced to exit from it almost immidately if you wanted to CS, and had no way to harass the enemy laner bedsides just walking up to them, and even then it was usually while stealthed in which case you probably gave up CS to do it.\n\nNew Eve actually has range on her Q, and deals way more damage early on. She can also harass constantly because she essentially uses no mana. Additionally, the cooldown happens after using her first Q, I often am able to use it immediately after my third recast. Using W easily scares people away from hiding in minions, as no one wants to get charmed.\n\nI'm sorry if you're having troubles, but keep it up and you'll find success.","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2017-10-13T00:13:19.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not trying to be rude here, like the other person said, you are never going to hit your Q against anyone who knows what he is doing in lane, especially not a Q after a W, \n\nI'm orianna, I'm standing behind my minions and throwing Q-W and AA at you all day and zone you out of lane entirely, what you gonna do about it? charm me? I don't care, I'm still behind my minions and I poke the crap out of you and you still can't do anything. walk toward me to trigger the charm with an auto attack? and get hit by a full combo in the face + minion aggro? you are just going to die. walk away from your lane and ignore me + the minion wave to maybe flank me while invisible? you lose tons of gold + xp + turret and I'm still behind my minions and I blast your face when you show up. \n\nthat works for you because your normal mmr is low and you happen to play against players who indeed don't know what they are doing, and that's great, good for you, but try to understand that your experience is probably not universal, and simply not very representative of a good and actual duel either.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shaydrox","date":"2017-10-12T11:50:29.729+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think most junglers are having troubles because she's worse at running straight at somebody now, while a good flank will net very nice results.
