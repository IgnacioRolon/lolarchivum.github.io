It&#039;s a heartwarming nod to his original ties to the Crystal Scar&#039;s Dominion map, and is something we have never seen before as a mechanic. I like that. But as much of the people who have seen and played it, the concept is...lacking.\r\n\r\nThe stat boosts are incredibly powerful while in the area, but they are his only steroid. Sure, you can put the attack speed back on his Q, but what if we embrace the new passive as oppose to shun it? In order to make it work and feel good for the Skarner player, consider the following:\r\n\r\n**Increase the areas of the nodes of power:** The areas are far too confining. Yeah, you clear fast, but a &quot;juggernaut&quot; is suppose to FIGHT! And fights are not going to happen in these areas if it can be helped. Increase the areas to where controlling all of them would grant the passive to the ENTIRE MAP, minus the bases. Decrease the stats themselves to compensate.\r\n\r\n**Give a reward for capturing all of the points:** Managing to capture all of the points should be an important mini-game for Skarner, and one where he should be rewarded if he succeeds. 10 seconds of lockdown makes it far too easy for enemies to re-capture zones, meaning that there is little incentive to gaining control of the nodes in the enemy jungle unless you know a fight is going to happen there, or you know you can secure a buff from it. If the Skarner player manages to get all the points, it should feel good! Make it so that after Skarner captures all the nodes, they are locked down for several minutes so that the player can actually enjoy having a passive without fear of being confined to an area or having it taken away (giving gold and vision in the process).\r\n\r\nLike I said before, I want to like this Skarner. But people will not get behind this in its current state, and simply tweaking numbers won&#039;t cut it. I would be perfectly fine in keeping the current Skarner, because he is in a good state right now, but if these changes are GOING to happen, suggestions like what I have above would help it be a fun experience.","replies":[]}
