Ranged champs have one of the greatest advantages to go along with their DPS: safety. All of this talk of new masteries (like fresh blood) is just resurfacing the long-standing fact how ranged champions have such a natural advantage over melee ones, without having to sacrifice much in other areas for it.\r\n\r\nIn almost every case, when a new item/mastery that offers damage is introduced, it will automatically favor ranged champions over melee ones, especially in laning phase (where the difference is most pronounced anyways). \r\n\r\nWe could say &quot;just make it worse on ranged&quot; for so many cases, but when that statement happens too much, all we are doing is piling on band-aids to fix a much larger problem. Melee champions need to at least be able to survive against ranged champions in the laning phase without being totally shut out.\r\n\r\nNo, I&#039;m not sure how that looks like. Maybe specialized items or masteries need to be introduced. Maybe the base stats between ranged and Melee champs need to be looked at as a whole. I dunno.
