He could even be the character that caused the conflict between the Targonians which allowed _Aurelion Sol_ to rebel.\n---\nAlso, the Targonians with access to space travel seem to be the Targonian gods, rather than the citizens, or the mortals whom the gods possess and control , if that matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-11T22:38:26.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you bring up some good points, though it is likely that Aurelion Sol is referring to Taric when he talks about the \"Aspect of Targon,\" I think that Taric may be more pro-Targonian than not. It is possible that he personally dislikes the Targonian's using the dragon as a slave however, which could make for an interesting story point. I'm certainly excited to see how it develops.\n\nI'm not sure if any race could be called \"space faring\" if only their gods are the ones that can travel, since gods should be able to do that anyways. My hunch is that through magic fueled by Aurelion Sol (or indirectly through his immense power) that some branches of Targon have become voyagers in space, and are currently either seeking a planet to inhabit, or have already inhabited one or more planets. I also think that it is likely that Taric is the Demi-God representative of Runeterra's Targon as a whole while off somewhere in space.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreampod","date":"2016-03-12T21:59:59.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I got the impression that the Rakkor and Solari who are the champions associated with Mount Targon are not actually _Targonians themselves_ but rather humans from Runeterra that serve/are manipulated by and occasionally steal a bit of the actual Targonians power.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-12T22:19:29.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we base an entire race on just their gods, though? I would doubt that a non-God-like being would be able to bestow powers akin to a Demi-God. Unless the Aspects that look over Targon are a race of gods, which would be..weird, but plausible I suppose. I think it is possible that other races on other planets have also been bestowed the power of the aspects, but it may be referred to by a different name on their worlds. I firmly believe that \"Mount Targon\" is just another geographical location, albeit magical and mysterious, and the people who live around it should rightfully be Targonian as that is just what their nation is called.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
