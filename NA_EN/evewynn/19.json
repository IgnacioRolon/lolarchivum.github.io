I&#039;ve played Aurelion Sol quite a bit, moreso when he first came out (I like to play around with different champs a lot), but I like to say I still &quot;got it&quot;\r\n\r\nBefore I get into my issue, I just want to lay it out there that Sol&#039;s E is usable both on your cursor and on your mini-map.\r\n\r\nSo the change is this. When he was first released, you could use the mini-map to fire out your Q towards that direction. You cannot do that anymore, with it firing towards your cursor even if it is over the mini-map. \r\n\r\nThe reason I do not like this change, is because it makes it more difficult to make long-range q&#039;s using the mini-map. Nearly impossible even. Before, you could select a spot on your mini-map to travel with your E, and also fire your Q without moving your cursor for perfectly lined shots. \r\n\r\nI realize this was likely changed in order to help prevent mis-clicks, but this was my favorite way of quickly traveling while also making the best use-of long range Q&#039;s personally. I know I can&#039;t be the only one. Changing this back would be a big help for people like me, and would not really affect other Sol players.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: please let me fire my Q using mini-map again.","replies":[]}
