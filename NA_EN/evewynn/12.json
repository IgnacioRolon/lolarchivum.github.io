If nunu ult and other abilities can be invisible in bushes, Aurelion Sol should be treated similarly right?\r\n\r\nHaving it be invisible until it damages a champion seems pretty fair, and would immediately communicate what was happening to the opponent to avoid the legendary 5 sunfire evelynn experience.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒoes","date":"2016-03-13T04:50:26.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure this has been addressed yet, but Sol's passive should work just like Sunfire Cape's passive, Immolate. I believe that the passive only affects those within the bush, but not those outside. It would be tough to pull off visually, but it's better than ruining the game for Sol players.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-13T11:54:17.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering that the radius is large enough to where it would be extremely difficult to hit a champ that was occupying the same bush as Sol, I doubt this would be an effective solution","replies":[{"poster":"ƒoes","date":"2016-03-13T19:42:48.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or the passive could disable all-together while in a bush, but this could be potentially harming to the playstyle. Using Sol's W while in a bush, however, will reveal him to the enemy team if they have vision in that area outside of the bush.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-13T20:58:03.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is definitely a harm, and would feel very awkward in practice","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"p a t r i o t","date":"2016-03-13T03:14:03.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think anything can hurt the roaming potential of a champion who can fly over terrain.\n\nBut yeah they should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-13T11:52:53.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, if I just wanted that I would play Zac, he can practically fly anyways...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PWR4UtAfKw","date":"2016-03-13T00:26:48.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELL YEAH~!\n\nsol : My comets are too bright to sneak in a bush :D\n\nnot fair at all","replies":[{"poster":"SpookyNeedle","date":"2016-03-13T07:13:42.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite, the mountain.
