He's a funny guy, and you might get a chuckle out of his stories or mistakes (or mine, since I'm the worst nid ever). He knows he does poorly because he is new but he catches on quick and is willing to learn.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking of watching a streamer, think about watching him for a game, and leave a comment of anything you like. \r\n\r\nAnd also, if this guy made a stream, would you watch it? How can he improve the experience for the viewer? Thank you for your time!\r\n\r\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zjs0hyBmqBQ&amp;feature=share","replies":[]}
