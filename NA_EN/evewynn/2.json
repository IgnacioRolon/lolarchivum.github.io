The concept of the &quot;grim reaper&quot; comes to mind readily, especially for western cultures, but I feel as if there is a more relevant representation of the entity known as Kindred.\r\n\r\nIn comes the Psychopomp.\r\n\r\nAccording to Greek mythology, psychopomps are the beings that greet mortals upon their death in order to guide them into the afterlife. They take no part in what happens after they die, only bringing them to the point in which their souls are judged. Their forms are varied depending upon their depiction, often taking on various anthropomorphic animal traits. In the popular role playing game Pathfinder, psychopomps are characterized by the masks that they wear.\r\n\r\nSounding familiar? I feel as if the concept of psychopomps (which the grim reaper falls under) was a heavy--if not the main--inspiration for the champion.\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s everyone&#039;s thoughts on the matter?","replies":[{"poster":"Cardinal Sinveil","date":"2016-05-15T18:39:38.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if {{champion:203}} is the Thanatos-type or Charon-type of Grim Reaper (or something else). That is to say are they the one that: \n1) Decide whose life is time to come to an end (think Atropos)\n2) The one who, after the decision is made, _grants_ Death to the individual (think Achlys)\n3) The one that guides the deceased to the Netherworld (think Thanatos & sometimes Hermes)\n4) The one who takes them to their next destination (think Charon)\n\nAs we can see, there are several types of psychopomps, and it's tricky to define which one is the {{champion:203}} exactly. There are many others I forgot to list, such as the Judge-type (think Anubis, although that would be more fitting for Nasus) or possibly an Underworld Ruler archetype such as Hades or Hel. I'd personally label the {{champion:203}} as a combination of 1) & 2) but it's anybody's guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-05-15T20:14:02.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that there is definitely viability in the concept that Kindred is a giver of death, especially considering how they are portrayed (lamb giving peaceful passing while wolf taking those who are resistant).\n\nThere is little description to what happens to the souls after Kindred comes, so I do not think there is enough to know whether or not Kindred has any say as to how the souls are judged or where they end up. Everything else is definitely possibly, though. Not too much is described directly, so it is difficult to say which specific Psychopomps Kindred specifically embodies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2016-05-14T23:35:30.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thought this was going to be another Chiara Bautista thread.
