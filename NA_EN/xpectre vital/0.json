I totally 100% that my attitude was unnecessary and absolutely unacceptable. I have so much invested in this account and this game.  I have played this game for something around 4 years and have dedicated time and money into this game and account.  I would be destroyed if it were to end like this.  I will take a 2 week ban, a one month ban, a one month chat ban!  Whatever!  I just want to join my group on the rift and create more memories and meet more people.  Although I have flamed in the past (most people do at some point, but that's beside the point), I want to change from my ways.  And only you, rito can do that.  Please hear me out.  I know riot games will come through for me in one way or another.  Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Radiant Wukong","date":"2016-12-26T09:15:47.278+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Merry Christmas {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-12-26T09:26:21.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know riot games will come through for me in one way or another.\n\nConsidering you yourself admitted to being toxic, it seems like a justified ban. You're welcome to make a new account though, maybe losing everything from that one will be enough to get you to change.","replies":[{"poster":"xPectre Vital","date":"2016-12-26T21:55:00.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be surprised if everyone wasn't salty at one point or another.  Another point is that I have never been suspended.

Either way it is deserved.  \n\nIf you are truly capable of reforming, you can prove it by making another account and not being toxic enough to be banned. However forget about your perma-banned account, it is gone, you broke the rules and it is your punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-12-26T10:17:23.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had enough chances to change.","replies":[{"poster":"xPectre Vital","date":"2016-12-26T21:57:17.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never got a suspension.
