I'd recommend running a traceroute log during the hours you experience high latency so we can see what's going on in the backend. First, grab the network app [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) then plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field before you start the trace. After 5 minutes has passed by, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you encounter issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Drezmal","date":"2016-12-01T04:36:06.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply i dont get on the boards that much usually 2ce a month thank you for help on this issue when your not even the sorce of the problem riot has by far the best support staff and listens to there fans/community the most\nbut it looked like my problem fixed itself so thank you for the help but im good now i think mediacom was having alot of issues like this in our area and they fixed it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kewlipo","date":"2016-11-23T04:11:34.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, I'm getting the same problem.\n\nI too have Mediacom, and am getting the bad ping at certain times of day, usually 8 to 10.\n\nOverloaded cheap ass network...","replies":[{"poster":"Drezmal","date":"2016-11-23T06:24:08.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i should've said that its really bad around dinner hours","replies":[]}]}]}
