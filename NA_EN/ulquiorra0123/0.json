Azir has a kit that isn't overcomplicated to the point of inability to balance, however he is tiptoeing the line. This new kit coming to Akali, its way over that line of complexity. I am fine with the mastery bar for a champion being high, but when the kit demands low numbers because you have so much ability to outplay with little opportunity for counterplay - this becomes a problem. Her rework kit already has insane numbers as shown, and we know PBE won't change that at all. So they are releasing an assassin with the ability to outplay any champion in the game, with overtuned numbers. \n\nAnd their response to her 100% pick/ban state will be to gut her into the ground or just straight up revert the rework.

I agree it has some intricacies, like every her ability marking a target with the circle ( which has a CD aniway ) but otherwise it's quite simple. They just offer you many different choices and you have to pick one.\n\nHer Q is an aoe and is useful to proc the ring effect at distance. It has different properties like waveclear and hp recover but those are bundled up in the effect itself.\nHer W is basically her old one, with some under-the hood changes.\nHer E is probably the most complex of the 3 but it's quite simple to make choices around - either hit somebody with the skillshot, proc the ring and dash at them or dash to them, hit them and withdraw to the smokescreen.\nHer ulti allows her to break the mold a little by proccing more easily rings and giving her an execute.\n\nmechanically, they are simple. Combined they intersect very nice and clean.\n\nTotally different thing from other champions like Camille or Aatrox, so to say, which have mich more undelying effects and timers that feel more enstranged to control.

I am not sure if said stun procs the mark that allows her to refresh her dash.\n\nI mean, in the end the execution is pretty clear, but if you look at the inner workings it's all mad eup of marks, exceptions, resets, stacks and so on. Not an effect is a clear one!\n\nAlso, she has stuff that is not much intuitive, and while that does not make her complex it does not help at all to understand her. I still don't know the uses of her W, and why they gave her a mark reset on a skill that can be used to engage with a stun. I actually dom't get at all why they gave her a mark reset that works like old Fiora's Q.\n\nAkali instead has skills that work in a simple way, but that have dynamics that interact with each other. Probably the most comples of her kit is the E, that has an exception ( can hit a temporary cloud of smoke ) and a mark ( that however is single targeted and very bief).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-07-17T10:58:16.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir's kit is complicated? in what way?\n\nYes he requires some mechanical dexterity because some of his combos require you to be in-animation while you are casting the next step, \n\nbut is that complicated? or just difficult?","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra0123","date":"2018-07-17T19:21:56.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Compare Azir to most of the champion pool, he is far beyond the average line of complexity if you consider how he is played at the top tier of play.

The intent is to not make an inherently overpowered champ in relation to the broad meta (at least I assume this is the case, and have seen that confirmed many times).
