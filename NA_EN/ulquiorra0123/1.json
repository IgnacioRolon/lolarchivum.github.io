I played for fun got towards later part of season decided I wanted skin, immediately climbed. \r\n\r\nI heard it most from enemies when they look at 45% win rate and go \"you're hardstuck and won't ever reach gold, look at my elo and then look at yours!\". Like, you took the L in just one of the many I hardcarried during the climb xD Is it salt or are people just that delusional that they look at a win rate and get so hung up on it they cant see the difference in gameplay lol. Also I love this argument because you got matched with me xD \r\n\r\nIll give Riot this, they tried as hard as they could to keep me out of gold. First and second games of series were literally impossible to win. 4th was looking that way with team flaming me for going AP malphite jungle, but most KP/gold/damage/damage taken, so guess something went right xD 5th was a fiesta, 5-0 trist who got 5 kills without jungle pressure, doesn't matter. Me play tank, me buy randuins, me tanky, me win game. \r\n\r\n12G 8W 3L\r\n\r\nSejuani\r\n60% (3W 2L)  6.89 KDA\r\n\r\nKha'Zix\r\n100% (3W 0L)  5.58 KDA\r\n\r\nMalphite\r\n100% (1W 0L)  9.33 KDA\r\n\r\nThese are my final stats on the climb, I don't think I would call 1 loss in solo queue hardstuck. Anyways, done with this account for the season as far as ranked is concerned, got the skin. Back to main to see If I can stop plummeting rank xD","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-08-24T18:02:39.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hardstuck usually means you can't climb.\n\nLike calling somebody a hardstuck plat is usually somebody's way of insulting them.\n\nFor instance, to translate what they're telling you; 'you're hardstuck gold and are too bad to climb' is practically what they're saying. They're calling you trapped in your division.\n\nFor example somebody might call me hardstuck diamond because i play a lot of games and haven't reached challenger yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra0123","date":"2018-08-24T18:07:13.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't this a ridiculous claim to make though?

Its just what our league culture is known to do. The best way to insult back is to just win. \n\ni personally was hardstuck but there's a lot more to being hardstuck then being the reason why, especially when you're at 0LP in a 5 division and trying to climb out with 13 LP on a 24 LP loss rate.. the best thing that ever happened to me was getting demoted then I started climbing again because I wasn't hardstuck dropping MMR in the same division for a long time, now i'm back to where I was and earning 18-20 LP, just idc enough atm to actually try and climb higher, i'm just glad i recovered.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellmet","date":"2018-08-24T18:29:58.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In high Silver/Gold it takes on a new meaning.  There is a flaw in the Ranked system where new players to ranked & to the game are automatically played around that MMR.  It's where I'm at now and just about every game it seems like there is somebody in the game who do not understand the basics of the game.  And when you get them on your team it's an absolute nightmare.  \n\nYou might think law of averages.. well the other team get them too etc, but that's doesn't really work out that way in the big scheme of things.  If you climb to fast, your MMR gets to high for your rank, so it means that when you get to Silver 1 you can easily be playing against high Gold players.. which is why sometimes proportionals can be a nightmare.\n\nTo give you an example, the last time I was in promotionals to get to Gold my first game I had one of those news players in jungle.. he basically went 0-18 and was unbelievable bad.  The other team had Gold 3 players etc.  The second game I had 2 players who were new to ranked, and although one of them played okay the other one didn't understand the importance of CS and was really bad.  Again playing against upper Gold players etc.  I can't remember the third game but I was so tilted I didn't care.\n\nThe fact of the matter is Riot really screwed ranked up this year and it's something they have admitted to.  I don't really understand why they can't get this right.. I mean it's been 8 years right, how hard can it be?  And I don't see these problems with other games and their ladder/ranked systems.  Something as basic as.. if you are new at Ranked you should start at the bottom seems to be too complicated of a concept for Riot to understand.\n\nActually, I was really dumbfounded by the decisions Riot made for a long time until the drama came out about their bro culture, how they treat women and how they only hire directly from this toxic community into their company.  Their product is a direct representation of the people who work there.. and in ranked it clearly shows.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellmet","date":"2018-08-24T18:31:48.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, my last ranked match we had an AFK.  5v4 game, I lose 18LP for something that is not my fault.

My definition of hard stuck would be if you no longer get more LP for wins than you lose for losses.  Climbing is still feasible as long as you are getting more lp when you win than you lose on a loss.  Hard stuck also still means almost nothing to me.  You could say that I was \"hard stuck\" gold 4 this season but now I am in promos to plat just because I changed my build a little bit.  I was like 44% win rate on Taric trying to use relic shield.  I then switched to coin and dropped tear from my build and now have gone 30-17 on him since.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultimate Deadpoo","date":"2018-08-24T18:33:44.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally view hardstuck as a way of telling someone you've gone as far as you can go in ranked, it's generally used to insult someone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-08-24T18:00:55.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im hardstuck 500 games in plat","replies":[]}]}
