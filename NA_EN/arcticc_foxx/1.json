I read online that someone said there is a file that you can move to make it so that you can use your item sets in the new client, but they didn't say which file. It is just showing my item sets from before i updated them, but I really would like to use my new updated ones. I looked all over online and I can't figure out which file it is that you have to move. Do you guys know how to do it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-27T02:16:15.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Item sets aren't built into the client, so you can't really *move* them, but you **should** be able to get them showing up in-game while using the Legacy Client if you load into a custom match once with each item set and from the Legacy Client. Basically, just load into a custom match to view the item sets you create in the Legacy Client **before** moving back over to the Beta Client.\n\nI hope I managed to convey this without making it confusing, but let me know if I need to clarify further. ^.^","replies":[]}]}
