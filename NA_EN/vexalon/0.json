The screen goes black, and if I move the mouse, then the loading screen appears as normal, and if the mouse stops moving, it goes black again...In other words, the loading screen only lights up when I move my mouse.\r\nIt's almost as if it's a screensaver or power saving for the loading screen.\r\nIt only happens with league, and no other game\r\n\r\nI have an MSI GT72s 6QD Dominator Laptop if that makes a difference, connected to power whole time\r\n\r\nAny help will be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-22T16:38:51.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've connected to the game, but an overlay or third party app could be causing this.  If you have any, even discord overlays, disabling it should fix it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexalon","date":"2017-12-23T10:44:53.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I don't really use any additional apps with League of Legends. \nYou are correct, I am connecting to the game, it's just the screen goes blank while loading.\n\nI'm going to disable all laptop related apps. MSI True colour, steelseries ,nahimic etc\n\nWill revert back with report.\n\n*Edit, switched shadowplay off too, still no luck","replies":[]}]}]}
