(or Poro ;\")  )\n\nOnce again my internet company (i swear croatian net companies run these things on potatoes) f-ed up and my net died for 10 minutes in game,guess what? I get out of the game and get leaver buster,a 20 MINUTE LEAVER BUSTER,I shall not quote but I was told that \"the punishments diminish after some time\" or rather \"after a period of not being afk,leaving etc\".\n\nI haven't afkd or left a game in 3 months and i get 20 minutes? I mean I honestly don't care i'l just play something else in the background but what the hell Riot? \nIf I was told that punishments diminish after a period,why didn't they,chances are i'm not the only one,so yeah Targo(or Poro ) pls assist me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-16T21:01:19.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true, consistently playing without leaves improves your standing with [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).  I looked into this for you, and you had 2 leaves in a row and they were ranked too.  :/  You can play something in the background, but I recommend resolving whatever is causing you to leave games.  These leaves have a hugely negative impact on other players in ranked.  :/  \n\nIf you have any questions about the system or your specific behavior in general, hit up our[ PB Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) or a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more context, otherwise I hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Skaarl  D Lizard","date":"2017-05-16T21:38:08.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first one wasn't actually a \"leave\" by definition,net died like 1 min before the game ended,enemy had baron and was pushing,\nsaw minimal harm in it.\n\nThe second one was indeed a leave,around 15 min,team probably surrendered at 20,can't do much there.\n\nResolving is unfortunately impossible as this internet company of mine runs on already previously mentioned potatoes.\n\nWII U WII U WII U rant alert\n\nPORO PLS REMOVE MY LEAVEBUSTER XD {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]}
