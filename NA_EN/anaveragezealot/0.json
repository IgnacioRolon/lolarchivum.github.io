The issue is that the client assumes you want to bind self cast to just space when you press it. How would I go about changing this to the way I want? Thanks for any help you can provide!","replies":[{"poster":"TheSleepyGod","date":"2016-08-10T12:03:34.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you could look up the process for binding \"attack move\" to left click and try to apply the same logic there, might work","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T16:57:27.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The spacebar is originally reserved auto-center back to your champion, and it doesn't look like it's possible to combine spacebar to additional keys for hotkeys.  Some keys are reserved and cannot be altered.  For example, I use Shift+2 to self-cast Kayle's W.  While it heals, shift is also the auto attack move so if I'm not careful I could heal and run to my death instead of the opposite direction.  :P  If it helps you, I usually just smart cast over myself for a speed boost.  It's good practice anyway, in case I need to smart cast an ally for some support.

I would love to see full customization for key binds but I will find a way to make it work.","replies":[]}]}]}
