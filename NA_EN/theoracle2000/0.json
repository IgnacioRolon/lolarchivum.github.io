Thank you kindly.\n\n>I do firmly believe the guy knows what he's doing and trust him to do what's best for the game. \n\nI think the playerbase who deals with his changes disagrees with you on the \"he knows what he's doing\" bit, although defending your mate is honorable. This Morde rework is a repeat of CertainlyT's previous mistakes: When it works as intended, it's too damn good. \n\nBut it makes Morde reliant on a good support, and these are rare in solo queue. Without one he's useless, from what I've experienced on my PBE account. And it seems like CertainlyT is ignoring all these concerns when he says \"yea well get a good support then lol\" and changes nothing except the Q damage.\n\nWe realise he wants what's best and he's not some evil entity or anything, and he makes fun designs that are great to watch; but he's done a lot of damage to the game which outweighs the good he does, and he seems to fully ignore the feedback on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-08-11T05:06:14.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you consider \"damage\" may actually be what Riot strives for.\n\nThe champions CertainlyT has made and has worked on have been some of the most impactful and game changing champions this game has ever seen. Yes, people hate them, but there is not one champion in the game that someone does not hate to some degree.\n\nThresh redefined the support role, and bottom lane as a whole.\n\nKalista has been just as or even more polarizing than Teemo!\n\nDarius has become a long time favorite for many people out there, and even though he is being slightly reworked (and Certainly isn't reworking him), he will still feel like Darius.\n\nZyra, unfortunately needs some love right now, so, we can leave her out.\n\nAnd finally, Yasuo. Do I even need to explain Yasuo?\n\nAlso, in regards to Zed, people should stop blaming for Zed, for he only helped _slightly_ with Zed and is not responsible for his full production (this comes from the League wiki: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Zed/SkinsTrivia ). So, stop blaming him for Zed.\n\nYes, the champions he has made have all been released over powered. Zyra was so stupidly overpowered, that the game was basically over once she was chosen. However, how many other champs have been released that were overpowered on release that CertianlyT _didn't_ make? To name a few......:{{champion:245}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:14}}.\n\nYour blaming CertianlyT for something all of Riot is accountable for, and that just isn't fair.","replies":[{"poster":"toonpang","date":"2015-08-11T06:58:42.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Riot's own words, what they strive for is minimisation of burden of knowledge [as in, players should understand what an ability does after the enemy uses it without looking up the wiki.] CertainlyT is terrible at that. Armor penetration hidden in Yasuo's ult, CDR in Zyra's seeds, bonus infinitely scaling autoattack damage in Thresh's Flay passive, and so on.\n\nThresh and Kalista were both such big designs because they do just about everything other champs in their roles do. At one point in her design, Kal could globally teleport to her Sentinels if they were triggered, until someone rightfully told CertainlyT it was stupid.\n\nI didn't blame him for Zed. But remember, Zed's been frequently picked/banned since his release, until the 1 second nerf to his ult \"Get out of jail free\" escape came along. CertainlyT was responsible for the addition of that escape.\n\nZyra, on her release, had a 65% winrate with people who had even had 5 games or less.\n\nLeague of Legends has different champions with different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities because that's what makes the game interesting. But CertainlyT's kits seem to ignore that because he just packs them full of extra goodies which ultimately eliminate most of their weaknesses. It's like he looks at a champion kit he's making and then gets carried away, like they were letting a 12 year old design a champ. \"Okay, I'll make a champion which can do this, this, this, this and this. Oh, but she should also have this! And this! And this thing!\" \n\nCertainlyT is the fan fiction writer of League champion design. His champions are Mary Sues, good at lots of things but with almost no weaknesses. Which is why they're popular. Why play a champ who actually has weaknesses?\n\nYes, other champion designers have made mistakes in the past. But **every single one of CertainlyT's designs has been pick/ban some time after release**. That's a very bad track record for a designer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-08-11T09:33:07.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give CT a hug, he could appreciate that. \n\nBonus points if it gets awkward","replies":[]},{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2015-08-11T01:52:31.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^_^ quick question for all AP champions and the MR changes that effect assassins and maybe brings new strength to the juggernauts.
