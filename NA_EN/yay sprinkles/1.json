Zyra, yorick, udyr for example all have multiple things that need to be done to get a new skin. \n\nZyra has a lot of animations that need to be done with her plants. Shes probably the most complex in the game when it comes to spell animations.\n\nYorick has all his ghouls and Udyr is technically 4 skins in 1.\n\nSo the time it would take to make 1 skin for them, they could make 2-4 skins that are much simpler for other champs :)\n\nIn saying that, can we please get a Yorick skin Kateykhaos ;)","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-06-10T22:24:23.893+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure yorick is in the category of champions who aren't getting skins yet because they're in line for a major rework (Taric, Urgot,  etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"Dracid","date":"2015-06-10T22:29:41.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=7ha7guy777,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=s5LiZPsg,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-06-10T22:24:23.893+0000)\n>\n> I'm pretty sure yorick is in the category of champions who aren't getting skins yet because they're in line for a major rework (Taric, Urgot,  etc.)\n\nya I know..wishful thinking lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"skyfall619","date":"2015-06-10T18:47:48.730+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:154}} its all good bro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-06-10T22:47:13.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like what champs?","replies":[{"poster":"Dracid","date":"2015-06-10T23:18:25.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=insaiyanbacca,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=s5LiZPsg,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-06-10T22:47:13.506+0000)\n>\n> like what champs?\n\nAatrox, Azir(Reksais getting a skin already like really?), Brand!!!!!!!!, Diana, Elise, Fiora, Kass, Kayle, Kennen just to name a few that don't have many or have not had a new one in forever.","replies":[{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-06-11T00:04:27.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"elise got blood moon semi recently aatrox got mecha last augaust iirc, brand i agree there fiora and kass to, kayle has enough already, kennen needs a vu","replies":[{"poster":"Dracid","date":"2015-06-11T00:34:09.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=insaiyanbacca,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=s5LiZPsg,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2015-06-11T00:04:27.246+0000)\n>\n> elise got blood moon semi recently aatrox got mecha last augaust iirc, brand i agree there fiora and kass to, kayle has enough already, kennen needs a vu\n\nkayle only has 3 that are available all the time though. she has a lot of limited ones","replies":[{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-06-11T05:41:57.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and annie has alot of limited skins and people complain when she gets one","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mast3rMahan","date":"2015-06-10T23:33:43.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox could get one, Azir is new and though Reksai is new, she thematically fits with the pool party line very well because of shark, Brand got Zombie Brand about 2 years ago (not super new but still), Diana got one last year, Elise got Victorious and also receives little gameplay so pretty meh in my book, Fiora is the same as Brand, Kass could use one but just got visual update so probably not in the near future, Kayle just got Riot Kayle last year, Kennen could use a new one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mast3rMahan","date":"2015-06-10T23:18:19.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shut your face right now.
