That was fine by me but when i bought the packs i joined a lobby at the same time and now when i go to choose my chroma color i can only choose the classic white. I am confused because i thought you got the colors when you bought the pack but it only lets me have the white classic color. Does any one else haveing a problem with this or am i the only one?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-13T16:28:55.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey atomiccowpie, \n\nWere you in a Team Builder lobby? The functionality to use a chroma in that specific queue isn't implemented just yet - but it will be soon! \n\nIf not, selecting a chroma is a bit different than a normal skin. \n\nIn Lucian's case, you'll need to select his base skin, which will then bring up colored squares for you to pick from. This is how you'll select your chroma. \n\nI've attached an example using Pool Party Leona. \n\nIf you're still having issues, please let me know. ^-^","replies":[]}]}
