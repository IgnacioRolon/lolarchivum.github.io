She certainly has a very powerful spirit, she reforges her blade, and even stuns people with her spiritual power.  I'm wondering if her resolve to change things qualifies her as being in motion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2015-11-25T20:53:08.584+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryugi Kazamaru,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qOUo9xAK,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-11-25T19:42:02.328+0000)\n>\n> What about someone like Riven, who is marching ahead despite her great losses, and trying to find a way to reforge Noxus?

The way you described her, it sounds like she's in motion.\n\nPersonally, I see Riven as somebody who's a little lost right now. She had conviction once, but that's since been shattered. And nothing has replaced it (yet). In my mind, Riven could benefit from some clarity and purpose. Less dwelling on the past, more driving towards reforging what is broken.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-11-25T19:35:07.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel she'd dislike him due to his inability to adapt to the situation properly.

Swim forward, or drown.\n\nNot sure how she'd feel about the Z-Drive in general though - maybe it's ok, as long as you're using it to (ultimately) move forward? I don't really know... WAAARGHbobo or Jaredan might have some thoughts on this!","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-11-25T20:49:38.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tell me you do on purpose to put WAAARGHbobo's name after a pause or the points \"...\".\n\nIt always spooks me up when Rioters do that, is that a conspirancy?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CarrierKestral","date":"2016-03-23T05:43:54.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qOUo9xAK,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-25T19:35:07.737+0000)\n>\n> I feel she'd dislike him due to his inability to adapt to the situation properly.
