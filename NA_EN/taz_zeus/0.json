The best way to confirm this is by having you run tracerts.  Make sure download the following and run a trace to the following IP's:\n\nhttp://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/\n\n216.133.234.62\n192.64.170.62\n\nYou can run it for about 30 seconds for each ip and export it as a text and attach it to your reply.  It should allow me to see the route your connection is taking and whether this is the root cause to your higher ping!","replies":[{"poster":"TAZ Zeus","date":"2014-09-23T20:48:25.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey TAZ Zeus!\n> \n> Given your explanation, this seems like this may be due to a routing issue.

Tonight though I had a real epiphany. I've been playing normals since I've been on tilt for a while and have been for about a week. SO while playing I realized that my ping rarely spiked at all and when it did was only to about 115 from 100. I recently got out of a ranked match and the ping never went under 135.......like really? I think there is something wrong with the ranked servers since it seemed to only happen in ranked play and not during normals. \n\nIt was really weird and kinda makes me think i'd rather not play ranked if my ping is going to spike by 35% just by switching game modes and wanting to put my skills against others. The odd thing is that its with all the same programs running and everything. So maybe we need to look at what is going on in ranked since it seems to be where I\"ve seen the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirBullwinkle","date":"2014-09-23T00:32:06.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirBullwinkle","date":"2014-09-23T00:17:20.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello I've also had my ping up to about 140 each game i dunno what the problem is .","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-23T00:28:16.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't seem to be related to your Network Path at all, as it shows right around 100 as your normal ping.
