And since nobody knows what their opponents have until they fight them *gasp* Ziggs uses nocturne ult and everyone hears ziggs laugh and fly at sombody (for the lolz)\r\n\r\nA few interesting example:\r\nGnar (passive and ult) with Veigar's stun, Anivia's wall, and Yasuo's stab\r\nPantheon (passive shield) with all his normal abilities except now he grabs nocturne's ult\r\nVeigar (passive mana regen) with nidalee's heal, Soraka's heal, Sona's heal, and soraka's ult\r\nMordekaiser (passive shield) with his flying metal shield(W), Shyvana's fire spin, Singed poison, and Nasus' ult (then just grab sunfire cape muahaha)\r\n\r\nLemme know what you guys think!","replies":[{"poster":"Tin Tarantino","date":"2015-02-28T04:39:33.025+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:79}}  Passive\n{{champion:115}} Q\n{{champion:35}} W\n{{champion:83}} E\n{{champion:17}} R\n\nThe most annoying champion ever","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boxxygen","date":"2015-02-28T02:16:12.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}} Passive\n{{champion:86}} W - Courage ->              Q\n{{champion:89}} W - Eclipse ->                W\n{{champion:11}}  W - Meditate ->             E\n{{champion:12}}  R - Unbreakable Will -> R\n\nThen I'd park my ass under the tower, do a faceroll and go afk to get a sammich.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-02-27T22:54:49.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:29}} with \n{{champion:8}}s Q\n{{champion:41}}s W\n{{champion:69}}s E\n{{champion:23}}s R","replies":[]},{"poster":"freereign","date":"2015-03-01T22:19:10.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:28}} Passive\n{{champion:105}} Playful/Trickster for Q\n{{champion:238}} Shadow for W\n{{champion:29}} Invis for E\n{{champion:7}} Mimic for R\n\nBest hide and seek champ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"VBs4aQv7zJ","date":"2015-03-01T02:52:49.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:99}} Passive, base range 550 and Illumination\n{{champion:222}} Q, Either 175 range plus aoe, or 130% attack speed\n{{champion:96}} W, Active adds 210 range and on hit max hp mgc dmg.\n{{champion:10}} E, Adds 400 range and makes all on-attacks (unfortunately not on-hit) aoe\n{{champion:126}} Technically, Jayce's range is 125, so using the cannon form adds +375 range.\n\nWhile it would be tempting to use Twitch's ult for the multiple hits, Jayce's ult is available at lvl 1 for free,\nand is not subject to significant cooldowns.\nEnd result:  1285 range in \"Pow-Pow\" form, or more the range of Caitlyn's Piltover Peacemaker (aa edge to edge),\nmore than the distance of your natural sight.  Both W and E apply spell effects, so the Illumination debuff\nis being constantly proc'ed after the first hit.  \nEarly game, you can literally farm from under tower.
