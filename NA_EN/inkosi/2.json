But i feel like this time will be my last time trying to really pick a main. This Champ shall be mine to get famous as and climb to master with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.................... Any way here we go \n\n\nFor the most part, im a midlaner. Started my mid lane career heavy playing with AD assassins, and as played more and more, AP Mages are very valued in this game. For team fights and because most tanks in lower Elo dont build to much MR. Usually besides the support, mid lane is the only AP. So ive had phases of playing different AP mid laners. My most notorious ones are Brand, Cass, Ziggs, and Diana. Ziggs being my most recent. Now ive had phases where i loved each one of these champs and for some reason i just kind of fell out of love with each of em. Well not Ziggs yet. But i Love ziggs, i do well with ziggs, but my issue here is that i just cant defend my self. I know they always say \"Peel for your carries\" But man, some times i want to peel for my darn self. I get tired of getting jumped on and instantly knocked out a team fight. You might can say \"Use your Sachel\" But i do use my sachel, i knock myself away. But you know what.... its not enough to stay alive most times. And if my sachel is down, i cant do much. It doesnt help that ziggs has one of the hardest skill shots in the game. (end rant) Any way, Im looking for an AP mid laner who can Carry and pretty much defend for himself/herself if i get targeted. I dont expect to live a 5v1, but at least still make an impact on the team fight when renekton jumps on my throat. I dont expect to get away 100% of the time. But i want to at least give my self a fighting chance. So here's my list of champs that ive been looking at.\n\nAzir\nViktor\nXerath\nMaybe Brand again (dont know why i stopped playing him)\nand Vlad\n\nThanks for reading and Thanks for the feedback. I usually have fun with all champs in game, so saying \"which ever you like the most\" is really appreciated, but unneeded\nTLDR: Pick a champ from the list above or suggest ones that can defend himself the best when being targeted.","replies":[]}
