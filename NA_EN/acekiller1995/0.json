In this case, you may have to perform a [reinstall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).  I recommend reporting this in the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards as well so the client devs can look into it.  You can try updating to the test version again if you want, but can also stick with the legacy client for the time being.","replies":[{"poster":"AceKiller1995","date":"2016-11-25T12:19:36.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this is what I've figured out, I cannot update to the new client. Whenever I do I get that message even after I reinstall. Unless there is a separate installer/launcher for the new client there is no way can use it at it's current state. So all I can do is only use the legacy client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T16:21:17.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds strange that a complete reinstall would still result in this message.
