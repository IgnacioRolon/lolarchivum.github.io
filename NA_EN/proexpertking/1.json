Will there be some type of progress bar to tell me when I'm close to leveling up? I don't really want it to be a surprise kind of thing because I want to get excited and gloat to my friends about how I'm close to being higher honor than just ending a game, possibly a bad one it just popping in my face \"HONOR LEVEL 3! AREN'T YOU JUST SO HAPPY!?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T00:07:16.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment there isn't a way to see how close you are to the next honor level, but a progress bar is definitely something we could add in the future!","replies":[{"poster":"ProExpertKing","date":"2017-07-01T00:55:31.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking it would be cool if you know how the lines appear on the Level 5, that should be the progress bar, it would be a neat way to show progress that fits with the theme instead of just a bar tacted on like experience.","replies":[]}]}]}
