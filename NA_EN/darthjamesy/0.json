I have had it happen a few times now. Always seemed to happen with Neko. Most current I had a 2 star Maokai and 2 star Ivern and 1 star Neko. Sold my neko and still had the 3 woodland and druid buff.

Got a extra Ivern next battle phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-11-14T01:38:39.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did it actually give you the synergies, or was it a visual bug?","replies":[]}]}
