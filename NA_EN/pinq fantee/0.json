It looks like OP was not part of the original AFKer's premade, yet was still inactive long enough to be flagged by the AFK system, and thus received an AFK penalty for the match. Going AFK to await a remake can be an awkward situation if the player reconnects and suddenly the entire team is behind because they were waiting for the remake to go through. This is why the AFK system treats all inactivity equally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2016-07-10T18:51:59.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to be rude, but did you read the post?\n\n>I wasnt premade with this guy and i also didnt afk myself","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Boss4Carrys","date":"2017-09-01T13:17:11.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was playing a ranked game, where i needed to wait about 5 minutes before the game was loaded, then my lol client closed and didn't start up, after starting the client my reconnect button didn't show up so i couldn't reconnect, after trying to restart several times i got the end screen of the game. they remaked. because my client had a bug i lost 20 lp, i think this isn't right, remake is a great way to prevent losses but it shouldn't punish so hard on the afk, it can be something they can't help, if they want to troll they will not let you remake, i think this system needs to be reviewed, i suggest that the penalty will apply after consistently remaking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swift Justice","date":"2017-05-31T07:11:48.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's so stupid btw","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hrbrt","date":"2016-07-10T09:51:39.476+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you sit in fountain and not move you need to actually move or you will be flagged for afk if you sit still and do nothing until the remake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2016-07-10T19:57:52.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey fanteepotje2,\n\nWould it be possible for you to send in a support ticket, I'm wondering about a few details but you'll need someone with access to your account in order to review the information and your account.\n\nIf it is a bug, then it is certainly worth reporting.\n\nhttp://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-612-notes#patch-remake\n\n>  _FOR DIAMOND ONLY_ To prevent abuse of /Remake, Diamond V and above players will take a loss when the dcâ€™d player is in their premade \n\nIf you weren't premade with him this needs to be reviewed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-07-10T08:16:23.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at the game I think multiple players may have been tagged as leaving.
