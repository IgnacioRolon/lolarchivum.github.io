I just came from a game where i had to support a level 3 ashe, myself being a level 27 braum. I notice that this ashe is low level, due to the lack of last hitting, so i semi scold/teach them in a polite way, immediately, i am met with hate from his \"fam\" and they call me racial slurs such as \"niger\" and tell me to \"stfu\". They tell me i am bad, saying that \"theres a reason that i got matched up with a level 3 ashe (in a way dishing on their friend)\" and other nonsense. we win to one teammate carrying, but i couldnt care less. im so confused as to why this game community is so bad. i just needed to vent. Please tell me if youve had any experiences similar to mine. (And i know there is the mute option, but i just cant take some people's stupidity so i further the arguement, as if it were to help.)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-07-16T05:33:32.810+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry you experienced that, doesn't sound fun at all.\nMake sure you're reporting players when this happens.

How is it that more often than not, \"the jerk plaguing everyone\", is at fault and the actions that cause him to be a jerk are more often than not are not at fault?\n\nThis is a double standard that Riot has created with this piss poor reporting system. \n\nIf the reporting system was doing it's job for the afk's, the feeders, the trolls, and whatever else causes a lot of the \"jerks plaguing everyone\", then we would not still be talking about it after all these months.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-07-16T09:10:09.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well then you better \"stfu\" when you dont wanna be reported thats how the world is.","replies":[]}]}
