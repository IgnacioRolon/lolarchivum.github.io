I'm not sure if it's just a coincidence since there have been other issues, mostly from the recent Windows update.  Third party apps can definitely cause some problems with the game and client, especially after a new patch.  I will keep this in mind and look for results.  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Starcall Casey","date":"2016-08-11T20:57:02.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same problem too so it's not just him!

My situation was on my main account loot and crafting would crash every time after I earned a 3rd key fragment starting 8/10. When I log into my smurf it never crashed at all even tho I still had plays.tv open.  Play.tv usually opens once I play a game and today I haven't yet and Icon wasn't open but when open task manager it was running in background. Hope this helps any one trying to get that sweet sweet free stuff!! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tryce Maxwell","date":"2016-08-11T20:14:08.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found this happening to me as well.

As soon as i closed the program everything worked the way it's supposed to.
