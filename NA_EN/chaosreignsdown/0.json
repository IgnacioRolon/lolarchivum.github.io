Good CC and poke if you can hit skill shots. She's not a completely ideal support, and I can see why many people choose supports like Lulu or Sona over her because of her lack of direct supportyness. I would play her mid first before supporting with her, as you'll learn her combos easier that way. Without proper comboing in bot lane, the CC and poke synergy is very  unreliable.
