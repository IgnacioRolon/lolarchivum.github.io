The punishment escalation will only give one 14 day ban and after that the next punishment for any kind of toxicity will result in a permanent ban. The only reason why you would receive a second 14 day ban is if you managed to lower your punishment tier, which, on average, takes around 3 months of actively playing while also showing reformed behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I love Cata","date":"2018-06-07T17:55:05.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"but i know taht i need to get banned 2 times before a perma soo what?","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-06-07T17:57:25.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you reach the 14-day ban your next punishment can be a permanent one.
