It started off with a single rune page then another rune page was corrupted so no matter what runes I place within the page that it will not save. I figured if I bought another page than this will solve my problem but this only made it worse, please help me!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T21:28:25.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue we've been investigating, and seems to happen if you try to rearrange rune pages or give them a special character.
