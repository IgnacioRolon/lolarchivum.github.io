The computer is running windows 10 and has that free trial of Norton that all the new windows machines get.\nI already white-listed league on my firewall.\nI tried  the hextech repair tool.\nI tried stopping the IP Helper service.\nI tried deleting those files from the RADS folder and let league re-patch.\nI tried using windows 10s compatibility mode for both windows 7 and 8.\nAnd league still runs fine on my old windows 7 laptop so I know its not an ISP issue(Bell Canada).\n {{sticker:sg-zephyr}}\nWhat do I do?

Most likely, some firewall blocked a file or two during the download. Great job getting that fixed up!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UniqueHeadress","date":"2017-10-16T20:14:26.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dude you need to be in riot support with that knowledge of a computer\nwould love to help but i dont know the first place to look dude.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
