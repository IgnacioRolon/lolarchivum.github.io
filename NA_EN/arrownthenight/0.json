I finally got moved into my new house and set up the internet, downloaded league on my new laptop and went to join into the game. I'm honestly not sure what happened  bc i went to load into an aram game after \"champion select\" and the game gave me an error. I dont recall the error but it wouldnt let me reconnect to the game. It kept giving me an error. Then I exited the app and tried to open it again, and it acted like league of legends never installed. I reinstalled, and when i logged in, it put me 24 minutes into my aram game. I finished the rest of the game (another 10 minutes or so), apologized to everyone for the errors, and went to join another game. That's when i got a leaverbuster message that said i now have 5 20 minute ques. First off, how do i have 5 of them, secondly why are they 20 minutes? and thirdly, I'm well aware of the policy and when i had to stop playing in the middle of my moving of houses, I had no ques bc i never left games. I've played for nearly 2 years and never had this issue. Can someone please explain? I know they have a \"under no circumstance will we reverse any LPQ's\" but c'mon? there's nothing that can be done here?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T15:26:35.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system won't give you a lower priority queue for just one leave.  I looked into this for you, and found another leave earlier this week with Ekko.  It looks like you only have one game remaining to recover your standing with Leaverbuster, but it's really important to resolve whatever is causing that error to prevent further penalties.  \n\nI don't have a lot to go off of without details on the error, but if it's happening between champion select and reaching the game server, then it could be a connection problem blocking you from making contact.  I recommend going through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your network, and test it in a custom game before anything else.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
