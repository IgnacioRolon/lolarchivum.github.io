I was only able to listen to the games being played and I also missed the beginning of the rebroadcast. I am particularly interested in knowing what the song was about 8 minutes before the broadcast had begun for the pregame leading into game 1. Of course a full list would be fantastic as well. I guess I just need to hope that I can catch another rebroadcast or the VOD hopefully has it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if anyone happens to know what songs were used.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-16T21:11:34.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \n\nA Redditor was kind enough to put together a [playlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3nl7ak/revealing_the_worlds_2015_playlist/) of the music that's been played at Worlds.

I found the song I was looking for. About the only negative was that I had to basically blindly go through the music until I found what I was looking for. Though I found a few more songs that I really liked as well so it certainly was not all bad.\n\nThanks for the info.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-19T18:37:52.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it was kind of a mess.

It would have been nice to know when each piece was used, but all in all I think it worked out for the better as listened to alot of other music scores that were equally impressive to me.\n\nAll in all I did not go home disappointed.
