You can find it [here](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/2017-na-cs-summer-qualifiers).\n\nThe reason you see so little on the tournament itself is because we actually use [Battlegrounds](https://battlegrounds.leagueoflegends.com/na) to host the event. Everything you need should be available on one of those 2 sites, but if you have more questions you can hit me up on Twitter (@RiotIceChest).","replies":[]}]}
