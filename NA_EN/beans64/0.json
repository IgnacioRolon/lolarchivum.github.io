It started when I first go on to the new client, it loaded fine and I could play no problem. But then during a loading screen the game simply crashed and when I quit and re-entered my computer told me there was another instance of league running, despite the fact that nothing came up on the task manager. \r\n\r\nSo I reinstalled league to try and fix it, but to no avail. when loading the new client in the launcher it always either gives me a bugsplat or a unspecified error prompt. The failures happen at roughly 30%, 50% and 99% with either a bugsplat or a unspecified error, no real consistency with the exact when and what of the failure.\r\n\r\nI've tried every trick that the Riot support website and the boards can offer. I've used the hextech repair tool, I've gone into the RADS files and deleted the ones rioters have suggested, I've retried with my firewall down and I've done then all several times. But none of it works.\r\n\r\nPlease help, this is driving me insane.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T17:53:48.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These bugsplats may not necessarily be caused by the client, but driver problems or even corrupt game files.  Installation while updated the client could have gone bad too, but the solution here would be to use the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to make sure your PC is tuned up to game.  Test it out in a custom game.  If it persists than a [reinstall ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/dUzJZibt-i-was-in-promo-client-crash-in-champ-selection)may be necessary.

My PC can handle the game, its done so before without issue. The launcher is where I'm stuck, I used the hextech repair tool to both reinstall the game and force a repatch (I've even done both individualy) . But when the launcher is trying to download the new client it comes up this the errors I mentioned in the original post.\n\nI've looked at and done everything in both the game crash guide and reinstalled the game with the hextech repair tool, but the result is still the same failure in the launcher\n\nThank you at any rate, it's nice to know someone is trying to help","replies":[]}]}]}
