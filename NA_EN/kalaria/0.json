Riot have you considered a dedicated utility stat (buffs/heals/shields)? That way damage supports can either go full damage but have low heals/shields (pyke self heal/ lux crazy shields/ senna stuff) or high utility, or even a hybrid of the two. Perhaps that would open up other lanes to current only supports as well since they could only do one or the other and not high levels of both at the same time or at least readjust some unfavorable supports into making them more viable.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-12-01T05:55:09.821+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heal/shield power?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-12-01T06:28:57.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3222}} ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"XzMln","date":"2019-12-01T10:35:57.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia and her old passive ability to do more damage to shields was great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-01T06:26:26.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh.. this exists?","replies":[]}]}
