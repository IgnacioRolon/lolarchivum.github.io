I have been waiting for a new one for so long now and am happy that it is finally here. I will definitely be buying this on day of release no matter if it is tweaked or not, but I&#039;d like to comment/ask some things about the skin that maybe you guys can provide some insight on.\r\n\r\n_&quot;When we set out to produce a set of 750 skins we try to choose champions and thematics that work with their base effects. In return we can explore more niche themes. If they turn out to be popular I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll see more of them and possibly at a higher tier.&quot;_ -Kindlejack. \r\n\r\n1. Reading this quote I understand how nocturne fits into this theme, he is _the nightmare_ of the rift and his spells are kinda sp00ky, but I&#039;m not sure if the base spell colors of his q and passive/auto attacks really fit the skins color, but that is something I can live with because it&#039;s a 750 rp skin. If anything I&#039;d go for a color change for either of those.\r\n\r\n2. Why didn&#039;t Nocturne get the chance for a higher quality skin? It has been since December 5th, 2012 that he last received a skin, and other than eternum the rest are not considered to be of quality. I can see potential problems with him receiving a higher quality skin because maybe you guys didn&#039;t want to invest so much into him considering his model is getting older and is probably due for a VU in the next year or two, or potentially apart of a future class rework but after that amount of time I would think he&#039;s deserving of a little more love.\r\n3. A few ideas for future skins that Nocturne could fit into thematically! Arcade/Boss Theme, PROJECT theme, **Cosmic Reaver** (please this one), High Noon Theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-04-28T00:56:42.580+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BurningRice thanks for loving Nocturne the way I do! I still like to bust him out now and then even though I feel like Rek'sai overshadowed him for much of 2015. I'm wondering how/if the latest jungle item changes will affect him.\n\n1. Nocturne's base skills are super old and tough to work with. The passive, E and R are black and red while his Q and W are blue and they all look very very... dated. I think the optimum word in that quote there is \"try\" because with janky old spells like his we do our best but I can understand how they still aren't as good as they could be at mid-tier.\n\n2. You're right; Nocturne already has an excellent legendary skin, a number of older skins and is in need of a VU - these all impact our decisions for new skins.\n\n3. Given the opportunity I agree, Cosmic Reaver is my number one choice for a future Nocturne skin!","replies":[{"poster":"BurningRice","date":"2016-05-01T23:22:38.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply and your insight on these 3 points, Kindlejack!","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-05-02T17:42:51.363+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for asking!
