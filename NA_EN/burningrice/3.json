Let's Not Forget Nocturne! @RiotScruffy @RiotRepertoir","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I&#039;ve seen many posts about champion passives with feedback from Rioters. (Ty Meddler, Scruffy, Repertoir, and other rioters for taking part in listening and discussing the ideas that have been brought up on the boards) \r\n\r\nThis post will be about our friend Nocturne. Over the season a couple of champions have received updates so that their passives reduce in cooldown at later levels in the game. Evelynn, Aatrox and Shen all received this sort of update which caused Evelynn and Shen to be more popular picks as of late. Nocturne could use this type of change as well. Currently Nocturne&#039;s passive cooldown is 10 seconds at all levels. What if his passive reduced in cooldown to 10/9/8 at levels 1/7/13?\r\n\r\nThese changes would be done in a similar fashion as Shen&#039;s passive change from 9s at all levels to 9/8/7 at levels 1/7/13. Thoughts ?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-11T17:43:43.641+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible something like this is due for Nocturne. He does buy some Attack Speed, and gains some per level like everyone else, so his passive does technically scale with game time / level due to attacks lowering his passive's cooldown, but maybe it's just not enough at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-08-11T17:50:08.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if you are the guy to ask about this but for Champions with cooldown reducing abilities like Xin Q, Shen passive, and Nocturne passive. Why doesn't the new HUD have a \"refresh\" effect when proced. I liked having that visual refresh when playing a champion like that the old HUD had, this should be added again for clarity.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-11T18:53:00.981+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it did, and maybe it was just much subtler, though I could be wrong and maybe that was previous iterations. If it's not there, my guess would be visual noise/distraction, not that that's necessarily the right reason. It's certainly more important for some champions than others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gaby1best","date":"2015-08-11T19:27:44.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about his AA animation?

So technically he can have half the attack speed as nocturne and reduce his passive in the same time. \n\nIt's awesome that you are taking time to get involved and have discussion with people on the boards. Whether something does or doesn't come from this post, thanks for your feedback. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-08-11T18:51:10.761+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, Nocturne needs a better identity.
