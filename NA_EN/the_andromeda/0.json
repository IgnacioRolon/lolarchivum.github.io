Configuring your DNS was a good start, though it's not a bad idea to rule out most possibilities by going through each step of that guide.  As an additional step, try our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).  It has an option to auto-configure your firewall settings in case that's the cause of this.\n\nIf that fails, grab the logs from the HRT and reach out to us via support@riotgames.com.  This can work as an alternative to making a ticket.
