The second is, to borrow a phrase from the late, great, Douglas Adams&hellip; Don&rsquo;t Panic.\r\n\r\nThe perception you&rsquo;re getting of Viktor is largely from Jayce&rsquo;s bio, and if ever there was an unreliable narrator, it&rsquo;s him. Sure, from Jayce&rsquo;s point of view, Viktor might seem like a complete and utter psychopath, bereft of a moral compass and utterly devoid of humanity. But what of Viktor&rsquo;s point of view? Might what&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s doing be entirely misrepresented? Might there be a good reason behind it (even if what he&rsquo;s doing might be - from outside perspectives - be seen as reprehensible?).\r\n\r\nThe reaction is also likely coming from people reading about the place Camille visits in her short story, but I can imagine Viktor&rsquo;s response to seeing what those people are doing in his name&hellip; I can imagine him being incensed at this perversion of his grand philosophy, this naive, quasi-religious cult that has grown around his ideas and which has - to him - woefully misinterpreted his vision. Viktor plays the long game and knows that greatness cannot be achieved without cost. Does that make him evil? Perhaps to the folk who pay the price initially, but what of the folks who&rsquo;ll reap the benefit in the long run? What will history say of Viktor? That&rsquo;s the legacy Viktor is concerned with, not the fragile, emotional and short-sighted people around him.\r\n\r\nSo, no, we absolutely don&rsquo;t want to paint Viktor as a pantomime villain, twirling his metal mustache, but nor do we want to turn away from the dark deeds he&rsquo;s doing in the name of his Glorious Evolution. When Viktor&rsquo;s bio lands, it&rsquo;ll provide balance to the perception. Will it reveal the truth? Well, it&rsquo;ll reveal Viktor&rsquo;s truth, and the reality will likely lie somewhere in the middle. Perhaps shrouded by a fug of the Gray, but, hey, that&rsquo;s Zaun for you&hellip;\r\n\r\nDinopawz","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-09T18:18:21.711+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for popping down Graham, it's always good to have you guys around and I think the very notion of you guys just coming her to help reassure the populace is very much a positive thing. \n\nI'm also wondering if you're the one who's the primary writer for Viktor with his updated lore.

Reconsider the lore update!\n\n^ Yes, all of this. I have lost faith in Riot's ability to write champion's lore respectfully since the Burning Tides update where they turned Graves into a stupid blundering oaf with no actual reasoning for his blinding drive for vengeance. Instead, they painted him out to be responsible for his own failings and gave TF a medal of Honor. Their history with destroying characterization and just throwing in generic tropes is honestly very poor. It looks like the lore team puts 0 effort into their characters and just tries to look up the most stereotypical plot devices and motivations; and don't get me started on targonian champions. \n\nSo yeah, us Viktor fans have a reason for being worried, because Riot's track record is full of nothing but disappointment, even from the get-go. I just don't see how you can justify Viktor even with his own lore and still keep him in the gray area. It seems pretty obvious in your response that you want him to be the \"tragic villain\" or at least the sympathetic one, but still a villain. Just because he doesn't see himself as one and is still doing bad things for what he believes is the \"greater good\" doesn't mean we won't recognize what he's doing is wrong. What made Viktor great was that he wasn't forcing his views on anyone and never did anything hurtful to anyone. The driving point for Viktor's desire to create the Glorious Evolution was his own crippling self-loathing and hopelessness to not be able to stop or get back his stolen intellectual property.  It was this driving desire to better himself that lead him to such a drastic plan. He internalized everything and started working on **himself** rather than anybody else.  I hope this is addressed in his new lore, because so far the idea we are presented is that he always wanted to remove free will from humans even before he had this breakthrough. \n\nAt this point I'm kind of convinced Riot doesn't really care about lore too much, since they do such a shoddy job with it. Instead, turning well rounded characters with motivations and ambitions into lame 1 dimensional tropes with lazy story telling. When Riot released their plans to ret-con everything and still have yet to clean up all the holes they made, I lost 100% faith in them and knew Viktor would get the short end of the stick. But what do they care? They separated gameplay from lore anyway, and they could care less if their fanbase likes the champions' lore or not, as long as they still play the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-09T21:00:42.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's not trying to kill Jayce for disagreeing.

I hope this is more than a hipfire post, because your reassurance post implies that there really COULD be a conversation to be had, here.\n\nLet me preface by saying; I understand that fans asking(/demanding) Viktor's character to BE what they see him as is pretty obsessive. And probably something of a joke between you guys. ( ;p )\n\nBut you're very subtly deconstructing the perception of a character who is utterly **beguiling**.\n\nThe Jayce narrative doesn't paint a picture of perception. It paints 2 or 3 \"Hrm,so those dead bodies **weren't** killed by him//**For the EVOLUTION!**\" Viktor personality traits - even before Vik's own transformation. It paints Viktor as the desperate scientist who turned himself into a robot to escape death; rather than the depressed academic **who rent his own flesh to prove his worth**.\n\nSo there are a few lines in your post:\n\n* \"Might there be a good reason behind it (even if what he’s doing might be - from outside perspectives - be seen as reprehensible?).\"\n* \"Viktor plays the long game and knows that greatness cannot be achieved without cost. Does that make him evil? Perhaps to the folk who pay the price initially\"\n* \"What will history say of Viktor? That’s the legacy Viktor is concerned with, not the fragile, emotional and short-sighted people around him.\"\n* \"[we do not] want to turn away from the dark deeds he’s doing in the name of his Glorious Evolution\"\n\n**This is EXACTLY what the vocal fanbase was worrying about, Dino!!** :P\n\nViktor was never interesting because of a **[\"Justified Dark Deeds\"]** philosophy. He was interesting because he began so innocent, idealistic and naive. He was interesting because the contrast of what he became - at least in the eyes of others - was so stark to the man he once was. The most human of all of us; crippled by his emotion, discredited by his idealism, denied the support of those he'd supported.\n\nHe withdrew from his life; leaving everything he ever worked for behind. And he turned his research on himself. He became obsessed with redemption - maybe even revenge - but that's not how it turned out.\n\nWhile replacing his body and organs, Viktor had an **Epiphany**.  This wasn't just about him. No - the implications were societal in scope; maybe even global. His obsession for redemption may still have persisted; but if it did, it was funnelled into an obsession to change the world. And when this obsession reached the eyes of the public, it was worrying; maybe even **frightening.**\n\nViktor - if not because of his change, then certainly because of his isolation - spoke differently. He spoke fervently. Of the future; of potential - like a damn street preacher. People flocked to him and accepted his message. They became MACHINES; and they started *worshipping* him as the \"Machine Herald\" (whether he acknowledged it or not).\n\n---\n\n#What I Projected onto Post-Transformation Viktor\n\n---\n\n(bias ahead)\n\nOriginal Viktor painted a picture of a man slowly losing human traits - piece by piece. Isolated and left to his own devices, even post-transformation. Driven by ideals that noone else comprehends. Driven by a vision that is preached as salvation.\n\nViktor could bend. Viktor could twist -his personality had _already_ done so in the past. And though he'd not done anything 'bad' yet, his personality and ideals were shifting day by day. He could be a philanthropist one day; and a hand of his own perception of \"Justice\", the next. He could offer \"salvation\" one moment, then punish those who doubt his vision by leaving them to rot in their slums and die.\n\nViktor could be \"transcending\" human morality and government. Not necessarily for the better. And with a \"cult\" on his side, he would have unconditional moral support for any choices he made.\n\nStealing Jayce's crystal? This could have worked, were it not for the fact that Vik apparently already had a huge facility + following, completely functional and was his FIRST \"bad guy\" act (it just straight-up felt weird to invade people in foreign cities while trying to display the merits of Evolution, y'know? :P).\n\n----\n\n#So what's the problem with the direction of New Viktor?\n\n-----\n\nNew Viktor is an entirely different character. He has different ideals, a different personality and spends his time studying in Piltover:\n\n* New Viktor begins his story obsessed with human evolution. That right there takes away from the humanity and idealism contrast that was see in early Viktor's old lore.\n* New Viktor has a very obviously closed mind; focused on his perception and potential. (\"My future is the RIGHT answer!\") Selfish > selfless.\n* New Viktor is kicked out of the scientific community for being too evil. Seriously? :P\n* New Viktor commits his amoral Jayce confrontations BEFORE his transformation (having a human being bad; but a robot being passive and good is not fun. We want him being morally grey LATER. **Practical Example**: Battlecast Universe. We LIKE future \"evil\" speculation.)\n* New Viktor would KILL Jayce, as a man, just to keep things tidy. Unless the perspective twist, here, is something like:\n\n{{champion:112}}  **\"Nuh uh, I said DON'T kill him! Jayce just misheard me that's the twist!\"**\n\n* New Viktor also doesn't seem particularly (originally) interested in justice or philanthropic endeavours. This is compounded by the fact that Zaun is no longer where he studies (might still be where he grows up, though). He's no longer a \"good egg in a bad basket\" - he's just a cracked egg that makes robots; and may crack a little more as time goes on.\n\n---\n\n#Closing Thoughts\n\n---\n\nThe Machine Herald and the Creator are two distinct personalities - working in tandem one day; and opposition, the next.\n\nThe first, a promise of a future that he has envisioned and obsesses over, daily; \nThe Second, a machinist whose designs will saturate the world - for better or worse.\n\nViktor should be one part deep philosophy, one part questionable motives. He does not need to be killing Jayce to justify a rivalry. The mere fact that he outfits his machinations with weaponry could be frightening, enough. In fact, you could even use the 'free will' argument here!\n\n{{champion:112}} \"Their weapons will primarily be tools for self defense. When threatened by physikal force, they will gain akcess to their arsenal; exklusively for nonlethal purposes.\"\n{{champion:126}}  \"You just EXPECT them to not go on a rampage when threatened? What if they're threatened by a thunderstorm?!\"\n{{champion:112}} \"Of Kourse not. They will be unable to intentionally kill another human or machine. Choices to do so will be overwritten.\"\n{{champion:126}}  \"You're... you're messing with their free will?\"\n{{champion:112}} \"I am restrikting only the use of lethal force. It is a kondition for akcess to these upgrades. Other kognitive processes shall remain intakt. The organic mind makes mistakes. We must strive to limit the scope and reach of these mistakes. The augmented are, after all, not quite so **frail **as your kind.\"\n\n--\n\nViktor needs to be frightening for the POTENTIAL things he will do. He needs to be less \"cold\" and logical; and more \"luke-warm\" and logical. He should care. He should think, deeply - his vision, after all, relies on his introspective thoughts; and he can think faster and more deeply than any biological human (super processing!)\n\nHE knows he will not take away free will. HE knows that this is limited to a super-weapons agreement.\n\n... But we _**don't.**_\n\nThis is the kind of misunderstood Viktor I would like to see; and **not** one who exclusively performs 'dark deeds', \"for the greater good\". Seeking to improve society through stealing, smashing, killing and generally causing chaos isn't, after all, the trait of misunderstood innovator. A *child* can grasp the crazy in that worldview - there's nothing ambiguous about it at all. :P\n\nViktor **should** do questionable things - but there should be more tact involved than Doctor Doom super-villain tropes. His positions should be much more thought out than Jayce's. His ideals should be much more refined, than his detractors. He could make mistakes; and resolve to improve his thinking - sometimes simply refining a once immoral (or amoral) idea so as to mesh better with human society. This, alone, has fantastic story implications. Imagine the Free will Argument above, only AFTER Viktor had already tried tying weapons to panic.\n\nJayce is afraid that Viktor's stubborn attempts to provide his followers with weaponry will cause *another* Augmented citizen to go on a massacre; but if Viktor's design truly IS flawless, then what he says is completely feasible. Most notably of all - those equipped with the weapons have agreed to his terms.\n\nJayce **is** in the wrong. But he is RIGHT to be afraid of the consequences of this kind of manipulation.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryusaether","date":"2016-12-10T10:20:12.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything you wrote in here, like in the other threads.\n\nIn my opinion, removing his bond with Blitz and the betrayal of Pididly (at least in this Jayce POV lore, that part should be in Viktor's) is not a good thing. \n\nSummarizing things up, I think Viktor should be a Zaunite, maybe they can make him work in Piltover with Jayce like in Jayce's lore, but I think he should quit for the same motivations as the old lore, because he worked on Blitz, didn't get the honors and abandoned the academy, not because he got expelled for amoral viewpoints, it's o cliché I can't even tell.\n\nThus he could have passed his time isolated in Zaun, seeking for revenge but repressing it with his new program: The Glorious Evolution. \nNot having founds and support by the scientist world, he could have been forced to stole things like the Crystal fron Jayce's lab. Here, maybe in his Prototype Form, with some followers, could have still ordered to attack/immobilize (and maybe even kill, assuming he's still partially human) Jayce, after offering him to join his side. \n\nAfter the Evolution, I always seen him as a preacher in Zaun, spreding his movement and his designs and gaining consenses and followers, thus making him scary for people who don't understand his reasons.\nHe can still be seen as a villain, he can even be one in the future, but at least not a flat 1D man that justifies his actions with a \"greater good\" motive. That was the fashion of the character, in my opinion.\n\nBtw, I like Viktor still intended as a Villain, I don't see him giving weapons just for self-defense, but still without suppressing other's free will and only \"helping\" those who ask him reaching the perfection of machines. And I think, if he should have aa purpose to stay in the league, this should be the spread of the \"Glorious Evolution\" verb, and maybe not force too muche the rivalry between him and Jayce (just my 2 cents).\n\nThx for posting this and eventually reading my comment.\n\nP.S.: Please give our Herald a cool skin, it's 3 years he doesn't receive some love ","replies":[{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2016-12-10T14:05:46.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe Viktor has the potential to be that character that can switch between hero and villain to suit the narrative. CLOSE to the way an anti-villain operates, but not quite there in most situations.\n\nHe could just \"show up\" during events (even foreign ones), with his own motivations or goals - often conflicting or offering aid to the protagonists of a story. And it wouldn't *feel* weird, because we can't quite grasp his thought process; or end goals. His vision for the future clashes with religion and philosophy and government, while his vision for humanity might step on the toes of those who stand to make a profit from (or are otherwise negatively impacted by) him.\n\nBut that's just what **I** think; and I'm sort've biased when it comes to including Viktor in things. =p\n\nI will actually confess that I LIKE the new reasons for VIktor stealing Jayce's crystal. With no lab, he has no power. To test his designs, he needs what Jayce has got. Were it not handled so awkwardly - and did it not step on his old lore so hard - I would've loved it.\n\nBut I feel his personality is more important than a reorganisation of events to justify a theft that noone thought made sense in the original version. :P\n\nI think lots of us are okay with Viktor going bad; just so long as he has that \"can be redeemed\" factor. Just so long as he feels like he has been executed with the same depth his old lore implied of him.\n\nAnd I really hope Riot has given (or gives) us a chance to convey this to them, before Viktor's new lore is set in stone.\n\n((I also would KILL for a new Viktor skin.

His lore, Artwork and Skillset are what made me install this game, and I really hope Riot gives Viktor justice in his lore, because Jayce/Piltover's POV didn't satisfy me as I thought. The main points that trigger me are the uncertainty of his origins (I want him as a Zaunite like before), the expulsion thing (it was better when he forfeited because he felt demotivated and powerless facing a corrupted world), the absence of the Blitzcrank Creation and his new repression of the free will, which was one of his objectives, that he would have reached through his evolution.\n\nI really hope rioters read these comments and understand our point.

I'm certain you've seen the poll on reddit - 90% of people don't want Viktor as a villain.\n\nIf Viktor does a single wrong thing, he looses his gray morality. He becomes a villain through and through. A sympathetic villain, but still a villain. Like Xerath. Xerath killed thousands of people in the city, cackling doing so. And your description of Xerath is that \"he also has his point of view\". Now you say the exact same thing for Viktor. Not to mention that you intend to make his new lore from his perspective, instead of it being subjective like his original one.\n\nWhat made us love this character was the fact that he turned on himself out of anger, desperation and hopelessness. He proudly created the first free-willed robot in the world, who was meant to clean Zaun. This person is not gone from the Machine Herald. Don't erase this person.\nHe looks scary, but he never did anything wrong. That's the catch. He looks like somebody who would, but his greatest crime up to now was a theft of a crystal. As one of my friends said, up until now, his bodycount was 0! A 0! This is very important!\n\nAnd a part of my comment from elsewhere:\n\n> This is the point of my post: there are concrete points that can be drawn from Viktor's original lore. This brand new Jayce's lore steps on many of them, altering Viktor's personality drastically. And I'm not even talking about the corpses with their scalps sawed and skulls hollowed out. This can be revealed from Viktor's perspective to be different, but here are the points that cannot be altered by perspective:\n\n>Viktor working for Piltover means he never got the chance to fall into depression and have the moment of epiphany. The new lore also has Viktor explaining about his glorious evolution and augmenting other people even before he went into depression. This destroys his character in every way. This means that he always wanted to remove free will, that he didn't start the evolution on himself as a way of self-improvement, and that he never experienced the character-altering hopelessness after Blitzcrank got stolen.\n\n>Now if we remember his original lore, in it it is very clearly shown, and very important, that he was a naive student in Zaun who got his ideas and inventions stolen. This caused him to fall into depression. He didn't give up though, and he rebuilt himself. So the point of the evolution in the original lore is completely different than the one in the new lore. His motives are changed, even if he in his eventual new lore doesn't appear as villainous as he did in Jayce's.\n\n\nEdit: I know I sound angry, panicked, harsh. I swear, I am only scared. I can't stress enough how this character is slipping into the villain zone without anyone even noticing. Of course he isn't going to be a cartoon villain! But this just means that he'll likely be turned into a \"villain with a tragic backstory\". This is still a villain, not a gray character. Readers will say \"aww poor him\", but then they'll nonchalantly still want him to loose.\n\nEdit2: Blitzcrank is **very** important in Viktor's lore. **Pididly **as well, as the thief of Viktor's plans and creations. I've written somewhere... that having your intellectual property stolen, versus being expelled from a foreign academy because your friends was a snitch, have drastically different effects on the character. The first pushes Viktor into desperation and hopelessness. The second can only cause a need for revenge.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2016-12-12T04:06:40.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know I'm a bit late to this, I didn't see this post until I saw it off of Surrender@20.\n\nAnyway, I'm going to take a bit of a risk here, and say that you, 333lom, in particular, are reading WAY too much into just 2 paragraphs of outdated lore.\n\nI am not saying that everything you have said thus far doesn't make any sense, or doesn't hold any merit. In fact, I've been quite impressed with what you've done so far, essentially leading a small revolution over this entire ordeal.\n\nHowever, I believe that the amount of work you have put into this has also skewed your vision. You've become so engrossed with so little lore, that you've developed a picture of Viktor in your mind, that, no matter what happens with him, no matter what Riot does with his lore, you will be disappointed in the outcome unless Riot follows your picture of him to the letter.\n\nAnd you're not the only one either. There are quite a few people on these boards that also looked WAY too much into WAY too little of lore. Do you honestly think that a character as complex as the Viktor you have imagined, or the Viktor that Riot has in store, could be summed up in just 2 paragraphs? I mean, it took an entire short story just to sum up Jayce, of whom is really nothing more than an egotiscal jerk.\n\nIf you let go of this vision of yours, and actually wait and see what Riot has in store for Viktor, you may be pleasantly surprised with what they bring to the table. If you were to remove everything that simply points towards Viktor, could you say that you are not impressed with what has come out? I mean, look at the story The Weakest Heart in its entirety.....not just the Glorious Evolved. It is a fantastically written story, that dives into everything that is Camille; her past, her present, the situations she deals with, and the decisions that make her who she is.\n\nIn fact, every champion bio and short story that has been released with the Universe website has been nothing short but AMAZING.\n\nAnd yet, here you are trying to defend your vision of a character that was developed from almost nothing from a couple years ago. And this is why I fear that no matter what happens.....you'll be disappointed in the outcome. Even your line \"If Viktor does a single wrong thing, he looses his gray morality.\" blatantly tells me that you won't accept anything that isn't your vision. \n\nIn my opinion, I'm honestly excited about what Riot has in store for Viktor, for that one part where he orders his robots to kill Jayce, I felt there was some hesitation in his order, as if we weren't getting the full picture of why he just order his robots to do that. That points to something more than just a villain.\n\nI apologize if I came off as rude or dismissive, but I don't think there was any way to sugar coat this.

I'd even argue the new lore might be rich in detail and emotion(?) but when it comes to cohesion, logic and point, it's a downgrade.\n\nAs a professional comic book creator, I am not a layman when it comes to character manipulation and storytelling. There are a few things form Jayce's lore that cannot be changed with a different point of view. One of them is Viktor having ideas that got him expelled from the Piltovian academy. Me not liking him being pointlessly pushed into Piltover aside, here we see a change of the core of a character, and that's why so many people are disappointed. My sentence \"if he does a single thing wrong (...)\" is a bit clumsily written, but it means that there are crimes which, if a character commits, they are irredeemable.\n\nDon't worry, you didn't come off as rude.

So take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.\n\nThe big problem - the thing that I think really killed the \"maybe Jayce is just wrong\" argument - was the issue of free will.\n\nFirst, the diving suit. Someone pointed out that this could potentially be part of a lore update for Nautilus, which in that light does sound intriguing and cool, but keep in mind this event occurs before any notion of the 'Glorious Evolution' has entered Viktor's head. Vikky and Jay make a suit for the dock workers that is essentially a diving suit, and it works great. Then Viktor proposes an additional chemtech device that would strip the user of their free will, and treats it as a betrayal when Jayce goes to their superiors and it gets him fired.\n\nThen, in exile from Piltover, he takes the brains out of people and turns them into robots that obey his every command. He literally made the cybermen from Doctor Who. This is capital E cartoon Evil.\n\nAnd then in Jayce's story we see that Viktor sent more mind-slave chemically enhanced cannon fodder to kill Jayce.\n\nNow, if it were any one of these events alone or presented a little differently, I could believe Viktor had a psychotic break, made a mistake, or even that some of the people involved were actually willing. Viktor's charm came from thew fact that he saw his desire for revenge as a weakness and attempted to expunge it, so I could see him initially making the mistaking of following through on it. But this whole sequence of events together paints the picture of a man who has no concern for the well-being or free will of others. He's set out to \"fix the world\" in the same manner that psychotic super villains in bad comic books do.\n\nOn top of that, in Jayce's bio we get a brief moment where we see into Viktor's head. That implies that - even if Jayce isn't completely reliable - he's at least paying enough attention that the general events herein are correct.\n\nHaving a villain that thinks they're doing the right thing doesn't make them morally ambiguous or interesting in and of itself, especially if you can't see it their way. It's true that there's no such thing as mustache-twirling cartoon villains, but that doesn't just mean 'lol he thinks it's okay lol'.

That's a very interesting element to introduce imo, given Viktor's whole shtick is built around the same idea that people cannot change on their own.\n\n---\n\nConsider this possibility, sans assassination attempt: Viktor goes back to his lab after Jayce beats him. He screams in rage, smashes some stuff, general pathetic 'IM SO EVIL' shit. After a while, he sits down and stews on his revenge. He thinks of all the myriad ways that he's going to hurt Jayce, destroy Piltover, tear down all the short-sighted fools to shreds and make them regret ever pushing him into Zaun. He makes plans, prepares, gathers resources...\n\n... Then he stops.\n\n{{champion:112}} : ...What then?\n\nHe has no answer.\n\nHe calms down, sits down, and thinks.\n\nEven if he succeeded in bringing Piltover to its knees - which by his own calculations was not likely - what would he do? The city of progress would be utterly devastated. Though it betrayed him and he hated the city for it, he still thought the ideals of Piltover were the way to go: Progress, innovation, new ideas and testing grounds. If he destroyed the city, that would lead to a massive destruction of the ideas the city was advocating. And what of other cities? What of Zaun, or Noxus? He'd lived in the hextech cities long enough to know that if Piltover was destroyed, Zaun would carve up everything that they could; no one would be safe from their vengeance. Noxus would invade for Hextech, and they would only be interested in how it could be used for war.\n\nHe throws his emotions aside for a moment and considers his previous actions. They were not driven by a passion for science, but by zeal, anger, desperation... and now a need for vengeance.\n\nHe comes to the same epiphany in his old lore: that this emotional response, this desire to get back at Jayce and Piltover... it's illogical, a weakness. A very human weakness, but a weakness nonetheless. But even though he knows it's the wrong move, he can't help but think of how sweet it would be to destroy the city that shunned him and the friend that betrayed him.\n\nHe can't change by force of will. And so he lets go of his anger by mechanical know-how. He augments himself and becomes the machine herald, turning that zeal for progress to a useful purpose.\n\n----\n\nIn this way, Viktor is given actual examples in his own life of how emotional responses and a desire for revenge fucked him over, personally. And this time, he rejects it. He grows as a person through the Glorious Evolution, and seeks to help others do the same.\n\nJayce, of course, doesn't buy it for the same reason we're not buying the new lore: his experience with Viktor showed a vile, horrid man. He didn't make any mistakes, he was just evil. And as we saw in his short story, he doesn't think people can change. So as far as he's concerned, Viktor isn't morally grey because he's already seen him be morally black.\n\nThe two both believe that people cannot change on their own, that technology is the way to go, and that the ideals of Piltover are worth pursuing.
