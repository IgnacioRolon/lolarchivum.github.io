It always lasts until the last few seconds before the start so people try to have someone else leave (showing how common it is that people dodge). What compounds the issue is when you load into a champion you really like and are excited to play in ARAM just to have a dodge and your next game is a champion you abhor. \r\n\r\nI don't know if the temporary game disable counts down in game or IRL. If its IRL and people ignore the penalty thinking they'll just play something else then it's entirely ineffective. If it already is in game time I don't know a solution to propose but with how rampant abandoned games are it makes ARAM really frustrating and not enjoyable.","replies":[{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2015-01-16T13:46:26.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodging should just permanently lock the dodger's champion choice for next time he plays.\nGot Udyr and dodged? Next on ARAM you get Udyr without being able to use rerolls or trades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aww Kat","date":"2015-01-16T13:41:00.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think dodging in general needs a harsher punishment","replies":[]}]}
