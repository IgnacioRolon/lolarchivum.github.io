It's on the new Mac OS, High Sierra 10.13, I've never had any issue, but at this point, the games just unplayable. I give up 1-2 free kills everygame due to this and I don't know why. I've tried deleting, reinstalling, restarting, everything. Anyone know what could be the cause of this?","replies":[{"poster":"Deltora","date":"2017-10-27T21:22:03.835+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experiencing the same thing since last patch. I went through the Riot Support loop and they pretty much told me it's my fault for upgrading to the most recent OS and to fix it I have to revert back to the old OS.... fkn ridiculous if you ask me! It doesn't happen to me every single game but it happens a few times a day for me. Very annoying. Sets me super far back if it happens more than once. It always happens in the first 5-10minutes when farming and being in lane is actually important. A company like Riot that supports Mac should be able to support the most recent OS! I've steered clear of ranked games because it's not worth the risk. sigh","replies":[{"poster":"nitou7","date":"2017-11-16T18:54:10.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deltora,realm=OCE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Gzx3pEkQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-10-27T21:22:03.835+0000)\n>\n> Riot Support loop and they pretty much told me it&#x27;s my fault for upgrading to the most recent OS and to fix it I have to revert back to the old OS.... fkn ridiculous if you ask me! \n\nyou want malware, because that's how you get malware riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marsterymar","date":"2017-10-28T14:18:25.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me.
