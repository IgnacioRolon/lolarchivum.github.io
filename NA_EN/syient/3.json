There's actually a toggle in the Interface options to enable Show Neutral Camps on the minimap.  Is that checked?  If it is but without success then your settings may be corrupt and not syncing to our servers.  In this case try resetting your config:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nI hope that helps!
