Grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and run a clean reinstall to get that fixed up.  \n\nThe language filter might not be toggling as a result of corrupt modifications, so your settings aren't processing.  Resetting your config should fix it up:\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nKeep in mind that performing the HRT refresh shouldn't alter your config, so you'll have to perform the above process after.  Let me know if that does the trick for both issues.","replies":[]}]}
