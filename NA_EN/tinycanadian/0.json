For like, the last 4 days randomly league would freeze or lag. My ping would be fine and so would my FPS but occasionally my champ will just stand there for a good 5-10 seconds and do nothing. After, it'll unfreeze and I'd either be dead and everything suddenly speeds up... For example, minions are still attacking but their health doesn't move, and when I'm done lagging/freezing then it zooms down speedy quick and the minions are suddenly low.\n\n**Reminder, it's not ping lag spikes when this happens, my FPS and Ping couldn't be better whenever this happens. It'll happen when I have 80 ping and like 52 FPS. **\n\nI dont know what's going on but it's making it entirely frustrating to play, rito pls ):\n\n\nPS. Occasionally I have been getting randomly high ping too, but it's not as much of as issue as this. Common, but not as common as the issue I'm asking about. At least with ping lag spikes I know it's ping lag spikes, I don't know whats going on here???","replies":[{"poster":"mysterious eye","date":"2016-01-31T21:51:52.052+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

The screen is not freezing but only my champion.The ping and FPS was normal will it happens,my roommate has the same problem. I think its problem is even worse than normal lagging, because after normal lagging everything happens very fast,you might find you already dead.When this happens you have to watch your champion go straight into their turret but you cant do anything.

But to completely ignore such a devastating problem for players seems kind of rude.\n\nGot a new laptop as of last Christmas -- a good one. When on my home wifi my ping is fantastic at 36, fps around 100. But I've gotten these weird non-ping/fps related lag spikes at least 4 times today. Only got out alive for 2 of them. Tried so many things to fix it, but regardless I still get it several times a day. \n\nIt also takes like 30 seconds for me to join the lobby after I've finished a game, which makes no sense considering my connection is great. This happens every single game. Wondering if maybe there's some kind of relation? Ironically, when I was in school where the wifi is garbage at times, this never happened. So not sure if the problem is on my end here at home or on LOL's end.

Essentially, packet loss is something that happens when parts of your connection get lost or damaged when it's on its way to our servers. Without all of that data, some pretty weird stuff starts happening like your champion not responding to your commands immediately. There's not a whole lot we can typically do about packet loss on our end since it happens before it hits our servers.\n\nGrab the network logs from that game if possible, and have this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them really quick so we can check for any packet loss. If you can, post a screenshot of what it shows you afterward and I can take a look with you!","replies":[{"poster":"PickTank Not Lux","date":"2017-10-02T19:57:56.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your response.
