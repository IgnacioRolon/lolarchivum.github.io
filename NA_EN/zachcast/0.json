Last ranked game I lost I single-handedly got 7 towers. I have experience playing with and against every champion. I can switch to any role and play at a minimum of gold level. Been told my mechanics are top notch. (beaten Diamonds mid-lane). \n\nWeaknesses: Could work on warding as soon as trinket comes up. I tend to roam a little too much if I think lanes are losing, causing me to occasionally lose lane tower while out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shangdi","date":"2015-01-30T22:59:52.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: ImTryingToLearn\n\nTimezone: Central CST\n\nCurse?: Yes\n\nRank: Gold 2\n\nRole: Midlane\n\nBest Champions in order: Ahri, Xerath, Leblanc, Syndra, Azir, Zed\n\nExperience in Ranked 5v5's: Multiple teams, have shotcalled and captained a team before.\n\nStrengths: Good mechanics, Game knowledge, Good innate synergy, Solid communication\n\nWeaknesses: Tend to focus on my lane and only roam when asked, also very aggressive (can be good or bad)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordDarkshayde","date":"2015-01-30T22:29:26.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: LordDarkshayde\n\nTimezone: EST\n\nCurse: Yes\n\nRank: Currently Silver 4 (Hopefully higher very soon)\n\nRole: Mid\n\nBest Champions in Order: {{champion:268}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:131}} \n\nExperience in Ranked 5v5s: I've joined teams in the past but they never stuck together for more than a few matches.\n\nStrengths: Counterpicking, Pushing my opponent out of lane, Decent shot calling on objectives.\n\nWeaknesses: My warding could use some work.","replies":[]}]}
