You should be able to resolve this if you force the patcher to complete the upgrade again. To do this, we'll first need you to hop into the following directory: \n\n> **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system**\n\n> - Open user.cfg with notepad\n> - Change the line that says **leagueClientOptIn = yes** to **leagueClientOptIn = no** and then save the changes and close the file\n> - Set League to \"[**Run as Administrator**](http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/how-run-programs-as-administrator-in-windows-10-3632744/)\"\n> - Go to **(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)** and delete the **LeagueClient.exe** file.\n> - Launch League and select the Upgrade option\n> - Update and patch the new client\n\nLet me know if this worked for you. ^.^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clews","date":"2017-02-13T01:12:51.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found a fix on reddit and confirmed it by myself to work when done correctly. make sure to click upgrade to beta client while patching.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5n1agx/cant_use_new_client_any_help_please/dc7ys0o/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clews","date":"2017-02-13T00:46:56.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same exact issue.
