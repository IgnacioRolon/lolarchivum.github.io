If you don't deserve a loss for an afk, you don't deserve a win for an afk either. \n\nSee how it works, now? They rely on the random chance that an enemy will afk just as often as an ally to even it out. Because the only actually fair alternative is to make every game with an afk completely void.","replies":[{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2019-03-23T05:35:48.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all I am seeing is your sensibilities, that's not an argument... nor will it change mine.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-03-24T05:51:22.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Boatwhistle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Agmye8e1,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2019-03-23T05:35:48.422+0000)\n>\n> all I am seeing is your sensibilities, that's not an argument... nor will it change mine.\n\nI was giving you the mirror to see the other side of it. You didn't provide an argument, just your side. So I'm explaining to you why it wouldn't work-- because saying the team with the afk doesn't deserve the loss means you have to also accept that the winning team didn't deserve the win.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ßurst","date":"2019-03-23T04:12:28.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this would be exploitable i think the best thing to do is just make a vote for the afk team if they all vote yes then the loss gets prevented for them but not for the afk.

Making the loss apply to duo partners removes the exploit hence the response.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
