Lethality provides less damage than armor pen early. Meaning early-mid game it won't be as powerful as armor penetration.

It is weaker than before because it doesn't provide the same early game damage as armor pen.","replies":[{"poster":"ßurst","date":"2016-10-28T18:41:27.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point is adcs will be able to use early lethality far more efficiently than assassins","replies":[{"poster":"Naqel","date":"2016-10-28T18:44:24.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they won't.\nThey are both lower level and fight a lower level target.\n\nIn all botlane scenarios, Lethality translates to less armor penetration than marksmen currently typically get.","replies":[{"poster":"ßurst","date":"2016-10-28T18:47:26.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we'll see how it plays out I feel that bot win rates will rise while assassin win rates will fall but that's just my opinion","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolfram Oxford","date":"2016-10-28T18:45:43.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Ki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZrVtplWp,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-28T18:41:27.100+0000)\n>\n> The point is adcs will be able to use early lethality far more efficiently than assassins\n\n\"I say this will be a problem in the new season.\" If it is weaker there is no problem lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
