They have a voli top but the entire rest of their team is feeding.\r\n\r\nVoli absolutely poops on fiora, going 7-1 in the first 20 minutes. Then the bull begins.\r\n\r\nHe shoves down mid and then double kills me and blitzcrank under our inhib tower. I ignite to try and stop his passive but he still gets away, backs and comes back. Rinses and repeats.\r\n\r\nOnce the inhib tower is down, he instead of attacking the inhibitor stands behind our nexus. Blitz is dead so he can&#039;t pull him into the fountain, and he aces literally our entire team (flashed into the fountain and survived because of his passive). We could do absolutely nothing. Jhin was super fed and bought a Lord Dominik&#039;s, but by then it was too late. His team won 17 minutes in.\r\n\r\nWhat could I have done to stop him? How do I itemize against a volibear? I believe he&#039;s not broken, but a humble bronzie would love to know what I should have done. Should I have gone Liandry&#039;s? Morello&#039;s?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfram Oxford","date":"2016-03-30T17:46:49.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3033}} Instead of Dom's {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}}  On you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-03-30T17:35:55.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grievous Wounds to mess with his passive, Ignite a 30% health, stuns, slows, knockups, and knockbacks.

Use ranged cc like morgana and lux binds. Make sure your supp is peeling for your adc while they go to town on him. I think Voli has one of the highest win % right now so I wouldn't be surprised if he got a small nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spanked eGirl","date":"2016-03-30T17:38:26.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veig wasnt using his stun well if Volibear could run into your team, otherwise your comp had little to no peel really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlaktarTasken","date":"2016-03-30T17:38:12.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a 100k+ voli player I can tell you that pretty much anything that stuffs his engage will wreck him, if he uses his Q to engage, odds are he won't have the chance to use it to get out, also not that he has to auto three times before he can bite anyone, if he doesn't get those AA's off th only one getting executed is Voli.\n\nHe also can't do much unless he gets free reign to do so, being permaslowed or/andcc locked as voli is the bears worst nightmare, he doesn't have any defensive steroids outside of his passive so he actually goes down easier than you'd think, given he doesn't get massively fed. Thus items that reduces the effectiveness of healing also reduces his ability to fight at low health.\n\nChamps I hate facing as Voli.\n\n{{champion:24}} - Once he has enough items he will simply just beat your ass.\n\n{{champion:103}} - If she ever let's you catch her, you're either a god, or she sucks.\n\n{{champion:40}} - Can't do anything if she's on the opposing team.\n\n{{champion:78}} - Have you seen bears fly? I see it all the time.\n\n{{champion:105}} - Engage me? Lel, byebye!\n\n{{champion:7}}  - Engage me? Lel, byebye!\n\n{{champion:64}} - Engage my carries? Lel, byebye!\n\n{{champion:245}} - I am simply better than you.\n\n{{champion:104}} - Bite? That felt more like a kiss.\n\n{{champion:133}} - You're blind, now you're stunned, now you're slowed, here's my birdy.\n\n{{champion:67}} - This is my absolute fear as Voli, no matter how fed I get good Vayne will still wreck me no matter what I do.\n\nCan probably ramble on about a dozen more champs I hate facing as Voli.\n\nTruth be told, if Voli doesn't get fed and he only gets fed against players that aren't really experienced playing against him, he's about as usefull as a sack of meat, he won't be doing any tanking since he's not a tank and he won't survive long enough to dish out any substantial damage. (I know since I main him so I stomp him every time unless my team feeds him)\n\nHope this helps out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-03-30T17:33:56.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some situations are unwinnable. If you let someone get that fed on enemy team and they know what to do with it, you dead son. \n\nBut, there is hope. The solution is to block them from getting that fed early. If they are starting to snowball, end lane phase before they get super fed and group together where the gold lead isn't as significant if it's only one champ. That will give you the wiggle room to win, especially if your team had a better team fight comp. Yours was a reasonable strong fight comp. Plenty of CC and pick potential between Jhin, Blitz, Veigar and Udyr. A decent front line, with solid burst and solid sustained damage. \n If the enemy doesn't respond to you guys grouping, or you can pull off a good team fight or two you should be able to secure objectives very rapidly and get your team back in the fight with that gold.\n\nRemember, you can't win every match so dont let a loss get you down. Just try your best and adapt as well as you can. Hope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HamerDrunk","date":"2016-03-30T17:30:40.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so fiora got beat in lane by voli seems like a bad fiora and you're team seems to have enough stuns to deal with him the big downside voli has is he needs to be in you're face slows and stuns ar lethal to him maybe take a {{item:3116}} or somthing to slow him down jihn traps would have worked to altho when he's fed its pretty hard to get him just don't try to kill him just keep him away","replies":[]}]}
