With that, it actually looks like there was another chat log combined with this one that ended up getting you escalated to a permaban. I don't want to give out too much of your personal info, but if you want the full context of what was said in the other game you're free to hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Sidicious","date":"2017-07-22T19:27:51.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like my account unbanned.\n\n It's been 2 years isn't that long enough??? Who can I speak to, to get this resolved? You already have players like videogamedunkey who are leaving this game for this exact reason.\n\nFurthermore, its obvious to many players that this game's tribunal has been broken for quite sometime.\n\nExplain to me the the logic of a toxic community, being the community that determines who is banned and who is not... This makes no sense. I've experienced countless AFKs and Disconnects yet do I complain? (No) All I want is a fair system which doesn't steal money from its user base for doing something that every other game on the planet allows (to be cursive). You're going to end up like Club Penguin if you continue in this trajectory and Riot is already beginning to have a falling out with this game as new and more accepting communities are developing. Please tell me how banning some of your most veteran players and not allowing them to criticize other players without getting banned is conducive to a \"non-toxic\" community. It's absurd I want it changed and so do many others.\n\nYou could have banned me for a year but no. Permanently??? And if you agree the 2nd game wasn't bad (at all) then why is it included in the ticket? As justification for calling someone a name. How often does that happen to me? All the time yet when I respond, which I always respond and never provoke, I'm the one who is banned. Ridiculous; If this were any other intellectual property you could be properly sued for this negligence.\n\nAlso the first game was a response to someone from Mexico calling me a stupid American. So I said he was a stupid Mexican but without proper context it makes me look terrible that's why I did not post it. It's one thing to have a person banned because they have psychologically toxic mindsets its another for a person to defend themselves from attackers. This is how the system of law works in many countries - why not here???\n\nFix it. Please.\n\n\nFurthermore the ticket doesn't record nor does it show what was said pre-game. Context is important Riot any system of legality knows this. Even if you don't unban me - there should be a means to do so.\n\nAlso this was a ranked match. I know this as I only play ranked matches. AND I WAS DEFENDING A GAREN JUNGLER SO HE WOULDN'T RAGE yet i get banned for defending someone who was being harassed and defending myself IN A RANKED MATCH. I can't just leave nor can I mute because its ranked and I need to communicate.","replies":[{"poster":"Sidicious","date":"2017-07-22T19:42:36.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also, your system of /remake in combination with Leaverbuster is broken.
