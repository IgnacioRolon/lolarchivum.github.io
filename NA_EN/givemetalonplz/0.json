I love pretty much everything about him and have been playing him for about as long as I've been playing League.

Before being played in LCS no one really cared about them.  Now that they've become 'meta' people are jumping on the \"It was in LCS, so it MUST be OP!\" train, and calling for nerfs on champions that don't need them.
