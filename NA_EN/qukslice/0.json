After a while, it just sends me back to my desktop. Whenever I attempt to open the client again (alt tab, click on it, hovering on it ETC.) it does nothing and on rare occasions, opens again. If it does open, it just puts me back on the desktop. I did some googling and discovered that spamming Enter can fix this problem but it's very unreliable.\nSometimes when I'm loading, I will be disconnected with a message saying \"You have been disconnected from the server. Please check your internet and try again.\"\nStrange thing is, I am connected to the internet. I can open browsers, play other games, and much more but League continually brings this message up even when I try to reconnect to the games.  I have no clue why. \nIt is very strange and I never encountered this behavior before. Whatever is happening, it's cost me multiple games and also got me low priority queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T22:55:45.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black screen that you're seeing is due to a network problem failing to establish a connection and download assets.  You'll usually end up disconnecting and receive that error after a while.  Your best bet would be to use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot your network and tune up your connection strength.
