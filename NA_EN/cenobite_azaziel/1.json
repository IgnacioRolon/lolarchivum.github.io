I, however, did not have river warded, thus it was *my* fault we got ganked. It's unfortunate that your team is unlikely to communicate with those outside of communication applications such as TeamSpeak, Skype, Crse, etc. However, can't you then communicate with your team? Remind them that you're there, and that you're relevant. Talk to them, and they'll talk to you. Or at least they should; we all know there's that asshole that doesn't ping, type, ward, or provide and kind of map utility to the team. Those existed in solo queue, and they exist in dynamic queue. It's going to happen, and it's happening. Is it unfortunate? Of course. So then who's fault is it, if anyone's? Is it your team's (or the enemy's) for being in a group, or is it yours for not asking to join their Skype/Curse/TeamSpeak chat? \n\nThere was an incident in Florida where there was a massive crash on the I4 interstate. Many people were injured and many of those injured died because they did not receive treatment in time. Why did they not receive treatment in time? Because no one called 911. Why did no one call 911? Everyone thought \"someone else will\". Don't expect those in a Skype call to talk to you. Take initiative, and talk to them. When you're in match making, they might not be paying attention to you; make yourself be \"heard\" (via text).\n\nLeague is about teamwork, and growing stronger to overcome your enemy, per match, and overall. Communicating with your team is essential, and we're all learning how to be better at the game. If this means trying your best against a coordinated team with a team that refused to talk to you *after* you've done everything you could to communicate with them, then consider it a challenge to grow stronger as a player.\n\n> Well, the big problem is that you had 5x5 teams while we had solo Q.

Which also provided people who didn't know how to play their roles, and thus a free win... for the enemy. I, personally, am glad that (though it still happens) this happens left often. If you feel like you are 1%, something is wrong with your team; you are still a part of the team. Give tips where possible, and do what you can to integrate yourself to into the team. If everyone, including you, myself, and everyone in every match ever, did not do eveything in our power to win the match, we did not care enough about winning. Of course, matches do get to the point where you have to hope for a mistake on the enemy's part in order to get a glimmer of hope of victory, but that's why we need to try to prevent it from getting to that point. \n\nBut at this point, I'm rambling on and on.","replies":[{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2016-04-19T00:10:35.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NoctusLynx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YnUoWHXW,comment-id=000e00000000,timestamp=2016-04-18T15:32:48.558+0000)\n>\n> \n>However, can&#x27;t you then communicate with your team?

I felt like it was much different than being in an Xbox live chat for example.\n>I got the feeling that if we were going to be talking to each other for 35+ minutes we didn't want to be fighting. Maybe I just got lucky. I also feel like hearing someone's voice makes you realize there is actually another person on the other side not just a nobody you can flame in the chat box.\" - lips\n\n-\n>\"I have transitioned into only playing league with people in a league clan because I don't find the game fun without talking anymore. that's some amazing results on toxicity but i'd rather talk with a toxic teammate on voice chat than talk to them in chat. I've played games with negative and mean people on skype or teamspeak (they are never mean to me personally) but I just delete them and never see them again. I also meet tons of new friends using voice chat.\n\n>I think people who don't want voice chat are just anti-social or don't want to win games. *I really don't understand the reasoning behind wanting to play a team game without a team*. Imagine how bad counterstrike or something would be without voice chat. I also don't meet that many young people on league, the most angry people are like 18ish. People complaining about 12 year olds most likely have not played league while communicating with other players.\n\n>Of course if you invented it you would need some type of honor system (but with a thumbs down option as well) I would love to go into a game with a ribbon saying i'm a good communicator.\" -Mister Oinker\n\n-\n>\" . \" -Ouroboro DFGAREN \n\n-\n>\"It has It pros and cons.\n\n>It allows good communication to lead to victory,however, If you have a pitch voice,you might get laughed at for about 35 minutes.\n\n>I think It's a good Idea to impliment voice chat,but maybe having a way to record the conversation would help In case of toxicity.\" -Popples\n\n-\n>\"I would like it as long as you add a report option to ban people who are blaring music into the mic or making a ton of noise just to p*** people off.\" -True Lizard\n\n(Is there a spoiler function where I can condense those quotes down to an optional button?) \n\nHaving the voice chat be public within the game itself does have its issues, but communication within the game is essential for playing to win (or maybe even for fun). It's not a problem with the system put in place, but the people who use it. By a similar token, guns don't kill people- people kill people. Guns are simply a tool or a medium in the violent exchange. Voice chat is simply a tool that can be used by trolls and ragers, but is the voice chat itself at fault? No. Would Rito be at fault for making a system that was used in such a way? No. McDonald's is not at fault for making unhealthy food if it's the people that continue to buy it. They, however, want to prevent the bad apples from driving away the good apples. \n\nThen there's language barriers, but I feel that it would fall under a different thread, and wouldn't quite fit in in this thread/post, as that has to deal with someone choosing the wrong server, most likely.\n\n---\n\nIn the regular champion select, the one before dynamic queue, you called for a role and hoped you got it. Typically, prior to season 4, the last one to call a role was stuck with support, unless they decided to do some off meta thing. At the time it was a *typically* undesirable role: no support gold income items, mainly. This meant that someone had to master the role they wanted, or support if they were too slow to call their role. Some chose fill, but let's be honest: 9 times out of 10, they ended up with support either way. \n\nSo yes, you are right, they would need to learn two roles: their role, and support. But then, if you were a support main? You typically only need to learn one role, then: rarely will someone contest you for your role. Support has become more popular as the years went by, so there are people who actually want to contest the support role. This means that support need to learn two roles now. \n\nOf course, someone can learn 3, 4, 5 roles if the wanted to or if they cared enough to. True, this happens in champion select where you have about a minute and a half to coordinate where everyone will go, but you had to be prepared to have to go into any role if someone calls your role first. With some, this would sometimes lead to insta-locking. I've had several situations where two people insta-locked top lane, and one occasion where 3 people insta-locked top. It  happened a few times with mid where two insta-locked mid, about three times with junglers, and only once with adc to my memory. \n\nTeambuilder was a very nice concept, but it's major flaw was the queue times. I've had ocassion where I waited a game's average length (30 minutes or so) just to find a jungler/support if I wasn't support. It was a very nice idea, but those queue times needed fixing. \n\nIn Dynamic Queue, you instead select two roles and you're guaranteed one of those two. The game will try to give you the primary role, but will instead give you your secondary role if need be. Complaining, maybe, but there's more organization, and there's a general trust and understanding that the person knows how to play the role (not always do they know how to play the role, but that's with or without solo queue). Dodging still happens, but I have yet to see any arguments happen as a result of the role that matchmaking gave a player. To put that in perspective, I've seen people trade roles. To that regard, I wish that you can trade roles visually and not just in chat. That way it doesn't look like Darius is doing support and Janna is going top, but it's far from a perfect system.\n\nIf what you meant by \"You know that champion select (everyone choosing 2 roles) is independent of dynamic queue right?\" went over my head, please let me know what. I just tried making do with what I understood. \n\nBut I digress. The more and more I talk with those wanting solo queue back, the more I learn about the predicament. With everything I've learned, I still don't know what people want Solo Queue back with the system that's in place. If everyone really did want Solo Queue back, there wouldn't be 5-man teams in Dynamic queue- there would instead by a team of randoms vs a team of randoms because of the match making in the game [(it's been fixed)](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/XvqbAgrF-letos-talk-about-dynamic-queues-and-ranked-play).\n\nEdit: Fixing my TL;DR.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NoctusLynx","date":"2016-04-18T15:35:20.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, wouldn't it be awkward only having a few people in solo queue?
