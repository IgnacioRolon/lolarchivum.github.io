I&#039;m not saying Legendary VO, but like 2-3 lines.\r\n\r\nFor example, Evelynn is near her VGU (most likely they already recorded), but imagine if her Tango skin would have a special taunt with Tango TF. Things like that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? \r\nI think this would raise the value of every skin, since every skin would have a bit of unique from all the rest.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-09-08T16:23:41.672+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Finikksu!

Please don't tell me their only connection is the tango skin. I'm sure you guys will do a great job and as someone who loves to try to make as many voice lines appear as possible keep up the good work!

The hyena warwick I did notice :)\n\nFor Swain?\nHe doesn't really have many skins, but I think since Tyrant is supposed to be like his High General Leader of Noxus skin, he could have some kill lines when he kills Noxian (about how he is their leader) or Demacian champions, or a taunt againt J4 \"The High General vs the soon to be King\".\n\nI can't really think something else.\n\nAgain, thanks for the answer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-09-08T14:37:17.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes when a new champ launches their launch skin gets a few lines changed or added, like Program Camille got taunts towards project skins and said some stuff when entering the enemy base.
