League seems to be the only thing affected by whatever is going wrong, and all the internet tests I run say I'm doing close to 60mbps up and download. When I mentioned it to a computer guy he said it sounds like a hardware issue, but then I would see it in more things than just league.\r\n\r\nBasically, my problem feels almost like packet loss, but incoming instead of outgoing. I'll be running the game on the usual 40-50 ping and get little to no spikes in ping when the problem happens, but it happens a few times every minute or so where I'll have a couple of seconds of being able to move and kinda see other players movement, but no animations will happen, I can auto attack and somewhat see health bars drop, and a few seconds later it will catch up and play all the animations (like spells and auto attacks and minions dying, etc.) that happened over those few seconds all at once. I almost never actually get a spike in ping during this, and it makes playing at a decently high level almost impossible. I've had times where I literally am farming lane and suddenly die, only to realize a riven walked all the way through lane and full combo'd me a couple of seconds after the fact.\r\n\r\nThere is something wrong with my laptop case, the hinge were the screen turns is coming loose and is starting to come apart, but I don't think that's anywhere near my network adapter. I've had the same internet and laptop for a long time and never run into this problem before. The only other difference is my family installed a device to monitor devices on our internet and limit certain devices times around the time these problems started showing up, but I don't think it is related, no one else has had any connection problems, and it only happens when I play league, granted I don't play any other intensive computer games on my laptop, but my ps4 hasn't had any issues, and it is being monitored by the device same as my laptop.\r\n\r\nIf there's any logs or whatever that I would need to post for someone to try to help, please let me know where to access them. Thanks for any replies!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T00:49:24.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'd be willing to take a bet that the device your parents installed miiiiight have something to do with this if your connection was affected around the same time. It'd be good to try testing your connection with that turned off, but regardless let's go ahead and troubleshoot this as if it was packet loss.\n\nLet's first make sure of what we're dealing with and run a test for just how badly this packet loss might be. Hit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) with some networks from a League game that had this weird lag. Take a screenshot and post it here using something like Gyazo so I can take a look as well!","replies":[]}]}
