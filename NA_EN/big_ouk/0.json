I noticed this whilst playing Garen in an ARAM match. Taking the mastery &quot;Bond of Stone&quot; makes Garen&#039;s passive useless.\r\n\r\nThe new keystone mastery &quot;Bond of Stone&quot; which allows you to take 8% of the damage dealt to allies, is probably the best team oriented mastery on the resolve (defensive) tree, and unfortunately works really badly with Garen&#039;s passive &quot;Perseverance&quot;. When any ally on your team in a decently large radius takes damage from literally anything, this mastery kicks in, and you take a part of the damage and your passive stops.\r\n\r\nSo if you have disengaged after being chunked out a bit, and you want to wait to the side of the contested tower or objective and heal up, if a single ally takes a single point of damage, then you have to wait another 8 seconds before the heal can begin again. \r\n\r\nStopping this mastery damage from counting, and allowing Garen&#039;s passive to continue would make a lot more sense, because then once again, it is the Garen who needs to avoid poke whilst healing, not his entire team, and in a team fight or even a small skirmish, the passive will still fall off as soon as he take damage, just like it used to.\r\n\r\nTl dr; Until rito decide to remove this interaction the keystone mastery &quot;Bond of Stone&quot; will actually be a detriment to you whilst playing Garen.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-15T16:20:00.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Garen doesn't really do the peel/disengage thing though. Soaking up damage for his teammates is something he does, but it's a secondary effect to what he's actually trying to do; disrupting enemy team. He charges in, silences someone and makes a big mess, forcing them to either deal with the big loud source of damage or ignore him in favor of the rest of his team. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that Garen makes better use of the other 2 defensive keystones, and that Bond of Stone is best used on actual tanks instead of bruisers.","replies":[{"poster":"killferd","date":"2015-11-15T16:40:04.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"as a GAREN fan and main ( my first serious champ when i started playing league) i have to agree.\nthat mastery is a waste as he is intended as solo top.\nhe has No CC hence a waste as a jungler or suport ( but i have JG with him and it was fun ganking).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-11-15T17:08:11.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, with the refresh time on his regen it's not that big of an issue.
