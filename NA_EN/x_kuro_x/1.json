My team fed hard in all lanes 11/37 K/D  (my KD was 4/3/2). \n\nPlease thumbs up to tell riot we are tired of the lack of unranked player parity.  It's bizarre that they are working on autofill parity before unranked parity. \n\nPlease thumbs up to tell riot we don't want unranked players in ranked games at all.. find a better way to get them a starting MMR than screwing up 10 ranked games. Or make them get mastery-5 on 10 champs before playing ranked, and only let them play those champs in placements. Anything.\n\nThis isn't even about whether we win or lose, or whether this evens out by happening equally to your team or enemy team. This is about games with unranked players being an un-fun waste of time (win or lose) because the unranked players most often dictate the game loss, more than the other players. I'd rather play games (Win or lose) where my teammates all have some understanding of the game. That's why I play ranked to begin with, but unranked players ruin too much of the fun.\n\nI suspect people may be target-dodging games with unranked teammates, which is why we end up with 2-4 of them in a game sometimes.. who knows.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Janarab","date":"2020-02-13T21:36:41.905+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Don't worry, they stop showing up once you get out of bronze\n\ngodspeed","replies":[{"poster":"Hordes66","date":"2020-02-13T21:57:03.099+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not true.","replies":[{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2020-02-13T23:02:53.339+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gold still has unranked in them","replies":[{"poster":"HEALTH FOUNTAIN","date":"2020-02-13T23:24:25.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GFREEMEN,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zK2AwiHv,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-13T23:02:53.339+0000)\n>\n> Gold still has unranked in them\n\nplatinum has the too, occasionally","replies":[{"poster":"Du Ma Mi","date":"2020-02-14T08:30:33.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but they're just people who haven't played their provisionals yet, or they had some absurdly high mmr going into their provisionals (like 0 losses challenger smurf type of MMR).\n\nI think OP is referring to people who have never had a rank at all - fresh 30's.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2020-02-13T22:02:28.773+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"so you're saying you're gonna stop playing ranked until unranked players are out of ranked games. guess you're gonna be waiting a while. there will always be unranked players going into ranked to dip their toes into it and see how it works. then one of two things will happen. they'll either drop out cause they can't handle the pressure or they'll climb up into higher ranks and become ranked players. that process usually happens around bronze or silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Dracocentaurus","date":"2020-02-13T23:47:02.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wrong, it happens up to plat","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2020-02-13T21:56:36.786+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> we don't want unranked players in ranked games\n\nthis made me LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2020-02-13T22:14:29.894+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would the loss have been less discouraging if all your feeding lanes were players with ranks?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2020-02-14T00:13:13.011+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So... how would people even get into ranked? Like what is this even? The entire point of placements for new players is to put them where they roughly belong. Some new players are terrible and will quickly fall down to bronze or worst. Some are average and will stay in high bronze to mid silver. Others are above average and will be around mid to high silver and will quickly climb to gold+. What is the easiest and fastest way to determine where these unranked players will go? You put them in bronze/silver games and see how they do. Simple as that. Riot isn't going to stop unranked players from playing ranked, that is hilarious.","replies":[{"poster":"qpringle","date":"2020-02-14T00:17:05.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.

Unrankeds don't like being in Gold games either, but because Gold is the average player, unrankeds have to start out there before their ranked MMR goes down. So the game auto assumes you have gold MMR and then you drop after your placements.
