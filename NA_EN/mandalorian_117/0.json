Since Blitzcrank was built to be an improvement over normal steam golems, his name most likely refers to one of the innovations Viktor made. Faster (blitz) internal mechanisms (crank). Blitzcrank later modified himself, maybe that's why he seems to be crankless today. But who knows what's really inside him? Maybe a plague rat he keeps in there as his best friend.\n\nAnyway, I like [mrmeddyman](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/WhlGFQ9A-why-did-viktor-name-him-blitzcrank?comment=00010000)'s theory as well.

Also Blitzcrank originally had nothing to do with Viktor, I believe he was just a robot created by random students. It was later they tried to integrate the characters in the lore by making them related\n\n{{champion:41}} - Pirate execution measure\n{{champion:21}} - Simple pun\n{{champion:80}} - 300 rip off so may as well call him something Greek sounding\n\nA lot of uninspired names in the early champions , it was gameplay first back then with a simple thematic to justify their existence\n\nSo I'd guess Blitzcrank is called Blitzcrank because it sounds robotic","replies":[]}]}]}
