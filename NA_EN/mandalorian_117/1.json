She said that she loved an artist who liked to paint flowers. Sounds familiar? But what if she thought she killed him, but he actually survived but has gone crazy because of it? What if she knew it, but she killed the man he once was. If that's the case, she probably has even more guilt that she created a psychotic killer that even Shen and Zed were traumatized over.\n\nNow for Jhin's side of the story, he probably had no memory of the experience. However, he knew he was an artist, and this near death experience made him become obsessed with death. The story said while he was in prison, he revealed nothing about his past. Maybe he doesn't know much about himself anymore.\n\nJust a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-08-10T16:37:48.081+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Timeline wise it doesn't work: \n\n\"She grew drunk with memories that were not her own, and exhilarated in the lives of others. Through stolen visions, Ahri watched through their eyes as they pledged fealty to a temple of shadow, sacrificed offerings to a deity of the sun incarnate, encountered an avian tribe of vastaya that spoke only in song, and glimpsed mountainous landscapes unlike any she had seen. She experienced heartbreak and elation in tantalizing flashes that left her craving more, and wept at the massacres of Ionian villagers at the hands of Noxian invaders.\"\n\nAhri was struggling with her addiction before she met her lover and during the course of the Noxian Invasion.

As I understand it, it would mean Ahri's guilt trip, meeting the artist, killing him, wiping out a village, disappearing, then reappearing in control all happened during the invasion, a strange time for an artist to visit, or after it.  If after, with Kayn being a child soldier in the invasion's first wave, the events would have to be rather close together, as he doesn't seem significantly old.    \n\nI was thinking that, with Ionia's relative lack of dedicated military power, periodic Noxian raiding parties wouldn't be unreasonable, and would fall under the scope of the term invader even without being in  _the _ invasion.  This would also mesh with the Vastaya journal's mention of a family avoiding Ahri for generations, which otherwise stretches the timeline oddly. It seems to mean she spent decades hunting people down, then the invasion happened and she rapidly goes from bad to good, to oversimplify.  \n\nIf it's officially wrong and I'm way off please tell me so I can adjust everything and stop spreading misinformation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandalorian 117","date":"2017-08-10T16:41:46.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't really know about the timeline, I was just wondering if this all probably happens before the invasion.

Ahri's first encounter with humans was apparently encountering soldiers from a foreign land of stone and iron (maybe Noxians?)\n\nIf it _was_ Noxian soldiers from the invasion that she first encountered, then Sharjo is right in that Jhin was not only imprisoned during most of the invasion, but had been a serial killer long before the invasion began.  I think it's very unlikely* that it could have been a close encounter with Ahri that 'made' Jhin the killer he is today.\n\nThat's not to say that they haven't crossed paths since his release.

(I'm not sure about the Charm math, I've never looked at it.)\n\nAssuming Jhin did only keep certain fragmented memories, one of them could easily be an obsession with numbers. But, which numbers?
