Primarily dealing with health issues just from trying to be good enough to even qualify onto a professional team, but I would like to hear arguments for or against why it would ever be played at an olympic level. I&#039;m not saying that it can never have the entertainment value of other sports, rather that I don&#039;t believe that there should be a point in which this game or other online games should be classified as sports. It clearly has entertainment value, but to make it to the point where it could ever be an elective in school in order to train better players just doesn&#039;t seem correct to me.","replies":[]}
