It should be set in the old Summoners Rift with all of the old items we loved so much. I think it would be a fun way to see just how far the game play has evolved and would give new players a chance to experience the game us old fogies remember so well.","replies":[{"poster":"X Anivia X","date":"2017-04-28T06:03:36.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zephyr Yi, Instant ER Anivia, Sword of the Occult + Mejai Akali..........","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-04-28T02:59:11.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"beta TF?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AddyVan","date":"2017-04-27T22:26:15.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP SION YAAAASSSS!!!{{champion:14}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ronin Ryouichi","date":"2017-04-28T20:47:40.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also in this new game mode there should be no new champs","replies":[]}]}
