The game still started and i couldn't join. Now i have to wait 20 min for 5 games before starting a game -,.-. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nThis is what i read here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-support/W0aEONuP-2017-ranked-rewards-help-desk\nDISQUALIFICATION\nAs announced in August, certain players are ineligible for this seasonâ€™s rewards:\n\nPlayers with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends.\nPlayers issued a ban of 7 days or more after Aug 22nd, 23:59 Pacific Time.\nPlayers banned for boosting during the 2017 season.\nPlayers who experience fraud-related or erroneous bans will still be eligible.

To clarify here, you are still eligible if you get a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).  You will get your rewards if you haven't had behavioral incidents.\n\nIt does suck to see this crash though.  :(  Was the repair able to get this fixed up?  Be sure to test in a custom game first!","replies":[]}]}
