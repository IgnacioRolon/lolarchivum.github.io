Its surprising how EU and LPL/Korean teams constantly out-do each other, but NA is still stuck with C9 and TSM on top.

Just lucky things happened. Tigers lost. C9 was demolished. SK lost because they banned out Forgiven. Gambit was themselves. You can not take away how well TSM did at IEM. Even if they didn't win, they still played well every game. Most of it came with pick/ban.\n\nYou saying that TSM and C9 are in the finals because the rest of the teams suck internationally? What does that even mean? CLG choked sadly, TIP played well game one. C9 almost didn't make it. But because they knew what TL was going to run with jugger'maw, they could easily counter it. And after that game 3 lost, Piglet just went on tilt. Because TL honestly has Piglet on their team, he doesn't allow other players to shine. Unlike players like WildTurtle who just plays stupidly. But because he speaks english, he fits. Piglet not speaking english clear enough, hurts TL in communication. Piglet and WildTurtle are the same person. They both are solo q ADCs. More so Piglet. But still.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-15T19:49:24.046+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I followed and agreed with the comment up until you said that Game 3 was piglets fault. He's the only consistently performing member on the team. \n\nGame 3 TL ran a single threat (Easily shut down and a rather poor comp) Jugger'Maw is always a two threat comp. Putting Fenix on a support instead of a carry like the first two games wrecked the momentum. \n\nHonestly that started a team wide tilt, that unfortunately spanned the remaining games.\n\nComparing Wildturtle to Piglet is another thing I just cannot agree with.  Wildturtle just makes terrible decisions, Piglet is an emotion driven player. He wants to be perfect so he is constantly analyzing his play and it can cause him to be distracted or even spacey. You see it sometimes when he streams.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pigby","date":"2015-04-13T05:03:23.033+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"They both outperformed all the EU teams last season at worlds, with TSM handing the eventual winners one of their few losses. \n\nTSM just won IEM.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Yunii","date":"2015-04-13T06:20:49.191+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pigby,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=F4sceUXU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-13T05:03:23.033+0000)\n>\n> They both outperformed all the EU teams last season at worlds, with TSM handing the eventual winners one of their few losses. \n> \n> TSM just won IEM.\n\nThe EU teams are much better this season so we'll see what happens there.

That's not a \"fluke\" that's just not performing when it counts. GE as a team has been falling off anyways, after IEM they've dropped series to both KT and SKT.

SEA was somehow thought of as an actual region during Seasons 3 & 4 when the teams that went to Worlds from SEA were no better than the Wild Cards), and NA is above EU as well. Prior to the influx of Koreans into the Chinese scene, NA wasn't that far behind most of China either (i.e. In the group stage, TSM split with eventual runner-up SHRC).","replies":[{"poster":"Zraebiel","date":"2015-04-18T20:01:16.986+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its still Fnatic vs someone else.
