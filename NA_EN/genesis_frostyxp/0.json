Because I have hand-like shaped cursor while playing but when I want to ping cursor changes to some small triangle, I don't like it, is there an option for it? I couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nThanks for answering.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T01:24:27.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe there's an option to turn off the way the cursor changes when you're pinging. If you want to get something like this added, the best way would be to get more visibility on your idea by posting it over in Gameplay!","replies":[]}]}
