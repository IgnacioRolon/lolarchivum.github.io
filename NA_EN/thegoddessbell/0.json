I am talking about currently having the ability to only mute SOUNDS. I'm aware you can mute a specific player's SOUNDS.\n It's the part where the DISPLAYED ping icons are still visible, along with the chat logs, meaning that every time someone gets pissy on my team, the chat log fills with a thousand \"Enemy Is MIA\" notifications.
