However, it doesn't appear that this is directly impacting you at all.

For like, the last 4 days randomly league would freeze or lag. My ping would be fine and so would my FPS but occasionally my champ will just stand there for a good 5-10 seconds and do nothing. After, it'll unfreeze and I'd either be dead and everything suddenly speeds up... For example, minions are still attacking but their health doesn't move, and when I'm done lagging/freezing then it zooms down speedy quick and the minions are suddenly low.\n\nReminder, it's not ping lag spikes when this happens, my FPS and Ping couldn't be better whenever this happens. It'll happen when I have 80 ping and like 52 FPS.\n\nI dont know what's going on but it's making it entirely frustrating to play, rito pls ):\n\nPS. Occasionally I have been getting randomly high ping too, but it's not as much of as issue as this. Common, but not as common as the issue I'm asking about. At least with ping lag spikes I know it's ping lag spikes, I don't know whats going on here???","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"skarecrow36","date":"2016-06-11T00:00:54.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I just lost a game because we were in the load screen then got kicked off so I assumed it was the \"maintenance' issue that the warning had mentioned. I log in again and next thing I know it's asking me to reconnect to the game. i do that see the loading screen now it's a 3v3. Of course, all the other team's members eventually come back and we lose the game because our top laner never connected . it seems like players got dc'ed before the load screen but then eventually came back","replies":[]},{"poster":"TragicTricks","date":"2016-06-10T23:46:40.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hasn't been happening to me but alot of people in my games have been disconnecting on my team and the enemies team\n\nGlad East coast got that stable connection","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Nature","date":"2016-06-10T18:14:12.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This keeps happening to me aswell.
