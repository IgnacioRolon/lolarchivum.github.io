By having PantsareDragon coach him live without any delay enable redmercy to break any rules? I am genuinely curios if this is allowed and wonder if someone such as myself can screenshare to get help trying to improve in the game. I&#039;m not a hater of redmercy in fact I&#039;ve loved his videos for years but i want to know what your opinion is about this. Are both redmercy and pantsaredragon breaking any rules by screensharing for coaching purposes or is this giving an unfair advantage to redmercy in ranked play.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-06-08T19:05:53.507+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is silly.\n\nIt's still a game, getting your buddy to look over your shoulder and give you pointers is part of gaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vapor Wave Vibes","date":"2017-06-08T19:00:44.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No long as pants can see what red sees it's not cheating since in any game with coaches you would get coaching as you play.","replies":[{"poster":"darkanubiss","date":"2017-06-08T19:04:04.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So would a higher elo player telling you what to do during a live game not give you an advantage of a second pair of eyes though? since the other team most likely does not have a second pair of eyes to look over what they are doing?

Every single coach I have ever had does this, usually with skype with screen share on or with teamviewer. Now the level of coaching in game varies, I have had a challenger level player tell me how to jungle much more efficiently then I would have without, that same coach told me how to play mid better but I couldn't change everything he told me I was doing wrong as he told me, like getting tilted at my teammates, not paying enough attention to the map, not communicating enough, getting caught because I didn't predict cds, etc. That coaching eventually made me a better player but about 40% of those games I still lost, and some of those games I didn't even need a coach because my team did so well there wasn't any chance for me to be stupid and mess up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-08T19:14:54.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is basically the same thing as having your teammate in the game telling you what to do.\n\nDude is seeing only what you're seeing and helping you get better at the game.\n\n\n\nIf i was a teammate and said go do this because of this and that, in a sense i'm coaching you.","replies":[{"poster":"darkanubiss","date":"2017-06-08T19:17:23.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"that would make it a 6v5 in teams of people on each side having an outside person not actually using a champ that can solely focus on shot calling give a distinct advantage to their team?
