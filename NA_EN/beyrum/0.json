Really frustrated with losing ranked games over this, only fix i found was pressing esc at the black screen then waiting 2 minutes to reconnect, it was a gamble tho if it wild reconnect in time for my team to not remake also always puts me behind atleast 2 waves before even starting, I have effected many people because of this. It is not a internet issue I have the best internet I can possibly have getting 40 or lower me and 80+ mbps, it is 100% a client issue. My computer is not the best so I'm sure that has something to do with it but if rather not spend 800$ when I'm in college to play a video game. Really hope the issue gets resolved and also out many tickets in on a different account about this and get the same reply everytime, \"it's a connection issue\". It's not it's client issue","replies":[{"poster":"ZZCorruptedZZ","date":"2017-05-17T02:58:37.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just happened 4 games in a row and this time no recconect button the client takes to long to load so they game is remade before I can get back in","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-06T21:56:57.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen usually suggests a connection problem that's failing to download assets, so it stays black.
