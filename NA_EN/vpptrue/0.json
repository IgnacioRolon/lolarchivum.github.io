I was just looking through my forum posts trying to find my ban date and reading my comments made me...just so disappointed with my past self. I was no better in game. I flamed and trolled my teammates and opponents alike. My actions were completely inexcusable. \r\n\r\n I could have done so many things differently. I could have just simply had a more positive attitude, I could have muted or ignored side chat when my temper got the better of me. I could have recognized that many times I was truly the one at fault and, instead of reacting in such a negative way, I could have taken the opportunity to learn. I'm sure many of my past teammates have taken the higher road when I lashed out at them. Those that did were right and I was the one that was wrong. \r\n\r\n I don't really have a great defense or explanation for my actions. The only defense I have is that I was dealing with a lot of loss during the months leading up to my final ban. Instead of trying to work through the situation in a productive way, I found myself lashing out at others under the veil of anonymity. If my friends that are gone now knew that I was taking out my anger in a video game, they would have been even more disappointed in me than I was in myself. \r\n\r\n Luckily, I have grown a lot since then. I've accepted my mistakes and am truly sorry for ever having made them. I have so much more confidence in myself and no longer feel the need to bottle up anger. Things that I should have recognized as petty are truly petty to me now. I can't see myself berating a teammate or enemy for things that they do in game. I understand that playing League of Legends can lead to some high stakes games and tensions can run equally high. But I understand, in a way I didn't before, that there are people controlling those pixelated champions. \r\n\r\n I know that it is difficult to believe someone making a request like this. I wish I could somehow emphasize my sincerity more clearly but I am no poet. Whether my request is accepted or not, I am genuinely sorry to all of those whom I've insulted. \r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-12T05:25:51.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Accounts dont get unbanned, there are too many warnings already. Riot experimented with this years ago, and the sad truth is that toxic players cant reform. It was a failure and a waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"VPPtrue","date":"2019-09-12T05:39:26.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh...that is unfortunate. I understand where they are coming from with the decision on that policy. However, I think people can change. \n\nWell, even though it seems unlikely I'll get unbanned at least I've had the opportunity to apologise.","replies":[]}]}]}
