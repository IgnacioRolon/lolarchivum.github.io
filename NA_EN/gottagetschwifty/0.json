However today I booted up the game and I played one game. After this one game I got permabanned where my own teammates honored me and one person who intentionally fed and was toxic back reported me for one reason. while the other game being cited I do honestly feel as I did nothing wrong. For Game 1 I had not played for about a month, I decide to boot up the game and I get two games that day, neither of them was I toxic, my text sounds aggressive, but I was just trying to communicate with the team, I did get raged at but I handled it and just talked to my own team. This one game got me the 14 day ban, so ya know I stopped playing until today, I decided hey I'll play a game. I played one game cited as game 2, admittedly I was much more toxic in that game but I was also jovial for the most part.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: by telling them about your stream it allows them to ghost it\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: I thought i was out of range\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: no we can't\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: lee don't ping if you aren't coming\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: she needs the farm more\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: drag gone\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: gj guys\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: just farm he's alone\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i wiill on next back\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: if you leave we give up tower\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: thanks for letting me do basically everything there guys\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: cait you new to adc?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: cait what are you doing just leaving the lane?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: really the tower at full health was going down?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i mean we could defend the tower\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: clear the waves\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: cait and i had enough poke to get rid of it\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: we had opportunity beforehand\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i cleared the wave alone\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i have over 50% kill participation\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i'm trying out the new mao support\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: the same actually\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: only a few more than most of you\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: who has 3 assists and only\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: 112 cs at 30\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: lol keep raging dude, i'm not the reason we have lost, we all didn't play that well, jhin played the best\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: and he didn't play badly\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: how am I being difficult?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: not on purpose\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: yeah you're just raging\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: so whatever i'll mute and report\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: toxicity\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: it isn't intentional\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: it is a normal game\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: no thanks\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: it is a normals why youeven upset\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: just end, I don't need lee's toxicity anymore\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: yeah i was\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i admit to it\r\nGame 2\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: take off your pants and your panties\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: shit on the floor\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: k\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: what the fuck?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: what are you guys doing?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: yeah cause i didn't have vision\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: or i would have died too\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i have a huge cs lead i don't need to get the support\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: don't come back rek\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: give yoru adc the kills\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: goddamn their fed\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: they're*\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: rek it didn't help you to get kills and be worth money agiain\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: stop\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i'm getting poked\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: malph you gonna keep on your adc to help or nah?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: you let zed get right on top of me\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: That w hit dude\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: rek?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: red buff more important than a team fight I guess\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: he is a horrible jungler\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: came into my lane feeding kills for no reason\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: you had a bad positiong buddy\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i tried to help\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: why?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: i need it more\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: yeah and i'm the carry\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: buying\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: we won a lot off that now back off\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: fiora why'd you overstay?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: go lnow\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: fiora do something\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: get bot inhib\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: whty are you pushing top\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: \\fiora\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: thank god you got something\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: group\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: we can't do antyhing now\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: rek you fucking r%%%%%\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: you're chasing the tank\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: bad fikght\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: don't\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: don't fight\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: don't fight\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: let minions win it\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: just stay alive\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: it isn't gg malph\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: it isn't either\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: cause you guys don't know how to not fight\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: why are two of you on just zed?\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: we deserve this loss\r\nGottaGetSchwifty: should have won like 20 minutes ago\r\n\r\nI will admit the second game has toxicity in it, I did curse, but mainly it was in confusion, and the beginning was for fun. I am not really trying to appeal anything here, I just hope that people understand that this kind of behavior I feels gets attention but the people intentionally feeding and threatening to report cause they didn't get the lane they wanted is not cool. Before this game the individual who reported me admitted that they would steal all kills and report anyone who said anything, how was this alright. This last year was tough for me personally, financially, a lot of people I loved passed away and maybe booting up the game in a bad mood wasn't a good idea, but I do feel that these two games do not account for my entire league history. In the first game cited I was even getting raged at and I handled it calmly. I know a permabanned likely won't get reversed, but these 2 games have apparently been enough to get me permabanned after barely touching the game for three months.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T00:39:47.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely understand your point about not feeling like reporting people can do much good when others are able to hold games hostage by saying things like \"give me x lane or I feed\". It really sucks, but the best way to deal with them is to muster up the strength to take the high road and just report them after the match. \n\nI don't want to say you shouldn't have been playing when you were just because of your personal life, as many people use games as a way to escape the life around them and I've personally been there myself. I can see where you were trying to have a good time at the beginning of that 2nd game, but there *were* a few things that were pretty negative. With all of that being said, you're more than welcome to reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to open up this discussion a little more as well and we can see what we might be able to do.","replies":[{"poster":"GottaGetSchwifty","date":"2017-07-10T00:46:29.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, and I do 100% agree that things weren't completely not toxic. I just think that these two games being my permaban is a bit crazy, I mean you don't have to say anything here and maybe can say something at another point in time, but do you think that first game at all is worth the 14 day and then a permaban for today? I'll own up to the second game completely. I'll fill out a ticket and we'll see what happens but I have heard that it is very unlikely that Riot will reverse the permaban. \n\nAnd hey maybe it is just me, maybe I could handle the toxicity in games better when I was younger, but now that I'm older and closer to being a full on adult I can't just keep my mouth shut when I'm treated badly or not respected and because of that maybe I shouldn't be playing the game anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GottaGetSchwifty","date":"2017-07-11T05:02:40.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well guys, it seems like my time on the rift is over. My Permaban stands and rioters weren't very understanding of my position and I am positive they made a mistake about one key issue. But it is out of my hands.

Sometimes harsher language conveys the urgency. I'm not saying it is right to do, but you have to sometimes. Sometimes people ignore pings and all talking. You can't report teammates for refusing to communicate and listen to the calls anymore. For example my game 2 in my OP, I got honored for shot calling because no one was.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rastarogue","date":"2017-07-11T16:08:38.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GottaGetSchwifty,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=8NVurRPn,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-07-09T23:57:45.117+0000)\n\n> GottaGetSchwifty: rek you fucking _retard_\n\nIn general calling people insults tends to get you banned, calling someone that is generally a pretty quick escalation to a perma ban.
