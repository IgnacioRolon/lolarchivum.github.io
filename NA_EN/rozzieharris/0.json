When I tried to change my password I found that the account is still mated with an old email that I no longer have access too, so the email verification is unobtainable. My questions are these;\r\n\r\nWhy would my password suddenly not work? The last time I logged on was during the Camille release where I purchased her as a gift for my fianc√©. \r\n\r\nHow would I go about changing my the email associated with my actual account to the one I am currently using, considering that I don't have access to the old one. This is especially concerning since my password doesn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nIf my account has been hacked, and the password changed, how would I go about recovering it altogether without access to the prior account?\r\n\r\n Thank you in advance, I'd like to solve this as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T02:42:03.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can assist you with recovering the account and changing your associated email if you reach out in a support ticket using [**this specific form.**](http://riot.com/2iGnX0K) One of our recovery specialists will reach back out to you as soon as possible after you've submitted your ticket.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RozzieHarris","date":"2017-01-09T20:11:36.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I can't log onto the site here either, I'm assuming I was hacked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RozzieHarris","date":"2017-01-09T00:10:02.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would I go about doing that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolmonster32","date":"2017-01-09T00:05:12.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the same problem.
