Seems like this change slipped through without being added to the actual patch notes -cough cough- so it was hard for me to catch this change. The voice change was made to kind of celebrate the new rotating game mode, Dark Star. Rest assured this voice change will probably be reverted to the old voice once the event is over.","replies":[{"poster":"2o2LL","date":"2017-05-05T01:56:01.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=RprQjn63,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-05-04T22:49:13.516+0000)\n>\n> We haven&#x27;t made any changes to the announcer&#x27;s voice in awhile, but if you still have that much love for the old voice this long after then maybe we should give it some thought!
