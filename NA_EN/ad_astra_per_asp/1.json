Let's try forcing a manual reset on those files by following these steps. \n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Ad Astra per Asp","date":"2017-05-05T20:08:57.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :D I tried that and if it happens again I'll post. :) :) :)\n\nCould being alt tabbed to browse the web while the game loads cause it?  I'll watch youtube in a 2nd monitor often while the game loads but I do this almost every game until I see I spawned and then alt tab back.  Then more often than not it works, but as I get to lane/camps/invade I'll realize my QWER and other keys aren't working and have to shutdown the client and reload often losing CS/exp/being set back once I was even killed :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T20:17:26.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I know that alt-tabbing during the loading screen can sometimes mess with your connection or drivers while loading, but I don't believe it should have any effect on your hotkeys =\\ .
