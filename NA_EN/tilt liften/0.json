The slow decays over 2 seconds.&quot; yet, after building a Liandry&#039;s Torment to test the increase in damage, it felt like only the health was a factor for increase in damage... thoughts?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSummoner BOOYA SHAMBO","replies":[{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2015-10-17T20:36:51.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If it deals magic damage then it is affected by magic pen. Lyandries is only 15 magic pen so that is only 15 more damage that gets through so you really won't notice it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bhagswag","date":"2015-10-17T20:40:10.345+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"15? You mean your magic damage ignores 15 magic resist.\n\nSo if some had 100 magic resist, Liandry's makes it so it feels like they have 85 magic resist. \n\nThis means it can either be 15 more damage, or something much more, or even something like 3 more damage; its a percentage thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2015-10-17T21:07:30.669+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damage reduction is calculated as 100/(MagicResist or Armor + 100)\n\nSo 100 MR is 50% reduction, while 85 MR is 46% reduction (make sure to subtract the calculated number from 100 to get the actual reduction value)","replies":[{"poster":"Tilt Liften","date":"2015-10-17T22:20:39.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All really helpful insight, however...\n\nI guess the deeper question I was meaning to hit, though, was whether or not his Q (and after review, his passive, as well) were **actually** affected because the Q scales off of health and the passive off of level?\n\nI see now, though, that even if affected, the damage could really be negligible...\n\n\nThanks for the input, everyone, cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-10-18T00:19:23.263+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum's Q and Passive both benefit from Magic Penetration if Braum has any.
