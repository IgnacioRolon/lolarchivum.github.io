I could type in game and press enter and communicate with my team and move around and use my spells and items when i clicked on them, hell the skillshot arrow didn't even appear, would just really like some help asap please, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T20:59:59.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap, that really sucks that your keybinds stopped working in a ranked match!!\n\nSometimes that can happen if your config files get damaged somehow, but we should be able to fix them pretty easily. Run through these steps before trying another ranked game to make sure that doesn't happen again.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
