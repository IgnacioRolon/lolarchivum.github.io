Game ran at 170 fps initially but now it sticks at 30, nothing more or less. I have tried many things; in game options, turning off v-sync, turning off DVR, updating drivers, reinstalling the game and restarting the laptop. Is there anything else I could try? Really appreciate any help as I have run out of ideas.
