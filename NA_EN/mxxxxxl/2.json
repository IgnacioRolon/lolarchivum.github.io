She could be so much more, and healthier, if she wasn&#x27;t held back by Riot.\n\nI think the two most interesting ways to move forward with Sona would be to either make her cooldowns longer but while the spell is active it provides a constant buff to all allies affected.  Focus more around her ability to power up allies within a small space for limited amounts of time.  And provide a skill floor, based on how people weave their spells.  Can splice all three abilities together but then have a really long down time before you can cast another spell, VS let one run it's course then move to another, finishing off with the third ability.  If all abilities run for full length the first ability should be off cooldown by the end of the third abilities duration.\n\nThe other idea would be to make Sona a very double edge'd champion.  HUGE boosts in power when abilities are active but they all leave serious debuffs once they wear off.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-05-12T00:01:12.902+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Itemization needs to be fixed. Supports shouldn't feel like half a champion because they don't have the gold income of other roles. The problem is that if you make support items too good or too cheap, other roles will abuse them. So you have to make those items conditionally good:\n\n1. The item grants damage, HP, resists, CDR, whatever at a great price... but you lose that stat temporarily if you CS. Think the Tribute passive from the first and second Frost Queen items that gets disabled if you take minions. Now solo lanes won't abuse the item since they can't farm or risk losing gold value in the process.\n\n2. The item specifically interacts with abilities that are frequently used by supports. Think the new Athenes here, where it's passive can only be triggered by healing or shielding someone other than yourself; something that rarely happens outside the support role. Increasing the MS of allies or preventing damage to allies in some way are also conditions that could be used.\n\n3. Gating power behind the condition of having an ally close to you is an acceptable power restraint, but not as restrictive as the others. Solo lanes get quite a bit of visitation from allies, especially mid lane, in the form of roaming supports and junglers. When teamfighting starts to break out and the laning phase ends, the condition is almost always not restraining the solo champ unless he's constantly split-pushing or wandering the enemy jungle looking for assassinate targets.\n\nThe point is that supports need strong, cheap items to feel as impactful as other roles, but won't get those items if they can be abused by those other roles. If you hide that power behind a condition that supports can meet and other roles can't, that's a great solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2016-05-12T19:27:33.860+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BastionKross,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LNhVioxO,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-05-12T00:01:12.902+0000)\n>\n> Itemization needs to be fixed. Supports shouldn&#x27;t feel like half a champion because they don&#x27;t have the gold income of other roles. \n\nIt's not just the income that kills them, it's the expenses.  Any champion would be weak if they started every game by spending 800 gold on an item with the stats of a ruby crystal and another 75 on no stats at all.  Delete all forms of spending gold to get more vision from the game.  Replace them with ways of getting vision that don't subtract from one player's ability to build normal items (e.g. buffs or expansion of the trinket system).  Gold is not a healthy way to control access to vision because gold is spent by one person and vision is gained by a whole team, which leads to the \"someone has to be weak for the team's sake\" dynamic that repels people from the role.\n\nAlthough on the income front it would definitely help to bring kill and assist gold closer together (seriously Riot, damage is not always and not even usually the most important contribution to a fight, why should it be disproportionately rewarded?).\n\nAnd possibly add a built in CS sharing mechanic (X% of the gold value of a minion is split by all other champions within exp range, does not subtract from the amount gained by the last hitter -- this would somewhat reward group wave shoving, but the main effect would be to make it more rewarding to hang around a teammate who is CSing).","replies":[{"poster":"MEMEME670","date":"2016-05-12T20:42:16.999+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">which leads to the \"someone has to be weak for the team's sake\" dynamic that repels people from the role.\n\nThis isn't what leads to that. It's the fact that there's 4 gold streams (3 lanes + jungle) and 5 people in the game. You could remove all ways to buy wards from the game and support would just buy other items that help the team (auras, mikaels, etc).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cookimonster316","date":"2016-05-12T00:48:48.533+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Problem is that everyone wants to be the hero.

Now that's gone and it's (thankfully) not coming back.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't think there should be \"support\" items aside from the core laning ones.
