Normally, If I flash to jump onto her, She will just snare, flash, E, ult. I'm dead.\n\nIf she has no flash, then she will take all my damage, because she can't get away. She needs to decide whether to try to juke my damage or out damage me. \n\n I need to {{summoner:4}} onto her because she's too far away. She isn't just gonna let me jump onto her in a favorable position where I do not need to flash. \n\n\n\n2:\nNormally it is 300 seconds. If they have {{item:3158}} or the mastery.

In a team fight it doesn't generally matter who has flash and who doesn't.  I think the most important thing about knowing flash cooldowns is for junglers to gank.  If a jungler ganks a lane that doesn't have flash, the chances of securing a kill are drastically raised from when they did have flash.  This will allow the jungler to snowball lanes easier.\n\nIt also makes decision making a little different for the laners if the enemy has flash or not.  You might be low health and safely be able to farm from a distance if the enemy doesn't have flash but pretty much be guaranteed to give them a kill if they do have flash.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TryMucinex","date":"2017-04-28T04:56:19.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-28T05:34:23.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just mouse over their Summoner Spell in the Tab menu, no need to guess it's max cooldown or look it up on a website.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tangy Citrus","date":"2017-04-28T11:35:51.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you hover your enemies summoner spells you can see their cooldowns on it.
