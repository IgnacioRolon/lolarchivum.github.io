Your computer might be getting overwhelmed switching from using your mic to possibly another source for recording. I've seen this happen with other devices and games, mainly controllers that use a USB plug in.\n\nMake sure your mic is firmly plugged in before starting a match, or just make sure you want your mic plugged in or not before a match to avoid this situation. \n\nIf you need anymore assistance, just let me know! :)","replies":[]}]}
