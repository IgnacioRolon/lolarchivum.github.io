Fuck rito, ever since Mark Merril sold it to Fuckface China they shit all over the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Undustas","date":"2019-07-26T20:34:56.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Just RednecK,realm=EUW,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=BF76ko7E,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-26T20:01:24.975+0000)\n>\n> https://i.ibb.co/D8JK6wZ/01.png\n> This guy finish with 100 hp.

They just too lucky every game?\n\nHow was scarra in masters then on another account he is going to masters again? He's just THAT lucky every game??\n\nNot to be rude but typically the people who make these kind of posts are just bad at the game and refuse to believe it's them, so they need to blame it on an outside force that's making them lose, like rng.\n\nYour decisions matter in the game, you can literally get the worst RNG and win a top 4 spot...","replies":[{"poster":"lGhetto Cowboyl","date":"2019-07-26T20:42:25.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was yordles and i was tris lvl2 on board + tris lvl2 on back (its 6 units).

This game is more about skill than rng. Yes he had good items but I bet you had items too, if you're not planning right that's on you.\n\nHe had 3 star units all of which are only 1 and 3 cost units, hate to tell you this but in most games those same units always hit 3 stars. It's common for those units.\n\nWatch some videos and streamers to learn how to play the game, that guy had a great economy while he was #1 because he doesn't need to reroll as you shouldn't be trolling really, he saved up to finish his 3 star units. Even then it was meh,he didn't even get an 8th unit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PikemanDim","date":"2019-07-27T11:04:59.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Just RednecK,realm=EUW,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=BF76ko7E,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-07-26T20:42:25.921+0000)\n>\n> I was yordles and i was tris lvl2 on board + tris lvl2 on back (its 6 units).

In diamond you get 36 lp for first 20 something for 2nd  and 38-56 minus for anything under 5th.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gottmilk101","date":"2019-07-26T20:36:58.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Just RednecK,realm=EUW,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=BF76ko7E,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-26T20:01:24.975+0000)\n>\n> https://i.ibb.co/D8JK6wZ/01.png\n> This guy finish with 100 hp.
