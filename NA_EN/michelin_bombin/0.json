The animation is the same (splashing water with blue particles) even the sound... But they are purple. Can you please fix this? I bought this skin for those water spheres... Please\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-01T18:45:18.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Michelin Bombin! \n\nI've loaded up Atlantean Syndra in game, and it appears that the orbs are working properly for me. From enemy view, it's intended that the spheres are purple due to gameplay clarity - could this be what you're experiencing? \n\nIf that's not the case, would you mind attaching a screenshot of what you're seeing? Thanks! ^-^ \n\nhttp://imgur.com/0f9pgVb","replies":[{"poster":"Michelin Bombin","date":"2015-12-01T22:28:40.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, till yesterday their spheres were purple, but i've just played her and now they're blue again. By the way, yeah, i was confused when I saw them purple on an enemy Syndra, and the other was like 'no man, they look blue to me' that was disturbing me, i thought the problem was because of me but now I see not.
