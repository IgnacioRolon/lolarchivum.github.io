Since this laptop runs a 3200x1800 resolution, you may notice some element scale oddly. Some players have managed to have the UI scale alright if they run the game in a Full Screen mode under your **VIDEO settings** in-game and avoid *Alt+Tabbing* out of the game. If this doesn't end up working for you, I'd recommend [changing your Windows display resolution](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4910-screen-resolution-display-change-windows-10-a.html) and your in-game resolution to 1920x1080 or 1920x1200.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T00:00:28.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure, do you have a screenshot?
