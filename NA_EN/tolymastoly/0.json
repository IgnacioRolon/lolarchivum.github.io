WHAT GIVES?**\n>\nThe drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line. With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n>\nWe wanted to give players who didn't play as frequently a good drop rate for keys, without making it feel like farming was mandatory if you wanted keys.\n>\n**Note:** There's currently a bug which prevents you from earning key fragments if you're playing a champion you don't own. This is unintended, and we're working on a solution.\n\nAlso, you are guaranteed a key fragment after winning a certain number of games without one. While you are not meant to 'farm' them, if you continue playing you will receive some if you want. However, if you have had a recent punishment on your account you may be [ineligible for Hextech loot](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/57wOcrmh-if-you-are-ineligible-for-hextech-loot-read-here-for-info-on-becoming-eligible-again), though you should know if this was the case.","replies":[{"poster":"tolymastoly","date":"2016-07-26T08:20:08.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no i dont have  punishment but i got alot of key fragments recently but i want to know if the chance of getting key can get to 0?","replies":[{"poster":"ntbcool","date":"2016-07-26T13:22:18.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if it's a normal exponential function the chance would approach 0 but never hit it so there will always be a very small chance of getting a key","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T17:57:29.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way to not be eligible for key fragments is by having hextech restrictions caused by behavioral occurrences.  I looked into your specific issue, and everything looks okay!  I see that you've received a healthy amount of keys over the last week, but keep in mind that the drop rate is more of a curve.  You can obtain key fragments more slowly as you receive them, until the rate resets roughly every 30 days.

Has Riot considered displaying the timing of this reset in-client? Feels like it would save you a lot of time, and even for people who do understand the system already, that's still interesting to access this information directly, instead of half-guessing through your drop-rates in the previous month.","replies":[{"poster":"ÂFRÏCÂN GØD","date":"2016-08-03T18:30:34.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The timer would be different for everyone and it doesnt go by games it goes by wins so if you dont play for a while the timer would be paused.. unless its showing days.. thats not really a MUST because it would just be counting down 30 days from day 1 and reset. so you want a 30 day timer? seems excessive unless they show the drop rate percentage as you win. i dont see it being something of an issue on the forefront so who knows if this is even worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-03T19:30:40.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I want a 30-day timer, precisely because it is different for everyone.\n\nI want to know if my reset is today or next week, without keeping a spreadsheet of my previous key fragments drops...","replies":[{"poster":"ÂFRÏCÂN GØD","date":"2016-08-03T23:05:18.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I've learned with this company they don't seem to care about simple concepts until it's too late and even then they execute some of them wrong. I guess it got overlooked because they prioritize 4 chests a month n figure you'll get the 12 keys if you really want them and once you get down to hardly getting any 30 days is coming up or already passed. I know because I play a lot of aram I get my keys within the first 10-15 days it seems like.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
