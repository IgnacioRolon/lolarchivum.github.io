I have had a myriad of problems, the first being was that I could not connect to the back end servers. Then after patch 7.15, I have been getting an error and then when I try logging in after the error, I am stuck on authenticating. I have attempted to reinstall the game at least four times already, gone through a majority of the fixes suggested on the Login Issues page, and even tried resetting my router and modem. Nothing has worked. \r\nMy only conclusion as to the root of the problem is the latest WIndows 10 Creator update 1703, as before the update dropped I was able to log in just fine, and now I am having these problems. Has anyone else been having trouble with this, and is there a surefire fix?\r\nPlease, help. I want to play again :(\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have already sent a support ticket into Riot, and their recommended steps to fixing the problem were steps I already tried. \r\nAlso, I have used the HRT... and that has ceased working for me as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Jantix Shafalcon","date":"2017-08-28T20:10:01.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same situation here.. nothing seems to make any difference at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T02:44:19.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Creators Update might have reset a few of your network settings, which might be why the tech agents were running you through some basic troubleshooting steps first. Even if you'd done those steps already, doing so with those agents will let them know what's going on in each step of the process, which can help rule certain things out.\n\nYour best bet is to keep talking with our tech agents in your ticket, as they've got the most knowledge to help out in situations like this.","replies":[]}]}
