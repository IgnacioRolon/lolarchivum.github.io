Got there sometime last week, and I usually didn't do too badly in my games. But since hitting 30? I can't compete. I underperform, and I usually wouldn't mind. I'm not a very competitive person. I do try to win, but as long as I feel I've tried my best, I honestly don't mind if I win or lose. What I do mind is the sling of insults that consistently come my way. Being told that I'm r%%%%%ed, or that I should kill myself, or that I'm trash, hinders my enjoyment of what would otherwise be a very enjoyable game!\r\n\r\nI don't know what I hope to get from making this post, other than just a bit of frustration off my chest.","replies":[{"poster":"RUNAAANS HYDRAA","date":"2015-09-27T15:52:05.037+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember feeling that way once I hit 30 too.
