It's easy enough to change it back but I'm confused because nothing was change don my account. No purchases or games played or anything. Why would someone bother to change my password but do nothing else?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-03T22:54:36.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and peeked into your account history, and I do see where someone keeps submitting password changes which most likely means someone has been trying to take over your account. Like Antiweapon said, I would try to change that email's password as well since they might have access to that too. \n\nI want to make sure your account is still safe, even though they might not have been playing games or buying anything. I would change both of those passwords (your account and email) and then reach out to our [**account team**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) if you need to make sure that no damage was done while that person was on your account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-06-03T03:13:01.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I  would change your password on your email also if I were you. \n\nAnd the most likely reason if that they haven't gotten around to it yet or they were planning to sell your account.","replies":[]}]}
