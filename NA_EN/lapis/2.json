I don't approve of such sexual behavior, but there's a lot more wrong with the world than some guys being gay. Gay people are humans too and they are capable of doing good and bad things like the rest of us. We're all messed up.\n\nI like rainbow stuff somewhat, but I've always thought it silly that someone calls this kind of art a symbol of being a sexual deviant. Is Sona a gay champion and how many colors does it take before the champion's theme qualifies as sexual deviant rainbow? I dislike Sona compared to other champions, but it's due to that her hard disable is on a really long cooldown more than anything else.\n\nIf I liked the rainbow trail enough to use it, then I would. But I don't. I'm not going to flame someone in LoL for anything that happens outside of LoL.","replies":[]}]}
