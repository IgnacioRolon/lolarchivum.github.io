Sean Day9 went over what makes a game fun and engaging, and a big difference between RTS and MOBA was the level of interaction from the second you hit the map.\n\nIf you take Starcraft 2 for instance, to generate income, you simply build workers and start harvesting minerals. The first several minutes of a game (aside from scouting, or some kind of cheese) is simply placing structures and mining more income. According to their research, this is a turn off for many gamers in this day and age. People like to be engaged, doing something, from the minute the game starts. Enter League.\n\nWhile the practice of CS'ing may seem monotonous and dull to some, what it really does is create an interaction that keeps the player engaged from the start. You aren't just building a drone and automatically sending him to bring you income, you're actively working to land that last hit and gain a bit more gold every minion. Combine this with having another play in the lane with you, and you've created a style of game that is never dull due to the mechanics of CS'ing, wave manipulation, and the opposing champion. You are always doing something, you are always interacting. \n\nSo overall, in a game like League based off of gold income, I'm of the belief that CS'ing adds a certain value and level of interaction that keeps you engaged in the game from the moment (or shortly after actually) you hit the rift. It is repetitive, it can be hard, or it can just be dull; but overall it seems to be in my mind, a necessity of entertainment value.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-06-22T22:59:39.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait... in what world is starcraft uninteractive for several minutes. anywhere outside of bronze your dealing with harrass withing the first 2 - 3 minutes.
