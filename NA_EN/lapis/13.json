My only complaint is that the transformation looks weird. There's not clouding, smoke, fire, nothing to transition her, she just instantly snaps from black hair and tee to blonde with coat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-21T11:04:38.671+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"And default Kayle...\n\nF","replies":[{"poster":"Camille Ferr√∏s","date":"2019-02-21T13:50:22.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"F","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"B3Prof","date":"2019-02-21T11:08:36.952+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"The entire Kayle rework's appearance is a major disappointment.
