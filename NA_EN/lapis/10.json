The lack of sidesteping skills from your enemy and the lack of knowledge and common sense... If you are against a zed and don't build seekers ASAP, you deserve to lose. If you are very good with dodging and can avoid his main damage, yes, you can skip the seeker's for later but if you are not so good and still don't build seekers, you had it  coming. Also, from the moment his shadow dissapears when he uses it since the next time he uses it again, you have a 14 window of abusing him. If you can just avoid his damage, it's all skillshots so, you basicaly can, and abuse the fact that his energy will run out if he uses a full combo and hits nothing but air, then you will do quite well against him. Also, i can't stand what most people say about rushing a zhonya's that it ruins your damage potential...

Learning to carry is definitely the hardest thing to do in this game for me xD\n\nI wouldn't really blame you that game, your team was absolute trash and the enemy team had 4 Ahri counters.\n\nThe ways in which Ahri can carry are 3:\n- Teamfighter: group with your team, peel for your carries with charm and maybe rylais. Keep your team alive and they will win you the fight. Get picks with charm if possible. If there's nobody you can rely on, try to burst the enemy carries. I've won many games through peeling for my lategame Trist/Vayne/Twitch etc.\n- Assassin: get blue trinket, spam it, ward everything. Find people that are alone, kill them. Only really works if you're fed, but as I see you do know how to get fed.\n- Splitpushing: push lanes, take towers. When they send people after you, either escape with your kiting kit, or maybe kill them. Usually chasing an Ahri is just wasting time, you won't get her. Meanwhile your team gets objectives.\n\nWhat I did in my screenshot was mostly the 2nd option, I was snowballing so hard I could oneshot anyone with W+R+ludens+lich bane. In the end I grouped with my team to push and got 2 picks with charm, then we pushed to nexus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2016-03-27T11:39:58.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yeah, carrying.
