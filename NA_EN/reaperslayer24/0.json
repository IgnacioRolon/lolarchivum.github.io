Then while in river I get \"Reconnecting\", but my net is fine, and my client is still logged in. Well, I end process on both, relaunch league, and i'm sitting here with no reconnect option for the match. It's also not over, or didn't exist to the servers as I do not see it in my match history.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T02:23:30.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh those ghost games can be pretty frustrating sometimes. Every once and while, games can crash entirely server-side. It's pretty rare, but when it happens nobody will be able to reconnect since the game doesn't exist anymore. You're free to continue queueing up, and no worries, you won't be hit with any penalties if the game did crash.","replies":[]}]}
