In Varus&#039; lore, Pallas was destroyed by the Noxians while he was defending the temple that held the corruption. In the ensuing chaos everyone in the village was slaughtered, including his wife and child. This is what fueled Varus to become blighted by the corruption in his desire to kill every Noxian associated with his village&#039;s destruction.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m glad that Varus was mentioned in this map to be honest. I am also desperately waiting for your reveal to his new narrative, Jaredan. Because if even you get excited chills about it, then I know for sure you and the foundations team has something big planned for him.","replies":[{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-12-15T16:36:25.164+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just realised that Kalamanda is on that map too.
