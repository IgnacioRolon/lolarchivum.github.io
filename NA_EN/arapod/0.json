I thought I was imagining things so I used her classic skin in another game. Sure enough she has her little tail in that skin.\r\n\r\nJust thought I would let you guys know if it was a big enough issue to warrant a change! Her rear end looks so bare without a lamb tail!\r\n\r\nFantastic new champ, Riot.
