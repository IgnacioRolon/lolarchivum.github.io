I constantly see things like \"Riot is ignoring the players\" or that \"Riot is the shittiest company because they didn't Nerf (insert champion I lost last game to)\" and I was wondering, where does all this hatred from riot come from. Clearly Riot is a popular company, I mean there are millions of us that play League of Legends, and millions who spend real money on the game to support them, and yet we have constant flame for Riot. People pretend that they never do anything for us players (Which is just incorrect. You think worlds was cheap?) just because they don't balance champions based on the sole opinions of the players, who for the most part know very little about the balancing of the game due to the fact that they don't have insight on the changes planned for the future. Anyway when it comes down to it, what I'm wondering is why do people flame at Riot so much for no readily apparent reason? Is it just because they are looking for someone to blame when they lose games?","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2014-11-19T18:53:27.400+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":44,"body":"Well, when the shoe fits...\n\nSeriously though, I just wish they would stop straight up lying to their customers. As a S1 player, almost every single team under Riot has done this. Take the LE skins as an example. LE meant never to be sold again. Now it means \"sold when Rito needs more money\". I can now no longer trust *anything* riot says about skin sales anymore, because their one most basic promise was sold out to for some quick holiday money.\n\nAnother example is how they treated the move over to the boards. No matter how you look at it, someone lied. They claimed that this platform was better for communication and using it would increase communication, forced everyone over here despite it not being ready and community protest, and now don't communicate any more than they used to, and *still* hide conversations on reddit without so much as a link over here. \n\nI think the biggest lie of all is that they don't actually listen. They do as they please, it is their game, and they will treat it as such. Then they get mad at us for not being happy with it, or their communication over it. This particularly is displayed time and time again by multiple teams, lore team is the most recent offender here, and if they were just straight up about it, and came out and said \"yeah, this is how we are doing this. whether you like it or not is irrelevent.\" then I don't think there would be as much of an issue. Thing is, they expect to maintain their player oriented reputation, but do nothing to actually deserve it anymore.

I think it really sets Riot apart. There are advantages to a one-way, top-down relationship between developers and the community, but I think Riot has shown that there is also an extraordinary strength to be drawn from the community and its ideas.\n\nI do wish that **[Narrative would follow this lead](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/1Bi3Xi6w-link-this-thread-next-time-narrative-makes-a-massive-change-with-no-prior-community-input)**, however. I've more or less made my peace with \"The Great Retcon\"; I don't agree with kicking us out of Runeterra like that, but on the plus side, it's easy for the lore community to incorporate the new lore into our community-run League of Legends universe (the one that also contains a League of Legends—crazy, I know). As I've said **[in another thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/VtaGu1O3-the-lore-fading-long-post)**, I believe the lore community can survive, and even find some silver lining here. While I do wish they'd **[stop enforcing the retcon so aggressively, e.g. by censoring the voicework,](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/APptXsao-leave-the-vo-alone-if-were-still-summoners-in-the-game-then-let-us-be-summoners-in-the-game)** I'm not asking Narrative to undo the Great Retcon. I get it; that's locked in.\n\nWhat I *would* like to see from Narrative would be something along the lines of how the gameplay team handles major Champion reworks. If Narrative is planning to seriously rewrite a Champion's story, personality, or voicework—and they obviously are—I'd like to see them hold some mid-development discussions with the community, share their current ideas, gather the community's ideas and insights, and engage in some real back-and-forth.\n\nSo far, Narrative's process has been:\n\n1. Write their material in secret\n2. Publish it in a shock reveal\n3. Show up on the forums to answer questions about what they've already decided and published\n4. Disappear, repeat\n\nThis is rather nervewracking for people who are invested in League's lore. I like a lot of their new material, but I honestly kind of freak out when I see that a new lore-block has been released, because I know they're not shy about crushing old lore when they drop the new stuff in. I keep expecting to log in one day and find out that Veigar is now an undead Noxian lizard-man or an Ascended chipmunk or whatever. (Well, I mean…Ascended Chipmunk Veigar, that might have some traction.)\n\nI'm not trying to \"call out\" any members of the Narrative team, and I am painfully aware that at one point the community behaved in an utterly repulsive, disgraceful way toward a particular member of the team. (I spoke out against that behavior then, and I'm speaking out against it now: that was not acceptable, not at all.) CarnivalKnights has been **[quite helpful and friendly on some occasions](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/VGkjNe3U-bilgewater-sails-out-to-attack-the-black-mist?comment=001100000000)**, and they've even made **[a few token steps toward Riot-style community engagement.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/6EofhoHW-lets-talk-biographies)** Still, the pattern remains fundamentally the same: secret development, massive rewrites, shock reveal.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2014-11-19T22:49:04.866+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree with you, I like most of Riot's decisions, but sometimes I can understand (not agree with) the haters.

I truly don't believe that I can lump together Riot with EA and ActivisionBlizzard because they're giving out their product for free, truly.  Out of the sea of \"free-to-play\" games, Riot, Hi-Rez, and Valve have stood out as the companies that actually get the phrase right.  I've spent a fuckton of money on this game, way more than any game that is charged on arrival, but I've felt that none of my dollars have been used to make me at an unfair advantages (skins get wins cuz usually it's an indicator that you're good enough with a champion that you're willing to show off your skills in an aesthetic way.)  \n\nAlso unlike the faceless ooze monsters of EA and ActiBlizz, THEIR OWNERS TALK TO US DIRECTLY.  Seriously, I can't describe how cool it is that fucking {{champion:23}} comes on the boards and talks to random League players.  It's cool as shit.  I can't stress that enough.\n\nBut I think in terms of constructive criticism, you really need to stay consistent and to be brutally honest with players.  None of these \"oh we're getting to it\" or \"we've got something better planned\", be brutally honest Rito.  If you think that what the playerbase says is going to hurt them in the long run, don't pull any punches or shy away from the conversation, be direct.  \n\n\"We've thought about it, but we cannot forsee x in League because x+y = a future of no fun.\"\n\n  \"We're not nerfing Lee Sin right now because we don't know what direction to take him, and we know that eSports is going to be a lot less fun to watch without him.

We're sorry to all the Cassiopeia mains and we're doing our best to give Cass her identity back.  We understand that you've lost faith in us after Skarner, but we're hoping to give her as smooth of a transition as him.\"\n\nDONE!  Half of the people complaining will instantly shut up.

And your attempt to spin it otherwise only makes that worse.\n\nWe can, as players, still enjoy a game even if, as a corporation, you don't respond to the players.  Your convoluted non sequitor aside, his point can be easily shown in how you do not respond to the desires of a minority of players, even when the majority isn't against them.  Of course, you respond when it is clear to you that an overwhelming number of players would feel strongly about a certain change.  Take, however, the example of lore.  The simple fact is that the majority do not care; plenty of them will read and enjoy whatever you put out, not really caring if it suddenly disappeared.  The minority that actually care about the lore, as CupcakeTrap points out, do not even see a real attempt at communication or any evidence that you value player input.  There are not enough of them to drastically affect your bottom line, so they are simply not important.  Unfortunately for you, there is no counter-example to that argument.  There are many examples where you bent to the will of an overwhelming number of players, but deciding, out of the goodness of your hearts, to do something for even an unopposed minority is not something I have ever seen.

Then, when I discovered I liked the game a lot, and knew I'd be playing it for a long time, I started investing my money in skins I liked.  I did this partly because I wanted the skins, but partly because the game was free and I wanted to support the company that put it out.\n\nFrom your perspective, if my time and money were equally valuable to you, or if money were more important, I suspect the game would cost money either out of the gate, to buy the software, or in a monthly fee.

I know for sure though that for the things that I work on we always seek to find a balanced view of player opinion which includes vocal community members, (not just in NA English on the forums, but in 20+ languages and hundreds of different community platforms), real usage data and deep analytics, survey and other sentiment data and so on. Getting a well rounded perspective on how players feel about anything we do is important.\n\n> There are many examples where you bent to the will of an overwhelming number of players, but deciding, out of the goodness of your hearts, to do something for even an unopposed minority is not something I have ever seen. \n\nI don't think that's true - I think you've naturally selected yourself into a version of an unopposed minority that you personally believe that may be true for. We've made lots of changes to League of Legends that cater to a tiny minority of players (many bug fixes, master tier, programs for owners of fansites or other community advocates, folks who develop tech on top of LoL, artists, and many others).\n\n> The integrity of your intentions is just laughable. You're a corporation; your raison d'etre is to make money.

A lot of decision making at companies is, \"what's the most that I can get out of my customer, vendor, employee, whoever while giving up the least\" and that approach really doesn't exist here. There's a huge amount that we're willing to sacrifice in profitability in favor of the health and longevity of relationship with players. The balance in that relationship though means there's also going to be changes that we're going to make that some folks will be unhappy about. That's necessary to remain healthy. We also try to push context, we try to push honesty and integrity in decision making. These are critical concepts internally. Again it doesn't mean we've figured it all out  \n\nThe amount of people in the company who make decisions that involve trying to make money is tiny. We don't tie any performance management to revenue or profit either - so we really don't provide incentives for most to be thinking about revenue impact. We even track value and sentiment data like purchase regret (because we don't want any), and cost per hour of engagement time - all examples of ways we're trying to make certain we're providing huge amounts of value to our players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-11-19T21:51:06.634+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preliminary edit: I just read through my response again, and it's super rambly.  Oops.  Take it with a grain of salt.\n\n> if you're really sitting there questioning not just our actions - but the integrity of our intentions, then the relationship that we have with you I'm not sure can be salvaged.\n\nThis is a really important distinction.  I actually hear things about Riot being greedy or not caring or whatever all the time.  **Constantly**.  From my interactions with RIoters and the amount of time I have spent learning about the company, it's just blatantly false.  Rioters are some of the most passionate people I have ever seen, and it's really tough to find anything from Riot that even remotely points to greed *as the primary factor*.\n\nThat being said: When there are a lot of players with this mentality of Riot being evil and they aren't getting drowned out by people just downvoting them or ignoring their stupidity, it becomes possible that maybe there's a kernel of validity there.  I know the community is huge and that a minority could be hundreds of thousands of people, but there's something to this.  When you have all these people on a forum together and, overall, some of these hypernegative stances aren't being totally eradicated, it's possibly attributable to any combination of a few factors:\n\n* The Boards caters to a particular subset of the community, thus it's not a representative sample.\n * What type of person uses the Boards, and does the platform's design discourage certain \"interest groups\" so to speak?  Does it encourage negativity or other types of behavior?\n* The community tends not to entirely disagree with some of these claims.\n * To an extent, do a significant number of people feel this way?  What's the root of that feeling?\n* Boards mechanics don't allow users to get rid of comments they think aren't constructive as efficiently as one might like.\n * I doubt this is a significant factor, to be honest.  Say what you will about \"reddit-esque\" vote sorting, but it really does work for filtering content.  I'm not saying it doesn't have issues, but overall it's been pretty successful.\n\n---\n\nAs a disclaimer, I'm not saying that total raging is something we should heavily consider.  I'm referring to threads like Boards Mega Discussion, most of the interaction immediately following the closure of the old forums, etc.  There have been quite a few of distinctly popular threads regarding the topics of communication, community initiatives, etc. that have bordered on \"Riot flaming\".  \n\nWhy do these threads do well when they are created logically?  They tend to be pretty pointed, and if people didn't consistently agree with the mentality the threads wouldn't be popular.  Is it because a representative sample of the population feels a certain way?  Is it because the Boards stifles certain goals and ideas?  Is it because players encourage negativity rather than positivity?\n\nIt's really important to consider **what the target population is**.  From what I've gathered, places like Boards Feedback are primarily composed of players that **really** care about Riot and **really** care about the community.  Should they be discounted as a tiny, nonrepresentative portion of the community?  Consistent posters in Boards Feedback might be 0.00000001% of the community, but they are the people that are the most passionate about how the platform functions.  Even though they are a tiny minority, their thoughts and feelings can be (in theory) far more valuable than any other feedback received from focus groups and surveys.\n\nI can safely say that I have never been invited to participate in a survey or group involved in assisting with decisions made for community interaction.  If you have run surveys about the Boards within the client, I certainly haven't seen them.  It seems important to really focus on your core feature audience, rather than the overall opinion of a community that might not even really care about a particular piece of content.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSexyHobo","date":"2014-11-19T22:16:44.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> * The Boards caters to a particular subset of the community, thus it's not a representative sample.\n\nthe internet is a place where angry or immature people can lash out at others with no real consequences. its not just riots boards. the internet in general is 80% troll.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-11-19T23:25:29.775+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If the internet is 80% troll, would it make sense that an 80% troll rate on the Boards could reasonably translate to a ~80% troll rate of League players overall?

It's just getting pushed on us and we have to accept it, no questions asked. \n\nIt's incredibely frustrating to try and discuss something when Riot just ignores all the great and constructive threads that have been made about this retcon. It's like talking to a brick wall. I have no faith left in the current narrative department after first Trundle, then the institute and the overarching silence to top it all off. They'd have to fix mistakes to regain my faith or I'll just have to abandon Leagues lore, only to be reminded about the bitter memories about it all, the wasted potential and lost faith, whenever it pops up in my client.\n\nIt might sound like I'm exaggerating, but it's been 18(?) months since Trundle got replaced by this new troll. I've had countless discussions about him, realised he was a lot closer to old Trundle than I initially thought. I hoped for Riot to go back at him, update his lore and VO to make him the same troll in a new setting. All I got is silence while one of my favorite characters from the lore got replaced with a power-hungry brute. Now the very premise of the lore is getting retconned out and I'm still here, still creating discussions with other players hoping the brick wall will listen.

I understand as a company such as this, not everything is set in stone and you can't just give news off the top of your head in the forums.

It would get people out of the dark and maybe give people a glimmer of hope.  Talk about your set backs when you have them, too.  People are more likely to understand when they are given more insight and realize that you are all just a bunch of human beings and shit happens.  Yeah, you have a news feed, but I'm talking about something that occurs on a more regular basis.  Maybe once a week or every two weeks, someone goes around to every project lead and gets info about where they are at and what setbacks they have come across.  Then, of course without giving away too much because most intelligent people know that a business does need it's secret/fun projects, release a letter (kind of like your patch notes) detailing where every project team is at.  \n\nI believe that this would help your community keep a more calm attitude toward you without raging at you all the time about specific items/  I, for one, am not affected by the serves.

However, a lot of the times people take that idea of a minority opinion and suddenly expect their statements to be insightful simply because they're the underdog opinion.\n\nA lot of the times I see posts expecting Rioter attention when it's an obvious trap post (impossible argument, cherry picked \"facts\", opinions == facts, etc.) and then proceed to get offended when they don't get said response.

Because obviously why wouldn't you want to make them happy, its good for business. It's that the time spent in development of lore could be better spent in the development of things that would make 80% of people happy instead of 2%. It's impractical. If it wasn't you would have developed a strong lore team 4 years ago. It's the same reason me and all my friends who have been playing since season 1 have 100,000 - 300,000 ip and nothing to do with it. We only represent a tiny fraction of the population.\n\nIn the over six years I've been here - I've been part of the hiring process and have directly or indirectly brought well over a hundred people into Riot. They've varied from heads of departments to entry-level contributors. Hiring teams is actually super tough. You want someone who will fit well culturally, is an expert in their craft but also is responsive to players, someone who works with a team well - but also owns their work and is entrepreneurial. You want someone who is a gamer or a minimum someone who will take the time to become one, you want someone who is a leader in the field - but maybe doesn't have the baggage, or someone who isn't a leader but has huge potential, etc etc.\n\nOnce you bring someone in (typically it can take a year from identifying the need for a person to getting someone we believe to be the right person in the door). Then you have onboarding. They have to learn how the company works and how they make decisions, they have to build a plan for whatever they're working on, sometimes they then have to build a team - either by rallying people who are already here or by bringing in people who aren't here yet. This is a huge intense process.\n\nIf you brought in a leader and it turns out that they were the wrong fit - you missed something in the interview process, they struggled to rally the team, whatever. Sometimes that means you're going to start over from square one. \n\nYou can't just throw money at people and all of the sudden they come in and it's perfect. It's takes careful planning and cultural architecture and time to develop that environment and we learn at every step. The company has gone from ~30 people to 1500+, and one office to a dozen offices in 6 years. The rate of growth is insane but it comes with its challenges.\n\nAs you grow too you have to restructure - reform departments, move work around etc. Either because it's more efficient or it's more effective to do so, but the operating system for the company has to change from 30 to 100, 300, 500, 1000 etc. \n\nYou're looking at one example of something that we really want to be great at - building that immersive world that players really love and building the right team to do that, giving them the right structure - both the autonomy and freedom but also the right oversight. There's tons of those examples - things like mobile, responsive web, new client, SR visual update, all sorts of tech infrastructure, events, eSports, etc etc that we've gone through that cycle with before.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2014-11-20T00:06:32.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pendragon Just a question but are you intentionally replying to the OP or is there and error on the boards for you?

I've been playing since around the time Miss Fortune was released, back in Season 1, so I've seen them change a lot over time.\n\nSeason 1: Inexperienced company, dealing with buggy systems and a rushed architecture, but super interested in their fanbase. LOTS of communication. Very open, very honest, but having a lot of trouble. The game grew rapidly, and Riot had trouble dealing with that, but lots of happiness was around... well, actually, the game was just so-so tbh. The foundation was there, but BOY did it need work.\n\nSeason 2: They're still chatting a lot with fans, but at this point it's clear they can't keep some promises they've made. Communication is still pretty open and honest up to a point, but when something goes wrong Riot starts to clam up. Magma Chamber, stealth rework, reward delays, all of these things leave fans confused by the sudden silence. It's a bit hurtful, but the game is objectively improving and League is making huge strides in e-sports. Overall, we're hopeful. It's a great time.\n\nSeason 3: Skin prices are rising. Champion prices are rising. Runes are ever more necessary as the game, through being explored, becomes much more competitive. IP rewards and boosts aren't coming as often. On the other hand, balance is still getting better and League is so big that everyone on Twitch wishes they could get near even a fraction of those view counts. Lore is mysteriously vanishing, but Riot is... sorta talking more. At least they're addressing the problem issues. They're saying less, though, even as more words come out. They don't want to tell us what they're up to. They're honest with us, and they're around quite often, but it's not a conversation anymore. It's two monologues that occasionally vaguely overlap. Feels bad.\n\nSeason 4: Game balance is honestly incredible. Occasional outliers pop up, and folks complain about Lee Sin or Lulu, but honestly we're way better off than before. All the roles have something to do, and can feel strong. Competition is huge, exciting, and surprisingly close. Riot is mastering the art of big announcements, and their game is looking better than ever. It's weird, though. Lore suddenly jumps out of hiding, disheveled and bizarre, but with wide-eyed optimism declares a Big Decision which seems to do little but infuriate those who cared and baffle those who didn't. IP prices are starting to level off after peaking, but IP is harder to get than it has been in the past. Designers are ready to discuss decisions and actually listen to suggestions, and though there are casualties like Karma and Trundle the overall result is fantastic. However, they seem to be the only ones really being open to us. Lore, wounded by the backlash, seems determined to continue making big surprises until one of them works. eCommerce is content to stay largely ignored, though players are steadily less able to actually play the game without huge investments of money/time before accessing content. The art team is friendlier, but they seem to be essentially doing the same surprise-explain-retreat cycle as Lore only better, occasionally poking us to get a bit of data.\n\nIn the end, I'm still interested in the game. It's a great game. It's very fun, and improving steadily. I still think that a lot of really cool people work at Riot. Some of them are charismatic and practice, while others are still getting the hang of things. That's fine. However, I don't feel comfortable giving them money, and I don't suggest this game to friends anymore. The required time and money are just too much without being clear, and the company is too hesitant to engage in actual impactful dialogue. It's now the standard \"frenemies\" model of Company Vs. Customers, rather than the \"benefriends\" culture we used to share. Instead of feeling like I can chat with Morello about upcoming Fiddlesticks changes (his E used to bounce up to 10 times), I kinda just wait to see what happens randomly and, oh hey, sudden Cass rework, I hope this is one of the successes. Instead of watching Guardsman Bob's Udyr bring a whole new item into the game through a lore event, I'm left wondering why the transhumanist genius Xerath has been replaced with Tragic Backstory Jafar.\n\n\ntl;dr: Riot was more open and honest, but their game needed help.

I'd used that construction earlier, and just got a bit lazy. My bad. (Edit: Turns out I can't actually change things in that post anymore, because Boards. I'unno.)\n\n> The game is free, IP is earned by playing the game (that is free, btw)\n\nI'm not sure why you're choosing to condescend, here.\n\n>and can be used to purchase every ESSENTIAL element in the game. The only money one can spend is entirely optional, such as skins or an alternative to grinding IP. Usually, grinding would be a problem, but playing the game is what you're there to do and it's fun.\n\nThat is ideally true, and was the case for a while, but at this point most of the game requires large amounts of IP to unlock. This means that many players simply can't get much actual satisfaction from the game for a while, usually that time between \"okay this looks cool what am I doing\" and \"I wonder if ranked is any fun\". My point is easier to make if we look at the whole [Timmy/Johnny/Spike](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11b) idea.\n\nTimmy: I want to have BIG NUMBERS and DESTROY THE OPPOSITION. Cheaply, this player can snag Annie early on, flash-tibbers people to death, and get some early satisfaction... until he wants to explore the other champs with big numbers, or make some rune pages that min/max for a stat. That initial enjoyment was fairly cheap in terms of necessary IP, but after that it quickly climbs, especially because of runes. Even so, it's fair to say that many Timmy players will be alright playing this.\n\nJonny: This guy gets hit the hardest. How do you explore and learn and get creative in this game without putting in ridiculous amounts of IP/RP? Quints often cost more than a champion each, and actually buying more rune pages is atrociously expensive. With every new champ being 6300 (after a week), and many of the more complex/involved champs being new enough to carry that price, this game really isn't actually F2P for Jonny. Maybe as a technicality, sure, but that's being disingenuous, since most of his time playing the game is just him waiting until he can actually play in a satisfying way. \n\nSpike: Spike fluctuates with the meta, but ultimately needs to put in an investment comparable to Jonny. While Jonny is spending a lot of time grinding IP to get the new champ with the cool new mechanic (Yasuo, Azir, Kalista), Spike is putting a lot of IP into optimized rune pages for currently-strong champions, some of whom are cheap (Trist) and some of whom are expensive (Braum). Ultimately, this requires a pretty big investment of time, during which Spike doesn't have what he wants.\n\n> tl;dr: I don't see how money is even a factor in playing this game, no one's holding a gun to your head and any money you spend is up to you.\n\nAgain, that's condescending, and I suspect that you didn't really think this one through or look at the numbers. I encourage you to do so, even if it's in a very rough way, because the results are highly edifying.","replies":[{"poster":"Glescoron","date":"2014-12-04T15:33:09.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Again, that's condescending, and I suspect that you didn't really think this one through or look at the numbers.

T^T Sorry, my comments weren't supposed to come across as condescending, maybe my naturally sarcastic way of talking got the better of me but my intention wasn't to belittle, just to be clear. <3\n\nAnyways, you made some excellent points that I have to say I agree with. I'd love to see Riot adjust some of the champs' prices to make it easier on new players. Sometimes I forget how ridiculously long it took to get thresh (my first owned champ) XD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Uiru","date":"2014-11-19T21:44:46.675+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still waiting on east coast servers, replays, ranked AFK protection, matchmaking, true solo queue, and for the balance team to stop nerfing underpowered champs while not even touching overpowered ones. \n\n Also: I don't care how much Worlds cost. The negative impact of eSports on this game is undeniable and, frankly, needs to stop. \n\n I've dropped an estimated $1200 since I started playing two and a half years ago. If I had known Riot was going to allow their servers to degrade to this point, leave east coast players out to dry, allow trolls and afks to dominate ranked, hint at basic features then go mia for 18 months when their aforementioned garbage servers couldn't handle it, and somehow make matchmaking even worse every time they try to fix it, I wouldn't have spent a dime. I'm on God damn LAN right now because I get ~60 less ping there- I'm still at 80, but that's better than 130-140 with the best internet available here!\n\n It's a fun game. I love a bunch of characters, which is why I'm still here. But I regret ever giving Riot money and if I could have the time back, I'd have $1200 to waste on some other stupid thing. I'm basically waiting for Riot to get bought out by someone competent at this point, because there is no way this game could be managed any worse than it currently is.\n\n \"We just reworked Sejuani and it is one of the VERY few we're going to do right. Let's nerf her into the ground and let Lee Sin run wild.\"\n\n \"Assassins are pushing APCs out of mid. Lux is one of the few who can compete. Let's nerf Lux.\" \n\n \"That support stepped out of support. Nerf her into the ground while nearly everyone else can do at least two positions reasonably well.\"\n\n \"Mobility is something that champions pay for in other pfft hahahahahaha I almost got it out.\"\n\nJust a small sampling of the failures of Riot's balance team.\n\n Then there's the champion redesign department, who made Sejuani get dressed and then released a second naked ice country dude. Equality! They're coming for Evelynn next and I can't *wait* to see how ruined she turns out. \n\n Gameplay reworks? All Nidalee needed was for her spear to not hit you when you were three character lengths away from it. Instead they go through all this effort and wind up buffing every one of her other skills, allowing her to murder you from the other side of the lane while throwing slightly less stupid (and still undodgeable) spears. Speaking of gameplay, AP Tryn was melee so he got deleted. AP Yi was melee so he got deleted. AP Trist? Ranged. Not deleted. Because melee vs ranged isn't skewed enough.\n\n The tech exists to end games that are detected as 4v5s and Riot won't do it. Every other game does something about 4v5s, Riot refuses. Mindboggling.\n\n So I'm pretty confused as to what there is to defend here. Since I don't play Lee Sin and don't care about eSports, there's actually quite a list of things to be upset about. And it's not like these are all recent complaints. Riot has had YEARS to fix some of these things. But they just don't want to.\n ~Uiru","replies":[]},{"poster":"KOSHER TACO","date":"2014-11-19T21:17:21.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just find it amusing that this red discredits all dissent by chalking it up to being whiny and entitled.
