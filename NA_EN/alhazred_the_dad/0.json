Supercakes explains how GGMF doesn&#039;t necessarily bring any new technology to the table, and as a result they would be lowering the RP cost. Should we perhaps take this as a sign that this kind of skin may be a herald of skins of the future? The technology is certainly there and functional. Being able to change forms as Kayn back at the fountain is essentially the same thing, however it carries a stat alteration as well as a model change. \r\n\r\nI think it&#039;d be worth talking about creating a new classification of skin tier exclusively for skins that take after the E.

There's been a big detailed post about it already made on here and the subreddit. The gist of it though is she's not made from the ground up, she's not \"basically a new champ\" by using this skin. She uses the old model, many of the effects are the same, animations were kept the same outside of what the new guns do, etc. Her \"forms\" are just chromas that don't even change the hair. SG Udyr in contrast has a different set of hair and beard with each form, takes different poses with each which are also different from his base skin's stances, different animation effects for the animals, etc. DJ Sona is the same, changing her helmet, the visuals on the helmet, board, behind her, stance, movements when she attacks, I could go on for Lux as well. This skin is not remotely close to being \"ultimate\" as it has been established by the skins before it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-03-08T07:22:43.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't answer the question, so I will just ask again:\nWhat would be the benefit behind that name change?\nExcept enabling Miss Fortune players to say \"Oh, we can still get an ultimate skin, since GGMF _technically_ isn't one!\".\n\nThey would have to make an announcement, describe what's going on and all that stuff, but what is the _purpose_ of such a change?\n\nLet's imagine they would create a new skin tier and call it \"ultra skins\".\nIf they do this, it implies that they will keep doing these regularly, otherwise it would be meaningless.\n\nNow we have 2 possible scenarios:\n\n1. They really continue doing these ultra skins and since these events are extremely rare, people will ask if this is the new standard and they stop creating ultimate skins completely. The answer would probably be \"possibly, but maybe some ultimate skins happen from time to time\". Unsatisfying answer, but all they can give.\n\n2. They make another ultimate skin next, again, pretty rare event. People might ask why they introduced the new skin tier if GGMF is the only example in it. Same answer \"maybe we enhance the tier some day\". Again, unsatisfying.\n\nMeanwhile I don't see anything that such a renaming would make better. Maybe you can give me an example. They already made the skin cheaper to tackle the problem that it doesn't match the expectations people had.\n\n_________________\n\nBesides, sorry, but it seems people claim rights here they don't have. Riot are the ones defining what is an ultimate skin, if they consider it one, even if a bit cheaper, then so it is.\n\nWho says that all the things you mentioned are KO-criteria for ultimate skins?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alhazred The Dad","date":"2018-03-08T02:29:10.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider this a personal gripe: I firmly believe Shen should have received the honor of an Ultimate skin. If they declare MF as the only top tier skin for the next three seasons, I really don't have faith in the creative team. \n\nNow, does this mean he will never get one? Of course not. However, the pattern which we thought Riot was abiding by has been shattered. There is no telling when he might get it. Now, any member of the old cast is eligible for one of these brand of Ultimate skins. Hell, we may well see another five years and a rework before Shen is allowed to have an Ultimate. \n\nRiot and Anna were kind enough to tell us that they finally have a long-overdue Shen skin in the works, but as it stands, it's pretty much confirmed to not be an Ultimate skin. So, the several year long wait was essentially forced upon Shen players because other champions with tits and asses were selling too good; integrity and vision can take a backseat to profits.\n\nThe entire point of distinguishing GGMF from the rest of the Ultimates is to not allow what could be a future feature (for free) to be bought for $25 now. Remember when they patched Champion portraits to match the skin you were using? You had to pay for that shit before, and you could only do it on four people. \n\nNow every champion has that courtesy, and Ultimate skins have the unique privilege of using custom map icons.  \n\nThe entire point is to get your money's worth when it come to shelling out almost 30 bucks for a skin for one of your favorite characters. The only reasonable uproar around Spirit Guard Udyr I could find is the argument that it thematically changes nothing about his kit or appearance, only makes them what they were supposed to be from the start. SGU is just vanilla Udyr, with 100x better effects, and as a result, Riot have neglected to even give Udyr's base model a VU, despite it being one of the worst offenders of clunkiness.\n\nUrgot is technically the champion to go longest without a skin, but with his rework being somewhat recent, and the rising demands for Star Guardian Urgot, his players will be at least somewhat satiated. He, rightly, didn't fit into many skin lines.\n\nShen, however, is eligible to be one of the best fucking blank canvases for the following lines: Star Guardian, World Breaker, Heartseeker, Warring Kingdoms, Dark Star, Pool Party, Academy, Totally-Not, and of course, PROJECT.\n\nSince they decided to skip over Shen for so many obviously phenomenal choices, I just prayed they were using every stitch of effort to make a bitchin' Ultimate skin. I am almost certainly wrong, as you can see. But I'm just a hopeful nerd with a one-trick he loves. My biggest worry is that Riot will dump this one Shen skin, and wipe their hands clean of him again for as long as humanly possible. If it were an Ultimate skin, it could be acceptable, but now it's just the given norm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thee Pie Man","date":"2018-03-08T00:51:20.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, as SatomiKun said, no real reason to do so other than to reference. Saying whatever skin it is, is going to scope/lock the champion's skin of whatever kind regardless of the name. Saying MF's ultimate versus MF's Transformation skin or whatever is purely label changing. What's the POINT of doing that is what I want to ask? Like what makes the need to classify it as something other than ultimate in \"tier\" when it follows the ultimate scheme but has a separate function (in my opinion)?","replies":[]}]}
