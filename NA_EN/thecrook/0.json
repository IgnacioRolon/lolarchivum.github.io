It's not a huge issue and can be cleared up pretty quickly by running through our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664). \n\nIf you feel the client still isn't running up to your standards you could also try putting it into low spec mode! That will take away some of the fancy doo-dads and sparkles, but it should make your game run a bit smoother for you! You can find low spec mode in your general game settings :)","replies":[{"poster":"TheCrook","date":"2017-06-06T22:35:28.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!
