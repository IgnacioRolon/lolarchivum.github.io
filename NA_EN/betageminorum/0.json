At first I was thinking why would anyone pick that, but then the enemy bot lane spent the whole match stunned and got cancer. Dont play Veigar support though, you will give every cancer and they will die and will be your fault. I&#039;m dying right now because Viegar stole all the CS and gave me cancer. Pls this is a PSA, DONT PLAY VEIGAR SUPPORT!\r\n{{champion:45}} :^) :^) :^) :^)","replies":[]}
