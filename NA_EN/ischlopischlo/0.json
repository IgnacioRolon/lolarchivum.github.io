I got the email with the account names and that they are located on EU Nordic and East. \r\nChanged password for both of them and it seemed allright.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I login at the webpage, I get the message missmatch account name/password/region.\r\nWhen I login in LOL client, I get the message \"Your account has been transferred to another region\".\r\n\r\nDoesn't this seem strange even when I got names, region and new passwords for my accounts?\r\nI created a support ticket, just wanted to know if someone else experienced the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T04:31:21.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already submitted a support ticket for this issue, I recommend waiting for a specialist to reach back out to ya. We'll need to give your account a thorough investigation to figure out what's going on, so fixing this in your ticket would be the best option since you've already sent a ticket in.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoulPurgeHunter","date":"2017-01-23T08:21:09.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi dude =] i think i found a solution because mine  it's ok now.. \nso , go on the gear (settngs)  and do a full repair files , and log in with your OLD password... at least this helped me.. !! :P idk.. i even changed my pw but i log in with my old xD","replies":[]}]}
