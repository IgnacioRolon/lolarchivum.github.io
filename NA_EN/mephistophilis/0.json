(If that is necessary, I'd rather have this skin than not have it, I guess) If that were the case, then bonus points if they make his poison color resemble Thresh's default soul drops.\n\nbut if they wanted to make the skin Awesome, here are some ideas\n\n**Q: Poison Trail**\n- Instead of just a cloud, would include ghastly souls/ghost faces inside the cloud - or maybe when it effects a target.\n\n- When a target is being poisoned, can hear a moaning/ghoulish groan.\n\n**W: Mega Adhesive**\n- The bubbling effect actually works pretty well for this, but instead, could have undead hands reaching up through the adhesive, as if trying to grab the slowed target. Bonus points if it actually spawned where a Champion was standing and followed them.\n\n- if this were even more Legendary, could have him throw a torch that lights a rune/symbol on the ground in the area.\n\n**E: Fling**\n- Not a particle or anything to change, but maybe there's a scream sound effect that goes with it.. ? I dunno. Maybe nothing for this one.\n\n**R: Insanity Potion**\n- First off, I think a default feature of all Singed skins is that he laughs constantly, on loop, for the duration of his R.\n\n- There are technically particles to this as he sort of froths and foams - but for this, I think he should whip out the lantern in the picture above and hold it out in front of his as he runs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dies to Wolves","date":"2015-04-23T05:41:24.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it'd be an insta-buy from me (and I already have a skinged skin)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TenSlashTen","date":"2015-04-23T05:25:05.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looks like something based off dark souls/demo souls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-04-23T01:12:40.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they prob wont release it in at least another 2 years since singed is most likely going to get the samsung white skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hex the FenFen","date":"2015-04-23T00:37:32.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even play Singed and I would insta-buy it.
