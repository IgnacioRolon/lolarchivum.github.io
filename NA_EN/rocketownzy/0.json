If you see it, they are doing it wrong. \n\nMost farming junglers will have lower KP than others, but they make up for it by objective control, counter ganking, or stealing when the enemy ganks unsuccessfully. Also a farming jungler will be a bit richer and allow them to buy pinks, which protects laners. Of course as you said this is a bit less interactive, but there are windows where ganking, even as a farming jungler cannot be ignored. \n\nProfessional players have MUCH less ganks than a solo q game due to respect of ganks. So Farming is actually the pros go to strategy, for both lanes and jungle. However, there are reason they don't pick farming junglers, like threat to gank, dueling abilities etc. \n\nSo AFK farming is not \"stupid\" it's actually more strategic (when done correctly) than ganking as your are not just looking for a mistake/ overextended lane. Rather pathing efficiently and pressuring different areas of the map at times and controlling it, planning ahead until an exploit can be found which includes a gank. \n\nFocusing on ganking in League should actually be a BAD strategy, (It's not) due to players should be respecting losing match ups and potential ganks. Level 2 ganks should NEVER work, but they do because players value that 24 gold over the potential gank. \n\nGanking is important, the only difference with a farming jungler than a ganking jungler is that early game ~10 min the do not do as much ganking, but after this point they should be grouping and destroying towers taking dragons and rift. Vision control and tracking, should double up and the pace of the game should pick up.  \n\nNow I'm not going to pretend that farming junglers are perfect and this happens every time. I have SEEN farming junglers seemingly AFK for 20 mins and be like well I almost hit my spike. On the flip side , I've seen ganking junglers into farming junglers that just inted and the farmer had to do nothing, but scale up for 10 minutes then stomp the game. \n\nNow that you've heard a slighty neutral/ fammers perspective. This is the important part. \n\nWe clearly have different ways we want to play league, that should be embraced with clear strengths and weaknesses. You like ganking cool. I like Farming great. There should be a strategy for both of those. ATM farming is crippled, in favor of ganking. I, and I believe the OP does as well, want the balance of the 2 strategies closer together.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Owl Puff","date":"2019-01-28T11:32:30.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If they want jg to be more of a support role then they should at least give catch up exp for jglers who are behind...that way jg will still stay at bot lane's lvl but jglers who got fked early game would still be able to catch up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Düff McWhalen","date":"2019-01-31T02:14:33.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh rest assured jungle is even stronger, but only when playing these champs specifically;\n\n{{champion:121}} \n{{champion:5}} \n{{champion:120}} \n\notherwise yes, the jungle is now awful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackfin97","date":"2019-01-28T08:28:12.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I am going a bit off topic - But does anybody here feel that Shyvanna is overpowered as a jungler after her buffs?\n\nI played jungle today and she took the dragon at level 3 before I could run from base to dragon's pit.
