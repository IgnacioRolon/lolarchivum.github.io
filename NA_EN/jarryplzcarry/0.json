This is 100% reproducable. The first recalls are working fine. However, if you just once recall while buried, the bug occurs with every following unburied recall. I have made a video of this bug:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2881X-UArlA\n\nHopefully this will be adressed. Also, I don't think Rek'Sai is supposed to have two snorkles.","replies":[{"poster":"Honor is Dead","date":"2015-06-26T21:33:11.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirm this, and i noticed that this bug only occurred for me if i had a point in my burrow/unburrow, but not a level 1 with a point in my q","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-10T18:49:45.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThis issue should be fixed in patch 5.13! :]","replies":[]},{"poster":"LittleGrimmie","date":"2015-06-27T05:41:11.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've experienced this bug as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kue Lapis","date":"2015-06-27T03:29:30.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem, i think when once we recalled when burrowed her recalled bug, hope it get fixed soon","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chosen Poro","date":"2015-06-27T01:02:27.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm this it was quite frustrating when I couldn't watch the b animation\nAlso I'd like to add that sometimes as she walks, her snorkels seem to be undone like it extends.
