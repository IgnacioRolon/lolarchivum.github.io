I get to go even. Thanks league. But if she gets fed she proceeds to tower dive me or push me away from the tower and then I get 9 man reported for inting or afking because those were my only two options left.\r\n\r\nAnd yet she's not even a champion I would ever consider banning because there's too much shit out there that's worse.\r\n\r\nThis game is less fun than driving a nail through your hand. Seriously. I fucking hate this game so much I don't know why I come back to play it, it's still fucking shit every single time, the meta somehow is even worse than ever, damage still crazy, balance team still literally braindead. Just fucking shoot me.","replies":[]}
