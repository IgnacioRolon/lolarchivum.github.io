What happens is occasionally if you command your soldier to auto-attack, Azir goes through the commanding animation but the soldier does not auto-attack.  These &quot;disobedient&quot; soldiers negatively affect Azir&#039;s gameplay through either missing CS or damage to an enemy champion.  If I can find a way to reliably reproduce it, I shall edit it in.  It does occur in all of his skins, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-12-03T20:09:20.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, this should be fixed for next patch.
