I'm glad that you guys are remembering everybody's favorite Brackern (I'm just gonna pretend the lore changes didn't happen), and the mana cost reduction on his Q and making his E's CD lower as you rank it will give him a little bit of late game power that he will enjoy.  \r\n\r\nOnly thing I am concerned with is you are forgetting that Skarner can be optimized (with items) for damage as well instead of just as a tank and I figured that maybe the Bonus AD and AP Scaling on his Q could be increased?  It seems you want to target changes toward him to affect him later in a game, well I imagine this would help much (his Q really doesn't do much damage later in the game).  \r\n\r\nIt would also help to alleviate the current problem of building damage on him but not actually gaining much from it (the only damage items he does well with are on-hit effects), thus making Tank Skarner the only option (usually being Triforce -> Tank Items).\r\n\r\nI'm also happy to see buffs to other jungles that many thought were forgotten, so I hope to see the changes on PBE ship to live in a few weeks.  Keep up the great work Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"DanLikesBacon","date":"2014-12-17T02:54:25.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"give back the base damage and scaling on his q and remove the e dmg (seriously 120 base just move it somewhere else) move the e dmg to his passive and keep the cd reduction on e and mana costs and boom skarners back. \n\np.s. also take away the ramp up movespeed on w... like srs","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2014-12-17T03:02:32.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a while back I was in full support of just removing damage off of his E completely (the base is super low, as is the scaling so there's not much point in it dealing damage when his E could be focused for utility).  Still am in support of taking the damage off his E and moving it around (bringing damage back to his Q is something I'd love to see with him, since almost all of the damage he deals comes from either his Q or Basic attacks).  \n\nThe only thing I don't think should happen is increasing the base damage of his Q **at level 1**.  He already clears rather fast and safely as well, but his trouble is in dealing damage to champions as the game progresses.  I think I'm okay with the movespeed ramp up on his W, which is arguably his best skill outside of his Ultimate (big base on it, scales well with AP, can get almost permanent up-time on it with 40% CDR).","replies":[{"poster":"DanLikesBacon","date":"2014-12-17T03:08:30.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"problem with skarner is his q dmg is kind of pitiful in 1v1s imo they should buff the base but reduce the dmg done to monsters by 10-25% to compensate. I can admit that skarner clears the jungle like a beast and over buffs on his q will make him too dominant in clears.\n\nEdit: problem with ramp up movespeed on his shield is that if he chases any champion his shield is very easy to break. Meaning you dont get to take advantage of the movespeed in the first place leaving him very kiteable.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2014-12-17T03:50:55.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see what you mean with his W, but they'd probably lower the movement speed to a value in between what it starts at and what it finishes if they removed the ramp up (might turn out well, might not, we'd have to see what % value they decide is fair).  \n\nAbout his Q, I suppose they could give it the Hecarim treatment (damage reduction versus monsters).\nIncreasing the damage of his Q to what it was before 4.10 (25/40/55/70/85 + 0.8 Bonus AD and 0.4 AP) and adding a damage versus monsters modifier of 75% would keep jungle clear about the same as it is now (slightly faster due to ratios changing but that will not be noticed during your first few clears), and if need be they can just strip his E of damage entirely.  \n\nHe'd be a much more potent duelist with that type of buff (giving him the diversity he had before; Being a Tank and building CDR for his CC or building damage items to be a sticky duelist).  I'd probably find myself opting to build more damage on him than I do now because of it (would be nice since Devourer is the only jungle item that really compliments him).","replies":[{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-02-09T22:44:44.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removing the initial weak hit is another thing they should do.

I'm definately behind that, though. Perhaps we could finally start building Skarner without tear/chalice; now THAT would be a huge buff in and on itself.\n\nOn the issue of Q tho, Skarner has this really odd breakpoint at 1 Q / second that once you reach it, it gets neigh impossible to get it out faster (in an ideal champion facetanking situation), which definitely supports upping the scalings, especially since it almost feels like building high AP is a trap.","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2014-12-17T23:26:11.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never been forced to build Tear or Chalice on him before due to mana constraints, but with certain builds (mostly when I build him to tank) mana does get very tight until I finish Trinity Force and Frozen Heart.  The mana cost reductions will definitely ease the pain of having to spam your Q whenever it is available.\n\nI want to see ratios increased on his Q just because it feels like you don't get much damage for building damage, so the only build that Skarner really supports is tank because of his low scalings, but he doesn't sport the base damage that others do (base damage of his Q is only 116 damage at rank 5 if you have your Q charged once, it gets used about once a second.  Compare this to the likes of Hecarim who's Q does more damage, can itemize CDR for a similar cooldown, and can itemize for penetration if necessary as well).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-16T23:26:11.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hecarim and Eve suffer from similiar issues....\n\nI used wished they'ld create a tank item with bonus movementspeed an an on-ability damage bonus (with an inbuild CD to avoid making it popular on Riven, Cass or Karthus)","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-12-16T23:47:59.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hecarim and Eve were buffed in the PBE as well :)  (both buffs were very much needed). \n\nAlso as a head's up, Zz'rot portal is tanky with MS (near turrets only though). There's no on-ability bonus, although I like that that's mostly limited to Sheen items. \n\nI don't think Hecarim suffers too severely from this though. I often build Hecarim\nWarrior Enchant > Sheen> T1 Boots > Iceborn Gauntlet > T2 Boots> Spirit Visage & Randuins Omen (order depending on enemy team) > Boot enchant > Selective 6th item (Ghostblade, BotRK, Warmog's Armour, Sunfire Cape, Banshee's Veil, Thornmail, Ohmwrecker, etc...) \n\nYou build damage early because it helps the most with camp clears and early ganks. You build armour/mr mid because Hecarim is going to engage the back line of teamfights with his ultimate (even if you're way ahead and are going to carry hard, you'd be crazy not to dive the back line with an ult that impactful) and if you want to survive back there against a remotely decent adc/apc you're going to want armour/mr. Building at least 1 armour and 1 mr item will actually increase your overall damage output more than building offense because you'll be able to stay on the back line longer and contribute more. \n\nAgainst full AD I'll build frozen heart instead of spirit visage if you're wondering (I won't if I build spirit visage because it would put me at 50% CDR which isn't worthwhile - although against heavy poke comps I may do Banshee's+FH instead of SV+Randuins). \n\nIf you're waay ahead I suppose you could build Ghostblade and BotRK 3rd and 4th and only build 1 tanky item (e.g. Zz'rot Portal when it's released, or GA), but I still think building two defensive items will maximize your damage output. I've played plenty of Hecarim games where I have the most total damage dealt and most champion damage dealt on the map as a jungle hecarim (meaning I was at a severe champion damage disadvantage due to not laning).","replies":[{"poster":"HeadHonchkrow","date":"2014-12-17T02:46:37.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve NERF, not a buff\nOr do you mean the E buff?","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-12-17T02:54:59.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry,  all I read was double the rate of mana Regen while stealthed compared to before, and the buff to her e.\n\nWhat did I miss?

If you're over half mana,  how much do you really need to Regen?  If you're under half,  you Regen faster.
