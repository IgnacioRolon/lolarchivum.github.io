If she's broken, forbidding her to be picked isn't the solution, she needs to be fixed. Stop with this stupid argument\n\nAlso played an ARAM game, a Vayne was feeding her ass off in the enemy team, she finally got IE + Shyvv, did a tumble, hit me with a crit and a good 60 / 70% of my hp was gone. Yes, I was a squishy obviously, Zoe if I remember right and 2 levels ahead. I don't know why this should be allowed, but when a burst mage DOES burst damage, he's nerfed to the ground even if enemies can buy \"defensive items\" with offensive stats (PD / Death dance / Hexdrinker / QSS)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheProfezzor","date":"2018-01-12T05:25:50.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why don't you ban her?","replies":[{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2018-01-12T05:29:07.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheProfezzor,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dBnfAQAN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-12T05:25:50.378+0000)\n>\n> Why don&#x27;t you ban her?\n\nI really hate when people say this, as if there aren't other champions that are ban worthy. You only get ONE ban to choose. Maybe he bans someone he doesn't want to lane against, or someone that can easily counter him in lane. Maybe he bans someone else who's op and a pain in the ass.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-12T09:25:50.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You literally ask your 1st pick for this cheesing monster, or straight up out ban her if you think the enemy gets it and if they do D o d g e, she can carry literally 1v5, she's just that good in the good hands. and besides ad items are super cheap. dmg > tank> ap","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-01-12T11:47:05.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remind me why darius needs a a heal\nremind me why azir neds soldiers\nremind me why mordekaiser needs a clone\nremind me why blitz needs a hook\n\nremind me why does this game need to exists","replies":[]}]}
