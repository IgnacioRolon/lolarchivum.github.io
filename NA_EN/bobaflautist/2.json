Allowing enemies to right back would make it possible to put more power in his e or somewhere else.\r\n\r\nJust a thought I had, his Q is pretty clearly supposed to give sticking power but it also makes it harder for enemies to hit him back, which isn&#039;t as mechanically appropriate (Garen welcomes your return blows with his w and his passive, as long as you stay close) or thematically appropriate (a giant sword to the head would make it pretty hard to run anywhere).","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-17T21:35:17.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if Garen Q embedded you in the terrain mesh?\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2018-07-17T21:39:01.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean that's just the word used to describe the effect, it just means you can't jump.
