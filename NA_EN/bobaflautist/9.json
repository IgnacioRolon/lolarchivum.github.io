Often late game can come down to which team protects their adc better, but if you don't want to play that kind of META, you can short-circuit it as a jungler by snowballing the other lanes or stomping the enemy bot before they can get on track.  My perspective is that jungle is most impactful because a wide variance in that role will screw one team really badly.  ANY laner (including bot) can be neutralized with the other lanes doing better (ie. if top and mid are strong but bot is weak, the other lanes can carry, and depending on the overall skill, even 1 can offset if its only the adc that's good in bot).

Not to mention dragons are easier to take with bot winning. Mid Champs {{champion:136}} are frankly just as good at ganking bot as junglers. In the snowball game it still ends up being about bot lane more often then not, just other roles mid/jg actually have agency in this case, so it's not all about bot it's 50% or so about bot. \n\nI main Jungle and many time my laners feel this way, but honestly at least half of the time my ganks are only successful because the opposing laners are bad or because my laners are good and i have to do very little in a gank. It doesn't really matter how well i play either, my laners will still feel this way. I've had games where the opposing jungler is 0/2/1 at 15 mins and i'm 5/0/1 when our team has 7 total kills and literally 2 of the kills were me 2 v 1ing a full health bot lane while mine was dead and in base...

Having a single mage on the enemy team demands an even mix of armor and MR, which in turn increases the damage the rest of the mage's team deals simply because the enemy team cannot stack armor. \n\nJust by picking a mage you are halving the number of item slots a tank or diver has to build armor.

As for marksmen in general I see plenty of tank, tank, mage, support, adc comps in solo queue. This is basically the best comp to win consistently if you don't suck. Tanks + support enable the mage early game roams/skirmishes, then transition to engage/peel for the adc in mid - late game.\n\n> Trying to say that marksmen decide the game is not an expression of their power\n\nThis is almost the explicit opposite of what I said.\n\n> I consider **being able to affect other lanes and snowball the game influential**, while I consider **raw threat to be the strongest **class\n\nMages and junglers decide the direction of the game, but in terms of raw power the adcs have all the pieces after an item or two.
