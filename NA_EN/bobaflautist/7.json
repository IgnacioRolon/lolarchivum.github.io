Let's see...\"","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":386,"down_votes":43,"body":"We&#039;ve got Marksmen, they do damage from far away, beautiful. \n\nWe have Enchanters, they help Marksmen do damage and stay alive, great class. \n\nWardens! That&#039;s a good one. Wardens sit in front of Marksmen and take damage for them. Then there are Wardens that sometimes use their ultimate abilities to start fights before walking back in front of their Marksmen, those are called **Vanguards**. They used to do damage and sometimes actually threaten Marksmen, so we had to nerf all their damage. They still wouldn&#039;t stop trying to fight Marksmen though, so what we did, it was actually pretty cool: we nerfed all their durability and stuck it all on an item that neuters their damage. That way they can&#039;t actually get to Marksmen without either dying or voluntarily cutting their own damage down. Brilliant.\n\n We have Burst Mages, they used to be a huge problem because they&#039;d occasionally actually kill Marksmen, can you believe that? They cut that shit out when we nerfed all their items and buffed Enchanters though, and now they serve the very important role of softening up the enemy team for the Marksmen to kill. Absolutely essential role, actually.\n\nDivers actually had the same problem, they thought they were supposed to actually &quot;dive in&quot; and fight the Marksmen, you wouldn&#039;t believe it. We didn&#039;t want to take their fun away from them, so we just buffed the hell out of Enchanters and now they know on their own to target mages or even just pretend they are a Warden. Feisty little fellows, but they learn quickly if you show them a firm hand.\n\nCatchers...we don&#039;t really like them, nasty pieces of work. We managed to trick them into basically playing as shittier Enchanters though, so we&#039;re enjoying that. As long as they stand by their Marksmen and peel, we&#039;ll leave them alone, and they know that.\n\nBattle mages were tricky. We got a lot of complaints about them, and they&#039;re diverse enough that it was a serious challenge to squash them as a whole. We ended up having to rework them one at a time, just systematically removing most of the damage from their kits. Combined with the item nerfs and Enchanter buffs, they seem to have gotten the message and focused on softening tanks up for Marksmen. Seriously, I&#039;m starting to wonder why we didn&#039;t pump more power into Enchanters sooner, it&#039;s worked wonders.\n\nAssassin&#039;s - don&#039;t make me laugh. This game doesn&#039;t have any assassin&#039;s.\n\nSlayers were actually quite easy, we just had to change all their damage to true damage/dps and they went right for those tanks. Worked out great, it happened right when engage-ultimate-Warde...er, sorry, Vanguards...were getting uppity and aggressive.\n\nJuggernauts were the same story. Just stack armor pen and %hp on their kits, create black cleaver, and they sit right between Wardens and the enemy team, beating up any Vanguards or Divers that try something other than peeling. It&#039;s actually quite sad watching the ones that still haven't figured this out, their feet never touch the ground.\n\nSeriously though, we think we have something great going here. It used to be a dangerous, limiting game for Marksmen but a combination of buffs, systematic nerfs to all their threats, and a ton of raw power pumped into Enchanters has worked wonders.","replies":[{"poster":"coback","date":"2017-09-07T22:18:19.679+0000","up_votes":161,"down_votes":9,"body":"Before you guys downvote.. its actually pretty funny and accurate:P","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-09-07T22:55:10.468+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":66,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=coback,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Tp93vlah,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-07T22:18:19.679+0000)\n>\n> Before you guys downvote.. its actually pretty funny and accurate:P\n\naccurate, yes.\n\nfunny, no.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2017-09-08T00:31:50.401+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's funny if you're one of the like 10 other classes that aren't Marksmen.\n\nOtherwise I assume it makes you salty.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayce Top","date":"2017-09-08T06:24:01.670+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think he means its not funny because its true.

Someone raised a really good point to me on Reddit the other day about Ashe and how she's currently struggling some. He pointed out she's in a weird limbo because of how her passive works. She actually does scale linearly with crit, at least more so than other marksman. As much As I hate to admit it because it was her whole niche, I think it really would be best if all marksmen worked like her. Crit is a gamble, your DPS is based on luck, and to remove that gamble you literally build so much luck that you can not fail. To me that feels like playing a game like Fallout with a full luck build and knowing I'm gonna cripple the enemy every hit because I species into it. Worthless until suddenly it isn't. I think crit is a problem and I know Riot doesn't want to get rid of it but honestly, what have you guys got to lose? Sure I get it it's a lot of work, but so is a ton of the other stuff you guys do. Every season you try to revamp the game bigger and better than ever, so why not just listen to us and try it? You the Devs don't need to be the ones solving every issue. If crit is removed you can scale ADCs linearly with how they should be. Cait and Lucian can start with high as fuck stats that don't really grow at all per level, and champions like Vayne or Kog can get shit stats but gain a lot per level plus gold. Why not give ADCs specific starting items that give them extra XP if they are in a duo lane sort of like what Mord was intended to do, but make it do nothing if you aren't splitting XP so it can't be abused. That way you can have ADC scale with level like everyone else and gold will just boost those scalings with things like % att speed and AD. At this point you guys have made a juggernaut of a game. And look at it this way. If it works, it works, hurray! If it doesn't work, then we deal with it, change it back after the season or at mid season, and forever more if the community says to do it again, you can tell us to shut our mouths! Just, try man.

This is largely because once again, due to Riot's favoritism for ADCs, every Assassin item introduced with the update just became an ADC item because Riot refuses to lock ADCs out of those items, and then the ASSASSIN ITEMS got balanced as if they were ADC items. So now the *targets* of assassins are using assassin's items better than assassins, AND ADCs already had a ton of anti-assassin options, AND Riot made it so GA is not only incredibly easy to build into for ADCs (I mean it builds out of the item almost every ADC rushes) but is cheaper and doesn't hurt their DPS in midgame by a whole lot.

If anything the new divides have just kinda started a ton of arguments over what champs belong in what roles... and even then most champions don't fit neatly into only one or two roles anyway.  It was just kinda wasted effort for no real gain.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-09-08T19:03:06.787+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, why then have categories at all?\nBecause if we are honest, the title \"fighter\" meant literally nothing.\n\nThere was no trait defining what is a fighter and what isn't.

But maybe you can tell me a criteria.\n\nI am coming from a scientific background and if you actually want to organise something, it's important to have a **criteria** to differentiate between the groups. If you don't, your organisation is literally pointless, it has no sense.\n\nThat was the case with the old system. You may feel that there lies no benefit in organising the champions at all, but at least the current system is made in a correct way, using criterias, instead of just randomly putting champions in a category.","replies":[{"poster":"Wildlife1","date":"2017-09-08T19:21:48.225+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion Sol in the fighter list should be a sin","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-09-08T19:27:17.300+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's exactly what I mean.
