Specifically designed with the intention of being able to melt any class, basically unplayable if they can&#039;t shred through tanks quickly because against coordinates play tanks are all they can hit.\n\nJuggernauts: Low mobility sustained burst, have no way past he frontline, are designed around  the assumption that they can _burst_ through durability.l, otherwise they are useless. Their _fucking core item as a class makes tanks less tanky_\n\nDPS Mages: this isn&#039;t really a unified class under riot&#039;s terms, but champs like Cass and Karthus and Zyra are designed to have mediocre to poor backline access, no defensive tools, and backloaded damage, which means, once again, they have to be able to melt through tanks to be playable. They were actually so overtuned against tanks that riot gave tanks an item specifically to counter them (instead of just returning the interaction, because riot) but then made it garbage (again: because riot).\n\nThat right there is four classes which BY DESIGN, without anything else, as just part of the fundamental assumptions integral to their design, HAVE to do be able to kill tanks quickly, when the whole point of playing a tank is that you want to live for a long time.\n\nThat&#039;s not counting divers, which also love black cleaver, for some reason often get attack-speed steroids and heavy repeating damage and have to by their nature be durable enough to ignore a tank&#039;s damage, burst mages which can&#039;t easily kill a tank on their own but can heavily chunk them, and supports whose need to be effective enough to protect their adcs from skirmishers and divers, and therefore just sort of automatically remove the possibility of an adc ever being affected by a tank in any way whatsoever in the late game.\n\nSeeing as riot has decided that tanks should never be able to duel or waveclear, eliminating them from the toplane, and that they shouldn&#039;t have meaningfully clearapeeda or jungle sustain (except Zac and Sejuani) making the jungle feel like shit for them, I&#039;m at a loss as to when Riot wants tanks to feel like they&#039;re actually doing something.\n\nAnd no, band-aid fixes like {{item:3193}} really don&#039;t cut it.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-07-07T03:16:58.398+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think the issue here isn't so much that all of these classes need to kill tanks quickly, so much as it is that many of these classes need to kill tanks quickly... or else they die before being able to contribute. Skirmishers especially are squishy frontliners with situational defenses who will die the moment they're locked down and focused in a teamfight, and both juggernauts and battle mages, who can only become as tanky as tanks (they're usually squishier) will also die quickly when tanks get shredded. The one outlier here is marksmen, who can more or less spend all the time they want shooting enemies from a distance when protected adequately.\n\nThe thing is, tanks dying too quickly is a problem pretty specific to League at this point. Games like HotS, Smite and Dota 2 have tremendously durable tanks, while also having viable equivalents to melee carries, juggernauts and DPS mages on the side at all levels of play. Part of the reason why they succeed is because front lines tend to be a little more porous (most players have a chance of affecting the back line if they play their cards right), but also because the overall amount of damage in the game is at a level where players can fight tanks, take a bit of heat, and still survive for long enough to make an impact in combat, unless they mess up spectacularly. By contrast, damage in League is so high that most champions effectively cannot survive long enough to operate at a natural pace, which is why light fighters, who are supposed to expose themselves to their enemies, only work when they can burst down the back line while avoiding most of their damage.\n\nBecause of this, I think part of the solution should be to actually tone down damage overall, or at least prevent champions from snowballing too quickly to a point where their damage becomes excessive. Creating a front line where champions, including members of squishier classes, can operate without needing either excessive burst or too many defenses, would allow tanks to be tankier without shutting down their targets altogether. I get that it's imperative to avoid noodle fights, but we're way past that stage at this point, especially when most new releases are given some form of innate anti-tank damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-07-07T09:43:32.945+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo this is an issue that popped out the moment life steal and self sustain became a spread and powerful thing.\n\nThat is the point when burst damage had to become \"oneshotting\" because the level of self heals became so high that anything that survived longer than 2 seconds after a burst came back in the fight with all the hp/defenses needed to kill who had fewer than this (which usually are the mages) GW didn't help either as the only item capable of applying it without bringing the enemies in a near death state is an AD item.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-07-07T14:32:34.355+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree, one of the reasons why damage is so high overall right now is because life steal itself is so powerful that its users either die near-instantly, or out-heal the weaker follow-up damage that gets thrown at them, so damage needs to be adjusted so that the first outcome happens more often. High life steal also means marksmen and light fighters end up with extremely high DPS (which is why it's often in burst-per-second territory now), and the end result is an environment where the outcome of a fight is more or less determined within the first few seconds, and is often heavily dependent on stats rather than outplays, which doesn't benefit anyone and is the reason why entire classes feel out of whack right now.\n\nI think the motive behind increasing damage and weakening tanks has been to increase the pace of matches, but while they've been ending faster overall, the game's pacing often feels unnatural, and too snowbally for one side to enjoy it. I also don't think it's worth sacrificing the fantasies of entire classes, as games like HotS and Smite have even shorter average game lengths while still having tanky tanks. If League is to increase its pace, it's going to have to do so through deeper structural changes, rather than \"quick fixes\" to key numbers that achieve the intended goal at far too high a cost.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-07-07T16:41:45.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, your suggestions make so much sense it makes me sad they're not a reality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-07-07T15:10:04.971+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is that you can increase the pace of the game by letting ppl in a \"wounded state\" without them having to recall asap because anything can instakill them the moment they drop under 80% hp.\n\nYou used HotS as an example of a good state of damage and I agree a lot with this, game lenghts anyway aren't just defined by this: Bringing, lets call it, the \"HotS HP/damage ratio\" to LoL would be a huge improvement imo because what's making HotS matches short is just the map size.\n\nHotS maps are like 1/3 of Summoner's Rift and thus any objective becomes a huge factor, not to mention that those maps also have a lot of things speeding the game up (think about having Rift heralds on a 2/3 min CD from the begin of the match).","replies":[{"poster":"lofi n chillhop","date":"2017-07-07T16:49:56.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"^ this this this.

If you died early or got cc-locked, then you probably won the fight, because the enemy team wasted too much damage on you.\n\nNow the play pattern is to dive in, frantically trying to get off your rotation while being chain-cced, then flash out and wait for cooldowns because you'll die before they come up otherwise, then dive in a second time and probably die.\n\nThe prevailing philosophy (among pros and high level players too, not just my shit-tier games) was that thornmail and GA, while powerful, were poor purchases as they discouraged focus and you _wanted_ to be focused.\n\nThen I remember when thornmail was nerfed because tanks were buying it to discourage the adc from just autoing them down when they fought (which Randuins used to prevent) and riot wanted ADCs to be able to safely auto tanks. That's why the slow was taken off tonight passive, randuins and frozen heart have repeatedly had their attack speed slow nerfed, and ga was changed to make it much weaker on tanks. Tanks were so desperate for late game durability, they were buying ga.\n\nI also remember that riot tried to balance tanks around the time of the game when they're supposed to \"Come online\". First the idea was that they are strong mid and late game, because if they were actually tank in the laning phase it wouldn't be fair to players that wanted to kill them. That's why they eventually got balanced around hiding and waveclearing instead of actually \nfighting, because it was deemed unfair for them to be hard to kill when laning.\n\nThen it got deemed bad that they were able to survive so long in the late game, because it made games too slow and besides ADCs had been patiently waiting all game to be strong and it wasn't fair for it to be hard for them to kill a champion with five armor items and a kit designed to make them hard for ADCs to kill without doing much else. \n\nThen it got deemed unfair that they were using their waveclear base damages to actually fight people in the midgame, because a tank focused around the midgame shouldn't be able to dual an adc based around the late game in the midgame, especially when the ADCs team tried to dump damage on them instead of using cc to peel and got upset when they could burst the tank. So their damage got nerfed, and their midgame tankiness got gutted in favor of making them much tankier late game when all the damage threats that shred through any amount of tankiness are present and fully scaled.\n\nSince tanks had no ability to fight people early or midgame, they started building double dorans so that their weakened waveclear could actually work and sitting under their tower, only sticking their heads out to delete waves. The dorans also helped with their shit-tier Mana sustain. Unfortunately, that was \"uninteractive\" because a class that was tuned for seasons and seasons to be unable to actually fight people was refusing to actually fight people so champions like Darius and riven and renekton weren't able to get the 3 free early kills necessary snowball a win against a tank top. So dorans were nerfed.\n\nNow tanks are just kinda accepting that they will be low-income adc-bitches like the support of old and buying support items so that they can maintain their 48% winrates. And we'll all know that riot will respond by being support items, because tanks aren't supposed to do anything beyond engage and immediately die or peel for ADCs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TEKadeo","date":"2017-07-06T22:42:16.832+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Been struggling with this a lot recently as a Sejuani OTP.

I'd say she's probably one of the champions where this problematic trend started, alongside Sion TBH. \n\nIt's only getting worse too, Zac had the CC on his Q strengthened, Sej's rework loaded a ton of extra unneeded CC onto her kit, Maokai's CC was megabuffed and even Rammus had a slow added to his R.
