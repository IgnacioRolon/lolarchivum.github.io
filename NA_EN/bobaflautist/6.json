By contrast, champions like Leona, Nautilus or Rammus are mostly good at locking down one single target really, really hard. These champions play very differently from each other and, most of the time, are also valued for different strengths: the former tank subclass is really good at initiating, for example, because they usually have large AoE hard CC on their ult, whereas the latter is better at roaming and ganking, i.e. dealing with isolated targets.
