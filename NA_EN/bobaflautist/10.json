It also has a high mana cost, so it's considered fair for it to have an incredibly low cooldown for a 0.7 ap ratio ability with a respectable slow to the primary target. \n\nIf a melee champion ever actually closes onto her, she presses W and then they don't. Also she gets another free q onto them. Probably another while they back away. \n\nIf she's facing Irelia, Renekton, or post six Akali or Kassadin, and pressing W does nothing but 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 40% AP) damage + 70 / 100 / 130 / 160 / 190 (+ 70% AP), she presses e, which is not only a ground targeted blink (really really strong for escaping) that can't be blocked or interrupted easily, but also benefits from Leblanc Syndrome thanks to the delay (which admittedly makes engaging harder for her). \n\nLeblanc Syndrome occurs when an ability, such as Leblanc W, or Ryze Ulti, or Lissandra E, has a delayed, targeted blink. The player of the champion insists that the delay makes the ability harder to use, and in some cases, they are right. However, when escaping an enemy without heavy cc or sticking power, the ability says \"Pick a location: Either the place I have telegraphed I can blink, or the place I am now. You are only one enemy, you can only chose one location. Ok, picked it? Wrong!\". The player of the Leblanc Syndrome champion gets to feel super tricky and clever, often crowing about \"THE JUUUUUKES!!!\" while only the enemy champion knows that there was no real choice all along and no way for them to win.\n\nAnyway, back to Lissandra. At level 6, she gets to chose between a targeted Sejuani Ultimate that has damage scaling with her primary stat, or a Zhonya's with damage scaling with her primary stat and hp gain.. No, no, not like Kayne or Kha'zix gets to chose, not at all. No, she gets to chose each time the ultimate is up. Whichever one she chooses actually further aids her ability to not have to pay attention to melee champions in the laning phase.

Good luck fighting him at 85% strength. Beat part is, he can apply this to multiple people, gimping multiple carries. Also, he can do it with unavoidable autos, or a high speed 900 range skillshot on a miniscule cooldown. Do both at the same time, and spread the pain around.\n\nHis q means that, barring a minion wave or tank to hide behind, he will massively outrange and bully his enemy melee top laner. There's almost no cooldown on his missiles, so his primary damage is basically always up.\n\nSo maybe you're tired of getting poked down by his endless stream of missiles every 2 seconds, and want to all in him. His w crushes your hopes of doing so, allowing him to slow you with his missiles and autos, kiting like a god and hard punishing you for disengaging from any trade with him without a dash. Whats that, you needed to use your dash to get through all the slows? Sucks to be you! And when you finally reach him, he has this massive shield that scales with all the mana he's building to missile spam you EVEN HARDER, which you'll struggle to break through even without your damage being reduced by his passive.\n\nSo remember how I said his q can be countered by standing behind some poor sod? I was lying, his e allows those missiles to lock on and increasing their range to absurd distances, rendering his damage even more braindead than a right clicking adc. Besides the lock on, it also takes the liberty of stripping off some of the armour you've been building to survive the constant barrage of intercontinental rockets you're being barraged with. It also deals physical damage in ticks, allowing him to stack his black cleaver to full penetration at ludicrous speeds.\n\nThe cherry on top is his point and click cc that displaces you harder than a blitz hook, shile also giving him a bunch of defensive stats. Whats that, you were standing within a screen of an enemy tower? Enjoy the free tower shots along with enough missiles to make the USA jealous as he lands a guaranteed e, activates his w so you can't run, applies his passive so you can't kill him through the damage reduction, shields, and defensive steroids, and annihilates your health bar. Whats that? You stayed close to your support/tank so they could bail you out? Nah, they're too busy being cc'd by the fear Urgot has on his ult for SOME REASON.\n\nBut no, please tell me more about how the unassailable point and click tanky ranged dps machine tank killer is so hard done by.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2017-07-19T02:50:14.158+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kengadeng,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=10ory18u,comment-id=002c,timestamp=2017-07-18T23:06:52.040+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:6}}\n\nMan this champion is so absurd if not constantly nerfed into the ground.  I mean he's got this super spammy Q which is better than any tool a standard top or midlaner has, who decided he gets to take this thing from Ezreal?  Oh, lets not mention that it has a FREE DEBUFF on it, so if you're an attack dependant champion who's not stacking AD you do basically 0 damage.  And its sooooo spammy, a 2s CD are you crazy Riot? Soooo unfun.\n\nThat's not even mentioning you don't even need to aim it like Ezreal!  E ever hits you for a half second Urgot literally hacks the game and can't miss you ever so you take 99999999999999999 damage per second especially if he builds CDR.  What, you're running low on mana, Urgot too weak for you?  Thats why you have {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}  for days, WHY DOES THIS GUY EVEN HAVE MANA??? Its so OP it even makes his shield scale, he's basically invincible!  Just stack tanky mana items and you do tons of damage, debuff AD, and can't miss!  So fair :O\n\nAlso thats not even mentioning his super powerful Singed flip with FREE STATS!!!!1!  Goes from 120-80s, why did you even give it a CD tahts so short!  Man as if slowing you and debuffing you wasn't enough hes now putting you under tower, so OP.\n\nWhat, you say he's immobile, has no range, you can dodge his E, and he can't start with tear?  Don't let the community fool you, this guy is the most toxic design in the game, his E is literally a DoT and its the size of Lux E, and you know that thing is hyuuuuuuuuuuuge!  His Q is better than his auto you never even need to right click, he's secretly a 1000 range champion, goodbye Caitlyn the real lane bully has arrived :OOO  And even if you run out of mana all the AD from {{item:3042}} means you keep doing damage forever, so unfair.\n\nI mean hell, this guy debuffs you and barely has counterplay before that debuff, he should be so nerfed he can't be picked for 5 years, there's no way you'd have counterplay for a champ as broken as this man - and he was cut into pieces so he knows what broken feels like!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tsa I Fly","date":"2017-07-19T00:26:47.205+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna.\n{{champion:40}}","replies":[{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2017-07-19T01:45:48.703+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A well played Janna doesn't let any melee champion EVER touch her adc. Her Q can single handedly negate powerful engages from the likes of Zac, Jarvan, and her ulti cleans up any leftover mess. You will never fight her, you can't dive her, and you will ALWAYS BE SLOWER THAN HER thanks to her w. Her passive rewards her for hiding behind her adc by letting them back out of fights more effectively, and her E is basically the reason that laning against Janna feels like laning against a _less_ interactive soraka.
