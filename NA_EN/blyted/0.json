If a rework changes the &quot;identity&quot; of a champ I don&#039;t care as long the champ is left in a viable or at the very least a more healthy state\n\n{{champion:113}} new kit is a nightmare that will either be super overbearing or super underwhelming. I understand this champ isn&#039;t the most popular, but why is it ok to leave {{champion:113}} in this state when she was fine before the failed rework?\n\n{{champion:72}} I feel rage bubble up inside me when I think about what was done to this champion. He used to be able to do things now he is nothing but an ult bot. What was done to {{champion:72}} is bad, but the true slap in the face is that after it is clear that this is a failed rework absolutely nothing has been done about it. This basically amounts to game development malpractice I understand that this is a free to play game, but damn.","replies":[]}
