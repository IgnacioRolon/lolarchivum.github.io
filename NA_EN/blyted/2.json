Not a peep from them.\n\nI would've surrendered if they were being sports and say anything to at least appear to regret how the game turned out but nah. They feed and then they want to leave ASAP. The game is no longer worth the effort they put in. So as a punishment, i play the game till the end, even if it's a known loss.

I don't care about inflating their egos and scores for their chests and keys while i am losing either way and getting nothing in return. If they want to screw around, bot games exist for a reason. Enemy teams that do end up screwing around and chasing kills instead of finishing the game, give the opposing losing team a real chance at getting back into the game because sooner or later, those champions with bounties will start to die due to overextending. Then they'll gradually start losing the individual leads they had, they'd have trouble contesting objectives and even more trouble grouping together.\n\nThis is the number one way on how to throw a game.\nYou dick around because you think that's fun and then you're the one losing the game.","replies":[]}]}]}
