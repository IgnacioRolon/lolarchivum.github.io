If you dodge, then you're letting a troller go ruin another person's game, all while punishing yourself. It's just as bad as being the troll. So do us all a favor, and next time stick through it so you can actually make a difference and report the troll, rather than being a selfish bystander and pushing your problems onto other people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krully","date":"2018-10-05T14:26:54.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd take 5 minutes over a (if lucky) 15 minute - 20 minute + wait","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-10-05T07:36:34.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Goblin Ranger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qFhRVOxp,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-05T06:40:00.735+0000)\n>\n> so you support dodging, which is punishable in many ways?\n\nThey're still being punished the same though?

Once a day is enough to become irritated by such a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2018-10-05T17:35:50.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"once a day is still pretty constant.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-10-05T14:30:36.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you’re below Masters, anything can work.
