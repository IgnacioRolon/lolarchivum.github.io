Exaggerating a bit? There is no way he was able to dish out such a big amount of true dmg in less than a second?\n\nAssuming max attack speed, without counting Lethal Tempo and whatnot that can break the speed limit (but we're trying to max the true damage anyway, so it probably doesn't even matter). So 2 attacks at max upon first contact. Obviously, we also consider Yi to also use Conqueror for the sake of bloating the stat.\n\nAnd for the sake of convenience, we also pretend that Yi has all of the OTHER reasonable true damage sources available on himself in the said contact. Just going for the extreme case. So we will also include Challenging Smite OR Chilling Smite, Infinity Edge, Crest of Cinders (here we assume Yi has max level), and Aspect of the Dragon (for the sake of its calculation, we will also assume Yi is so good he in fact has killed all of the match's 5 dragons with 0 for the enemy team), as well.\n\nTo deal 1800 true damage within 2 AA hits in the first second of Yi's contact with an enemy:\n\n* Aspect of the Dragon in this case will provide 45*5/3 = 75 true damage burn in that 1 second.\n* Crest of Cinders provides the burn of 114/2 = 57 true damage in that 1 second, at champion max level.\n* Chilling Smite deals 166 true damage instantly upon cast at max champ level, while Challenging Smite deals 162/3 = 54 true damage per second at champ max level. For the sake of going for the extreme, we will choose Chilling Smite as the one Yi went with.\n* Let us assume this Yi is a crit Yi, because otherwise the Infinity Edge wouldn't even work: A crit Yi full build probably looks like something like this: {{item:1416}} /{{item:1419}}  + {{item:3006}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} \n * This means he at full build and max level, Yi has a total AD of 117 + 45 + 60 + 70 (+35)## = 327 AD; and the bonus AD from item is 45 + 60 + 70 (+35)## = 210 AD. Which would also mean Yi passively gets an increase of 327 x 0.1 = 32.7 AD from the max level E Passive making his total AD 327+ 32.7 = 359.7 AD with a total bonus AD of 210 + 32.7 = 242.7, and so his max level E Active would grant him 50 + 0.35 x 242.7 = 134.945 true damage per AA. Thus with this build, over 2 AA, Yi deals a total of 134.945 x 2 = 269.89 true damage.\n * Since with Stormrazor, IE and Shiv, let us assume Yi crits for both of his 2 AAs on his targets for the sake of simplicity and again, driving to the extreme: This would mean Yi deals 4 x 359.7 = 1438.8 AD from 2 critical strikes, with 10% converted into true damage by IE => 1438.8 x 0.1 = 143.88 true damage from 2 crit AAs. _This will be revised later._\n* Now, Conqueror. Let us also assume that Yi was doing something else and was able to trigger Conqueror the instant they make contact with the enemy champion, which is why I included the (+35)## bonus AD in all of the previous calculates in regards to his AD; but it's going to be a pain in the ass to try and compute nonetheless:\n * Let us assume Yi also uses Q during that 1 second, and it also magically crits just like his other AAs because he's such a lucky person => 359.7 x 1.6 + 165 = 740.52 physical damage. I recall that IE will also consider crit Yi Q as a crit and calculate accordingly, for the sake of simplicity I will just use the magic number 28% scaling that is when both IE and Conqueror both procs and so 740.52 x 0.28 = 207.3456 true damage.\n * There is the Shiv, which we also assume it'd crit'ed. Thus it would deal 140 x 2 = 280 magic damage. I think it will also react to both IE and Conqueror too => 280 x 0.28 = 78.4 true damage.\n * Remember how I said the AA section would be revised, because Conqueror fucks every simple calculations up. We will still use the 1438.8 physical damage from 2 critical strikes as calculated below, but now to add in Conqueror for the true damage conversion: 1438.8 x 0.1 + 1438.8 x 0.1 x 2 x 0.2 = 201.432 (I think that's the formula?) true damage would be our new value for the AA interaction with IE and Conqueror.\n\nNow, I think I've got everything there... maybe not. But I think I do anyway.\n\nSo, how much **true damage** can Yi do in this 1 second?\n\n75 + 57 + 166 + 269.89 + 207.3456 + 78.4 + 201.432 = \n\n#_**1055.0676 TRUE DAMAGE. **_\n\nA 1800 - 1055.0676 = 744.9324 difference from the claim with a margin of 744.9324 / 1800 = 0.41385 = 41.385% margin of error from the claim.\n\nAnd remember! This is if Yi is level 18 and completely full build already, simply assumed to have maxed AS without even attempting to calculate his actual AS, has all of the true damage in the world, is the best Yi in the world and plays that match completely perfectly, and is also the luckiest man ever to crit for every single strike against the enemy in that 1 second, and have all the stars in the universe align so everything procs in just that 1 moment.\n\nMaybe Yi will score higher true damage output on other slightly different setup, maybe. Maybe I made some errors here and there in my post which can alter the conclusion to varying extent. But I can't be bothered to go through this calculation again.\n\n**But for the time being I rate the \"1800 true damage in 1 second\" claim as false.**","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2018-08-30T15:56:17.517+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your calculations are far from accurate, tho.\n\nFirst of all, with max AS you easily attack three times withtin first second (0.0, 0.4 and 0.8 seconds).\n\nSecond, you didn't include guinsoo, which doubles Wuju's true damage on every second strike, adds more AD than GA lategame and it's own on-hit, which get's conqueror'd*.\n\n3rd, you also ignore bloodrazor, which obviously gets conq'd, and on a lategame tank (rammus is in question) can add another ~200 true damage on it's own (4000\\*0.04\\*6*0.2). 6 is on-hit procs here, but I'm not sure if you can't do 7 of those actually with guinsoo.\n\nWhen you add this all, you can easily see that if Yi still can't do 1800 true damage to a tank in 1 second, than he can do it in 1.2s (for 4th auto)...\n\nAnd we are _STILL fucking missing_ a TON of possible damage sources, like cutdown rune that can increase that damage by another 12% (conq and infi for sure, not sure if wuju), and/or gathering storm (at minute 50 with guinsoo stacks and wuju passive it gives almost a _hundred_ AD (possibly more with drakes), which gives 200+ true damage from wuju alone, and more from infi and conq).\n\nLeague damage calculations are so incredibly complicated that the only way to go is to hop into a practice tool and see for yourself (but then replace bloodrazor with warrior, or dummy's hp bloats the score), than you can easily see how 1800 true damage in one second is perfectly possible - although probably doesn't happen often.\n\nBut the bottom line here is, that ammount of true damage in the game, especially on champs like Yi is absolutely bullshit, regardless of how much off OP was.\n-----\n* also a way more common purchase, according to probuilds","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-08-30T20:56:17.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you do understand that just stacking armor is pretty much useless without any hp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2018-08-30T19:37:07.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why does that even matter?

Then, add the ridiculous unmitigated true damage to that and you&#x27;ll be all set.\n> \n> This is why true damage is bad, kids.\n\n1st problem: Yi is not an assassin (not with on-hit build), he is a duelist (although admittedly one of the best duelists in the game). An assassin flanks or jumps an unsuspecting target and instantly deletes them with frontloaded burst. You know how on-hit Yi works? He is a god duelist PROVIDED HE STACKS GUINSOOS AND CONQUEROR. When he does that, yes his upfront damage is close enough to be considered burst. However, what assassin has to stay and charge up in full view of enemies? A Rengar ults, you don't know where he'll pop up and BOOM, your ADC is dead. A Zed W's in from fog of war, R's your ADC and disappears, followed by your ADC's death. \n\nYi? He sits around in lane, slowly autoattacking in full view to barely keep himself at max stacks. He also has to fight within 3 seconds from his last autoattack, if he does. If that is not telegraphed enough I don't know what is. It means he will win nearly every 1v1 that comes to stop him, but it also means he's not going to unexpectedly assassinate anyone (and you can go gangbang him instead).\n\nCrit Yi is a burst assassin, relying on a surprise Flash-AA-Q-AA followed by resetting Qs in the teamfight for wiping out squishies but that's no longer meta.\n\n2nd problem: That build stinks. You cannot go glass cannon with on-hit Yi because he relies on ramp-up before dishing out the unholy damage people complain about. You don't survive lategame to ramp up with 2 defense items, let alone glass cannon. On top of that, who the fk mixes crit with on-hit, they don't even synergize with each other.\n\n3rd problem: The build is horribly expensive. It requires snowball early and if you snowball early, chances are you should have ended the game and don't need those items. You are buying the Ferrari of crit build and the Lamborghini of on-hit build together in the same build, and they don't even synergize with each other. \n\n4th problem: You are playing on the assumption Yi's ult is actually used for the full 7 seconds. Guess what? Yi has to use part of his ult for gapclosing because using Alpha Strike for gapclosing lets you get kited by any simple dash/flash which is pretty much on half of the roster. And you won't survive to chase with the squishy build above anyway. Zhonya's on one person pretty much totally cucks him already, since they nerfed the duration of Highlander unless he scores a takedown at the start of the fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2018-08-30T21:12:05.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The JigSAW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gBXR6N9E,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-08-30T11:46:34.811+0000)\n>\n> No assassin\n\nTwo words in and your post is already wrong smh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suzuken","date":"2018-08-30T20:58:06.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The JigSAW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gBXR6N9E,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-08-30T11:46:34.811+0000)\n>\n> No assassin should have true damage or attack speed immunity in their kit.  Riot has no clue how to design and balance assassins, it gets more obvious every single day.  I was looking at that build to judge the true damage, but you know what would be worse than that?\n> \n> {{item:3153}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3046}} {{item:1419}} {{item:3006}} {{item:2140}} - No reason to build armor pen since true damage isn&#x27;t physical.  This combination would do far more damage to high health champions, combining BOTRK + Bloodrazor&#x27;s 4% max health on-hit and rageblade&#x27;s double on-hit with infinity edge (10% of damage as crit) plus Conqueror rune (AD boost, true damage) - Now, as far as the numbers?\n> \n> - With Bloodline you gain 8% lifesteal over the game, combine that with BOTRK and you end up with 20% lifesteal overall.  That&#x27;s equal to a Bloodthirster.  \n> - Attack speed: 40% + 25% (and when stacked, 48% on rageblade) + 45% + 50% + precision bonus and ult = 2.5 \n> - On-hit damage would include true damage as well as 5 + 10% bonus ad + 5 + 10% bonus AP + 8% current health + 4% max health and adds 12% less damage from the victim due to PD passive, which also enhances his already unable to be slowed movement speed. \n> - Crits equal 10% crit damage converted to true damage added to the basic attacks\n> - AD amount would be around ~250 plus the E bonus plus Rageblade bonus plus Conqueror bonus, so you&#x27;d hit for this every 2.5 seconds\n> \n> So with elixir and conqueror&#x27;s bonus AD, you&#x27;re basically dead within two seconds.  Armor means nothing, the more health you build the quicker he&#x27;ll cut through it, and you can&#x27;t slow him or his attack speed.  A 4,000 health champion takes 160 damage off Bloodrazor per hit, plus 8% current health (320 on 4,000) and then you also remember conqueror switches 20% of your damage to true and adds up to 35 AD bonus.  So Rammus, Malphite, anybody really would die quickly and stuns usually last a grand total of 1-1.5 seconds - his ult lasts 7 and adds 7 every kill/assist.  To stop his ult, you&#x27;d need a Malphite ult (1.5)+ Rammus taunt(2.25 max rank) + Xerath(2 max) or Veigar (2.5)stun + another stun every time he ults.  \n> \n> The attack speed immunity is one thing that needs to go.  Then, add the ridiculous unmitigated true damage to that and you&#x27;ll be all set.\n> \n> This is why true damage is bad, kids.\n\nbut how often do you see a yi get to that point ? Yall are being absurd. Any champ with full build can be a nightmare. Look at assassin kayn, full build he can kills adc in 0.5 secs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-08-30T21:06:01.217+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yi is meant to counter champions who are supposed to counter his class, if that makes sense.
