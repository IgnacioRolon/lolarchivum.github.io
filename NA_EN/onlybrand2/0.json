So, every time I get into the champions select its fine and everything else is fine too. But when the loading is about to start the league of legends client just disappears and the reconnect client appears straight away, every time you press on the ''reconnect'' button it just makes the sound effects and no action happens. This issue has caused me low-priority matchup and loss of LP when it is really not my fault and I have no idea what should I do because I have tried everything to fix this issue. Any suggestions will be taken and listened to, thanks for help and good luck on the fields of justice :).\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards, Lolzgamer777","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T20:34:13.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes that's no good! It almost sounds like your network couldn't get a signal from our servers whatsoever anymore if it couldn't even attempt to reconnect.
