To start my post off I just wanted to say its amazing at where this company has gone! Okay now to the discussion. My account has been banned over a year ago. Yes, I had somewhat toxic behavior but I know I'm not the one who gets to decide but I feel it was wrong due to no warning. Most of the time in chat that I was toxic was to my own friends as a joke to get a reaction. I will say i feel as a person I have matured but I know my intentions were pure. I could give the sad story of how I spent time and money investing in that account but even now I feel the mature thing would be to appeal. This post means alot to me and yes it would suck if I got banned for good but is there any way to reform or prove that im worthy. Thank you for your time and i hope we can come to agreeable terms! Happy 10","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-10-16T20:42:34.865+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**In short: **Nope.

You should have taken them seriously. Sorry man, that sucks you got permabanned, but dont feel bad for your actions. You arent like a bad person or anything for fucking around with your friends. You just broke league's very specific rules for in game behavior. It has no bearing on you as a person as a whole. The only lesson you should take, is that you need to arm yourself with knowledge and use that knowledge to your advantage. If you were just ignorant of the rules, then thats the lesson, dont let yourself be ignorant. Knowledge is power! Lol. If you knew what you were doing was against the rules, then the lesson is to take responsibility for your actions. You brought it on yourself, and you have to accept the consequences. But NEVER take Riot's rules as a lesson in morality. They are specifically designed to deter toxicity IN GAME. They are not a moral code to be followed in real life.\n\nGood luck with Riot support. I can imagine that would be pretty cool to get your account back, but dont get your hopes up. They reverse your punishment, then they set a precedent that players who are permabanned can get unbanned by simply making support tickets and saying anything that \"sounds good\" to appease support and increase the chance of getting unbanned... which sort of wrecks the integrity of the concept of consequences for breaking the rules. But maaaybe they will reduce it to a 14 day ban, since it escalated from chat restrict to permaban.

Your ban will not be lifted, as its purpose is to get you to quit the game and leave the community forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryzid","date":"2019-10-17T15:14:37.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"To debunk this as much as I can.

This is based on knowledge gained from previous punishment systems, which gave a lot more chances but didn't result in more reform.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-17T00:20:55.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryzid,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1gTTg1fc,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2019-10-17T00:02:19.171+0000)\n>\n> I honestly agree with this post, I think for what I did the consequence was almost extreme if you will.
