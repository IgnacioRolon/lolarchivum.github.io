I checked my internet service and everything was running smoothly on my end. But due to this inconvenience i got banned multiple times for \"leaving the game\". I was hoping that you could take these 20 minutes timers off.

Internet and laptop are working fine, but I randomly disconnected from the loading screen, and reconnected to a remade game that gave me a five game low priority queue. Can you help me?\n\nI created a ticket too (#32534901) but I know it won't be answered anytime soon with preseason stuff going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T22:35:10.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, what OS is this on?
