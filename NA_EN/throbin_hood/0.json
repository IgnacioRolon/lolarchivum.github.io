Yesterday when I was playing league I had my normal ping 31ms-40ms. I have restarted my router multiple times which has not fixed the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Shamill666","date":"2016-08-13T19:05:03.261+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Myself, and a few people I know, are having the exact same issues.

I have tried everything described in the connection issues support thread, among other things, and nothing has made a difference. The only thing i can think of for an explanation is there might be a problem with our ISP, virgin media. However I have no other internet issues whatsoever, only high ping in League.","replies":[{"poster":"Dariuskii ","date":"2016-08-14T19:12:26.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep im that friend {{champion:119}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:7}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3031}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khyy","date":"2016-08-15T18:46:59.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem seems to have fixed itself now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonFox","date":"2016-08-19T00:46:55.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having very similar issues. It is stopping me from playing my ranked games, sitting at Silver IV with 100LP and I can't go into ranked because I don't want my games ruined by this ping issue. Clearly it isn't just me that's having it and it NEEDS to be sorted out. I'll start a game with 27 ping at a constant, as it always has been, then not in 10 minutes in, it'll be bouncing from 150 - 600 for the rest of the game and ruin everything I try to do. Considering I play a lot of Ahri {{champion:103}} I'm not able to land skillshots or make plays.\n\nPlease, please! Riot fix this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"7oooThresher7","date":"2016-08-16T21:55:59.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ping jumps to around 500 for me too.
