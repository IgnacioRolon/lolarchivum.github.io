Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n...But really, honor your teammates if you truly think they deserve it. its a great little motivation booster and personally when i get one i think about what i did to earn it that game, and then i use that information for future games. its a great way to promote positivity . its a great way to let a support know you like what they did in lane, and maybe motivate them to continue to support. we all know good supports are hard to come by, so show them some love\r\n\r\nthis goes for all of your teammates as well. this system is underappreciated\r\n\r\ni do think we need some more banners out there, i hardly see any banner&#039;d names.","replies":[{"poster":"Akaliholic","date":"2017-04-18T00:26:09.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with the honor system is that there is no reward for honoring people. Humans are selfish in general, most only will use a feature if there is something in it for them. And to make matters worse, many people feel like its all their team's fault when something goes wrong, which makes them very unlikely to want to do something positive. \n\nRiot needs to rebuild the system keeping those two things in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2017-04-22T02:35:43.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet, there _is_ a reward for reporting someone!\n\nWhen a player gets that notice that pops up thanking them for helping to get some poor fool punished, they are being rewarded for expressing their negative emotions towards others.\n\nBut there is no notice thanking a player for helping someone get honored - no reward for expressing your positive emotions towards others.\n\nSo I have to agree.  The current system is like an episode of the Twilight Zone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-04-17T20:46:34.202+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's literally pointless though.\n\nLike, you don't get any benefit for getting commendations.\n\nOnce the system is reworked and actually DOES something impactful for good players, then people might just use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-04-18T00:28:04.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are currently reworking it.

Teamwork. They talk but only strategy? Helpful. If they do talk and are nice to everyone? Of course friendly! \n\nBut sadly... I haven't received many honors this entire month. It sort of makes me sad to be completely honest, I consider myself a very friendly person and I find it sad that people don't take their time to honor a teammate- it only takes a second!\n\nSo let's try to spread the honor around, and make the Rift a more enjoyable place to play. \n\nI'm sorry that was really cheesy.  ^^^ {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Myrkrvaldyr","date":"2017-04-18T02:32:33.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always honor in every match since there's at least one person who's useful, before the 8 month break I took I used to get honored a lot, got  440 teamwork honor right now.
