I wanted to tell a story that was about a champion relationship that I have always found intriguing myself, which is why I&#039;m writing about Vi.\n\nI really don&#039;t want to spoil anymore of the story so if anyone is confused about anything, just ask me below. Please enjoy and all feedback is welcome and appreciated!\n\nAct One --- Part One\nJaded\n\nPiltover. The City of Progress. Oh how times have changed. \n\nThis city used to mean something. I used to mean something.\n\nWay back when, I ran--- no, I _was_ the patrol. I protected this city.\n\nNow look at me. Chief babysitter of Piltover PD. Relegated to a cushy corner office with a view. And what a view it is.\n\nI remember when I could sit on the roof and look out at the smoky Piltover skyline. Enjoy the occasional passing dirigible. \n\nThese days the only smoke for miles comes from the remains of whatever arson took place the night before. \n\nEven as I glance out at the city before me, it&#039;s hard to tell where the black plumes originated with so many bars covering the windows.  Oh how times have changed.\n\nWhat used to be the techmaturgical leader of Valoran, Piltover has devolved into a pit of anarchy and bedlam. \n\nThey won&#039;t even send me home without an escort. That&#039;s probably what I hate the most. Relying on children to walk me home. They&#039;re too afraid I&#039;ll get sniped from one of a dozen abandoned buildings in my district, or at the very least, get jumped behind the opera house.\n\nWhat I wouldn&#039;t give to get jumped. To throw down the gauntlets one more time.\n\nBut I suppose thirty years in the League and ten years behind a desk will do that to you. It wears you down.\n\nI can&#039;t recall a time when my bones didn&#039;t ache. When there wasn&#039;t a limp in my stride. When I let my hands do the talking.\n\nNow I&#039;m lucky if I wake up without the arthritis setting in. What a cruel joke, putting up with arthritis and I don&#039;t even have all my fingers left. \n\nThat&#039;s a story for another time though.\n\nThe point is, as much as I hate to admit it, sometimes part of me believes I need that escort. \n\nSo what happened to Piltover? Why are factories burning every week? Why are officers getting gunned down in the street?\n\nDespite popular opinion, it wasn&#039;t the collapse of the Institute of War. Nor was it our ensuing \"dispute\" with Gangplank over control of our coastal marshes. Not even the imminent threat of an invasion from Zaun was enough to plunge our city into chaos. I made damn sure of that.\n\nNo, there was only one thing I couldn&#039;t stop in all my years of service. My single greatest failure in life. The one that got away.\n\nHer.\n\nAt the time we didn&#039;t know what to call her. What do you call someone who vandalizes a zoo one week, then brings down a commercial blimp the next?\n\nEventually, the city settled on an official moniker: Jinx. If I didn&#039;t know any better, I could have sworn she liked that name. \n\n\"Piltover&#039;s Greatest Criminal\" they would say. I wholeheartedly disagree on this matter. \n\nThe way I see it, crimes are committed for a purpose. No matter how cruel, or selfish, or unusual, every crime happens for a reason. \n\nWhat Jinx did... what she is... she was no criminal. Criminals have intent. \n\nJinx was a plague. No agenda. No interests in the city to even speak of. She was just bored. \n\nNobody cared much when her antics amounted to nothing more than arbitrary vandalism or destruction of private property. They didn&#039;t see her for what she really  was---a virus, infecting the denizens of Piltover.\n\nWhen the manhunt finally started, nobody really tried to find her. Everyone, especially the younger crowd, wanted to see what she would do next. The city found her fascinating. \n\nOne caper after another, she would incite the rambunctious nature of the next generation of Piltover. \"Jinx\" tags began popping up all over the city. Everyday, I&#039;d find more and more kids dying their hair that horrendous shade of  blue. Even I didn&#039;t realize how bad things were getting at the time.\n\nEverything changed after the treasury. \n\nOvernight, the city snowballed into pandemonium. Riots broke out in every district. \n\nFor two days, Cait and I struggled to quell the adolescent uprising. I never fought so hard in my life. \n\nSlowly but surely, peace was restored to the city. \n\nThe workers went back to their factories. The scientists returned to their labs. The youngsters, the ones that we could save, went back to school. \n\nHowever, despite all the work that went into rehabilitating our youth, Piltover was never the same again. \n\nOver the years the younger generations grew less interested in preserving the city&#039;s techmaturgical prowess, and more focused on stirring up trouble. Nobody wanted to grow up an inventor or a peacekeeper anymore. \n\nJinx&#039;s plight single-handedly led to the downfall of our entire society. \n\nAnd I couldn&#039;t do a damn thing about it. \n\nThe law became a fickle construct, and the lawmen along with it. I can count on my mutilated hand the number of people I still trust to protect this city. \n\nHere comes one of &#039;em now. \n\n\"Chief,\" says Masa. \"You&#039;re gonna wanna see this.\"\n\n\nReady for part two?\n(http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/7EEzRvgw-fan-fiction-piltover-the-one-that-got-away-ii)","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-27T06:33:47.390+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooh - an older Vi looking back at the city and how it all went bad.  Very interesting - and I can see the stylistic influence of the Burning Tides writing too!  You really got into the swing of that.\n\nI admit, when reading, that I thought that the adolescent uprising was going to be detailed a bit more - I had expected that what had started out as a peaceful protest was mishandled and/or misunderstood, mistakes were made on both sides, and an innocent life was lost.  At that point, the police was no longer seen as the protectors of the people, but the thing that the people needed to protect themselves from.  With the goodwill of the people eroded, things would go downhill from there.\n\nYou seemed to go quite quickly to a downright massacre - implied by the fact that only some of the teenagers were saved.  That seems pretty horrific and I'd have imagined that a civilian death toll that high (especially of beloved children of the city) would have resulted in an almost complete dissolution of the police force.  Maybe Piltover would react differently, but I get the feeling that even with Jinx's influence, the people of Piltover probably love/d their children very very much.  (Youthful riots in Noxus might warrant more of a 'message' being sent, but I imagine Noxus would have sought to channel that youthful energy at their enemies instead.)\n\nAm I a too soft-hearted creature to hope that Ekko is going to enter the picture here?  With a one-way trip back in time to before the massacre so that old-Vi can meet young-Vi and try to change the path that the city has taken?  Eh, I can dream :)","replies":[{"poster":"Morning Sword","date":"2015-07-27T08:52:33.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, thank you so much for reading!\n\nConcerning the adolescent uprising, I didn't intend to make the event sound so grim... whoopsie. I wanted to give the impression that the younger generation of Piltover, the ones that were heavily impressionable at the time, were being influenced by Jinx's rebellious attitude. This created a change in the social climate, kind of like how rock n' roll made teenagers more rebellious in the 60's.  While I'm not saying terrible stuff didn't go down the nights after the treasury, I prefer to leave the details up to the imagination.  \n\nWhat Jinx took away from the people of Piltover was more than simply a few lives. She took away the city's future. Explorers like Ezreal, inventors like Jayce, peacekeepers like Caitlyn---the very symbols of what the City of Progress could achieve---all of these role models were replaced by Jinx. Everything that Piltover stood for, the younger generations no longer found important. So it's not so much the people of Piltover turning on the police or any type of authority figure, but more like they turned their back on themselves and what made them special as a society. While this does not present any immediate danger, the damage caused by such a dramatic shift in the ideals of an entire generation is far-reaching and almost impossible to reverse, which makes Jinx's actions all the more potent.  \n\nI think I would best describe Jinx as a cancer: she brought new life to the city, but that's not always a good thing.  Eh hopefully that doesn't sound as crude as I think it does. \n\nI admit that I probably could have elaborated more on what happened during the actual downfall event, but lets just say there are plans for exploring that part of Vi's life later down the road. \n\nI really love the concept of a cameo by Ekko and what kind of arc that would present to Vi, but I'm not a Marvel comic so I'd prefer not to have to deal with retconning the story @...@. When something meaningful happens in my story, I want it to stay meaningful ^__^\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts and if you wanna know more, you know where to find me!","replies":[]}]}]}
