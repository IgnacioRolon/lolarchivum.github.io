Because of this, I have lost 45 LP and receive 4 leavers in my history which resulted in a lower priority queue. I'm not a tech-savvy person and because of this, I don't know what is wrong. I've tried using google and people have said to uninstall the windows update because the windows update might be the issue, but it isn't for me because my laptop/client still freezes completely at the start of the game. I'm desperately looking for step-by-step help to get this resolved.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-08-27T00:19:59.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! I just saw this. I have the same rig. I also had the same problem. Go to league, and right click select Troubleshoot Compatability.

However, I'm still a bit worried to queue up for a normal/ranked game because I already accrued 4 leavers in the past couple days and currently on a 5 game low priority queue.","replies":[{"poster":"hypermonkieboi","date":"2016-08-26T23:48:11.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hypermonkieboi,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=JF2NIzdi,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-26T22:56:05.190+0000)\n>\n> I was successfully able to start the custom match without freezing up.

Pretty frustrated about the low priority queue, but I only have 4 more left. Porocles, you are officially my favorite Rioter. I didn't have to go through all the nonsense I found from other sources that said to \"update BIOS and update drivers\" (no clue what it means since I'm not tech savvy)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hypermonkieboi","date":"2016-08-26T22:51:26.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for tip. Yes, I do believe it has to do with the windows update because I never had this issue prior to it. I've already uninstalled the update and the issue persisted and I just disabled the xbox app and I'm currently testing my game in a custom.","replies":[]}]}
