During my first promo game, at around the twenty minute mark, my game completely froze along with my laptop (MSI GE62 APACHE) and I had to do a force shutdown. Unfortunately, I was unable to reconnect in time because the game already ended and it resulted in a loss. I queued up again and my game froze again at around the 20 minute mark and had to force shut down. I tried ctrl-alt-delete, but the frozen game screen took priority over any other tab I had opened. Luckily my team was able to win without me,but I wouldn't risk queueing again until I get this fixed. I think it has to do with my laptop but I'm not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T00:27:06.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does your laptop have a G-Sync display?
