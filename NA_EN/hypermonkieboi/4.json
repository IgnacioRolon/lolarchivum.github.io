However, the freezing started happening again in 3 games in 3 days. My game would freeze at exactly the 19:31 mark and I'm forced to hold the power button and restart my laptop. I've tried all the solutions in the FPS guide but my FPS doesn't seem to be a problem since my game froze just now. Like I stated in my previous post, I'm not a tech-savvy person so I need help with fixing this. The video I posted isn't mine, but the video is the same video I linked in my previous post from a few months ago. I hope that I can get a solution ASAP before the season starts. \r\n\r\nLink to previous post:\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/JF2NIzdi-issue-regarding-msi-ge62-2qd-apache-pro","replies":[{"poster":"hypermonkieboi","date":"2016-12-08T07:16:58.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I was able to resolve it by changing to compatibility of my client from Windows 10 back to Windows 7","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T00:36:28.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ensure the Game DVR feature is still disabled?
