From there, it takes eternity (if at all) to connect to the game. Just received an Abandon Game/AFK penalty, when I had been spending 30 min trying to just connect to the game itself. I would load to about 40% and crash, causing me to have to close the client, log in, and try to reconnect again (rinse and repeat). Any thoughts? Would a forced repatch help? I'm running Mac OS 10.11.4 (El Capitan) on a wired internet connection with power supply.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-29T22:44:41.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you receiving a specific error message when this happens such as a Bugsplat or Network Disconnection error?","replies":[{"poster":"S1rBilliam","date":"2017-02-04T02:36:09.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, no specific error message for the most part.
