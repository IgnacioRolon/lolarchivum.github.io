Or, they could have the main honor like it is now, and then honorable mentions, like it used to be, where you hit the honor category during lobby. They don't really count as much as the main honor, but they do get tallied up like the old honor. I'd like to see that, personally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-08-17T11:54:01.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly there have been times where I believed the honor should have gone to more than one person. Just like in real life, any type of Team Based Game deserves to honor more than one person. As it is a team game and more often than not it wasn't just one person that helped in the long run. While i do miss it, i can understand with how the do honors now, it would have just made things worse and basically gone back to how the old honors were had they made it be able to honor everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-08-17T08:21:15.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honoring enemy coming soon.","replies":[]}]}
