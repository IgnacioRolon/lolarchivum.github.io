I had no issues connecting to the game and was even able to move around in it ( I could tell I was moving due to sound), but I could not see anything. I tried reinstalling League, but the issue persisted. I tried changing game modes to see if there was perhaps a bug ( first time I was luckily in the practice tool so I didn't lose any games due to the issue), but it didn't fix the issue. Finally, I decided to try changing the resolution to 3840x2160 to see if there was some issue with down scaling the resolution as I was using a 4K monitor, and I finally could see the game again. However, when I tried switching back to 1440, the screen went black again. After resetting the scale back to 4K I tried going from 4K in game to 1920x1080 and I had no problem at all. It seems to be an issue that only occurs in 1440. This is an issue that just started today as I was playing yesterday in the same resolution without any problems and I have not made any changes to my computer from yesterday (such as driver updates).\r\n\r\nWhile I can play in either 4K or 1K, I still prefer 2K as its a decent balance between having the higher resolution and being able to actually see things like health bars on minions or champs. \r\n\r\nSide Note: It would be extremely helpful for those in the community that want to play on higher resolution monitors if there was a slider for changing the size of health bars for minions and champs, for icons on the mini map, and possibly even the size of the cursor. Those are the things that stop me from playing League in 4K and why I feel forced to downscale my resolution.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T20:16:16.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're going to run into issues if you're on a 4K which isn't fully supported or exceeding a resolution of 1920x1080 such as in this case.
