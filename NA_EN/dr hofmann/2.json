I strongly recommend checking out the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a next step in resolving this.\n\nIf you continue to have issues after ensuring your settings are compatible with League, we can take a look at your route to the server.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oh Look Kaede","date":"2016-10-11T16:27:21.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't find the problem, deleting League and reinstalling always works.
