ATTACK DAMAGE: 20 / 28 / 36 Additionally, each of his basic attacks will pierce enemies in an 850 length line, with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20% down to a minimum of 40% damage.\n\nTwitch's ult is fine, except for the last part: \"with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20% down to a minimum of 40% damage.\". The reason why is because **this effect happens when shooting creeps.**\n\nWhy is this an issue, you may ask? Well, think about it this way: If the enemy adc sits in their creep wave, Twitch's ult is practically useless to kill them, since the damage on each of Twitch's AAs to the enemy ADC is 40% of the normal, if the enemy adc is behind atleast 3 creeps, **even if twitch is ahead**. This effectively ruins twitch's level 6 trading, something which he needs now more than ever, considering the hard nerfs to his early game.\n\nI suggest a change from \"with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20% down to a minimum of 40% damage\" to \"with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20%(10% if unit is a minion)down to a minimum of 40% damage\". This helps make the problem a little bit better, since if there are 3 creeps, twitch is not doing 40% damage to the enemy ADC, but is instead doing 70% of his damage. This wouldn't change Twitch's teamfighting at all, just his laning. \n\nEDIT:\nLink to the Reddit Post for more visibility\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2rbn6f/slight_change_to_twitchs_ult_please/","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-01-04T20:50:13.018+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It would be nice if he could actually autoattack the inhibitors and nexus while using his ultimate as well.

I could understand increasing the timer to 3 or 4 seconds, and for an actual assassin, that isn't that big of an issue, but 6 whole seconds while taking damage means you will NEVER be able to use it as an escape if actually being attacked, which also means you can't access the bonus AS from it either. If they were concerned about his early game being too strong, then they should have made it so that the duration to stealth while under fire scales from 6 down to 4 seconds at max rank. even that small change could help.","replies":[{"poster":"sayhisam1","date":"2015-01-04T21:40:53.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think that wasn't really the worst nerf.

Now, after getting a lot of AD, his passive can do something. It will be like Darius's stacks. Now, instead of only 6, he can deal somewhere to 9 or above. This can stack to 54 damage every second for the next 6 seconds. That totals to 324 (at most), but there is also the healing factor that will balance this out and the fact you must be FED to do this and you must land 6 shots. 2 will only deal 18 for a total of 108 damage. This would be way better (and beneficial) than a plain 6. The most dealt is 216.","replies":[{"poster":"sayhisam1","date":"2015-01-05T10:53:10.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wouldn'the really fix the problem of Twitch's really bad early game. That would juse make him scale harder into late game, which isn't really the main goal. Twitch's early game is terribly hard to play, and his passive stacks from his AAs are now nearly useless, simply because by the time you AA 6 times, you are either dead or really low. All I am asking for is a slight change to help Twitch land his passive by allowing him to actually  do damage with AAs through creeps, since one of the main \"mechanics\" that everyone in bot lane uses is that they sit in/behind their creep wave in order to prevent being damaged. So, without the enemy ADC making a stupid mistake, there is no way for Twitch to actually trade or duel, at level 6 especially, without a jungle gank, since twitch almost always loses trades now since they nerfed his E, passive, and base damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-01-05T14:16:05.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't much you can do to buff Twitch without it being unfair. But, with scaling his passive at 0.03 (or higher), they could raise his W to give up to three marks of his passive. With the damage always consistent, his W is not a very desirable thing unless you want 2 early stacks on enemies. All I'm saying is, lets give him the 1 stack for 2 upgrades, 2 stacks after the next 2 and his last upgrade gives 3 stacks. That would mean he'd dish out nice damage to each target, dealing at least 108 damage (or more) rather than a flat 72 damage.\n\nI will say that, and I barely play Twitch, his early game isn't that bad. It is his late game where he can't do anything with his E and his R has it's own problems.","replies":[{"poster":"sayhisam1","date":"2015-01-05T20:28:41.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main twitch, with over 300 games as him. I personally feel that his early game is terrible, since it is so hard to win the lane if your opponent is skilled.\nHis late game is fine; He can wreck whole teams if he has good positioning. It doesn't really need a buff.\nI feel that riot should either do one of two things: either buff his early game, or make him completely stomp lategame to makeup for the basically automatic loss early game.\nThe second thing isn't really an option, since riot wants counterplay and a non-linear game.\nTherefor, the only logical solution would be to buff twitch's early game ever so slightly just enough that he doesn't fall out of favor to higher damage, more bursty champions who completely outclass him in lane. My solution allows for a large window of counterplay, and doesn't make twitch OP, it just allows him to duel a little bit easier in lane when he hits 6.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2015-01-04T23:20:18.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that's a bug.
