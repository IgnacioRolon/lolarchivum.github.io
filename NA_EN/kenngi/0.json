(PS the middle score 1/07 played a kayle, my ADC never died ONCE!!! i did my job as a support fed my ADC kept them alive and won the game) I feel the current ranking system is unfair to those who play support. Any thoughts??","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-07T05:37:33.466+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really easily, just stop worrying about gaming the system and focus on doing well.\n\nWard properly, get assists, make use of your support item to get gold.\n\nseriously, ward. Get a sweeping lens after your sightstone item. I see these bronzeass supports who used a total of 14 wards in a 30-minute game, and i feel very sad for them and their poor team. USE THY WARDS. \nAlso get control wards and stick them in places where they are unlikely to get destroyed, but can serve as a warning. Good spots for them are around your blue/red buff, tribush on your side to stop ganks from behind, and inside your jungle at junctions.","replies":[{"poster":"Kenngi","date":"2017-01-07T05:50:38.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand not to worry and i dont i dont really care about the game or the score however, have you ever had that moment when you feel like your on fire! like your doing super well and doing everything  support should. only to be poorly rewarded?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SchmidttyGames","date":"2017-01-07T05:15:50.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get S- or better on Zyra more often than I ever expected to.  I think there are a lot of factors involved because I've gotten an S with some interesting scorelines that could only be explained by other stats involved.\n\nAside from KDA, CS, Damage Dealt to Champions, Wards Placed, Wards Destroyed and maybe even Gold Per Minute all seem to matter to an extent.","replies":[{"poster":"Kenngi","date":"2017-01-07T06:04:43.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I place wards often, I can normally get a full build, meaning my gold is about 12-15k a game which i feel is pretty high, KDA Unless i support brand i usually always have more deaths than kills, but its not bad, like a 1/3 however i feel 20+ assists should make up for that. :( CS i might push a lane if no one else will other than that i let my ADC have it.","replies":[]}]}]}
