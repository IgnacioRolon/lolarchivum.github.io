Baron and dragon are not targetable if you are in the death realm as far as I know, which means that every time both teams try to contest these objectives, Mordekaiser could simply ult the enemy jungler. So the only team with smite to contest in that situation is Mordekaiser's team, making them get every single one of these objectives by default as long as Mordekaiser is around.\n\nWith QSS however, the enemy jungler can cleanse the ult and keep contesting baron/dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-20T09:31:40.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bug.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-06-20T08:35:14.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good, there's enough bullshit CC spells that cannot be clensed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalignMetal","date":"2019-06-20T14:59:04.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counterplay options \n\nFuck yeah","replies":[]}]}
