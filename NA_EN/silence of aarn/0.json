I was running at a constant 80 but now im running at about 9 or 10. I have checked the other games on my computer to see if it was something wrong with the computer itself but they were running fine. I have tried to change all of my in game settings to lower and nothing changed besides the look of the game. I was wondering if there is a problem running around or if my league has just stopped working. Please help me :/","replies":[{"poster":"TheRealPriest","date":"2017-07-05T14:46:14.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHhh Riot messed up something with this new patch Im pretty sure.\nI was running 300+, now I have 100-120 FPS.\nThey will just link you to some guide that is supposed to solve all your problems but what they dont realise is that its problem on their end.\n\nI reinstalled LoL, graphics card, cleaned my PC in and out of dust and viruses, checked my internet connection if by some level its affecting my FPS, reinstalled those drivers too.\nDid not help.\n\n**I dont know what is this thinking where \"hey uummm we know your computer was same and nothing changed on your end, but we dropped this new patch so heres a link, check it, problem is on your end, we changed shit but you know, you didnt so yea its your problem, on your end, lata noob\"**\n\nLike wtf ?\n\nMaybe when next patch drops yours and mine problem will be fixed.\n\nSadly they dont care since no one bigger was affected, if it was some streamer it would've been solved within hours :P","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-05T22:26:37.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of assumptions here.  We do care and if there was something specifically causing widespread issues, we'd want to tackle that as soon as we can.  From what I've seen so far since the patch, that hasn't been the case.
