That's my first hunch, at least.  Aside from a manual download, an update should automatically pick those products up.

As a first step, I suggest downloading and reinstalling [ Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387) per the error you're receiving.  Test this out in a custom game to prevent further penalties!  Let me know if you have any issues afterwards!","replies":[]}]}
