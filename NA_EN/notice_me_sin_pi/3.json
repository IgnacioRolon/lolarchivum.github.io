With the recent rift herald buff update though, it is very disadvantageous to have the duo be only able to have impact on dragon control but have zero imfluence on rift herald control.\r\n\r\nNot only would sending ADC&amp;supp to midlane would use heavily increase roaming potential of supports like {{champion:89}} {{champion:12}}, but also the duo can swiftly join the jungler for either rift herald or dragon from that lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-04-21T16:52:49.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My understanding of the evolution of the lane meta is that mid lane goes to the often relatively squishy mage/assassin because it's the shortest lane, giving them the most freedom to gtfo if things get hairy. From there there's a jungler, and two lanes left for 3 people, and it's because of dragon that bot lane ends up being the duo lane.\n\nAs it currently stands, I would still consider dragon to be higher priority to control than rift herald.\n\nIn the not super distant future, rift heralds buff will be most effective on a solo laner, and will be a one off prize, as opposed to dragon where 2 dragons before laning phase is over is not unrealistic. That still pushes the duo lane bot, and the solo lane top.\n\nI could maybe see in an organised game bot lane swapping to top briefly and pushing for herald (probably giving buff to mid laner), and then going back bot, but that require more coordination than I'd expect out of dynamic queue so I doubt there will be big shifts in lane metas. Feel free to get a 5 man together and experiment though, maybe the mid lane control could be viable, but I doubt it.\n\nAnother thought is that the gank potential of a meta midlaner is probably somewhat higher than a typically aa based adc, so having a mage/assassin in a position to roam anywhere is more useful than the potential for an adc to roam. (Supports can and often do already roam from bot lane, sometimes all the way to top.)","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2016-04-21T20:26:09.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mysticman89,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=e2ZTAHjA,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-04-21T16:52:49.053+0000)\n>\n> In the not super distant future, rift heralds buff will be most effective on a solo laner, and will be a one off prize, as opposed to dragon where 2 dragons before laning phase is over is not unrealistic.
