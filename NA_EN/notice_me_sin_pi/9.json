It seems to me that in pro level, even just 5 seconds of support&#039;s absence at a location can snowball out of control. Conversely, support being absent in teamfights for 5 seconds leads to no significant change in outcome in casual play.\n\nThe idea of the turret changes is that if pros were to trade towers, then whichever team that goes bot first would insta-win thru _gold advantage_. However, I think even just the _time advantage_ formed from taking less time to destroy turrets is enough for pro players to stop turret-trading at level 1. ~~maybe resistances should even be changed to negative in order to make the time advantage a bit more meaningful~~ In most casual plays, that time advantage isn&#039;t going to feel too snowbally.\n\nedit:\ni've been seeing some comments saying they would rather see full-resistance turrets with 400g first tower bonus. The reason I don't think it's good is because it might push the pro play meta into playing whatever champs that have good base attack speed and base AD at lv1, making pro plays severely less diverse. Other than that I do like the concept of RNG risk for first tower bonus tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Best princess EU","date":"2017-01-06T23:36:14.813+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"but bot lane ziggs\" \n\nwe don't care, the state of the game is more important than one champ \n\ndon't get me wrong i'm happy to see one dude replacing adcs bot but first blood turret is cancer with 71% win rate for the team that takes it","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-01-07T11:35:38.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, what win% do you think would be appropriate?  60%, 65%?","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-07T18:00:15.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my opinion 60% would be enough\n\nbefore inhibitor used to give to your team stronger minions everywhere (ad and hp)if you destroyed one, riot removed it because first inhibitor destroyed had 70% win rate\n\nand then i think it dropped to 60%","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-01-07T17:47:05.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer riot doing the opposite, remove the no resistances but keep the gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silmaril","date":"2017-01-07T07:59:03.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather see it go the other way around (keep the 400g bonus but make all the towers the same).\n\nIn my head-space at least, that would make teams still want to focus on getting early turrets and force early PvP interactions like they want, but the gold advantage would still make lane swaps risky.\n\nThe problem with making one turret weaker than the others (other than bot lane is my preferred lane, either role, and I'm sick of the fiestas down there) is that is always going to make that specific turret way, way more appealing than any other turret because even if turrets gave 0 gold, killing it still gives an insane amount of lane/map pressure.  If all turrets are inherently equal in terms of time/reward (while still having a system that discourages lane swaps), then each turret would have a different strategic value that could potentially be equally useful in different ways (assuming the map itself is rebalanced accordingly).  You could force top turret to free up your top laner for TP support or let him bully his opponent harder, you could take mid, which is easier and allows stronger mid/jungler control and weakens their mids' roaming potential, or you could go botlane and use the higher number of bodies to most likely secure the 400g, but potentially lose a more impactful turret.\n\n\n~~Or my secret wish, make turrets invincible for the first 15 minutes because laning is my favorite part of the game, even though I know it's a really shitty idea~~","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2017-01-07T10:03:35.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think it's not gonna make it more risky, but rather, make 90% of the games' outcomes be decided in pick/ban; whichever team gets more champs with better lv1 att speed and base AD will get the turret bonus.
