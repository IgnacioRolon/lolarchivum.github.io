If brand&#039;s early game W mana cost got increased and E early game mana cost got decreased, brand support wouldn&#039;t be as oppressive as right now to play against in lane. It&#039;s definitely fine to have a window of powerspike like having an ult that works very well against 2 opponents, but it should also come with weaker pre-6 laning.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2018-04-08T21:14:38.242+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because then Brand mid could just spam E on you whenever you're in range and harass melee champs to oblivion (like annie with her Q).\n\nW is a delayed aoe so it has more counterplay","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2018-04-08T22:17:35.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i honestly never thought of that problem.

This includes assassins, because their slippery gimmicks and engage tools tend to have significantly longer cooldowns than point-and-click nukes. \n\nTo an extent you see this already with mages bullying assassins throughout much of the early game with autos, \n\n2: Mages can't just go mid and bot, they can also go top. We've hit balance points before (s3 and s4 most noticeably) where mages in general shoved all but the most over-bearing of the top laners out of the lane and.. basically removed them from the game. Absolutely no melee has the tools to survive sustained poke and harass from mages and ranged; so if you give too much reliable to mages too early in the lane phase, the only melee who can hope to lane against them are the ones who can basically kill them as soon as the poking starts. Things like Renekton / Panth level 2 all ins, and such.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-04-09T05:25:29.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:91}} How dafuq do you retaliate to a Brand when ur marked by E?

Yes he did get updated during the MidYear Mage Update, but it wasn't really a big difference if you compare his old and new kit. As such, the mana values weren't really adjusted.\n\nThe melee champs he can pressure basically are assassins. \n\nIf you've ever played an assassin against annie, you know how bad that kind of point-and-click harassment gets.\nSame with Teemo/Panth in top","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wolfalisk318","date":"2018-04-08T18:36:31.640+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand Support is so frustrating to play against.
