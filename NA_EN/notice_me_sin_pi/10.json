One of them being any semblance of an early game.

You really don't earn a noticeable amount of serpents in lane until you can one-shot the backline with a barrel + Q. Not getting *individual* minions doesn't effect GP significantly as most of his serpents are obtained when he can waveclear with a barrel.\n\nCombat stats from runes? Those are hardly a tradeoff when he get's a *much* better gold efficiency and possible combat stats in the form of consumables. Klepto is the most viable on gangplank.

That can't be a tradeoff if it isn't even an option. The closest replacement to tdl is electrocute, which doesn't proc off GP ult like thunderlords did. That argument makes very little sense.\n\nAs for the \"gp loses early game presence by taking klepto\" argument, that's also pretty weak. Any early game power on gp isn't utilized. It's like winning a hundred dollars at the cost of an old wrench you've never used. Ya you lose a wrench, but the actual impact it has in your life (or gameplay in this case) is little to none.\n\nAlso, I never said it comes with a 0 tradeoff. I said \" with almost no tradeoff\". I was very careful to pick those words because I recognize he loses out on *some* stats but it's really barely impacts him in a meaningful way.\n\n_**here's the statement that really matters though**_\nYou trade essentially meaningless early game stats for a safe + more reliable early game that speeds up your scaling into your dream lategame. That's the current situation that Klepto has given us in terms of GP's gameplay.\n\nIt doesn't make him over-powered, it just creates a very binary, boring, and quite unfun source of gameplay in League.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2017-11-15T21:20:34.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slythion,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VpkiwUE8,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-11-15T21:18:01.148+0000)\n>\n> The boards like to confuse &quot;unfun/unfair/toxic gameplay&quot; with being &quot;op&quot;.\n> \n> Gangplank being allowed to consistently Q his lane opponent and even be *rewarded* for it with almost no tradeoff is quite toxic gameplay that isn&#x27;t fun.
