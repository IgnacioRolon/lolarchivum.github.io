So as you know we can change our NA Server league of legends language into other languages such as Korean, Spanish, Chinese, etc. Everyone says for Chinese you have to type zh_CN in the riot locale folder but that doesn't work.

Additionally, I am unable to assist you in modifying the game files to change the language to one that isn't supported in your region. :(\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
