You can see it here: http://luxnguyento.lienminh.garena.vn/infos\nAnd i hear that skin riot only sell at 520 750 975 1350 1820 and 3250, mean 99 149 199 299 399 and 799 in VN (20k = 40rp, 50k = 100rp). Few month ago they change the price and it's change very random, many of it is more expensive then it should be. So may i ask that Ganera Viet Nam (who manage the game in my country) is allow to do that ? Am i been scam ? Because i don't want to play the game that try to do that to me (even it's a good game and i have a lot of skin), or at least the sever. \nThanks you and hope you guys can understand and answer my question. Sorry for my English.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T04:12:12.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I'd love to help, if you're playing on the Garena VN server, you'll have to contact the [Garena Support team](http://intl.garena.com/support/) to inquire about content pricing and any other questions.\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
