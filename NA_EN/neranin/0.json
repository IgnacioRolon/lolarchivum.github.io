He would probably need to have fine-tuned defensive stats/passives. Having generic armour bonuses or a reduction to physical damage would make him good against AD bruisers and ADCs.\n\nIdeally you'd want him to have a complicated passive where he takes less damage from physical damage that exceeds a certain threshold. That way, the low and consistent damage of an AD bruiser or ADC is unaffected, while the burst damage of an assassin gets greatly reduced. You can make this threshold be a percentage of his max health, to encourage him to stay squishy and build resistances instead of HP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McGurgles","date":"2014-09-12T17:21:37.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically speaking There are counters to ad mids, just not anyone that scales specifically from the ad/health/armor said ad champ you are vsing has.

Gain armor for a duration.\n\nE: Push a single target a moderate distance away from you. Deals moderate damage.\n\nR: Remove all debuffs including silence. For 3 seconds you may cast again to shock all enemies in a large cone. Enemies take high damage and are stunned briefly and slowed for a moderate length.\n\n-\n\nArgos has the appearance of a stout old man. At level 1 he is very lightly armored with runic tattoos and a large iron staff. The staff would be bulky with a broad head on it similar to a warhammer. He is a melee mage.\n\nAs Argos levels his armor improves. The armor has runes inscribed upon it. Depending on which ability he levels a different piece of armor will both grow and gain a rune. Q: gauntlets. W: chestpiece. E: legs. R: Helmet.\n\nArgos would have decent damage but would not be as bursty as some of the main AP mids. He would be a fierce control mage fighter with natural tankiness.\n\nCounters would be Ahri, Fizz, Orianna.\n\nHe would counter Zed, Talon, Yasuo.\n\nHe would be a top or mid champion.","replies":[]}]}
