I know we are busy with LCS but I was really hoping maybe I could play with some of the casters as my fiance and I watch LCS every weekend and I love listening to them.\r\n\r\nThanks for giving me many years of fun with my fiance (league is one of our favorite things to do together!). The video about league couples was really touching for us too. I cant think of a more awesome thing then to share my 1000th win with the people that have literally shaped uncountable hours of my life and helped me to create so many amazing friendships.\r\n\r\nMy fingers are crossed!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Dash","date":"2015-06-30T20:59:38.423+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Wfury!\n\nFirst off, congratulations on almost reaching 1000 wins, that's awesome!

First off congrats on reach 1000 wins! That is quite an achievement you have reached regardless of everyone else says. Now before I go to the secondly, it was only during URFitationals that I noticed how cool Dash was. So I started watching his stream and really started to enjoy it. So after seeing him respond to this kind of message in the boards and actually playing with Wfury, ups my respect for him not only as a rioter, but as a human being and it is stuff like this that remind me that not everything in the league community is complete crap. So for that I thank you Dash!
