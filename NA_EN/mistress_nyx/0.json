They said it was their religion... but honestly there is no place for that on League...\n\nI know people who battle depression on a daily basis, they play league because it helps them get their mind off things and get them through the tough times. There is NO PLACE for someone to tell someone to kill themselves. I don't care if it is your religion.\n\nLeague has toxic players. I get that. You can mute them, but a club dedicated to telling others to end their own life is awful and I never want to see it again...\n\nI hope you will do something about this soon, Riot Games.\n\n\n(Edited) I reported it yes. On the spot. It's not offensive to most people because you have never lost a friend to suicide. \n\nYes, people who are depressed needs REAL HELP, but that is not to say that names like this should be allowed or are not offensive. Telling people to \"Lighten up.\" \"Take a joke.\" and \"Get over it.\" Doesn't help the situation of the fact that they themselves said, \"Suicide is the best way to get out of being stoic.\" \n\nStoic means: A person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining.\n\nFor people who suffer from depression, they would know it comes in MANY different ways. Sure, some can keep a light heart about it. Others can't. People who are defending the names and tags, you are encouraging the chance of someone, ANYONE, can take their life in seeing these. \n\nIt isn't about having a winner, \"I can't make jokes.\" \"Well I don't wanna see this.\" The point is, it is serious to some to a point where A LIFE COULD BE LOST. Yes, IT IS THE INTERNET! But that does not mean you can just start saying things you KNOW could hurt someone.\n\nRiot Games has standard, rules and regulations. When a friend says \"Kys\" to me in chat, I can take it as a joke, because I know them, and I know they love me. When someone I have never met before says it, I don't laugh, because it is not funny.\n\nI should go without saying, to anyone. You should NEVER; even as a joke to people who do not know you; tell anyone to kill themselves.

Suicide is not immoral it is simply selfish. A person who decides, with their own mind, and their own agency, that they no longer wish to live within this world due to their circumstance, has that right, because it is inalienable short of total and unjust restriction of that person's capacity to *be*. you would have to lock those people up, depriving them of personal liberty.\n\n\nI don't encourage suicide, but i don't hold disdain for those who come to that conclusion. I actively discourage suicide, but hey, maybe your life fucking sucks, and you're not willing to attempt to improve it.\n\nmaybe you're being gripped by totally overwhelming mental illness, such as a psychosis or other reality warping mindset which disables you, maybe you're in intense pain, or are physically impaired to such an extent that you do not find it worth living, especially with your spiritual beliefs saying you'll go to a Heaven type afterlife.\n\n\nSo stop. you're not in the moral right here, you're actually quite authoritarian and tyrannical by your demands.

Who here is ACTUALLY in a depressive state at the moment or have been in the last year or two and are _willing_ to reply their thoughts on the matter? I want to know how they feel and hopefully we can all move through this. And if there are people who are distraught by the club names and tags then of course I'll report in the future for them.\n\nSo here's my thoughts. Having struggled with depression for part of my middle school and all my years of high school, I know that life often sucks or it feels like it does. I had no real friends (doesn't help having those Aquarius traits which I learned about after) and I've experienced bullying. I didn't even have a phone and I couldn't go anywhere from my house so I felt left out of everything and it looked like everyone was passing me by. But still I think that somewhere along the road, there's a chance that things will go upwards from here. That means that I'll keep going until that moment no matter what. I'm two years into college and I'm not as severely depressed anymore since feeling depressed all the time is tiring and I wanted that to stop. Suicide was a thought, but making it a bad joke is helpful for me. The tags and names don't bother me and playing games and watching cats doing cat things are more fun than dying imo. \"Pfft suicide? lol nah xXsasuke69Xx, I'd rather play video games and meme m9.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DedSilent","date":"2018-03-20T19:56:27.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mistress Nyx,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=6lNtMEAX,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-03-20T06:51:03.159+0000)\n>\n> So I just played a game... the enemy team had two players with the club name of, \"Suicide is the answer.\" and the tag of \"KYS\"\n> \n> \n> Why is this allowed? They said it was their religion... but honestly there is no place for that on League...\n> \n> I know people who battle depression on a daily basis, they play league because it helps them get their mind off things and get them through the tough times. There is NO PLACE for someone to tell someone to kill themselves. I don't care if it is your religion.\n> \n> League has toxic players. I get that. You can mute them, but a club dedicated to telling others to end their own life is awful and I never want to see it again...\n> \n> I hope you will do something about this soon, Riot Games.\n\nThat type of BS should always be reported regardless if it's easy to report.
