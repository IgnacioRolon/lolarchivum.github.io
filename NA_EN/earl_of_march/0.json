My host's home is on ATT U-Verse and, for the most part, seems to function well.\r\n\r\nStrangely, though, I've been having issues where my ping is either excellent (31-33) or awful (280-300).  I cannot identify what triggers the shifts - they happen from game-to-game, and within individual games as well.  One moment I'll be fine, the next I'm barely able to play.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help me out?  Happy to provide any necessary specs.  I have access to the router options and I've already done all of the recommended port-forwarding.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nEarl","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-23T21:20:28.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT: Just received an update that AT&T was experiencing some problems last night for ~3 hours.  Seems like it was something on their end, but should be resolved now.  Feel free to still follow the steps below just in case though :D\n\nHmmm...I'd go ahead and try uploading your network logs into our [Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).  It should help give a better understanding of what's going on (confirming if it's just ping spikes or potentially some packet loss as well) as well as provide some advice on common fixes for connection issues.\n\nLet me know if it helps!","replies":[]}]}
