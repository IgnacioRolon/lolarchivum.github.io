My pc can run GTA, Overwatch, Skyrim, Witcher 3 and many more on the highest settings the games allow. Actually I could play all these games at the same time and not even notice, but now league....\n\nI've heard you can't tell a diff of any fps over 60. Well I turn V-sync on and it stays at a flat 60, and just looks so bad. Stuttering or w.e you want to call it. Turn it off I hit 130 around players 200 running to lane. 130 isn't bad. Just for some reason it feels sluggish and choppy. Lets say I alt tab to change music or I am dead and want to facebook to kill some time. If I do not close my browser and I go back into league. Choppy as crap. I can play all these games on ultra but can't have anything opened other than league? How does league use more resources than any of these graphic intense games. I played league on a 1gig ram integrated laptop before lol. Is there some settings on my pc I am missing? I watch streams or youtube recorded league videos and they look so much smoother than my pc. Of course I do not have the power they have, but with the pc I am working with league should run a lot smoother, if not as smooth as some other games I play. \n\nthe pc I have not that it matters, but maybe some one has some better insight. \nhttps://www.asus.com/us/Tower-PCs/G11CD/specifications/\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T00:03:09.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So at first glance, this *kind of * sounds like it might actually be a slight form of packet loss. I'm guessing this because those stutters you're seeing sound like they happen while your fps is stable, which is a good indicator that packet loss is happening in the background. Let's check for that before jumping much further. \n\nGrab the network logs from that game if you can and pop them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). It'll scan them and give a visual representation of how your connection was faring. Paste that back over here using something like Gyazo so I can take a look with you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"AZ Frost","date":"2017-10-31T02:55:22.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what Riot did with this last patch, but I have seen (including myself) a LOT of issues with client, FPS drops mid game, and crashes that didn't happen like this before the last update. I don't know why the hell they are NOT widely addressing these issues. Guess they care more about having fun in China then fixing the game for the masses.\n\n(You know how hard it is to play a skill shot based champ and ur FPS (not ping/ms) goes from 70 to 11? Worse then the game lagging out, even though it looks like ur lagging!)","replies":[]}]}
