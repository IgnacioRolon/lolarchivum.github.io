Last night I played several games and had no problems that I can recall. Overnight a windows update installed. I tried to play a game an hour or so ago. When the game launched it for some reason was in a tiny window that used about 1/3 of my screen. Then I got the message that the game had crashed and I had to reconnect several times before I finally got in (everyone else had connected). When I got in the window was still tiny, so I went into the settings menu and changed it to full screen. When I did that, suddenly the camera had zoomed way in on my character and wouldn't zoom out. Also, at this point something was wrong with mouse input. I would click one spot but the character would move elsewhere. At this point I just restarted my computer.\r\n\r\nI got back in the game and just played the game on the tiny window (it did not go well). Afterwards, I tried launching a custom game and got the same thing. So I uninstalled League, reinstalled it and tried to make a custom game. Now all I get are bugsplats over and over, can't get into the game at all.\r\n\r\nThx for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T18:22:53.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your input file that's stored on the server may be corrupted or messed up in some way. I recommend completing a reset of that file using the steps below.\n\n>First, **Log into the game** then find your League installation directory. It should be here:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\n>Delete the folder named **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted that folder, hop into a custom match to confirm the change went through alright and that you aren't seeing the same behavior.\n\nLet me know the results.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ihatethisgame111","date":"2016-08-29T17:35:59.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it a Windows computer?
