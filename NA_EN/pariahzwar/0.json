Indeed, Singed is currently disabled so your pool will be under 15.  There are some champion sales right now if you want to fill up your pool.  I also noticed you don't have [Facebook Tristana](https://www.facebook.com/leagueoflegends) and [Unchained Alistar](https://www.youtube.com/user/RiotGamesInc) promotional content, which you can unlock for some extras.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"4EVERASWOWannabe","date":"2016-09-22T18:00:56.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really need to change my name...
