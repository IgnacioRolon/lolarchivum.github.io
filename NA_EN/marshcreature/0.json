champions (yes that&#039;s a sad attempt at a singed joke) he is loved by a small part of the community but his problems becomes obvious when you play him, he needs people to ether chase him or he needs to get in front of people he cant really team fight he lacks skills for that except the flip that can interrupt a channeled ult like jhin&#039;s ult or katarina&#039;s ult also the slow witch lets be honest is not that good his ult is lack luster as well.\r\n\r\nHis most iconic skill is his Poison trail this skill is where the memes &quot;don&#039;t chase singed &quot; and &quot;don&#039;t breathe the purple smoke&quot; this is kind of crap, singed can proxy waves really well (then die to a roaming jungler) he can even jungle to some extent even though his jungle clear is horrid he also has a slow that makes his life a little easier flipping people like a burger (burger flipper singed would make a good skin) his ult gives his poison a little more kick and gives a little more mr as well as health regeneration aside from that its a pointless ult. he is the meat shield no one will hit and he cant put enough pressure to make you hit him or focus him.\r\n\r\n**Suggestions for possible  reworks and skill ideas**\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}} For teemo ive been thinking of giving him a ranged/ranged play style similar to jayce, nidalee and elise move his mushrooms to his W and make his ult a stance swap like a jayce or nidalee i wanted to give him a more viable jungling path and more top lane potential.\r\n\r\nP - Guerilla Warfare - same as he has now i think it works well with him being a scout and all \r\n\r\nRanged\r\nQ - Blinding dart - same as he has now it works well for what i want him to be  \r\nmelee \r\nQ - Grass cutter - teemo slashes in a cone in front of him dealing damage if a champion has a stack of bleed they are slowed for 30% for 1.5 seconds\r\n\r\nRanged\r\nW - Noxious Trap - moved his ult to this since its so lack luster as an ult i think it works well as a standard ability with slightly worse scaling early and stronger late game mainly used for the slow\r\nMelee\r\nW - Move Quick - same move speed bonuses works the same  \r\n\r\nRanged\r\nE - Toxic Shot - people think this is a core skill and vital to the identity of teemo along with his mushrooms so i left it as is \r\nMelee\r\nE  - Go for the throat - Teemo jumps at targeted unit and latches onto them after 1 second teemo slashes their throat causing them to bleed for 3 seconds \r\n\r\nR - Scouts tools - Teemo changes from his blow pipe to his machete switching from ranged to melee accessing his second skill kit here is where the bacon sizzles \r\n\r\n{{champion:27}}  Ill be honest im lost as to what would make singed viable his theme is heavy on alchemy so i was thinking of a more support kit with his ult let me know if you guys have other ideas \r\n\r\nP - Empowered Bulwark - i got nothing leave it the same for now cant really think of a good passive for him \r\n\r\nQ - Poison Trail - this one stays the same due to it being a icon of what singed is and his play style don&#039;t want to rustle the jimmies of all 4 or 5 singed mains \r\n\r\nW - Mega Adhesive - singed flings a vile of Adhesive slowing the target for 3 seconds singed can fling more vials of adhesive to stack the slow eventually rooting the target (this works with an ammo system and can slow multiple characters at once making him viable in team fights) \r\n\r\nE - Flash bomb - singed flings a bomb that explodes after 0.5 seconds stunning the target in a small aoe  for 1.5 seconds \r\n\r\nR - Chemical X - singed uses his experimental potion to turn a friendly champion into a monster giving allies bonus damage as well as granting bonus armor and MR","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-23T23:48:26.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would make teemo into a decent assassin while leaving his splitpushing capabilities intact, seems kinda overloaded tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-11-23T22:05:50.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot so many champions...","replies":[{"poster":"MarshCreature","date":"2016-11-23T22:11:42.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the post was originally much larger covering most if not all the champs with old kits but i didn't want to make a massive post no one would read","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-11-23T22:58:23.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you didn't really needed to make concepts though...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jon1174","date":"2016-11-23T22:06:35.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Teemo one seems fun\n\nSinged not so much","replies":[{"poster":"MarshCreature","date":"2016-11-23T22:12:46.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"now that i look at it its kind of uninspired singes is such a boring character that i didn't come up with unique things for him","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenBo√ç","date":"2016-11-23T21:57:07.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}}  with a Machete O.o...
