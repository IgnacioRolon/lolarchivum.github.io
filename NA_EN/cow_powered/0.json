I think his W should either be called \"Staff of Haste\" of be reworked to give allied champions mana related buffs, as wisdom is often associated with magic. I also think his Q is out of place. I think it should keep the big part \"[I]f still in [range] when the explosion goes off [...] champions [are] stunned and [dealt attack damage + an additional 50]\" but the rest needs a little bit of rework. Aside from that, I just think you should make sure to just not make him like Wukong {{champion:62}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Cow Powered","date":"2015-03-17T23:00:31.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok i thought it might turn out lke him but im trying to avoid that\nthanks for the tips too ill keep trying to get him better lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}
