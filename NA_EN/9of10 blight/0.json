She is 2 years old now and has changed my world view for the better. She has opened my eyes to the ignorance i had and also to the hateful things i would say without thinking. \r\n\r\n The league community overwhelmingly votes to punish for persons using racial slurs, or homophobic slurs, but not for people with disability. Do you consider them lesser then you? Undeserving of the rights you afford to those who have wrongly suffered to this day? Persons with intellectual disability are also people, and they have families that love them, and Lawyers that protect them. \r\n\r\nI ask that we improve our naming standards to include &quot;Retard&quot; as a &quot;must change&quot;. \r\n\r\nBe less toxic. \r\nPlease.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2011\r\nWhy &quot;Retard&quot; is a Hate Crime\r\nIt doesn&#039;t happen often, but every once in a while I get confronted with a very ugly word.\r\n\r\n&quot;Retard&quot;\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s used a slang, as an insult.  People know that it&#039;s offensive, but they still use it.  They seem to think &quot;oh, it&#039;s slang, it&#039;s just a word, it doesn&#039;t matter.&quot;  But you see, it does matter.   Just because there isn&#039;t a person with intellectual disabilities there, or apparent, doesn&#039;t mean it doesn&#039;t matter. Because connotations matter.  The thought behind the word, it matters.  \r\n\r\nLet me show you how.\r\n\r\nThe noun &quot;retard&quot; comes from &quot;mental retardation&quot;.  Despite some popular belief, it is actually still used as a diagnosis for people with a low IQ score and two or more adaptive behaviours.  According to the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV-TR, there are even varying degrees of it.  It is considered to be an intellectual disability, and in fact, most advocates prefer the term intellectual disability rather than &quot;mental retardation&quot;. \r\n\r\nWhy?  Because of how the term &quot;retard&quot; is used.  It is used not just towards people with intellectual disabilities, it is also used against any disabled person.  It gets flung at children in the schoolyard.  It gets tossed around as an insult by adults.  It has been used to mock, ridicule and insult, not only non-disabled individuals, but disabled people specifically by the simple act of using a diagnosis as slang. \r\n\r\nWhen you use the term &quot;retard&quot;, you are specifically taking defining aspects of people, in this case disability, and mocking them.  It&#039;s kind of like taking a person&#039;s skin colour or sexual orientation and using that as an insult.  We don&#039;t use the words &quot;%%%%%%&quot; or &quot;%%%got&quot; anymore?  We know better, or at least, we should know better, because there is a history of discrimination against the groups that it refers.  In our supposedly more progressive society, it is no longer acceptable to use those words. \r\n\r\nThe same is with &quot;retard&quot;, but it seems like the same regard is not applied to disabled people.  It&#039;s discrimination.  It says that you can target disabled people, mock and insult them, and get away with it because you can. \r\n\r\nWhen you can hurt them in your head and with your words, what&#039;s to stop you from hurting them psychically?  Because believe me, you&#039;re already hurting people mentally and emotionally with your words, and it doesn&#039;t take much for those types of attitudes to shift from being merely words to physical violence. \r\n\r\nIt already happens.\r\n\r\nRight now.\r\n\r\nGo on, look up &quot;disabled victim&quot;, &quot;disabled crime&quot;, &quot;disabled violence&quot;, or &quot;disabled murder&quot;.  It is said that disabled people have at least two to five, possibly up to ten times, the risk of violence than non-disabled (Sobsey 35).\r\n\r\nDisabled people have been beaten, robbed, sexually and physically assaulted, and murdered because of how people think of them.  Because people think it&#039;s okay to use us as an insult, to mock us and degrade us, then it&#039;s okay to take things one step further and target us specifically for crimes, not just the individual, but the entire group. \r\n\r\nDo you know what it&#039;s called when an offence is motivated by a person&#039;s membership with a group?  \r\n\r\nHate crime\r\n\r\nThe question is, do you really mean it?  Do you really want to potentially endanger people with the carelessness of your words? \r\n\r\nUnderstand that ignorance as an excuse only goes so far, and intent does not mean that you are exempt from the consequences.  Once you know about the potential results, you got to ask yourself how you would feel if someone mocked you for being right- or left-handed.  Or being beaten because of your ethnic background?  Or murdered for speaking another language?  And then the people did that to you just walks away without facing any consequences, legal or otherwise?\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t like it?\r\n\r\nYeah, neither do we. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\n\r\nSobsey, Dick.

Moron was initially a word to describe mentally handicapped adults that had the mental state of a child. So, in theory it should be just as offensive. However, moron has evolved into a common insult that many people use playfully. Reba Mcentire called her own children morons throughout her sitcom. If she had used the word retarded she would have received political backlash. This is because the word retarded hasn't been completely absorbed into what we call harmless language. The reason this argument exists however, is because it has been transitioning into the same sphere of colloquial language as moron for some time now. It's just not there yet. There is a dilemma though. The only way to get it there is for people to use it in the same playful sense. Ironically, the only way for it to become non-offensive is for the population to use it regularly.\"- some redditor\n\nI'll pose a question\nIN what fashion is someone allowed to discredit someone else's intelligence?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-22T01:29:15.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too bad you won't get the 10-16 year olds to listen to you.","replies":[{"poster":"CancerBasedGod","date":"2017-02-22T03:50:46.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're against disparaging the retarded but not the young?
