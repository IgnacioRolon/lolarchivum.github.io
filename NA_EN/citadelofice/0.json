Sure it hurts your team when one person dies, but that's just a punishment factor for your team for that person getting caught and a reward for the enemy team for a successful catch. That level of punishment is needed for people to learn to not get caught and not take stupid risks. Plus that can make pick comps late game worthless because the deaths won;t mean that much. I mean, is it really ok to say if the ADC dies at 40 minutes the other team shouldn't get a free baron for it because the ADC is back up before they can even get good ward coverage and get in position for it? The catch was pointless then and they should've just seiged or immediately done baron and took the fight anyway. The entire point of long death timers is to motivate people to avoid getting caught because there are dire consequences for it. I think the problem has more to do with people not being able to ward appropriately when behind (or not warding appropriately period) and the high kill pressure of certain champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-02-17T15:26:04.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare you have a different opinion!?\n\nEVERYONE DOWNVOTE HIM!\n\n_Just kidding I'm sorry ples don't hurt me_","replies":[{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-02-17T16:39:07.442+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It happens all the time sir.

Vayne gives up quite a bit in terms of raw power when this is involved in her kit. For every instance of an advantage, something is compromised to make the champion, in a sense, non-overbearing. Vayne gets a lot of damage off of the W proc yes, but she can't distribute procs evenly like Gnar can; she loses all procs on a target if she switches, and the vast majority of her damage comes from simple physical damage. Only about 1/5 to maybe 1/4 comes from the true damage procs. So statistically, a lot of her damage is not linked to the W. Sure it hurts like hell, but it takes time to proc that, which you tend to not have a lot of when getting dove in full 5 vs 5 team fights. In smaller fights (2 vs 2 or 3 vs 2) Vayne have more time because less people are going to be attacking her, so she can get more procs off. That's more the area where Vayne is quite strong than full 5 vs. 5 fights. The reason I say this is because of how the champion is built.\n\nHer passive gives bonus movespeed, sure, but it only works when chasing or moving towards enemies, never for running away. That movespeed is significant for clean up and chasing down stragglers, but it gives her nothing for getting away.\n\nVayne has a very short range Q dash (300 units, compared to 425 for Lucian E and Graves E or 600 on Corki W [1800 when the package is avaliable]) with a low cooldown that functions as an AA reset; fundamentally, this functions in no way as an escape, only an engage and a dodge. Sure you can tumble through a few walls, but your room for error is quite small, and in a full fight that room for error goes down a lot due to stress and the chaos of the fight.\n\nHer E is nothing more than a push-back (470 units back), which is on quite a decent cooldown, even late game. This is primarily because she won't be leveling it except as her last maxing, which means that cooldown stays at 20 until she is at level 14 (CDR from items non-withstanding for the sake of avoiding build issues). With this in mind, other champions with dashes or blinks or hooks or MS buffs (Lucian, Graves, Irelia, Ekko, Tryndamere, Thresh, Nautilus, Leona, Garen, Nidalee, Kennen, Maokai, Zed is debatable but unlikely due to his W's duration counting with his cooldown, the list goes on) will have theirs up before Vayne's E is off of CD. The biggest thing it gives her is the stun if she land it, but that requires at least decent positioning by the Vayne, which is a 2-way interaction between her and the enemy champion; by that I mean you will never get pinned if you keep good positioning vs. a Vayne. Period.\n\nHer ult gives her invisibility on her Q for 1 s, but pinks and Oracle's help to deal with that. In addition, the functionality of her Q doesn't change; it is still a short range repositioning dash and AA reset. Her ult also gives more chase potential but again, no getaway at all except for a 1 s invisibility. Even then, that won't make up for its short range. Part of the biggest reasons why Vayne can win fights is because she gets a reset along with the invisibility that negates damage on her for 1 second, unless she is caught in AOE or skill-shots (cough, cough).\n\nUltimately, Vayne's true damage is decent, but it doesn't make up even a third of the damage she deals in the average game. In addition, she has no escapes whatsoever, only engage tools. When she commits, she has to commit.\nBiggest way to kill a Vayne is single-targeted CC (Lissandra, Maokai, Nautilus, Leona [her Q], Taric, Ryze, Alistar (once the combo is updated and it becomes much harder to mess up [hopefully] etc.). If a Vayne gets hit by any of these in a full fight where the team plays well, then she has no chance (QSS not withstanding, but QSS has a cooldown as well).\n\nJust my thoughts. Hopefully that is sort of clear and concise to give another aspect of the discussion.\n\nSources:\nwww.champion.gg\nwww.leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wikia/[_] <-- champion used in discussion\n\nI think the pinacle of this reached like -12 or so lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-02-17T15:18:07.862+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"VS a fiora a few days ago, I died once and she took both towers over a 30 second death timer like wtf","replies":[{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-02-17T16:38:24.454+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"You mean like any ADC can?

I think its a problem because it creates a lock-in effect for AP champions that simply want a very high ap number inorder to provide hard scaling for their abilites, and less about the strategic reason why you would buy a Deathcap in the first place.\n\nBack then when Hourglass, Rylai's, Luden's and Lichblade were 3000 gold, this was a good balance between the items because its more about which AP item you want that will give a particular effect for your current needs rather than gold efficiency and/or power spikes. With Hourglass and Deathcap being much higher in cost compared to the other AP items, it completely shifts to the idea of simply saving all the gold required to get these two tickets items rather than opting for a strategic reason why you would want a certain AP item.\n\nWould it be better to bring Hourglass's cost in line with other AP items, but reduce the AP? Even changing the ingredients would be needed, i.e. Blasting wand instead of NLR. So you get the following:\n{{item:3191}} (1200g)  + {{item:1026}} (850g)  + Combine Cost (1150g) = {{item:3157}} (3200g)\n\nThat way, there isn't that big cost saveup and puts the item more about the active instead of its stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blupor","date":"2016-02-17T08:17:38.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!

Need to talk about whether that's going to be something that's good for the game or not though, or whether given how much better players have got at juggling agro earlier tower diving's an appropriate and expected part of the game at this point.\n\nHonestly, I think I would be much happier with stronger towers.  Right now, its extremely easy to have the jungler gank top lane, get the turret to half HP, then gank again 3 minutes later and get a 10 minute tower.  Most recently I played a game as VI jungle, feel free to check my op.gg, and we had a lux who pushed her tower into this teemo.  With 1 wave of minions, I was able to get the tower down from half HP without taking a single turret shot.  Later on in the game, I took the bot Tier 2 tower from full HP to nothing while only losing half my health in the process.  This was just with {{item:1400}} and {{item:3078}} .  To me that seems to be a big problem.\n\nI'm actually fine with death timers the way they are currently, the problem is there are way too many objectives that you can take with 2-3 people dead.  In previous seasons, a team could take the Inhib turret and inhib itself at around 25-30 minutes.  Now it seems at 25 minutes that having 3 people dead on either team means the end of the game.  Granted this is the old TSM strategy where you group and wait for the enemy to make that 1 mistake and win the game off of that, but this seems to be happening at the 25 minute mark and not the 35 minute mark like it used to do.\n\nThe weaker turrets also make the games seem really snowball much to quickly.  If I'm playing top lane and I get ganked by the jungler at level 3, the game almost feels lost already.  Another problem with the junglers is, the massive amount of movement speed that they get.  With Swifties and Mobies going to go to boots for a majority of junglers, along with Dead Man's Plate (love this item BTW) ZZ Rot Portal (RIP), junglers have a massive amount of movement speed.  This means that they are able to run around the map and take towers rather quickly.  This isn't necessarily the problem, the problem is how many turrets they can take in such a short amount of time.\n\nThis also negatively affects late game scaling champions, specifically Nasus and Viegar.  I now feel like there is no good scenario where I would pick either of those champions.\n\nThe way that towers are now, makes dragons 2 and 4 almost seem worthless.  Back when Dragon used to give global gold, it was an objective that was fought even right at 2:30 when it spawned, even in competitive play.  Now we're seeing dragon being taken at 12 minutes, and half the time it's because, well, there was no other objectives to take.\n\nAnd finally if we look at Rift Harold, the whole idea of this buff is to give that person a distinct advantage while having the buff.  In top lane especially, this means pushing your wave to the turret until it dies, and more times than not, I've seen at least one tower being taken after Rift Harold was taken.\n\nI understand that you guys wanted to push faster games, and to be honest, it's actually kind of nice.  One thing about MOBA's like League or HoTS or Dota 2 is that you can't just leave the game and que right back up again like you can in COD or Rocket League.  So I appreciate the shorter games.  The problem is, turrets seem to be so fragile, that one mistake at 18 minutes can almost cost you the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-02-17T07:05:38.138+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> TBH, I'm not, and I REALLY don't think I'm alone here.
