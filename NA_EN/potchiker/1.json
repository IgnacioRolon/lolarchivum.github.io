Why? Well because if I can't kill an assassin with a non-assassin I'm not going to play anything but assassins, because they win 100% of the time through one shotting.\n\nWell, the other 4 classes, Tanks, Supports, Adcs, and Mages Don't need to rely on one shotting to get the job done. They have a nice combination of heals/sheilds/cd's and survive ability that lets them do their job. Honestly lets just move away from assassins. We are killing four classes for the benefit of one.\n\nNow lets be explicitly clear here, I also don't want to see a tank meta, where tanks automatically win, but thats the thing about tanks, they often get too much damage, because they also need to compete with assassins, so they often either get overloaded defense, or overloaded offence to make them compete. We need to work in that happy middle ground with all classes where they are able to do their job, but not do it so well that they auto win. If assassins can 100-0 someone we are asking for them to \"auto-win\" fights by existing. Because its their job to \"auto win\".\n\nTo be honest we actually currently have a very balanced game of (almost) everyone one shots everyone, but the game is just miserable. We need a proper rotation back, and for that we need to accept that assassins shouldn't be 100-0ing players any more than any other champion should be 100-0ing players.","replies":[{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2018-06-24T09:08:05.626+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started in season four and honestly thought the whole point of assassins were for them to flank team fights and take advantage of enemies who got low in them.\n\nWas the idea always to have them just 100-0 people?","replies":[{"poster":"Marothennan","date":"2018-06-24T12:42:39.475+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah and assassins were viable back then.

Why would you play an Assassin if not to be able to delete someone and get out? \n\n100-0 is fine as long as the build up is clear enough to be able to avoid. Assassins can circumvent those build ups by playing smart, flanking, etc. Like the Garen, he came out of Fog of War due to a lack of warding, and promptly ended Zyra's short lived existance. Garen's playing as an Assassin, not a Jugg, and so the same principle applies. \n\nHe has no way of going through walls, or closing distances with something other than a speedboost or flash, so his build up is \"See Spot Run\".  So with a proper frontline, he isn't going to accomplish his job without having to flank or otherwise outplay a frontline.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-06-24T04:12:50.404+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=X32p5KT9,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-06-24T03:58:24.244+0000)\n>\n>  That&#x27;s the Archetype, the playstyle, the theme, the feeling.\n\nSo how are tanks played then? They don't have survivability they just cc someone and then die. What the archetype, playstyle the theme the feeling of a tank that dies? the whole goal of a tank is to not die. \n\nIts no different. If we can't have unkillable champs, we can't have champs that kill in .5 seconds.\n\nStop using such one sided logic, the goal of an assassin shouldn't be to 100-0 someone, it should be to finish them off like how pyke plays. \n\nAlso, why is it that we can enforce the idea that assassins should be able to get in, get a 100% guaranteed kill, and get out? What is healthy about that gameplay? Why are we catering to their power fantasy? My fantasy as a tank is to never die, do I get to do that? No! My power fantasy as an adc is to stand still and right click things to death, do I get to do that? No!. My power fantasy as a mage is to control the flow of a fight, do I get to do that, No!. As a support my goal is to keep my team 100% full hp all the time do I get to do that, NO! \n\nSo why do assassin's get their treatment of being the premier class. Its fucking bullshit.

They do have survivability, and I haven't seen jack to disprove it in any of my games yet. \n\nAnd you're response about 'one-sided logic', well, for one, that's never how it's been in League with assassins. Look back in history, Assassins have never just been finishers in fights. \n\nAnd we're not talking only power fantasy. We're talking about the entire game, not a void. Assassin's have their power, due to the fact that League is a team game, and when coordinated properly, Assassin's have a lot harder time doing whatever they want than you think. Wards, Tanks, and Supports all lend themselves towards making an Assassin's contribution Null. \n\nIf an Assassin can spot a moment where their target is alone, vulnerable, or otherwise unprotected during a teamfight, than depending on the avenue of assassination, such a thing is fine. Giving them time to react, time to escape, or to seek help is a common theme most assassins have been built into with lately. \n\nKayn has his marker on Walls, and His Ult delay to give time to react and get help. Zed has his Ult Delay. Rengar has his Eyes shown above the closest target. Kha'zix is nerfed if the target isn't alone. Ekko has his Clone-Icon, and his W heavily delayed. The people I see problem with are people like Twitch or Shaco (who i think both should have giggling sound effects when they're close to a person while stealthed), since they don't give that time to react.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-06-24T05:40:11.722+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://tinypic.com/r/161mhh/9\n\nI was actually 100% hp when that fight started, but I died so fast that the death recap didn't even get the correct damage.

Now put that against someone that doesn't have three armor items. Literally .5 second deaths. \n\nWhy does yi have this damage? He needs to compete with assassins that have that damage as well. The class as a whole is creating a very unhealthy game where everyone needs to oneshot everyone. \n\nAlso, Who the fuck cares if they \"Give you warning\" that you are going to be one shot.

You were killed by a Yi who built to shred tanks with Black Cleaver, Last Whisper, and BorK. 4 seconds to kill you, is a relatively medium amount of time in a fight ~~and not *Instantly*~~, and no one was able to CC Yi? Despite the opponent being Yi, this isn't a stat contest. Tanks have CC for a reason, it's how they expand their life-span while in a fight. \n\nNot to mention the fact, that *you aren't a tank*. You're a Cho'Gath building Tank, big difference. You don't have the Shield of Sion, or Naut, nor their CC. The resistances of Sejuani, or the constant healing of Maokai and Zac. You had three tank items, and 2 Ap items. Deadman's Plate isn't a good tank item either, since you were obviously playing to do the oneshot-Cho deal and wanted that mobility. \n\nSo you weren't a Tank, nowhere close to most Full Tank Builds. Take out the ROA, and thrown in a Stoneplate, watch how long you last now. Hell, even Steraks is a better tank item. The reality of the situation is you think that simply stacking health and resistances should make you a tank, when that's far from it. You were playing a Hybrid-Ap-Tank. \n\nAs for the 'gives you a warning', ah fuck man, I thought like, being able to dodge something you could see coming was the entire part of 'counterplay'.

The threat is created by delivering a high enough amount of damage in short period of time, followed by a long period of weakness.

So the obvious choice is to switch to a dps champion, who doesn't suffer from downtimes.\nConsistent damage remains consistent, but if you nerf burst damage it just stops being useful.\n\nFor example if an Assassin does no longer have the damage to burst a target down then the risk is no longer worth the reward.

I have.  Assassins like Katarina were forced to wait until team fights were already well underway and everyone was already focused on what they were doing, then she could find an opportunity to jump someone who was at 40% and come in to delete them, using her reset to either Shunpo out or to another low target to do it all over again.  She was insanely popular too, because when damage is lower across the board, losing half your health is seriously threatening, and you can't just oneshot people back then so you had to stay in a fight for prolonged periods of time in order to get the job done, which was crazy hard to do with only half a health bar.  Going from 60-0 is still VERY SCARY, but we've just forgotten what that's like because nowadays anyone can do that so we forgot how impactful it is.  Burst was horrifying back then, even if most people (minus a few Mages) couldn't actually delete you outright.\n\nSpeaking of which, there were Mages (and I do mean MAGES, not ASSASSINS) who could 100-0 you anyway like LeBlanc, Annie, Brand, Veigar, Kassadin and Malzahar but that was their specific duty: To be super squishy and immobile (minus LeBlanc, but hoo-boy did she have her own slew of weaknesses, and Kassadin was considered so problematic that he was nerfed into obscurity) but do way more burst than anyone else.  When Assassins began to steal Mages' identity, that's when we had a problem.  Suddenly we had a class with all the trickiness of an Assassin and all the damage of specialized Mages who were originally designed to be extraordinarily NOT tricky in order to balance them out.  You can't compare the survivability or element of surprise that someone like Brand or Annie has to someone like Zed or Talon and honestly claim the latter pair are easier to deal with.  Despite this, both sets have equal damage.  So why would anyone ever pick Annie or Brand nowadays instead of Zed or Talon?  The answer is that they don't, because Assassins are just superior Mages.  In fact, those two Mages have actually been permanently delegated to the SUPPORT role because of how outclassed they are by those two assassins who stole their identity and their lane.  Sure Brand is thriving down there right now but he's just a single outlier and even Riot themselves keep saying they don't want him there and that he should be mid lane.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that Assassins were given entirely too much, and after years of having that much, they grew accustomed to being absolutely bonkers ridiculous and started thinking that was normal... occasionally even expecting MORE.  Do you know the difference between a ninja and a samurai?  A samurai fights on the battlefield and a ninja poisons someone's drink (catches you off guard) or slits their throat in their sleep (attacks when you're weak and vulnerable).  One is a warrior... the other is an assassin.  When assassins are fighting on the battlefield and winning against warriors, they're not assassins anymore; they're warriors.","replies":[{"poster":"FixHealsRemoveGW","date":"2018-06-26T10:29:41.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Assassins like Katarina were forced to wait until team fights were already well underway and everyone was already focused on what they were doing, then she could find an opportunity to jump someone.\n\nSo nothing changed, because Katarina was designed to more of a clean up assassin and she still works like that. Can't say the same about other assassins.\n\nThere are diffrent types of assassins.\nIt's kinda ironic when somebody who boasts about playing since season 1 isn't able to think independently. What is your experience worth when you just feed the big circle jerk?","replies":[{"poster":"Leverette","date":"2018-06-26T22:56:45.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a lot of aggression and snark from someone who's entirely wrong.  The only other Assassins in the game back then were Evelynn and Shaco.  That's it.  Kassadin wasn't an Assassin back then.  Believe it or not, he was intended to be played as an autoattacking melee bruiser, according to Riot themselves.  When people built him AP and went instakilling people with him, Riot shut that down hard.\n\nEve killed too fast on release so she too was nerfed into obscurity, becoming so bad that the community used her as the ultimate example of uselessness, dubbing the term \"Eve tier.\"\n\nShaco was always the tricky mofo that he is, but back in those days he needed lots of time to finish the job.  That's why he has Two-Shiv Poison.  The Assassination took so long that he needed a permanently renewing slow to keep them away from the turret as he did his work.  Wouldn't a _permanent_ slow be a weird design choice if he was intended to kill quickly?\n\nKatarina used to have a move called Sinister Steel which helped her stick to targets for prolonged periods of time, but nowadays she doesn't even have Sinister Steel anymore because she doesn't need sticking power when just reaching you is enough to kill you.  She and Shaco both needed sticking power because assassinations were NOT very fast ordeals back then.\n\nAkali was released in season 1 and she needed 3 Q+Auto+R combos to kill somebody.  That's why she had 3 procs on her R.  It was expected of her to need the whole thing.  What, do you think they just randomly gave her way more than what was necessary?  That's called \"Overpowered.\"  Seriously, if you just look at the kits of these Assassins you can tell they were meant to fight prolonged battles.  In a way, they were the original Duelists.\n\nIt wasn't until Talon came along that a Non-Mage was able to 100-0 somebody in 3 seconds or less, but even then, he was specifically designed to be the Mage killer.  Even so, that level of power was breaking the game so the community was outraged.  Know what Riot did with him?  They nerfed him into obscurity.  Such power on Assassins was not acceptable back then.\n\nAnyone else who you want to claim instakilled people back then was not an Assassin, they were a Mage.  Because instakilling people was originally the job of Burst Mages who lacked mobility, utility and survivability.  After all, that was a reasonable price for being able to instakill one person.  Total vulnerability.  LeBlanc was the special case since she had mobility and that tricky passive, but she had her own huge weaknesses.\n\nI could easily go on but my point should be well and truly made by now.  Ease up on your attitude.  You're talking to _people._  I gather that since you're using a throw-away account and talking to people like they're animals, you probably don't feel too much of a sense of communal bonding.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"potchiker","date":"2018-06-24T17:20:38.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FixHealsRemoveGW,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=X32p5KT9,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-06-24T14:52:25.513+0000)\n>\n> There are lot of champions that only are viable because they can successfully go all in, champions that rely on combos.
