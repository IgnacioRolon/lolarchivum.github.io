That means increasing its damage isn't appropriate, but making it weaker when he's not in the Danger Zone probably isn't a good fit either - it succeeds and fails hard enough already.\n\nIf we were happy with a bit more variance though and added a Danger Zone bonus we'd almost certainly have to reduce the current damage to compensate (so lower than current without bonus, higher than current with). Rumble's not too stompy when played by someone only moderately familiar with him, he's got one of the steepest learning curves in the game statistically though, so becomes really effective when played by someone with a lot of experience on him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2014-12-09T20:13:03.300+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Title says it all, I've always wondered why his ult doesn't have some kind of bonus for being in the danger zone.\n\nBecause it's his ultimate. {{champion:68}} 's Heat mechanic is meant to be a gate to his spammable basic abilities, and the Danger Zone bonuses are there to encourage proper ability timing in order to make the most out of them. Equalizer isn't spammable, and its timing has nothing to do with the use of his other abilities, so it would make little sense to give it a Danger Zone bonus. The variance it would bring would mean that the ultimate would have a case where it would be either far too strong, or far too weak, depending on balancing (unless there's not that much variance in the end, in which case there would be no point to the Danger Zone bonus in the first place).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2014-12-09T19:51:59.253+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rumble main here. I'm convinced his winrate is only low because he suffers from the \"Noobs play him\" problem. He is hard to pick up but once you get him down he's easy to play well.\n\nAssuming he DID need a buff, the LAST thing you'd want to do is buff his ultimate. At worst, they sidestep it as it falls out of the sky. At best, their whole team is baited into the jungle where they all take 60% of their hp from full duration. Buffing the Equalizer would make him and incredibly toxic one and a few halfs trick pony.\n\nIf he did need buffs, they would need to buff his w. His q is great, and with its good scaling and high bases, is fantastic danger zone late game. His e is again, bad early unless you land both, but once you get it leveled and some ap, can be once of the most powerful abilities and the only reason he can duel and adc late. His W is never really great, it's just always decent. And to buff it, they would have to remove the shiled OR the speed, and move that power to whichever they leave behind. Or they could keep both and increase the cd and make it stronger.\n\nQwe makes him great in lane, and his r keeps him from falling off in teamfights. He has more viable build options than any other AP champions aside from Amumu and Cho'Gath.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2014-12-09T20:40:51.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"because rumble needs no fucking buffs right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TigerBloodz","date":"2014-12-09T20:23:01.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro have you watched esports lately?
