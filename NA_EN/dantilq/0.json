This is negative, because it makes junglers get less camps, which makes them more predictable, and it changes the meta towards champs that can fast and easy solo/duo a camp level 1, and it also heavily influence how laning is done because you start at level 2 instead, and overall this can cause some big snowballing.\n\nCurrent approach by Riot is to change the jungle; to make it spawn later, be more difficult for laners to take and a few other solutions. All of those have big costs attached to it, and changes how the game are played quite a bit. Late spawns changes how invades are being viewed, high difficulty make jungling harder, and attaching too much on smite/jungle item and laners can't use jungle as a fall-back pattern.  Overall [Riot is not too happy with solutions](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/p77Wmyr4-recent-jungle-experimentation-context-post) tried so far.\n\nHow about instead of changing jungle alter the first wave, which in effect also make it more costly to do Krugs or Gromp at level 1 for laners. If the level 1 wave is worth much more than it is currently, or if there is mechanics making it more valuable to be in lane early, then the cost of poaching would be higher.\n\nI imagine something like first wave drops gold/exp like thresh souls, and if they are last-hitted you get it automatically, but if they die to minions, either side can pick them up, so if you are late to lane, enemy can pick up both sides exp or similar.\n\nIt does add another complication, but a mechanic like that or similar would make it more valuable to be in lane early.\n\nAnother possibility is that two mini-buffs spawns in lane early on each side, so if enemy comes to lane late, you get both the buffs. The buffs could grant temporary AD/AP or that it gives Gold/exp or something similar. The general idea being that the one being late simply doesn't get the buff.\n\nAdd some small objective to the lanes, making it valuable to be there, and make the objective fairly powerful too, and not very easy to take, unless enemy gives it up to poach jungle instead.\n\n**tl;dr; Reward getting to lane early, instead of punish for poaching**","replies":[{"poster":"Espy Psyche","date":"2014-12-17T21:34:46.415+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why Machete (and upgrades) needs a new effect:\n\nUnique Passive -- Jungle Guard: Unlocks experience gain from neutral monsters before level 4.\n\nAnd then non-machete holders get 0 XP no matter how many jungle creeps they kill, until they hit level 4.

Level 1 Dragons aren't enough yet.\n\nHonestly your heart is in the right place but considering that the game is currently being ruled more and more by who can push an early game advantage, giving laners a way of adding to the snowball that junglers can already nudge over the edge of the mountainside is just asking for trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Dantilq","date":"2014-12-17T10:23:17.257+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasn't level 1 dragons fixed last patch, removing dancing, and not letting pantheon block it?\n\nAlso there already IS a fairly massive thing level 1 in that you can poach jungle, which instantly pushes you to level 2, and certain laners can abuse that heavily. Example is Top Maokai which can start on the Razorbeaks and then get to lane level 2.\n\nBot lane can do krugs/gromp and this pushes them to level 2, if enemy doesn't do this, they get massive advantage which snowballs the game.

Guess he's now got to be level 3 and get a quick bit of help from his laners. And try to remember that there are plenty of other champions who can get early dragons besides Pantheon, he's just the most well known for it.\n\nA strategy like that also hurts the jungler by removing part of their income and putting them back a level considering quite a few junglers do a leashed blue, wolves, and then raptors for level 3. You're also missing the bit where the recent patch reduced the amount of gold that camps give someone who doesn't have a Hunter's Machete bought, so there's already less incentive to poach from a gold standpoint and less incentive to poach from a \"I probably shouldn't force my jungler to be behind in levels\" standpoint. \n\nSure they're going to arrive in lane at level 2, but level 2 isn't going to take a turret. And if a lane has an early advantage like that they're naturally going to push, which leaves them much more susceptible to ganks. If a lane does this, abuse it by having your jungler camp them out. They'll have to back off and you'll catch up in levels while their jungler can't give a strong enough countergank because he's behind your jungler after having lost one of his camps early on.\n\nIt balances itself out if you're smart about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dantilq","date":"2014-12-17T10:49:55.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are smart about it, then there is not disadvantage. If your botlane start krugs, then jungler start gromp, and then go for blue and red, and then does wolves/razorbeaks.\n\nStealing 1 camp from jungler is possible to work around for the jungler with proper pathing, as the camps respawn eventually, it does make the jungler more predictable though.\n\nLevel 2 advantage is MASSIVE, especially botlane. It's the most common reason lane is won, and the reason they changed how you gain stats in preseason. Level 2 all-ins is one of the more common ways to win lane bot. You can't \"just push\" because if you do, they just kill you. You can set up a freeze towards your side, but they will break freeze as soon as they come, and push into tower, and it's too early for jungler to come, if they do that and fail, they might get only get 1 buff.\n\nIn competitive pretty much EVERY bot-lane start on a jungle camp, simply because it's too strong, and it's not for gold at all, but for exp.\n\nDid you read what I wrote on my OP or understand the issue that is being brought up?","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-17T11:24:52.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Understand the issue?\n\nPal I'm a jungler. I don't just understand the issue, I feel it's affects. Hence me saying that decent laners shouldn't poach a camp because it sets a jungler behind out of the path that they've otherwise been practiced with. \n\nHow do I know this? I've been fighting my blue buff at level 1 and saw a Kalista and Blitz take my Krugs. I'm well aware of the issue and how it affects junglers. Me? I go blue, leashed and smited, clear wolves and raptors, usually by now i have to back, then head down to Krugs and use the Krug buff to help fight red so I'm at a higher health when I go to start ganking after that. It takes a bit longer but I feel better about my life that way. Now if you take my Krugs, they aren't going to be back up by the time I get there because it's going to take me less than 1:40 seconds to clear wolves and raptors, back, and then head to Krugs considering that they're killing Krugs at about the same time as I'm killing blue buff with a nice, solid leash. So now I don't have the buff that I'd otherwise enjoy, and the jungle path I've practiced to play into my strategy as a jungler has been thrown off. Even if it's not that big a deal, it's still a dick move on the part of the laners outside of everything else.\n\nI'm also aware that in that match I mentioned the enemy jungler camped out my bottom lane, who kept trying to push their advantage and ended up losing it as a result, while because my jungle path was messed up I ended up heading back up to my top side jungle to get Gromp since there was no reason to stick around in my bottom jungle at that point. So their jungler showed up bot, got my guys to back off a bit. I went down and left them one of those \"ward\" thingies I hear are pretty popular, and when it became apparent the enemy jungler was visiting that portion of river pretty frequently it forced my guys, who had a level advantage at first, to start letting the enemy push the lane back, so they were losing XP and gold. \n\nAgain, smart play can negate early advantages that are just based on a quick level. Especially considering how finicky those first few levels can be early on. I can't tell you how many times my support has somehow magically hit level 3 before I have even with both of us sitting in lane the same amount of time.\n\nIt's just weird I tell you.","replies":[{"poster":"Dantilq","date":"2014-12-17T11:46:18.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why start blue instead of gromp, and can you really do Red, Blue/Gromp, wolves, Razorbeaks, within 1:40, without needing to go back or gank at all?\n\nIf you feel you had to \"wait\" for the krugs, then you could probably have ganked a lane instead, it's part of your jungle pathing as well.\n\nAnd overall you're are using anecdote against a whole situation, it was just one single game of your own, which wasn't fully optimized for it, and your side still lost their advantage, but they did so by forcing jungle pressure. Which means your side should've won, because you could've ganked top and mid, as their jungler was forced bot by what your side did. As long as they survived and that you created as much pressure as their jungler, you would still win out.\n\nAnd you are still not talking about the topic, the topic is about ways to FIX that laners steal jungle. Not about anecdotes about time when they stole jungle and still didn't win game.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-17T18:18:29.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because I like having a leash on blue, and a lot of my champions are either very mana reliant or really enjoy the CDR for increased clear times by being able to spam spells a bit faster. And you aren't having to do all of those in that 1:40, only wolves and raptors. By the time you're finishing your blue buff with a leash they're finishing off the Krugs, so the 1:40 starts around the time you're done with Blue, not when you're starting. You're only actually having to do wolves and then raptors, which don't take very long.\n\nGood to know you read my post though. I specifically stated that I normally have to back after raptors and then head back into the jungle from base after healing up and grabbing my jungle item, which further helps my clear. All in all, wolves then raptors, a back and then heading back down to Krugs only takes me about 70 seconds or so, so when someone takes my Krugs I lose out on precious seconds if I wait for them to come back Only champion I've been playing more recently who doesn't need to back after raptors is Diana.\n\nI'm using an example to showcase how your argument breaks apart rather quickly. Ganking top and mid does nothing when they're playing safe and staying near their turrets My bottom lane lost their level advantage, but I never said that I lost the match because of it. Only that they lost that level advantage, which was just a result of them being worried about pressure from the enemy jungler so they pulled back the lane. I never said that the match was lost in the end, so once again good to know you actually read my post in it's entirety. My point with explaining that they lost their level advantage (not the match) was to show how level advantages don't actually mean a whole lot unless they are used right then and there. It's why a Graves/Leona botlane who reach level two will usually win early engages, but once the other bot lane hits their level 2 the Graves/Leona combo lose a lot of their power in the engages because now the enemy is back on even grounds and a heavy engage can be punished more harshly. If having a single level advantage was enough to win a match then games would be decided at the 2:30 second mark. But smart playing trumps small advantages, and that anecdote is an example of how easy that is to accomplish. \n\nI WAS talking about the topic until you decided to accuse me of not understanding the issue of poaching, so I was forced to explain how I'm aware of the issue and that led me to explaining how I see that while it's a bit of a dick move on the laner's part to the jungler's gameplay, it isn't necessarily winning any matches because level advantages can be lost as quickly as they were won. After that the match proceeded as normally aside from me having to change my jungle route up and feeling the lost amount of gold when I wasn't hitting certain timestamps I knew I could otherwise already have items at.","replies":[{"poster":"Wertilq","date":"2014-12-17T21:36:17.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Topic is still not about poaching, it's about **FIXES** for level 1 poaching.
