This would cause it to not allow you to upgrade the skin to perm even if you have enough Orange essence. You must first buy Gragas.\n\nIf you do own the champion for the skin you are trying to perm and have enough orange essence, then I'm not sure what the problem may be and will probably be best to wait for a reply from a rioter that hangs around support board. Best of luck to ya.","replies":[]}]}
