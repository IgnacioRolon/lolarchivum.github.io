The stack of chords affect the amount of reduction on her cooldowns. For example, if she has 4 stacks of chords and uses Razor Wire at level 5, Razor Wire is essentially refreshed. However, if she consistently uses Razor Wire, the cooldown will now be 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, and then 6 seconds, and by then the cooldown is now its regular amount. The cooldown amount is reduced by the TOTAL AMOUNT of chord stacks. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Q: _Razor Wires_\n> Active: Cable shoots out her wires in a line, spearing all enemies and dealing physical damage. After a brief delay, Cable pulls back all the wires, dealing bonus physical damage as well as pulling the speared enemies toward her.\n> \n> Hot Wire Bonus: Adds a burn for 4 seconds that deal up to a cap amount of 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 true damage.\n> \n> Range: 700 at all ranks\n> Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8\n> Heat Build: 25\n> Damage: 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 / 260\n>Bonus Damage: 5% of missing Health at all ranks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> W: _Fiber Optics_ [Replacing Steel Cables for the moment]\n\n> Passive: Cable weaves herself in tough fiber like wires over a course of 30 seconds, boosting her armor until complete. When completely covered in cables, she is much more dense, absorbing a percentage of enemy attacks based off the status of her armor. This armor can be broken if enough damage is taken. (Visual would include her armor chipping away as she takes damage) \n> \n> Active: Cable places a charge of thin wires onto the next enemy she auto attacks dealing bonus physical damage based upon a percentage of her armor, as well as revealing them in the fog of war for 7 seconds. \n \n> Hot Wire Bonus: \n> Cable super heats the wires, shredding armor by 5% / 10% / 15% / 20% / 25% as the wires dig into the enemy. \n> \n> Cooldown: 8 seconds at all ranks\n> Heat build: 10\n> Bonus Damage: 20% / 40% / 60% / 80% / 100% of armor\n> Passive Damage Reduction: 20% / 40% / 60% / 80% / 100% of armor \n> Maximum Armor Health: 300 / 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 (+3% Max HP) \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> E: _Trip Wire_\n\n> Cable lays down a long line of wire that links to a nearby wall. Enemy Champions that pass through it are whipped from their position to the wall, dealing physical damage based off how far they are from the wall and stunning them for .75/1.00/1.25/1.50/1.75 seconds. Cable can only lay down one Trip Wire at a time.\n> Trip Wires will stealth after .5 seconds.\n> \n> Hot Wire Bonus: Trip Wires will become Live Wires, which explode when impact is made with the wall, dealing bonus physical damage. \n> \n> Range: 200 - 1000\n> Cooldown: 25 / 24 / 23 / 22 / 21 seconds\n> Heat Build: 0\n> Damage: 100 - 200 / 150 - 250 / 200 - 300 / 250 - 350 / 300 - 400 (+.35 - .7 AD)\n> Live Wire Bonus Damage: 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 / 160 (+.35 AD)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> R: _Life Line_\n\n> Cable aims and shoots a wire into a champion's heart dealing 3 / 6 / 9% (+1% of Cable's Health) of their total health as physical damage and healing for half of the damage done over 3 seconds. At the end of the duration Cable snaps the enemy that are tethered towards her dealing physical damage based on the distance that the enemy has traveled away from her. She is able to fire up to three wires into three different champions.\n> \n> Hot Wire Bonus: While the wires are in their heart, they burn for and additional 2% of their missing health each second they are attached.\n> \n> Cooldown: 120 / 110 / 100 seconds\n> Life Line Radius: 1000\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLore:\nPiltover, a land of innovation and science who's geniuses are stifled only by the limits of their own imagination. It is home to inventors such as Jayce and Heimerdinger, who have helped pave the way for the future. However, not everyone's genius is adored in the city. Enter Cable, formally known as Devin. She had high ambitions and large dreams, but little to no means to execute on them. In her younger days she was able to brandish her genius to the eager minds of her childhood friends and teachers alike, but since the recent attacks by Jinx on the city, the last thing on anyone's mind is the \"Next Big Thing\". Having a mind like hers squandered because of a blue haired lunatic drove Devin to join in on the looting and rioting in the streets of Piltover within the wake of the chaos. However, Devin had no need for any simple material goods or supplies, she wanted gear that could show the city just how capable she really is.\n\n On one of her excursions out into the ruined streets, she came across a strange device in the rubble of a formally high-rise construction firm. This device had what could only be described as a self generating weaving machine, able to weave together materials from elements in the air to create high strength string. Devin saw to take this device back with her into her private labs and began to experiment with the device. Her studies showed that the strings could be woven into varying sizes, thicknesses, and elasticity. Devin began to experiment with the strings and found that they could be as malleable as a whip and be as thick and strong as steel cables. Her greatest finding was that although the system itself would overheat, the cables retained the heat inside themselves, turning the strings into white hot razor wires. After reverse engineering the device and creating a duplicate, Devin looked to the world to see how she could use this mechanism to aid others, specifically her ailing city.\n\nWhen she returned to the outside and saw even more havoc running rampant, Devin took it upon herself to help bring back peace from the anarchy. Fastening the two devices to a pair of heat resistant gauntlets and creating thin armor from the strings, Devin donned the moniker Cable, and began to put criminals behind bars at exhilarating speed and efficiency. Recognized now as a true hero by those around her, Cable aids Caitlyn and Vi in the police force to bring down Jinx and stitch back the broken seams to restore order to Piltover once and for all.

Regarding the Ultimate, unless I'm mistaken it seems very similar to Morgana's, and I'm not sure there's enough counterplay involved if the player can manually end the spell early, and the enemy takes a chunk of damage for getting out of range, too.

I'm worried how practical it is, though.  It seems like it's either useless because no one on the enemy team is fed, or it totally shuts down a hyper carry who worked hard to snowball an advantage that you basically get to counter for free.  Seems like a feast-or-famine ability and possibly not a healthy one.\n\n7- Generally speaking, I found this kit to be pretty complicated in terms of how many raw moving parts it contains.  You've got two passives, a new type of resource (two if you count the cable stacks, which I still don't understand with regards to how the player acquires them), special properties for all of Cable's abilities based on the Heat resource, burn effects, stealth traps, armor shred, environmental DoTs, true damage... it's just a lot.  I think you've done a good job at making the kit not horrifically overpowered as a result of having such an overloaded kit, but from a usability perspective (as, with AND against Cable) I think some of this should be trimmed down.","replies":[{"poster":"Yo Niqqa Jaquan","date":"2015-05-07T23:55:25.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=XVj279QA,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-07T00:19:58.896+0000)\n>\n> Hi Dez!\n> \n> I'm still at work so the notes I offer might be a little looser and less formal than I'd like. \n> \n> 1- Cable has an incredibly unique theme and visual aesthetic.

I also reworked her W completely and her E as more of a counter-gank/ganking mechanism. I also took the time to clarify her passive more, and add a little more to her Q. Overall I don't know if this helped with her becoming a little more manageable or not as well as more fun to be as a juggernaut who wants more attention on her (Both in her lore and her gameplay style ;)) I also wanted to ask on what you think i should tweak or change about her ult. I think thematically it fits. But you are completely right on how its just a glorified Morgana ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-05-12T07:15:09.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DezOverlord,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=XVj279QA,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-05-07T23:55:25.694+0000)\n>\n> Hey thanks for the feed back, I decided to cut back on the \"Fire\" aspect of **HER** build (Sorry about that, i thought she Cable should be a woman instead of a male after a minute and changed him to a she mid draft :P).

Glad to know Cable has a gender identity now.  :p\n\nWhat if the ult worked like a combination of Irelia and Morgana's?  Cable can shoot out up to three skillshot cables that attach to enemy champions, which she casts one at a time.  This slows them dramatically and possibly even tethers them to Cable.  She can muscle up to three of them at a time and root them, and after ~5 seconds she pulls them all to her simultaneously, dealing massive physical damage based on the number of enemy champions she has pulled.\n\n...Sounds pretty fucking badass to me, actually.  I may have to steal my own idea.  0_0","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yo Niqqa Jaquan","date":"2015-05-06T05:47:20.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I edited, cleaned up, and changed a lot of ideas for Cable.

I'm still clarifying the kit and design of the champ. And he was an assassin initially but now he is more of a top lane tank with cc. I'll update everything by the end of today and open up a discussion on potential changes and ideas.","replies":[]}]}]}
