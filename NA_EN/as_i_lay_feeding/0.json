And the next drake is also a infernal drake, and the next one after that is also a infernal drake. The worst part of this is like when the enemy team has a Jhin and a Riven. There is no way to comeback after the enemy team has like 2x+ infernals.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-16T16:41:21.441+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"getting 3 infernals does not = victory. As I have had it before and lost. Even so getting 3 Infernals is rare and it takes over 18 minutes of the game to get 3 even if they are in a row so there is plenty of time to compete for them, and you can always try to go for herald while enemy team is doing drake which I found out recently whichever team gets herald has a 71% chance of winning the game which I think is pretty crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"Kattzy","date":"2018-11-16T19:11:37.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if the correlation between herald and winning is actually just that herald feels more like a bonus if you're already winning and not a hotly contested must-have objective. It seems to me that the majority of the time my team gets herald, it's because we are already stomping so \"hey might as well grab herald.\" So basically, getting herald doesn't increase your chance of winning, but is an indicator that your team won early game hard and so will prob continue the snowball.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-16T19:52:56.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it also doesnt help that getting the first inhib increases that percentage to 90% chance of victory.

It isnt just a few times that I have stolen a baron with janna q as support and we won the game because of that steal. Being able to make those steals and steal both dragon and baron buff is advantageous. If it wasn't gamechanging and just utility like move speed you wouldnt really make an effort to secure it. And it is also a strategy when I go a jungler that can't clear that easilly I try to stall dragon so there are as few as possible and steal when I can","replies":[]}]}
