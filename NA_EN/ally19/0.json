However, my password was very easy to remember and i wouldn't  have forgotten it, also i had clicked on a dodgy link. The person had sent me a link and said his account had been hacked and should not click on the link, but he had said this after I had clicked it. It said sign in and looked like the league sign in page and i quickly closed it. I have clicked forgot password on the league client and entered my account name but no email has been sent after a whole day when it said it will only take 5 minutes. I just want my account back, it has my credit card details on it as well. I have filled out a ticket yesterday and i have gotten no response.
