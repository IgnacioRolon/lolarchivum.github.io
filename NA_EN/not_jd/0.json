As of now, we have played 9 games total, we won 7 and lost 2, placing us in Silver 2. We started off with a 5 man team, which crumbled to around 3-4 consistent players leaving 2 main roles open, along with subs. As of now, we are in need of a solid Top Laner, and a solid Mid Laner, as well as subs that can play 2 or more roles consistently. \n\nWe understand that everyone isn't perfect and we're willing to help with that as you go along, but we do not want to teach you everything. You must have prior knowledge of your role, and be able to hold your own. We will be setting up scheduled practice times eventually during evenings, so if you can't be dedicated with those, then this team is not for you. We are looking to have fun, as well as grow as a team. So if you think you're up for that, please feel free to submit an application.\n\nI have my own TeamSpeak server we can use, so we will be most likely communicating through that.\n\n\nDo not add me in game, I will add you so we can setup a tryout time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTeam Name: Ryans Btches (Will probably make a different team later so we shouldn't worry too much about the name now)\n\n\nCurrent Roster:\nTop: None atm\nJungle: Leo Das Fuhrer(Silver 4)\nMiddle: LaVeya (Silver 4) - Also looking for another mid when she's not here\nADC:Roughs(Diamond 5)\nSupport: Mightyquiver (Platinum 2)\n\nSubs: None atm\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n1.
