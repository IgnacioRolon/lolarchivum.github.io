We have DONE this in the past and worked and played both together, yesterday we even played one and after we started another game, the game crashed after we selected champs and started. Game no longer works, nor let me connect to normals, aram, custom or any game mode and doesn't even connect to chat neither. What is wrong with this, I have never had this issue. Tried disabling firewall, I don't have lolreplay, nothing works, I am repairing client right now, but it just doesn't make sense, that on 2 different computers the same thing happened at the same time in different accounts.\n\nEDIT: The repair didn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T02:33:30.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like an issue local to the network you're connecting from.
