Attached is the chatlog to my one and only game of chatlog provided. Thoughts? Is this perma ban deserved? I don&#039;t think it is, but if it happened, then perhaps the public can help me see why this is perma ban worthy. I do appreciate constructive feedback, as I have 4 more accounts to play on I&#039;d like to avoid losing them as well, but I really do not see this as a perma ban. I understand how the banning works in that I have received prior punishments, but if this is all it took to get the final nail in the coffin - then idk... seems a little odd to me.

Thank you all for the constructive feedback. I'll try it Riot's way and see if they can handle all my bullies for me.

However, I am still confused. I am under the assumption you have access to entire logs, and perhaps even champ select logs. My whole team was giving each other shit for me running Ignite over Heal, as my AD wanted to run Barrier or Cleanse. I don't like Heal so I kept Ignite (I don't believe I responded). In game I think someone commented about me running Ignite (not in a negative way but more in a debate like fashion). So I pointed out my thoughts on Barrier. Where I point that out - is that REALLY considered \"giving him shit\"? I feel like I just don't see the world the way you do, Tantram. To me thats just back n forth - They call ignite on Soraka shit I throw a shot back. Is that truly wrong? I'm not saying you're wrong but... It doesn't feel that bad to me. \n\nI will open a ticket, and if you can give me your two cents on what I just added here... I will take that advice I apply it to future games on my other accounts. \n\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-09-14T23:14:53.420+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does have access to the full logs, your behavioral history, pre/ post / out of game logs and more.\n\nThere is a reason why he's telling you to submit a ticket.

How many times have they just continued on with their behavior after you raged and flamed at them?\n\nTrolls are looking to get a negative reaction out of you, and when you give them it you encourage them to continue with their poor behavior. If you kill them with kindness or simply don't give them the response they want to see then chances are they'll stop trolling and focus on trying to win the game. Even if they don't giving them that negative response is still better than putting your account at risk for a punishment.\n\nI get how frustrating trolls can be: I've had more than my fair share of trolls in a couple of my games. However there are better ways of dealing with them than raging at them in chat. I get frustrated sure, but I just yell and rage at the screen and not in-game. It's not about \"creating a culture of hands tied\" or \"being a victim that seeks protection\" it's about being smart not stupid when it comes to dealing with problem players.\n\nP.S. I read the support ticket responses you posted and it seems to me that they did take into account that you felt the ban was unfair, went over the reasons why it wouldn't be lifted and even offered some tips on how to handle situations like that better in the future. Compared to other tickets posted by other users as of late I'd say that this is a really good example of them caring about their customers. There's a difference between them not caring about your thoughts on the matter and you not liking the answers that they gave and in this case this is clearly an example of the latter.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"jwebb0113","date":"2017-09-14T23:04:04.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"for this i dont think you deserve punishment of any kind. were you a bit of an ass ? yea but no worst then anything i see in every damn game i play. the thing is they are basing your punishment off of your history. not off of this game. basically you got reported. maybe by more then one team mate. and since you been flagged as a \"bad boy\" you get no leeway ... its kinda like the 3 strike laws. you get convicted twice do your time and do good for a while and the smallest thing that normally would be a misdemeanor is now a felony due to your priors and cuz of your priors this is 3rd strike so you get life. its bullshit... \n\nthat is why mandatory minimums in the legal system are bad and so  is the punishment system of league. \n\neverything needs to be looked on a case by case situation , where history does come into play if you keep doing the same thing over and over. say such as hate speech ... then it should have baring on the decision of punishment... but when its clearly a lil arguing and no direct verbal abuse , foul language, hate speech etc i  think history needs to be over looked. maybe not a ban for this maybe another chat restriction just based on you being a repeat offender. \n\ni feel at some point after you have had a punishment ... and some time goes by before your next offense if not worst then priors you shouldnt always escalate into the next tier .","replies":[{"poster":"Utility BackIine","date":"2017-09-14T23:21:08.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jwebb0113,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KusqXxa9,comment-id=000f00000001,timestamp=2017-09-14T23:04:04.574+0000)\n>\n> for this i dont think you deserve punishment of any kind. were you a bit of an ass ? yea but no worst then anything i see in every damn game i play. the thing is they are basing your punishment off of your history. not off of this game. basically you got reported. maybe by more then one team mate. and since you been flagged as a &quot;bad boy&quot; you get no leeway ... its kinda like the 3 strike laws. you get convicted twice do your time and do good for a while and the smallest thing that normally would be a misdemeanor is now a felony due to your priors and cuz of your priors this is 3rd strike so you get life. its bullshit... \n> \n> that is why mandatory minimums in the legal system are bad and so  is the punishment system of league. \n> \n> everything needs to be looked on a case by case situation , where history does come into play if you keep doing the same thing over and over. say such as hate speech ... then it should have baring on the decision of punishment... but when its clearly a lil arguing and no direct verbal abuse , foul language, hate speech etc i  think history needs to be over looked. maybe not a ban for this maybe another chat restriction just based on you being a repeat offender. \n> \n> i feel at some point after you have had a punishment ... and some time goes by before your next offense if not worst then priors you shouldnt always escalate into the next tier .\n\nI guess at this point I just have to talk Tantram, the Arbiter and some of the people at their word about what they see in my logs.

I have not used their Support Ticket in quite some time, but I was always under that impression. I did not intend to come to the forums to unban my account, but more to look for advice so that I don't lose my other accounts. It sucks I've lost this one, and if I am given a chance to redeem myself I would take it seriously. But I honestly came here because my 1 chatlog felt empty and void of what would consitute a perm ban. However, based on what Riot, and Arbiter, and some others have pointed out. I can see more clearly what my chatlog contained, and am learning that maybe what was said there is enough to get me punished, regardless of their punishment tier system. So now its come down to me having to ask myself \"Is this a culture I can actually conform to, or do I have to do the drastic mute all forever\" or something radical along those lines.","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2017-09-15T06:32:51.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is definitely not true btw.

IE: I use op.gg to point out how my stats are superior is punishable, wrong, and should never be something you do. I like the game... so I guess I have to accept that. However, I don't feel I am entirely arguing that my behaviour wasn't that bad... I just feel like these things were acceptable at one time, and I always seem to be on the tail end of acceptable and the nose end of unacceptable, like I'm almost perfectly riding the line/grey area. Every year I try to conform better, but every year the sensitivity goes up and the rules get stricter. It feels odd. \n\nI focus on how I can be better/different, but at the same time and in my defense... My 1 chatlog feels very empty. I don't see a lot to work with. Am I blind? It seems people here have gotten me to focus on the summoner spell mentioning, and the op.gg mentioning. So I can remove that stuff from my banter. Or do I have to take a more radical approach?

That's why I came here. I just see banter/shittalking differently. I see it as a part of the game and a fun part. I liked playing sports and some kid on my team criticized how I played my position. And then it gave me an opportunity to prove him wrong, and shit talk him back. Same went for my opponents. And when the game ended, I loved those moments where you could continue the argument and shit talking. Sometimes they got the better of me, or their critiques stuck more. Or I lost the game and they rubbed it in my nose, and it sucked. But on flip side, when it didn't suck and when you felt superior it was great. It kept me coming back to Soccer, High School sports, online gaming. I try to envision playing this game and all anyone has said was \"GL HF\" \"Need wards\" \"summs down\" \"Can you do x?\" \"No.\" \"Ok.\" \"Lets baron.\" \"ggwp\". Seems... idk... a little boring. I'm clearly in the minority for thinking this way, which is why I'm in this situation.
