For example, on lee sin you might typically use normal cast for most abilities but you could set your ward and w abilities to be quickcast for better ward hops. I always use quickcast with indicator, but for a few abilities (like ward hops on lee sin) I would prefer to have standard quickcast. Currently if you select qucikcast with indicator it forces all abilities that are quickcasted to have the indicator and there is no way for you to set some abilities to have the indicator and others to be standard quickcast. This would be a great little change in my opinion if you could select normal cast, quickcast, or quickcast with indicator for each ability separately.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-02T20:10:54.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't you just go to keybindings, and change them all manually there?

The reason being is that those Qs are super low cooldown and are CORE to the characters gameplay in the perspective that they almost replace the mechanical need to basic attack, just as basic attacks don't inherently show attack ranges UNLESS you use attack move.
