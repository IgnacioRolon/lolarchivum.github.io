However when I try running League client now I get the error message \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working\" almost immediately. So I tried fully uninstalling first, wiping all left over Riot games files so it was shiny and clean, then grabbing the current download off the site. Same problem, after initial download and running the launcher \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working\"\r\n\r\nCan't seem to find a reason why, please send help","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T01:32:37.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I most often see this when League hasn't been granted the proper administrative privileges. League requires specific levels of access due to how many software packages and files it interacts with outside of the League folder. I suggest [configuring your system permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) for League to make sure all is well on that front.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Nova Browser","date":"2016-11-01T23:23:32.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it resolved my issue (same as OP's) so thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
