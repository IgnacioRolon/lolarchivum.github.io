It&#039;s probably still going on as I&#039;m typing this, but I was having all kinds of disconnects and lag throughout the game. I didn&#039;t think much of this, I just thought it was one of those days, and it&#039;s probably unrelated to the real problem.\n\nThen it finally stabilized and we were winning. I was about to charge into the enemy Ahri then the screen freezes and I get the message League of Legends has stopped working. I was tempted to throw my mouse across the room, but I resisted and just tried to reconnect. It wouldn&#039;t start. I then thought my task bar was having issues so I tried to find it in my files and start again. Then I realized league of legends was deleted from my computer! I&#039;m not kidding! My lol file that I created was empty, I even tried to search for league in my files, there is zilch. I&#039;m reinstalling right now.\n\nHow could this happen? I had a rocky start, but it wasn&#039;t out of the ordinary. Then suddenly it all just disappears while I&#039;m in a game. I know this sounds crazy, but it&#039;s true.\n\nUpdate. My storage driver is missing! It's not a bug, my storage driver is gone from my laptop. Ok I solved the problem. I just needed to reboot. Apparently It wasn't detecting my storage drive, and that fixed it. So I guess ignore this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-12-20T21:36:56.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, a shortcut is not the game.\n\nCheck \"C:/Riot Games\" on windows.\n\nMost likely you have some trash antivirus, get rid of it and just use whatever is built in - neither will protect you from anything you let in, anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandalorian 117","date":"2017-12-20T22:01:32.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I checked that.
