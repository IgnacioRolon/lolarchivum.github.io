Is his lore outdated since Piltover ain&#039;t to crazy about yordles anymore? If so, what&#039;s he doing?

Blitzcrank is a cleaning bot, which makes me think that he was built by the government of Zaun, not a private citizen. Since we don't have any \"standard\" zaunite champ (IIRC), I'd say the closest thing we have that could be taken as a model for Blitz' updated look is Zaun's environment and technology. Bioluminescence mentions the elevators, and the Zaun aesthetic so far has been of art nouveau/deco with lots of grass, metal frames and shades of green and black.

It’s the only real ability he’s using in either story. It’s the most core part of his kit, so it would be strange to call him blitzcrank without a pull.\n\nHis ult is fun since it’s one of the few silence abilities left, but it’s somewhat uninteresting despite that. Other than the passive lightning, that’s interesting but not always useful.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-12-05T21:41:25.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read it when it came out but I have a bad memory.
