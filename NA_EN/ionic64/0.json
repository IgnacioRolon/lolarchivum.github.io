In the last couple of weeks I&#039;ve noticed that all of my Zac skins have become a very darker shade almost muddy looking. No other champ has this issue, and normally I would brush this issue off, but I like Zac a lot. I&#039;ve gone thru all of the options, turned off and on all that I would think would correct it, and still nothing has fixed it.  Please help!!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-27T14:35:46.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Thanks for the report! I'm thinking that maybe a spec map is (accidentally) lost on these skins on higher settings. Are you playing on low settings, by chance?","replies":[{"poster":"iONic64","date":"2018-03-27T14:41:20.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am playing on low settings, but I have changed the settings to high and still looks the same. Even on low settings the other champs do not have this color issue.

Are you seeing this all the time, and if so, could you grab me a screenshot?  If you could grab me a screenshot of your in-game video settings, that'd be super helpful, too! \n\nCurrently, I'm seeing things looking okay on high *unless* I'm using my joke and then I'm all splotchy. If I'm on lower settings, it looks like he's a bit darker, which as I'd mentioned is due to intentionally flipping off the spec map to increase performance. \n\nHere's what I'm seeing on my machine:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/LXujz1E\nhttps://imgur.com/3aDoxfD","replies":[{"poster":"iONic64","date":"2018-03-27T15:26:13.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly what i'm seeing.  but why does this not happen to the other champs, just zac??

It's something not many champions have, which is why you're likely only seeing it with Zac. On higher video settings, all VFX display without issue. As you lower the video settings, you increase performance, but lose some of the fidelity of VFX, so things like extra sparkles may disappear. The overlay Zac has is pretty graphically intensive, so to help with that, the spec map (the overlay) is turned off when a player selects lower graphics settings. Does that make sense? He's a really weird edge case in this sense. ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"iONic64","date":"2018-03-27T15:48:35.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, you ever have the problem with your car? You know you hear the clinging and clanging sound, but when you take it in to get looked at, and they don't hear anything. So ugh, I swear I messed with the graphics did everything low, med, high and nothing fixed it. Well umm, I put everything on low and just raised the character detail bar, and well wouldn't you know it corrected it. I'm sorry for bugging you :( I guess i just needed to play around with it more. I do appreciate you going out of your way to help and also explaining why Zac was effected and not the other champs.
