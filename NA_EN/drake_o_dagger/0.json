Long ago, there was a contest known as the CSC (Champion Suggestion Contest), which I ran. One of the submissions was a character who wielded a giant sword that attacked differently based on the position of the blade compared to the enemy. Because the archives are total garbage, and I don&#039;t even have the ability to find my OWN posts from that long ago, does ANYONE know who created it and/or what the champion&#039;s name was? This is a long shot, so I&#039;ll be amazed if anyone does, but I&#039;m really wanting to find them again. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Drake O Dagger","date":"2018-03-19T14:13:34.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, well, guess I don't need this post anymore.

This guy didn't have any activated abilities as far as I remember. It was all passive.\n\nI think the attacks were a poke if the sword was pointing at the enemy, swinging the sword from behind to in front if the sword was behind, and swinging the sword from the side to behind if the sword was to one side.\n\nPretty sure the sword was suppose to be on a wheel or something because it was THAT big.","replies":[]}]}]}
