Spent so much money on this game as i loved it and now its banned and i cant get back on which is heart wrenching.\r\nI hope to get my account back","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T22:19:28.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not 100% sure if you were talking about the account Aerza, but that's not the reason the account was punished. We don't ban accounts simply for speaking in another language, and if what got you punished was in another language it was because of what it meant not because of the language choice.
