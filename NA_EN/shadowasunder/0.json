I am trying to grind back to plat v, and I might leave this season just like last year if I cannot play the game.\r\n\r\n I am reaching pings of 100-500ms once in a while (specifically last night). It was still playable, but quite unresponsive. I was able to grind to silver I, and now I am getting this problem again... During today, I played ranked, no ping issues, but the response is still an issue. As an example, I press e, and move away, e will cast 3 seconds later while my champion runs in the opposite direction I clicked as a lagged out animation, then to the direction I clicked. At this rate, not only from poor match making, but this alone is gonna drop me if it continues to happen each day.\r\n\r\nIt is not a local issue, it is somewhere along the network path/routing which is not my area of expertise. My ISP has already been contacted, and did a full check on there end, and a local check in person; mind you a general connection check, not specifically to your servers. The only thing they found as an issue locally was that there was a bit of a bend in the Fibre Optical wire, preventing light from travelling. That was fixed and now I am back to this block. I seem to be able to play other games fine, and stream videos without issue. Maybe it is only minor, and is happening by coincidence, but one simple lag response like that makes the difference between running away, or running into an enemy player. Securing a kill, or not securing. Dying, or living, I am sure you get the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T21:41:25.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've gone through a lot, and if Targon Blade's suggestion to go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide didn't help then we'll need to take a closer look.
