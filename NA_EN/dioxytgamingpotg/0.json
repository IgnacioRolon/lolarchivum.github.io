WHAT IN FUCKING HELL! I DIDN'T EVEN AGREE TO SURRENDER AND THEY SURRENDERED ALL OF THEM. WE WERE WINNING AND MISFORTUNE (SERIOUSLY SHE'S MISFORTUNE BAD LUCK TO TEAM AND MYSELF. MS. A QUITTER) JUST PRESSED THE SURRENDER BUTTON AND EVERYONE STARTED SAYING YES EXCEPT ME! I DIDN'T AGREE TO SURRENDERING!\r\n\r\nIF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PPL WHO USES THE SURRENDER BUTTON THEN YOU SHOULD SURRENDER YOUR SOUL TO SATAN BECAUSE YOU'RE A FREAKING QUITTER. A FREAK WHO HAS NO LIFE AND A MISREBLE FAILURE IN LIFE. FUCK YOU ALL!\r\n\r\nWHY THIS COMMUNITY IS FULL OF QUITTERS, TROLLERS, FEEDERS, BAD MOJO AND LOTS OF TOXIC PLAYERS. AND I PLAY DOTA 2. I have clean conduct there. AND THIS IS THE FIRST GAME I STARTED SWEARING OR CURSING INGAME. I told them to kys and stop masturbating and cannot accept truth so they all surrendered.\r\n\r\nThis game sucks much dicks and balls and lubed them all and shove it all up in Garen's ass because I think he's the one pressed surrender.\r\n\r\nSomeone explain me why there are too much quitters in this game. Maybe I should have gone to church than play this shitty game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-03T23:12:03.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's understandable that you'd want to keep pushing through towards victory, but it's important to keep in mind that Surrendering is put up for a *vote*. If majority rules (needs to be 4/5 usually I believe) then the vote passes. You still get your vote regardless, but the system needs to respect the wishes of the majority so that others aren't held hostage in a game they think they'd lose no matter what. Heck, sometimes people use surrender as a way to get out of a game they know they can't stay in due to IRL concerns and such.","replies":[{"poster":"KuronekoRuru","date":"2017-12-05T01:23:36.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing i've realised though, is that the ability to surrender makes some of these Project missions near impossible to complete. How am I able to destroy 3 inhibitors or farm up 12k gold if the enemy just surrenders when they're losing at 15 every single game?\n\nHonestly I feel it just creates such a negative, defeatist attitude where after one death people want to surrender and just stop playing entirely. I just feel it's such a horrible mechanic in the game that hurts it more than it helps. If IRL stuff just happens to come up, then that's unfortunate, but it's more or less ruining the game for a lot of people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DioXYTGamingPOTG","date":"2017-12-03T10:41:12.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf! wtf! why?! They can just abandon and never play the game again. Why drag me into this \"surrender\" option. BTW there are too many op heroes here.","replies":[]}]}
