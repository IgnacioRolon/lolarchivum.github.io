I'm sorry this is really off-topic, but I don't know where else to put it, since I made a discussion but it's been a day and no one has answered yet and I'm getting impatient because I can't play league. I accidentally uninstalled the new client, then I read that it says not to uninstall the new client. It's on the post I made on the account YouOnlyHook, if you would please check it out and give me an answer. That would be great if you could do it as soon as possible. Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
