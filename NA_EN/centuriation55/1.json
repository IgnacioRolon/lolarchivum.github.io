They have a program in place that can deny summoner names based on a sequence of lettering, in this case R I O T, in any part of the name in that four letter sequence. F A G, F G T, N G R, S P I C are all ok but R I O T isnt? Its pathetic that the solution is to just \"report\" a fucking lvl 30 with over 1600 games played who apparently ISNT being dealt with. His name is LITERALLY youre a f g t.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-07T04:27:10.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Filters inevitably prevent people from having legitimate names.
