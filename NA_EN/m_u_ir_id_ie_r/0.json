After adding my credentials it said that my account was transferred to another region. Intially i was confused. At worst I thought I was hacked. I tried to login on league of legends.com on my computer but it says the info i typed was incorrect. \r\n\r\nI tried to change my password. My email recieved the request and I changed it. Still the league site wouldnt log me. \r\n\r\nI tried the forgot username function and my email also recieved the notification. in the email it said i was still in NA.\r\n\r\nI am now typing this  plea for help on my phone. Somehow im still signed in Im not sure how. I tried changing my password on here to see that would help. But the current password im inputing is coming up invalid, even though on the client it is proving correct. \r\n\r\nSo much rambling ... please someone help\r\n\r\nI sent in a ticket, I havent recieved a response yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-27T16:29:53.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help with recovering your account, as well as fixing up anything we can during the period that someone else may have been on it.
