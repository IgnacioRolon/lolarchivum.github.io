Like so many of us faced it we have our game crashing after champion select, I looked up for as many solutions as I possibly could but none of them work. So here what happens:\r\n\r\n-I select my champion, no problem\r\n-the loading starts, no problem\r\n-then after 10 secs my computer freezes entirely, cant move the mouse because its bugged, cant quit the loading screen because its bugged.\r\n-I have to restart my computer, go back to lol client launch it etc...\r\n-and usually when i manage to get back in game its already've been remade and lose lp + 5 low priority queues.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help me out! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Alvarez","date":"2016-08-30T17:59:29.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been having a similar problem but after champ select i get the league logo then black screen with the \"Whoops!
