I consulted my friends immediately and i told them i was permanently banned from league of legends, my friends quickly responded that a few days after the Aram game i had played with them. I asked them if i was in the voice call with them to which they told me i refused to join the call and had simply said that my younger brothers were being very loud and it would be annoying (I'm a only child). I looked through my op.gg page and sure enough there were numbers of matches where everything was off such as my flash keys and every single game looked like i was intentionally feeding https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=explodingape. ( I have never gotten a chat ban or temporary suspension before except for leaver buster because of bad wifi)\r\nI have have and never will account share because there is no chance in hell that i would ever gamble a $230 dollar account to any of my friends. It was clear that someone who i had somehow obtained my login info was playing on my account while i was away at school. Because this is my only account i am wondering what i can or should do if possible to get my account Un-Suspended.\r\n                                                                                                                                              \r\n                                                                                                                                                  With Many Thanks, \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                   ExplodingApe","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-06T17:22:19.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you submit a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to our player behavior team, we can investigate what took place on your account.
