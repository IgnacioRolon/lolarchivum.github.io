In the last few seconds of the game where the Nexus giants are fighting each other I jumped onto a Draven as Fiora and tried to best to end him. With the help of the team he quickly died. Immediately after his death I took dot damage and died. Since Draven was dead I thought that was odd unless he red buff so I checked the recap to make sure I wasn&#039;t crazy. Sure enough there it was as were two other sources of damage with no images. I know the recap can act up at times I moused over them as the short respawn timer counted down and was stunned to see the top imageless source to be labeled as &quot;PizzaSlut&quot; for a few hundred points of damage. Okay. Pause. Full stop here. What? I tried to take a picture but the respawn timer was under ten seconds and with my potato phone it doesn&#039;t unlock fast enough. So is &quot;PizzaSlut&quot; a thing? There was no Sivir on the enemy team. \r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\nWas killed by &quot;PizzaSlut&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"SÃ©ance","date":"2018-12-13T05:02:58.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure death recap is a bug at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-13T03:57:33.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/TAJbC7z.jpg\n\nDR is tripping balls, always has been, always will be.","replies":[]}]}
