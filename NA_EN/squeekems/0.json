MtG has Weenie/Control/Combo while SC2 has specific unit counters as well as strategies that work this way (Weenie = Zerg Rush, Control = Standard, Combo = Fast Expansion). Fighting games like Street Fighter have Attack/Block/Throw, as well as L/M/H while Soul Calibur has Horizontal->Crouch->Vertical->Sidestep->Block->Grab.\n\nBasically it's about making a decision that will either be good or bad depending on what your opponent will do. Thus a lot of the fun/challenge of PvP games is about knowing what your opponent will do (through prediction, scouting, vision, mind games, guessing) and then knowing how to counter that - the rest is just the quality of your execution.\n\nI'm not a designer I'm an artist, so feel free to disagree. But the more you look at great pvp games the more you'll notice these patterns (and how they get badly disrupted when a hybrid like 'Bruiser' and 'Assassin' is added to the game - although 5 type loops also exist, they just look a lot more complicated; see Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock).\n\nEdit: Just thought of another one - Camping sniper->SMG/Flashbang rush->Sneaky guy with knife","replies":[{"poster":"Cupkek","date":"2015-04-20T02:57:33.260+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Pwt6QNfw,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-04-19T22:37:27.442+0000)\n> while Soul Calibur has Horizontal->Crouch->Vertical->Sidestep->Block->Grab.\n\n\n\nThis is bs.

Tank\n2. Assassin\n3. Mage\n4. Marksman\n5.

The basic information is the same (I used OP's relationships), but arranging them this way also leads to some interesting thoughts.\n\nWhat do the tank and assassin have in common? They both go straight into the middle of a teamfight to get the enemy damage dealers. I would call that \"reach,\" or \"threat;\" The tank has reach because he just wades into the enemy team, ignoring them; and the assassin uses some form of elusiveness to avoid the enemy team to go straight for the enemy damage dealers.\n\nThe assassin and the mage both rely on burst combos to get things done. Common knowledge, more or less.\n\nThe mage and the marksman both rely on distance/range to be able to stay safe while still doing a lot of damage. Their ability to kite is how they beat fighters.\n\nThe marksman and the fighter both rely on DPS to defeat their enemies. Some have burst combos, but unless they are dropped on a glass cannon, they tend to be weak. And, at any rate, when dealing with an opponent who is durable or can elude their burst combos, they are almost always able to start relying on some form of DPS to win the engagement.\n\nThe fighter and the tank, of course, share durability.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-04-20T09:35:35.236+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem I see with this is the assumption that mages beat fighters.\n\nFighters generally have an advantage over Mages since they have solid itemisation VS magic damage and generally have plenty of damage to overwhelm a squishy mage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-20T01:41:16.770+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruiser has a mix of sustained and burst, which is why most of them rush {{item:3134}} and {{item:3707}} when jungling.
