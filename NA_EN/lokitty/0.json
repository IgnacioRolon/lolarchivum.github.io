Those are my two strongest roles, so when I queue for ranked I pref ADC first, Support second. And, lo and behold, I **_always_** get support. I have **_never_** gotten any other role when I put support as my second pref. I realize that it&#039;s hard to find supports - which really sucks - but this system is absolutely broken for people who _can _ play support, like me, but would rather play another role (so that we&#039;re not absolutely helpless if the rest of the team feeds *ahem*). If someone is preffing another role first, then it&#039;s completely unfair that they will never get to play another role just because they&#039;re _actually_ willing to play support. Not only is this system unfair, it also discourages people from actually preffing support, which only makes the support shortage worse.\n\nI think this should be a super easy thing to fix: just track how many times a player has played support instead of their first choice role and guarantee first choice after a certain number of games. This is similar to what they already do for people who fill support. Does anyone else have thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-31T01:20:25.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot just needs to realize nobody wants to be forced to play a role they do not want just to play at all.\n\nThis is another thing that is destroying bronze/silver/gold ranked, half the players have no idea how to play the champs they are being forced to use.\n\nI have been in premades with friends where one queues mid/sup, the other queues sup/mid, and both get their secondary role. I have to assume this is a bug, because riot cannot possibly employ programmers that awful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fire Twinkie","date":"2016-10-31T00:54:06.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not the only i do mid first and support 2nd","replies":[]}]}
