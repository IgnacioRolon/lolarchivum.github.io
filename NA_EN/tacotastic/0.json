Her AS isn't all too great, her Q doesn't do 100% of her AD, it does 80% on the first and 100% on the second so it's not all that powerful beyond using it to harass in lane or a quick mini-AA. She has 2 AD ratios as an ADC and neither are very good. Q is 80%, W is 6% per stack, going up to 5 to 8 stacks depending on level of R, which is 30% to 48% of her AD per AA. That sounds nice, but you need to do 4 hits PRIOR to getting to the 30% and 7 hits PIOR to getting the 48% boost. It's also magic damage, so it doesn't scale well in the late game, so building AS to get the stacks up ends up costing you since building IE and a crit item nets much more DPS in the long run. I mean.. at max AS, you can only get 5 stacks per 2s, which is 2.5 attacks per sec, the current max. That's if you're standing there perfectly and letting it do the AA's for you since orb-walking with max AS is harder than BoxBox's Riven Animation Cancelling. lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-07-25T06:43:07.485+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or, while her Impure Shots is active, Strut cannot be disabled at all for the duration.

I'd expect people to figure out how to counter the gimmick that is blitz with every champ.\n\nBlitz is a mediocre champ that pales in comparison to a real pull champ like Thresh.  Even Naut is head and shoulders above Blitz.  Blitz should have his entire kit re-evaluated.  The only reason anyone plays him is because he's cheaper than a good champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Beldori","date":"2015-07-25T22:28:19.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More like no matter how easy it is to learn how to counter Blitz there will be situations where you can't avoid being pulled which could mean instant death for the unlucky SoB that was pulled and that's why he still sees play","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cronofuge","date":"2015-07-25T21:23:45.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I tried it too and while it was nice in lane hitting those empowered Q's in lane but the enemy team had a rengar...

Like, the significance of just how much speed you're getting simply for not getting hit is more than people give credit for.\n\n3) Strut can last indefinitely so long as you don't get hit. Corki's Valkyrie is simply a quick dash from one spot to the other. Given that she hasn't been hit along the way, MF would eventually catch Corki...or anyone else...before 17 seconds. You literally just can not outrun this character when Strut ramps up...and now we want that to be even stronger? We already bitch about Kalista and now this is a good idea?\n\n4) Why can't Jinx, Varus, and Ashe be mobile in their own way? Because not every adc should be a speed fiend.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
