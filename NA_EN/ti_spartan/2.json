The first thing you should decide on is if you want to deal with hardware or software more, as the paths to these careers differ greatly. If you want to deal with hardware and repairs, you can get your certifications (CompTIA, Cisco, etc.) and you should be fine. If you want to be a software developer, you should go for a computer science degree.\n\nThere are a lot of really cool jobs you can have in this field. A lot of people tend to assume that \"oh you're a computer guy\" and lump everyone together in the same pool. Really, you could be a network engineer, work in information security, or even one of my favorites, a network penetrator. Those guys use all the tools they have to hack into networks and show companies where their faults in security lie, then come up with solutions for them and implement it.\n\nThere's really a lot you can do in this field and it's great to see that you already know you want to work with computers. I would suggest checking out YouTube for some help on deciding what you want to do. Look up DefCon videos and watch some of the presentations there. [Here's one of my favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4oB28ksiIo). It's only about 20 minutes long, and a lot of the videos average 45-60 minutes, but it's definitely worth the watch!","replies":[{"poster":"TI Spartan","date":"2015-01-09T03:20:15.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot!

If you want a head start, familiarize yourself with the parts that make up the computer, learn how to put one together and take one apart.","replies":[{"poster":"TI Spartan","date":"2015-01-13T21:45:40.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay thank you","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TI Spartan","date":"2015-01-10T02:22:35.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay i will, thank you!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-01-09T13:28:56.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Elduris**, oh how I've missed you on the boards.
