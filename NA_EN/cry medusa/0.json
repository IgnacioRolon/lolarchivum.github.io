However reports are handled, they are done terribly. I have gotten chat restricts for saying practically nothing, or joking around with friends. Now, I have pretty much stopped typing in game altogether aside to defend myself when trolls bash me. I have had so many good ranked games with next to no issues, but whenever I play an urf or normals match just to have some casual fun, everyone rages and flames. The moment I retort in any way, even saying absolutely nothing bad, I'm penalized to a drastic extent. I am not making this post asking for an appeal or anything, but it has gotten ridiculous to the point where I feel it needs to be brought to everyone's attention and acknowledged. I know for a fact that there are many more players like me who wonder why they've been chat restricted or banned while a troll team had gone off the walls verbally to them, and instead of punishing the right players, we're penalized. I had gotten an account suspension and wondered why. I had checked the chat logs and they're from two games. The first one was me telling the enemy team to report a Lee and Yas who openly admitted they were inting my lane on purpose and doing nothing to help multiple times, after taking my lane when I called it and trolling me. Nothing bad was said in the first game, barely anything at all, just me pointing out what was happening. Then the second game was completely ridiculous. It's the shortest chat log where I have said NOTHING worth a report, let alone a ban. This is ridiculous, but this is the reality of things. And Riot doesn't care enough to do anything about it unless its a big streamer who has a major following and could bring it to everyone's attention. They don't care about lesser known players who just want to enjoy the game, they only care when they wrong someone who has a big following that can hurt their reputation. This is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nGame 2 Chat log in text : \r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nCry Medusa: ?\r\nCry Medusa: im proxying\r\nCry Medusa: i didnt\r\nCry Medusa: im proxying lanes\r\nCry Medusa: youre pretty fricking toxic\r\nCry Medusa: its not inting\r\nCry Medusa: yes you are\r\nCry Medusa: harassing me for what, in an urf game\r\nCry Medusa: ok\r\nCry Medusa: dumb toxic trolls are what ruin this community\r\nCry Medusa: gg\r\n\r\nNot even the f word.

So, it appears you're pulling a strawman.\n\nRegardless, to answer your question (however far out of left-field you brought it from);\n\n- People can report for any reason, even invalid reasons.\n- A report triggers a review of the player's behavior _for that match_. The IFS will not dredge up previous matches for the sake of a single, given review.\n- If the player misbehaved in the match that's reviewed, the match gets flagged, and counted against the player's behavioral history.\n- If the player's behavioral history is sufficiently negative (taking into account the consistency of reports being flagged as valid over a given timeframe, as well as the severity of the offenses), the player is punished.\n\nSo, short version; yes, trolls can falsely report someone, but the IFS will just throw those reports out once the review comes up indicating that the report was false. So, ultimately, _no, people cannot get punished for false reports._","replies":[]},{"poster":"hawk77iowa","date":"2019-04-09T03:43:30.568+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":17,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DJColdCutz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aGtE1MJe,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2019-04-09T03:39:40.524+0000)\n>\n> in the chat provided for game 2, he wasn't toxic at all. why would his game 1 chat logs matter, even if he was toxic in them? you're telling me trolls can falsely report someone for toxicity to get a review of the account triggered, and if they were ever toxic in the past, they can get punished off the troll reports? im gonna do that to everyone i see from now on then. hope to see you on the rift!\n\nthis ^^^^^^","replies":[{"poster":"PoppyjDw","date":"2019-04-09T15:01:33.328+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Keep in mind riot participates are incapable of being unbiased and can not see any fault in riots system they lack the ability to have that logic or objective view","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-04-09T11:15:18.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cry Medusa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aGtE1MJe,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-04-09T03:15:25.049+0000)\n>\n> Its annoying and makes it practically impossible to ever discuss anything that should be discussed.

So people can't really give a complete opinion on your punishment since not all of the chat logs are known nor do we know if you were at a higher step of the punishment ladder due to a chat restriction.\n\nGame 2 that you showed was mild, true, but it still had a little insulting when you're calling them, \"dumb toxic trolls\".
