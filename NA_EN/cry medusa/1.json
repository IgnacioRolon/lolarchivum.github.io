Clearly most of the people know it's just fooling around, then you have the one person who wasn't even involved in the conversation reporting after the game as if they're offended about nobody mentioning them, resulting in me getting chat restricted over something I don't even recall being serious at all since I just randomly log on after a break with one. At one point you could actually have convos with people while playing the game, now everyone wants to pretend they're MLG and report over something as simple as typing in all chat \"Your boot's untied.\". Guess the LoL staff just wants everyone to play the game and not say a single word, might as well remove the all chat feature unless they use keywords like \"report\" so you can know to report their team for \"Negative activity\". \r\n\r\nS1-S2 were fine, S3 everything started to decline, now it's just pathetic hoping to play the game for fun, which is the reason games are meant to be played, instead of playing to bore yourself to death. Not to mention most of the games I'm pretty sure I get these dumb reports in are games my teams win or I do better than most of the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Tehemai","date":"2014-12-07T03:22:44.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel the same way. I've never gotten a chat restriction or banned but I just hate chatting in general now because of how they handle reports. I feel like people in this community have lost the real meaning of being toxic. Saying something negative is not being toxic and you shouldn't need to carefully craft criticism in the most delicate way possible just to get your point across. Nowadays playing the game feels like hanging out with your friends while having your mother in the room. \n\nMuting was invented for the oversensitive, reports are supposed to be for the really bad cases where they're literally harassing you.

Best to just hide from a real human interaction? Yea, if you be yourself, you may not always get along. Yes, when that happens, it may even cost you a game. So what. I rather lose every once in a while than playing in a game where people are scared to be themselves and speak their minds. This kind of thing just reinforces the gamers are socially inept stereotype.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-12-07T03:55:19.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"My point is that Riot created the rule that \"joke teasing\" is not okay, and that if you offend someone without intention, it is still wrong.

And to top that off, I don't even argue with people, I just have casual/funny conversations while playing. Stop backing up riot for their BS cases, most of the chat restrictions people get shouldn't even be received.
