Grinding on him actually gave me plans for a day rather than just waking up and working. \n\nBefore i never played supports, the passive or tanky nature didnt appeal to me, i liked someone fast, nimble and mobile really peaked my interest, and when i first played him i loved it.  We rushed from college that day and insta-bought the champs and their skins .\nI only played Edgy champions like Zed, Talon, Jhin, Varus and Warwick but Rakans loud and donkey like (shrek) personality still resonated with me. \n\nAlthough i have some beef with the soul patch he has :( , the art, voice acting, lore and gameplay all blend together perfectly to make a perfect champion. \n\nAgain, Thanks Riot {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-01T00:55:06.584+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hate?","replies":[{"poster":"Perniicious","date":"2018-07-01T00:58:39.302+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-01T01:05:49.011+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux}} \n\nNo, I mean you mentioned \"all the hate Riot is getting\" - just wondered what had happened?","replies":[{"poster":"DirigoX","date":"2018-07-01T01:30:25.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PKerAAY3,comment-id=000900000000,timestamp=2018-07-01T01:05:49.011+0000)\n>\n> {{sticker:sg-lux}} \n> \n> No, I mean you mentioned &quot;all the hate Riot is getting&quot; - just wondered what had happened?\n\nThe crit changes \n\nthe excessive amounts of burst true damage\n\nand the fact that scuttle changes have yet to be reverted. \n\nI know you guys are working hard and you do do great jobs and champions like rakan, but seeing as how you were kinda unaware of the \"hate\" I recommend putting like a survey on the league client homepage after the vs event asking people questions like \"the recent rift scuttle changes had positive benefits? and then the strongly agree to disagree scale.\" among other things it will help the good guys at riot get a better idea of how the playerbase feels","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-01T07:33:19.094+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, well I basically only work on the stories and lore...

I just want to make sure you're seeing both sides of the feedback in case you get to talk with the balance/gameplay devs.  \n\nPractically everyone hates the pace of the game right now though.  Games are too short, snowbally, and full of 100-0s within <2 seconds.  \n\nTanks feel like armor is almost pointless while mages think magic resistance is overpowered.  Full AD teams have too easy of a time shredding armor stacking tanks while AP champions feel like they have no DPS options to break through the defenses of anyone who builds just {{item:3156}} + {{item:3071}} or even one MR tank item {{item:3065}} or {{item:3194}} .\n\nMarksmen mains want crit buffed so that they have zero competition for the bot lane carry position, but everyone else is happy with the slight increase in diversity we have now and marksmen are still being played more than any other class.  The community (Marksmen mains vs everyone else) is split on that issue.  A lot of people feel like Riot is backpedaling against good progress and is showing too much marksman favoritism while marksmen mains hold the game balance hostage because they want to remain the best carry role in the game.  The compromise that will make the most people happy is to reduce the 1-shot damage output being thrown around so that marksmen don't die in >1 second but also add more APC item options and support items to synergize with bot APCs until we get real bot lane carry diversity.\n\nAlso, the community pretty much unanimously disliked the scuttle changes.  I've seen no positive feedback about it.  I have personally gotten used to it, but it has killed weak junglers.  Tank junglers need buffs.  Balance is out of whack right now but some of us are trying to be patient.\n\nAlso, the event missions have been broken this weekend and we lost our event progress.  That's been a slight annoyance but I don't hold it against Riot.  Technical difficulties are sure to happen, and I bet someone had to come in on the weekend to fix it, so I know it sucks for you guys too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-07-01T01:23:50.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People seem to think the insult topics are increasing in quantity even though they really havnt, or if they have, not by a noticeable amount.\n\nPS I have loved and drawn every new Female champ since Camille!
