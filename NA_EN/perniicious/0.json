That kind of translates to a lack of respect for the old champions for us players, who actually play those champions and come to love them. That's the main reason why people hated the pitch of such a dramatic change of lore - you have a story, already written for a champion, that you want to cannibalize and replace with something else entirely because you want a new champion to have that lore. Not cool at all. If you wanted the revenant theme for Pyke, you needed to completely push him in a different direction. The whole undead ripper thing is a good way to do it, but you need to commit to the theme so we can be told a unique tale using a similar backstory (like you have it seems).\n\nThat leads to my next point though - Pyke doesn't come across as dead. At all. He comes across as a male Illaoi. Both have the glowy eyes, and both have spectral/spirit elements to them. Nothing really distinguishes Pyke visually as being dead, because we're reminded so much of how Illaoi interacts with her god. Pyke's skin tone is a very natural, living skin tone, which doesn't sell us undeath, and his recall shows him combatting a leviathan, which again doesn't sell us undeath. Overall, he _feels_ like a mystical pirate more than an undead pirate, and that to me is a pretty big flaw in his visual design if you were aiming to sell us the LOL pirate version of Freddy Kreuger. A good start would be to pull the warm colors out of his brown skin tone, and use a gray/blue underlay for his skin instead, so we're instantly aware that he's got an unnatural pallor.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-05-18T22:15:58.152+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BdPgp4xW,comment-id=0001000000000002000200000003,timestamp=2018-05-18T21:42:17.515+0000)\n\n> \n> That being said, it&#x27;s not particularly refreshing to hear that you guys are so utterly willing to gut the lore of existing champions just because you&#x27;ve created a new champion who fits the theme better. \n> \n\n\nActually, I as far as I know this was the first time this was attempted.   \n\nBut in defense of the process it wasn't done  Willy-nilly.  **You have to change stuff to try and make things better.**  And... thus you will sometimes fail.  \n\nTimes change.

I already talked with Bioluminescence and Scathlocke about it, but I guess I'll do it one more time.\n\nYou can elaborate on what exist, you can add new stories, new perspectives, new facets to a character. But changing what's already done should be a very last resort, should be an exception. You should accept what's there as a base, and do the best you can on those foundations, with an isolated retcon once in a while, again, as a last resort.\n\nI'm not opposed to ANY change, but it's a matter of scale. As it stands, you are far too willing to retcon everything and start from scratch. It makes me lose all confidence in the Lore. Why should I invest time and feelings in the story if anything can change every couple years?\n\nAnd the comparison with comic books is very disingenuous. Each version of Batman was its own self-contained story, and comics have dozens of different time-lines / parallel universes to host the many versions. LoL does not. So I agree there isn't a *right* answer, but there should be ONE answer, because Runeterra is still only ONE universe with ONE timeline. Having too many versions makes me feel like it's no universe at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2018-05-19T01:13:37.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you excluding the times the lore of existing champions was gutted for the new story of a new/reworked champ?

(Kled yelling Charge!, Sion yelling Cowards!&quot; etc...)\n> \n> Then finally, you have &quot;X&quot;number of lines left.   This is where you use lines for &quot;misc other stuff&quot;  e.g. lore, jokes, alleviating player pain  (i.e. Zoe groaning &quot;Darn it&quot; when she misses a long Q) This is where the writer prioritizes and makes judgement calls.  (For instance, maybe you have a targonian character that has some lines for Taric... the lines are super funny.. but your character is a midlaner.  Is it better to have lines for someone they might actually lane against?  Hmmm  -there isn&#x27;t a right answer.)\n> \n>  I remember writing a line or two for Vlad... but I honestly don&#x27;t remember if it got culled. (As Vlad is mostly a mid-laner and Aatrox is mainly a top-laner.)   I will say Aatrox really, really, **really** hates Zoe. (He as a very good reason too hate her-- but also I like to make fun of my, and the designer&#x27;s previous champs).\n\nDon't tell me the proud duelist dude was sealed into the sword by the Aspect of Twilight that got into a child LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"KSGHook","date":"2018-05-19T07:06:57.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so cool!

I know I would kill for Ekko to have dozen more interactions with other champions ( how the hell does he have only 5 minutes worth of VO?!). That's just my personal opinion. Hopefully, in the future, you will allow more champion interactions. It is undeniably my favorite part of a champion's VO being released.\n\nComically enough, a lot of people told me the opposite about Ekko (why is a bunch of his lore in champ interactions which never fire?). It's okay though, you can't please everyone. 5 minutes for Ekko was a lot when we were working on him. Consider that when we did Ekko, most champs had under 1 minute of VO (and some still do). TBH clear -- VO is something Riot is ALWAYS working on, fussing over, experimenting with, and trying to make better while doing out part to keep patch download times down. Every narrative writer's favorite part of the job is writing VO. Sometimes we went overboard and wrote more for more's sake. That also wasn't the best idea.

They won&#x27;t ALL be taunts though.\n\nFor the record, taunts are actually some of the least plausible character interaction triggers. Kled and Camille are perfect examples with their vast majority of kill triggers that have a lot more opportunity to go off, as we'll more than likely be killing opposing characters. It's a bit difficult in the middle of a game to plan to be close enough with enough time to do a taunt to a relevant champion. \n\nA game I played during it's brief life was DC's Infinite Crisis. It had proximity interactions between the heroes that triggered automatically without taunt or joke inputs, but they were limited to 1 run so you didn't get constantly trigger it whenever you got close. So for instance, If Harley Quinn was in lane and the enemy Joker walked up to her, she'd shout something like \"Sorry puddin', I'm going to have to give you the hammer now!\" and so forth. It was a great way to trigger interactions that would allow you to seamlessly play the game and hear fun banter without having to stop and input commands within a certain distance of someone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-05-17T02:48:14.626+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've found that with Riot, particularly in the last couple of years, reality rarely meets expectation.\n\nIt's why I never expect cool interactions between new champions, or kits/in-game visuals that I would have expected based off champion teasers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keshaun","date":"2018-05-20T08:08:05.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BdPgp4xW,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-05-17T02:30:52.897+0000)\n>\n> There were a lot of interactions, but ultimately it didn&#x27;t feel right for the character to have a lot of VO lines toward other characters.

Thank you for taking the time to respond, I really appreciate you :)\n\nI completely agree. I really wanted some interactive lines with {{champion:420}}, {{champion:41}}, and {{champion:111}} with a few more lines with {{champion:21}}. They could've made a story where Pyke was apart of {{champion:41}} crew and was obviously was thrown off and not rescued. From there, he died and met {{champion:111}} who told him about Nagakabouros ({{champion:420}} god) and was resurrected. Once he comes back to land, he goes on a murdering rampage and eventually gets to {{champion:21}}. {{champion:21}} is obviously a skilled fighter and assassin and gives him a run for his money where he his stuck on her name. If either of them kill each other in game, they would have unique interactive lines between one another.\n\nFor Gangplank's part: \"You were once my friend, and now you're my foe. Oranges won't save you, and now it's time to go.\"\n\nFor Nautilus's part: (Nautilus speaking) \"You too, huh?\" (Referring to Nagakabouros resurrecting the both of them.) (Couldn't think of anything off the top of the dome.) :D\n\nFor Illaoi's part: (Illaoi speaking) --> (You are not worthy to duel against me!\" --> (Pyke speaking) \"Why don't you ask your god? Nagakabouros I think his name is? He felt differently.\" --> (Illaoi speaking) \"Face me and I'll see for myself!\"\n\nFor Miss Fortune's part: (Pyke speaking) --> \"ABCDE _short pause_ M .. Ah here is your name! Miss Fortune isn't it? This should be quick.\"\n(Pyke speaking) --> \"I am not like these other weak men from this traitorous place I once called home. A pretty face won't blind me from my ultimate goal!\"\n\nThese are just lines I thought of off the top of the dome. I'm by no means a game developer, so they may or may not be any good, but I did try my best. I'm also not saying to copy and paste these into the game, but if this is seen, I hope there is more thought and creativity when developing more lines for Pyke.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2018-05-16T07:12:15.727+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"For him being sold in his teaser as a vengeful, murderous monster of a man, he does come across as very...
