Fiddles does not have sustain problems. Magus has built in mana regen, and combined with blue buff or a couple of mana pots he is absolutely fine. I don't even see the problem with forcing him to rely on a few mana pots either, because most other junglers are forced to buy health pots, which fiddles has the luxury of not needing. \n\nCutting out half of his early game stats, for mana regen which **he doesn't need**, is ridiculous.\n\nEdit: Not magus, but the completed jungle item has mana regen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-06-13T06:36:32.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Inept Maverick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ge5MQ3Rv,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2015-06-13T06:25:47.640+0000)\n>\n> It gives him more mana sustain than Magus did.

Sure the stats may need a buff (thats why its the PBE), but its a good item for early sustain on him overall.\n\nCurrent Magus + 5% CDR from masteries + Lucidity boots = early 40% CDR on Fiddle.  This item will make him have 40 less AP and make him take much longer to reach the 40% CDR cap.  His primary rush after Lucidity/Magus is Zhonya's (In my opinion).  So you either delay his core Zhonya's for 10% extra CDR, or you rush Zhonya's and just accept that you aren't at the CDR cap anymore, meaning less Ultis, less drains, etc.\n\nBasically it's a huge nerf to Fiddle in general, who is already extremely unpopular and risky to play in the tank meta.  It's inferior for auto-attack based AP junglers like Diana, because they could go Lich Bane instead for a stronger Spellblade proc.  It's basically worse for almost everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-06-13T21:13:57.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lucidity magnus rush fiddle? that was the bronze build of the year. cdr is overrated on fiddle. only support fiddle its good. not saying cdr is bad. but fiddle is all about his ult surprised one rotation aoe deletion. cdr so overrated on fiddle. stop build like that please","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-06-13T21:37:45.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ekko or feed,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ge5MQ3Rv,comment-id=000000000000000100000001,timestamp=2015-06-13T21:13:57.570+0000)\n>\n> lucidity magnus rush fiddle? that was the bronze build of the year. cdr is overrated on fiddle. only support fiddle its good. not saying cdr is bad. but fiddle is all about his ult surprised one rotation aoe deletion. cdr so overrated on fiddle. stop build like that please\n\nIn my experience, the question wasn't _\"is my ulti strong enough to blow everyone up,\"_ the question was, _\"is my ulti up in time to blow everyone up?\"_  \n\nIt seemed to be an all-or-nothing sort of situation, where the ultimate didn't really seem to lack damage, but it was on a long enough cooldown that you _did_ have to make sure to use it conservatively or else you risked not having it up for key teamfights.\n\nMore CDR = more readily available for big teamfights & more freelo ulti ganks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
