This will seperate the good, opportunistic Tryndamere players from the bad ones.\r\n* Tryndamere&#039;s slow should slow even if they&#039;re facing Tryn, if he casts it while his ultimate is in use.\r\n* Tryndamere should gain 1 MS for every point of rage he has.\r\n* Tryndamere gains tenacity based on his critical chance. 1% critical chance = 1% tenacity\r\n\r\nWhat does Gameplay think about these fair Tryndamere buffs to make him viable again?","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-04-22T01:45:04.988+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong forum.
