Is his opinion wrong? Yes. Is that because he is a Bronze V? No.\r\n\r\nHow you would reply to that claim? Would you say &quot;Master Yi is not OP because he is vulnerable to CC and is squishy&quot;? Or would you say &quot;Master Yi is not OP, shut up, you are just a low elo, stop talking about balance&quot;?\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s also say that this same Bronze V says &quot;Ekko needs to have a mana cost on his ultimate&quot;. Is his opinion wrong? No. Would you really disregard that because he is a Bronze V player?\r\n\r\nHonestly people that do that make me sick, no matter if someone is Bronze V or Diamond I, attacking the people&#039;s elo is NEVER a good argument. If you don&#039;t agree with someone&#039;s claim, you have the right to do so, as long as you provide reasonal counter arguments to that claim. If you are just saying things such as &quot;you are a low elo, you can&#039;t talk about balance&quot; then you are just harassing that player and honestly I would report you to the moderators.\r\n\r\nIt surprises me to see how much people on this boards are obsessed with balance to that point.","replies":[]}
