Or would you say &quot;Master Yi is not OP, shut up, you are just a low elo, stop talking about balance&quot;?\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s also say that this same Bronze V says &quot;Ekko needs to have a mana cost on his ultimate&quot;.

No. Would you really disregard that because he is a Bronze V player?\r\n\r\nHonestly people that do that make me sick, no matter if someone is Bronze V or Diamond I, attacking the people&#039;s elo is NEVER a good argument.

Hexdrinker's passive even scales later into the game with its shield. The amount of stats it gives me against their AP midlaner and AP jungler is just too much to pass up at this point in the game. AD especially is great early game because auto attacks have alot of damage to them. Especially if I opt to take an AD rune page setup, so my autos are doing alot of damage. On top of that, Kat's E has a auto attack reset to it, allow me to get off plenty of autos. Not only do her autos and passive do well with ad, but her shunpo even scales off of AD. It becomes hard to build against Katarina because she's doing plenty of magic and physical damage. Throw in ignite and you're doing 3 types of damage.
