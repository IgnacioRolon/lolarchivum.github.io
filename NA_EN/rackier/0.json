How about A tank assasin? \n\nIt could go he has a 1:1 armor, hp and mr conversion into ad ratio in his passive. So he gets like 3,300 AD if he has that much HP + whatever his armor and mr are. That could be good.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2019-03-10T19:40:33.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda like Pyke.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-10T19:38:16.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I haven't seen a Rackier Diamond No Backtalk thread in a long time.","replies":[]}]}
