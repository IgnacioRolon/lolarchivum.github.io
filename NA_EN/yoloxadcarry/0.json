But recently I moved to Thailand and people over here play lol only in Garena. I have read a lot of threads about transferring to Garena thai but all of them told me that it is not possible. \r\nReason  I am writing this threads because I spent more than 300 dollars on riot points and thinking to start off with lvl 1 it just too much.\r\nSo, I would really appreciate if you could tell anything about transferring to Garena thai server.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T16:52:24.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have jurisdiction over Garena regions, so I couldn't give you a clear answer on this.
