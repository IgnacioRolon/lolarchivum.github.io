You better be SURE it does NOT overlap with the CLICKABLE barrel, the further away you are, the \"easier\" it is, but also easier to PREDICT for the enemy.\n4. While OUT OF Q RANGE, press Q on barrel, and position your mouse aprox. around the area you want the 2nd barrel.\n5. The INSTANT the bullet leaves the gun you press E to place the barrel.

Do you UNDERSTAND how LITTLE time 0.3 seconds is?\n\nWhat does that mean? You need to know HOW people move in general, you need to know WHERE to place the first barrel to give yourself ENOUGH space and TIME to do the combo while WATCHING the other players MOVEMENT: You CANNOT stare at your barrel.\n\nF*cking easy, ban all GP mains.

Plus, GP's entire kit gives him incentive to land them perfectly, and punishes him if he doesn't. If he killed the barrel with a Q, he generates the bonus gold from the Q and the Silver Serpents (which his Q gives him for killing things with it; it's used for upgrading his ultimate) for everything the barrel kills. The barrel also gets 40% armor penetration and will crit if the auto (or Q) that popped it crits. It also spreads Tri Force damage all over its range.\n\nHere's a few tips for playing VS a GP:\n\n1: Pick someone ranged or mobile. Someone who can jump on him or someone who can farm from far enough away from their own minions to force him to pick one: a potential hit on you, or a guaranteed hit on the wave.\n\n2: Watch any barrels you can see. They tick down from 3 health to 1 over the course of a few seconds and, if you can time it right, you can actually kill the barrels as they tick down. If he places one too far away from you for you to kill it, don't stop moving. Miss CS if you have to, but keep moving from side to side until either you get in on that barrel and kill it or it's gone.\n\n3: Watch Gangplank. One common lane tactic for him is to put barrels in brush, let them tick down, and then surprise his opponent with a double or triple barrel combo. However, when he places the barrel, an animation triggers. If you see the animation, you can usually guess which bush he put it in and position yourself away from it enough that he either has to run at you (which is super obvious and you can just walk away) or that he straight out can't reach you with the barrels.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-04-09T05:30:37.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Brutalitops01,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eqAufaUl,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-09T03:20:26.816+0000)\n>\n> If you don&#x27;t have an actual mental disorder, that move is the easiest and most obvious thing in the game to dodge.\n\nI'd like to propose Warwick's ultimate as being easier to dodge than GP's barrel combo.\n\nCan I get a second?","replies":[{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2017-04-09T05:32:03.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SzGamer227,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eqAufaUl,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-04-09T05:30:37.500+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d like to propose Warwick&#x27;s ultimate as being easier to dodge than GP&#x27;s barrel combo.\n> \n> Can I get a second?\n\nWill admit that the super tiny hitbox on it is annoying, but it's still a giant dash that you can't see coming 2-3 seconds before it happens in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-04-09T05:37:50.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see him running straight at you though, you can be ~96% sure he'g going to ult you at his first opportunity, so if you have Flash or any form of mobility on your champ you can be ready before he even comes in range. if you time it right you can also just sidestep it.

XD\n\nTrue, and that's what I was saying with the tiny hitbox. I play WW and it's near impossible to hit if you don't surprise buttsex them from the side with it. However, GP barrels in lane either he hits it twice to get it down to 1 HP (which is beyond obvious and you can walk away in the meantime) or he places it down and leaves it for a while (in which case it'll take 2 full seconds for it to be ready so you again just walk away). You have to either not be paying attention (doin it wrong) or literally have a learning disability to get hit by them until the ability is maxed and they tick down so much faster.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TakeAGuessNerd","date":"2017-04-09T07:56:42.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guess we know who lost to a GP","replies":[]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-04-09T04:10:34.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow, I'm actually impressed.
