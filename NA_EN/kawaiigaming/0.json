This is my first post in any kind of game discussion and it just irks me so much that people consistently thinks that she is overpowered when in reality she can be very easily countered if you play your lane right.\r\nThis all stemmed from me visiting the Surrender @ 20 site (Bless Moobeat btw &lt;3) to check on some pbe updates and I noticed that there had been slight nerfs to riven (Which I don't mind) but I scroll down to the comments below and my jaws just dropped. It was like a rave party with everyone rejoicing over the fact that she got a slight nerf and everyone just going ''FINALLY RIVEN NERFS YEEEEEEEYYYY'' I just wanna point out that she isn't overpowered within this post.\r\n\r\n1. She is squishy as heck. You can go ahead and disagree with me on this fact but for all of you who play rivens out there you know that she is squishy like any other assassin like champion and she can be easily knocked out of the fight if focused. {{champion:58}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:122}}  all of these champions right here alone can completely and utterly destroy her. Even when players are like ''OH BUT RIVEN IS ABOUT THE 1V1 ENGAGES AT THE VERY FIRST LEVEL YOU IDIOT'' this is just false. {{champion:122}} will not even let you commence a trade with him because by the time you finish off your combo, he would've gotten your health down to half or maybe even further because of his bleed stacking on each other and you having to recall or risk being killed the next time he engages.\r\n\r\n2. A lot (if not all) of her burst comes from being able to quickly animation cancel to bring out the full damage potential within her. Most low elo players would just argue ''NO JUST SPAM HER Q AND W AND E TO BLOCK OFF DAMAGE AND YOU WIN LOL NOOB'' when have you seen a riven win lane by just spamming her Q without auto attacking in between? She already cuts off 50% of her burst by doing that and will most likely get dumped on afterwards. In lanes where you have to be depend on burst (Which accounts for all riven lanes) you have to play that game where you have to knock your enemy down first quickly or you're done and out. If she can't burst YOU down quickly then SHE will get bursted down. Champions like {{champion:39}} have sustain and good amounts of damage so what happens when a riven can't pull out her full combo without getting knocked to 40% health? Losing out on last hitting minions. Having to recall. Go back into lane just try to keep up and end up falling behind.\r\n\r\n3. Riven becomes worthless if she's behind. If she doesn't get a lead or atleast even then she has almost no chance of coming back unless she constantly goes to gank other lanes instead but even then in high elo i'm fairly certain the enemy team would notice when a riven is not in her right place. And her squishiness counts in too so she can be easily shut down and kept out as long as the enemy team plays their cards right\r\n\r\n4. She is so dependent on her burst to do anything good. Let's take in for example that a riven tries to catch up to you using Q and E? She basically destroyed her way of escaping from you if you are ready to trade with her to death and she can't burst you down cause she destroyed her burst by trying to catch up to you. She can't do much else cause her cooldowns will be under play and if she doesn't have enough damage to take you down after using her combo? RIPERINO IN PEPPERINOS M8\r\n\r\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. i could go on and on about the many faults she has but I just wanna show people that she isn't as overpowered as an abundantly stupid amount of people seems to make her out as. She can be beaten easily. She's not this unstoppable demon that will kill you a thousand times over (That's only if she's fed) it's like saying {{champion:75}}  is too overpowered because he was allowed to farm for stacks. Do not feed her and don't engage unless you know that you can win the trade. I would really like the community's input on this kind of subject and feel free to add in any details or even correct me on anything you'd like. This is my first post in anything ever so i'd expect it to be a rather crude first post and will have tons and tons of mistakes so please I like constructive criticism so don't be afraid to tell me your opinion on this matter cause this is what I came here for.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-05-07T00:18:03.058+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's not that she's overpowered, is that her kit is absolutely annoying.\n\nA shield that scales off AD, rewarding her with a defensive boost for building an offensive stat.

OP or not. I understand her design -- I understand it's intention, and why every part of her kit is how it is. But the thing that irks me the most isn't her mobility. It isn't her shield (let's face it: she needs it), it isn't her damage, or animation cancels. It's that stupid knock-up on Broken Wings. Everything else I am pretty much completely fine with. But the knock-up on her Q is pretty much completely extraneous. \n\nI can't think of any Assassins with two hard CCs, one of which isn't even affected by tenacity, in tandem with that much potential damage and mobility. I mean, I understand some assassins have a cc or something, that's perfectly acceptable: Diana has her knock-up/pull + slow, Fizz has a telegraphed slow + knock-up (so you can Zhonya's it if you have it, or QSS it off of you, and so on). But Riven's main thing is that she has to continually be in your face to apply damage, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if she didn't have TWO HARD CCs keeping you captive audience in a front-row seat to your beatdown. She doesn't need two - she only needs one. She can have a slow or something on her third Q, but a knock-up just plain feels unnecessary.

Her defensive stats look just like {{champion:98}}, except that she doesn't have sustain. This is irrelevant because her ability to trade is better than most top laners early until she picks up a {{item:3077}} where the regen issues stop mattering.\n\n2- Except, sustain champions don't have that much sustain to negate {{champion:92}} 's poke combos. I'm saying this while accounting for her doing splash damage to minions, {{champion:92}} 's push is not enough for sustain champions like {{champion:39}} to heal on without pushing lane and therefore get ganked and lose. Riven on the other hand has THREE options if she is in a losing matchup:\n* Roam and get kills: pretty easy to do all game long, riven's ridiculous mobility and CC from level 1 make this possible hence jungle riven was occasionally seen in previous seasons. Much more easily than a {{champion:58}} would.\n* Farm the jungle: because of her tendency to rush a {{item:3077}} and her AoE CC, this is a valid alternative unlike say {{champion:86}} who would take forever to clear a camp. \n* Wait for jungler ganks: I know you're sick of hearing it by now, but it is {{champion:92}}'s biggest problem. Riven's mobility, CC and AoE makes it easy to keep an enemy down when her jungler is there, or even pull off 2v2s because she does a lot of AoE.\n\nShe is fucking bullshit in that regard, there is no \"true\" victory over a good Riven in lane.\n\n3- How do you have no chance of coming back? Mobility does not fall off, she can split push very well behind or not. She also has 2 CCs for teamfights granted she probably needs a {{item:3143}} and that's it, tanky enough for short skirmishes because you cannot catch riven in the long run anyway. Also, building straight AD is cheaper than building defenses; because {{item:3077}} synergizes so well with her kit she can get more farm than the enemy laner even when behind; so her \"behindness\" isn't so big.\n\n4- The situation you're proposing is {{champion:92}} making a mistake. Much like {{champion:122}} pulling {{champion:86}} to force a trade, that's wrong. He should be harassing with Q and pulling to reduce enemy DPS or force them to continue trading. Just because you can force a trade doesn't mean you should, an ability usually has more than one way of being beneficial. Also, burst trades is what {{champion:92}} excels at, no kidding. She also has the mobility to decide who hits who at what time. Depending how many mobility spells she saves, you might land only one auto attack while she throws her whole combo.\n\nBy the way\n\nThat's a nice bullshit thread you have there...\n\nIt would be a shame if....\n\nSomeone were to...\n\nDownvote it to negativity...","replies":[]},{"poster":"kcStranger","date":"2015-05-07T02:33:08.284+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything you said, especially that it's irritating how giddy people get about certain champs being nerfed. I don't think this nerf is about power level, per se (although her 54% win rate in Diamond is definitely notable, indicating that she's able to prey upon solo queue play patterns when mastered). For my full thoughts...I'll just copy something I said on another Riven post (others have said similar things):\n\nI think the thing to keep in mind with this nerf is that Riot's main goal with champion balance is *not* actually to put all the champions on an even playing field (even supposing that was possible given the different balance demands of solo vs. 5v5 and low-tier vs. high-tier play). Above all, they're trying to make the game **fun**. I'm just guessing at their intentions, but my read on the situation is this: Riven is a champion who, when mastered, wrecks solo queue because of her skirmish potential. She's also fairly mobile, allowing her a pretty good deal of freedom in choosing her fights (again, especially in solo queue). I think the idea of the changes is to cut down on her mobility (mitigating her ability to engage/escape, which can be pretty oppressive/unfun) and to open up a little more counterplay around the ult (a little more chance to dodge it). In short, the changes are meant to open up a little more counterplay against a champion who's difficult to play against with uncoordinated teams.\n\nNow, do I think the changes are needed strictly from a balance perspective? No. The fact that Riven is basically never seen in pro play (although certainly a bunch of pros mess around with her in solo queue) should make that fairly clear. As you point out, her win rate also is not that high until Diamond, and I for one am OK with the idea of having champions who take some work to master but reward you by being very strong once you have mastered them. But, there are other factors at work here.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think this is part of a larger pattern. Katarina, Yasuo, Lee Sin, Nidalee...all these are champions who, when strong, lead to play patterns that are unfortunately quite frustrating for a large number of people. (I personally am not too sensitive to this kind of stuff, but the number of people who still complain about Lee Sin despite his crap winrate and bad teamfighting is astounding.) Eventually, they may be headed for reworks. (Unfortunately, a lot of champions need reworks of some kind...) In the meantime, I think Riot is trying to put their balance in a place where you still can be successful with them, but with counterplay that can be somewhat consistently achieved in solo queue. Unfortunately, this frequently means making them objectively kind of bad.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I doubt nerfs of the sort on the PBE are going to make Riven unplayable (definitely worse, though).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Ratchet","date":"2015-05-07T00:18:37.280+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I like Riven too, but I don't really care that she's getting nerfed in this case.

A lot of the people who post on the boards confuse champion design and balance. There are reasons for this but I'll explain later. This post will be lengthy, there will be a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nDesign and balance are not the same, but poor design often leads to poor balance because they are difficult to balance (See: Kalista). In addition, a lot of poor champion designs are extremely polarized (See Riven) where she will either smash with very little opportunity for their opponent to counter them or be clobbered with few options themselves. Finally, because they're difficult to balance, they often become the king of their role or are completely outclassed.\n\nNow, because people confuse the two AND because of peoples' tendency to use their own experience as anecdotal evidence to justify their position, when people are beaten be Riven because she counters them or they simply don't understand how she functions, they will say \"Hey, I had no real chance of winning that match-up (Unless the player using her was retarded) and therefore she must be overpowered,\" and then they go onto the forums to complain about it.\n\nIn general, the angriest players \"Post the loudest,\" so to speak. Very few people will go onto the forums, for example, and go on a tangent about how well design and balanced Vel'Koz is. However, with a champion like Riven, she will often cheese people who will come onto here and complain about it.\n\nThis leads to my next point. Design and balance are different, but inextricably linked, and Riven's design is cheesy (Albeit skill indexed at the highest level), overloaded and kit-strong. This means that she is inherently powerful but her numbers are weak, which was the intention of her design. Therefore, when the Riven cheeses her opponent and gets ahead, she has FOUR things going for her. She's fed, she naturally snowballs really hard, she's kit strong and as a result of being fed now has a numerical advantage as well. Now there really are few options for the other player (Though there obviously are some), and given that they got cheesed, I doubt they'll know how to use them.\n\nAll in all, the result is that her design is, put simply, INCREDIBLY frustrating to play against and stomps unprepared players. The skill required to beat her at LOWER levels of play are skewed, and while she is extremely difficult to master, simply playing her effectively is not. because most people aren't at Gold+, they will fall into the category that Riven does well against.\n------\nTL;DR: Riven has binary match-ups, her design inherently makes her kit strong and people cheese their opponents for a numerical advantage that she innately lacks, and as a result, she snowballs incredibly hard. This voice is most common because angry players will post about her, not ones that don't think she's an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Andrew","date":"2015-05-07T06:30:04.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) tell that to tank riven with the shield\n\n2)TLDR no grammar or pretty pictures to make sense of this wall of gross\n\n3) any champion can become worthless if they get behind just aswell as any champ can get op AF if they get ahead\n\nyoure point here is invalid\n\n4) didnt you already mention burst in the first sentence of number 2(which I didnt read)\n\n_________________\n\nshe is Overpowered her kit is just toxic as all hell (along with any manaless/energyless champion)\n\nCDR based champions are cancer\n\neither make every champ CDR based or give them all energy and or mana\n\n(or Fury/rage those concepts are pretty neat, Gnars for example or shyvannas)\n\nbut anyone who has no use of the mana bar needs to go \n(Garen/Riven/{{champion:36}} ??

My problem with riven is the fact that she can do a lot of damage and has a shield that gets better based on your ad, so you are rewarded twice as much for building damage.

Play that champ for a little bit and you'll learn how they work and you can beat them in lane a little more easily.

I'm not a Riven main but I seem to play against her a lot.\n\nEverything else is about timing and her CC is laughable, what CC?  The range on her stun is pretty small and only lasts .75 seconds and her knock up is just as long.  How can you complain about CC on Riven when you got Champions like Morgana's snare that'll immobilize you for 3 seconds with her Q and her AoE Stun/Snare ult or a Cho'Gath that can knock you up and silence or a Gnar that has a crap ton of CC each of which are longer than Riven's.  It's not like you're having to dodge spears and praying Nidalee doesn't pounce on you for a kill when you get hit.  God forbid you complain about her shield that's already been nerfed, lasting only 1.5 seconds.  If you see her shield come up, don't go ham and let it suck up all your damage, be patient.  Too many players play with the mentality of \"If I all in now, I\"m going to win and get a kill\"  There's a lot of timing and playing smart involved with playing with or against Riven.  \n\nWhen she falls behind in a game she'll be limited farming and split pushing, since she'll virtually be useless.\n\nWhen you see someone pick Riven, counter her with someone that can silence/snare/stun, if Riven's caught up in any of that CC, she can't use skills and she's pretty darn squishy and easy to kill.  Riven might get strong with a couple items, but you can easily shut her down.  \n\nPlay smart, play better, and realize the mistakes you make instead of blaming others for them.
