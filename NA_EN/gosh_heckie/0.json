It only happens when issuing movement and attack commands. I am looking forward for a fix because the sound effects are one of the most important aspects of the game and this thing is just annoying.\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}} Bring teemo maining back to my life rito please ;w; {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-09T17:57:46.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi hi! \n\nThanks for the report!
