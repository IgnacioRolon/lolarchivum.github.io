Maybe it was just me, but I felt like the previous Make It Rain didn't do much. Or maybe it's the bullet indentations that makes me feel like it's doing actual damage now. I always max out Double Up first, then Make It Rain, and finally start working on her Impure Shots when everything else is maxed out. If her W granted Strut immediately, I would definitely put a point in it early game, just to chase down enemies better (actually...to escape faster). Miss Fortune's passive turns off with just a basic autoattack, and I think that it makes it that much harder to dart in and out of fights fast. If Strut was activated with any of her abilities, that would be great for her. Also, Bullet Time is great against squishy champions, but against tanks...not even a dent. I hate that she has to be rooted during her ult; enemies can typically get close enough to squash her by then, especially the tanks. Sometimes I accidentally cancel her ult in the first couple bullet waves because everyone's just running towards me and I have to run. Survival is better than taking half a small block of HP off a champion that has like 5k HP. Still...gotta love Miss Fortune! One other thing-RIOT PLEASE GIVE HER RED HAIR AGAIN IN HER SPLASH ART. To quote a YouTube League streamer, we don't want \"burnt, mahogany hair\". {{champion:21}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:21}}","replies":[{"poster":"Somohexual","date":"2015-08-11T21:37:47.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's nice that Make It Rain doesn't feel like a waste of Mana anymore. \n\nMy only complaint about E now is that it could be so much more interesting if it had synergy with the rest of her kit. The best way to accomplish this, imo, would be to have Impure Shots apply on ALL attacks/abilities that deal damage. It would also end up buffing Bullet Time by letting her pre-stack Impure Shots, which she doesn't have time to do with auto-attacks alone.
