(This means both Mystery Skins Gifts as well as the Mystery Skin Chests!) No special button, just use the normal Gifting Center. ^-^\n\nThe following Lunar Revel Skins are part of the double chance (Includes 2016 Lunar Revel skins as well!):\n\nWarring Kingdoms Tryndamere, Warring Kingdoms Jarvan IV, Warring Kingdoms Xin Zhao, Warring Kingdoms Nidalee, Warring Kingdoms Katarina, DragonBlade Riven, Dragon Fist Lee Skin, Dragonblade Talon, Dragonwing Corki, Jade Dragon Wukong, Panda Annie, Jade Fang Cassiopeia, Firecracker Jinx, Guqin Sona, Lunar Goddess Diana, Lunar Wraith Caitlyn, Lunar Wraith Morgana, Radiant Wukong.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2016-01-29T09:41:28.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean the Eternum Nocturne I just got out of a mystery box was a natural one? :o","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-29T19:01:36.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like you got lucky! ^-^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-01-29T05:40:24.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=NdaT5eH7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-29T05:21:30.692+0000)\n>\n> The skins that are being replaced in your Lunar Revel Shop are scheduled to go on sale either in January or February.

That's a little unfair if a better discount is removed from their offer listing. I could understand if it was for the 20% and 30% Lunar Revel offers - I'd be upset if I bought it for sale and then saw it go on sale for a cheaper price; But for it to be on the 60% and 70% off sale, I would be upset if you removed it and then offered it to me at a higher price. It doesn't quite make much sense in that manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-01-29T05:41:11.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cavalry has arrived!

I just find it odd that Riot employees replied to many posts regarding the lunar shop, but not a single Riot employee has even acknowledged the issue of the screen blacking out and disconnecting after champ select. Not only are we getting leave buster penalties, but we are once again not able to use the ip even to its fullest. It is just frustrating to know that myself and some other players are having the same exact issue, yet no acknowledgment has even taken place.
