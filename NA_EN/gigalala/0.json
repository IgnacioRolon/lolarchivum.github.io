Normal shift + ability key does work.\r\nAny ideas????\r\n\r\nI have a Mac by the way.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T16:18:52.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really familiar with binding on this mouse, but it sounds like you're attempting to bind a key that's bound by your OS and not the game.  Technically, one of the extra buttons on the mouse would be noted as MouseButton-4, or something along those lines.  You'd want to keybind learning a spell as a combination like MouseButton4+Q, or something similar.  To change that mouse button specifically to shit would require doing that through your OS.  \n\nI'm not the most adept at binding with unique hardware, so if you still have issues with this reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if our tech team can help out.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
