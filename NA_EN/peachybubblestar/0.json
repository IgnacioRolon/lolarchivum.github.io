Plz no arguing or rude comments below) \n\nLulu is a ranged support champion who is good at being whimsical and magical casting shields and polymorphing her enemies while buffing her allies in glorifying ways. she also uses her sidekick Pix to help aid her in battle.\n\nPrimary Role-Support, Secondary-Mage\nSecondary bar-Mana\nHealth-553-1947\nHealth Regen-6.0-16.2\nMana-292-1227\nMana Regen-6.0-19.6\nRanged-550\nAttack Damage-46-91\nAttack Speed-0.625(+0% - 38.3%)\nArmor-19.2-82.1\nMagic res.-30.0\nMove Speed-325\n\nName-Lulu\nGender-Female\nRace-Yordle\nBirthplace-Bandle City\nResidence-Unknown(Formerly the Glade)\nOccupation-Trickster \nFaction-Independent \n\n**LORE**\n\nPerhaps more than any other champion in the League, Lulu marches to the beat of her own drum. During her youth in Bandle City, she spent most of her time wandering alone in the forest or lost in a daydream. It wasn&rsquo;t that she was antisocial; the day-to-day bustle of Bandle City just couldn&#039;t compete with the vibrant world of her imagination. She saw wonder in places most people overlooked. This was how she found Pix, a fae spirit, pretending to be stuck in a birdhouse. Lulu&#039;s imagination distinguished her to Pix, and he seized the opportunity to lure her into his life. He brought her to the Glade, the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods. There the rigid properties of the outside world - things like size and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated by this secret place.\n\nShe quickly lost track of time. Her life in the Glade was comfortable, natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she had been told were \"only pretend,\" and she got exceedingly good at them. It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside seem distant and surreal. Lulu decided to revisit her former home, to share some of the lovely things she&#039;d learned, but when she and Pix returned the world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away. Lulu sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world, but her attempt had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek, temporarily changing them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but their parents didn&#039;t appreciate her efforts. When the yordles insisted that she leave their land, she turned to a vibrant, magic place where those with unusual gifts were not just accepted but adored: the League of Legends.\n\n\"*The best path between two points is upside-down, between, then inside-out and round again*.\"\nâ€• **Lulu**\n\n\n**ABILITIES**\n\n [](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120317033727/leagueoflegends/images/c/c6/Pix%2C_Faerie_Companion.jpg) **(Passive)-Pix, Faerie Companion**\n\nWhenever Lulu or the allied target of Help, Pix!.png Help, Pix! attacks an enemy (excluding structures and wards), Pix fires a barrage of 3 homing bolts toward the same target that deal 3 / 7 / 11 / 15 / 19 / 23 / 27 / 31 / 35 (+ 5% AP) magic damage each to the first enemy they each hit, for a maximum possible 9 / 21 / 33 / 45 / 57 / 69 / 81 / 93 / 105 (+ 15% AP) magic damage.\n\n\n[](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120317033217/leagueoflegends/images/e/ec/Glitterlance.jpg) **(Q)-Glitterlance**\n*RANGE: 925, COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 MANA,  COOLDOWN: 7*\n\nACTIVE: Lulu and Pix, Faerie Companion.png Pix each fire a magic bolt towards a target direction, dealing magic damage and Slow icon slowing enemies hit by 80%, decaying over the duration.\n*MAGIC DAMAGE: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 50% AP)\nSLOW DURATION: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2*\n\n\n[](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120317033302/leagueoflegends/images/8/8f/Whimsy.jpg) **(W)-Whimsy**\n*RANGE: 650,  COST: 65 MANA,  COOLDOWN: 18 / 16.5 / 15 / 13.5 / 12*\n\nACTIVE &ndash; ALLY CAST: Target allied champion gains 30% (+ 10% per 100 AP) movement speed for a few seconds\n\nACTIVE &ndash; ENEMY CAST:  Polymorphs an enemy champion for a short duration, disabling their ability to attack or cast abilities and Slow icon reducing their base movement speed by 60.\n*DURATION: 3 / 3.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 5...

But it does need some of them--\n\nNumbers inform decisions and the core ideas of that ability.\n\nFor example, if GP's Q had much more range than it did, it would be stupidly broken.\n\nBut I do, really, agree with the idea of damage numbers not being particularly important-- unless the champion has some interaction with their damage (Wirym, for example... or to use a real champion, Morgana and Nasus).\n\nDurations are quite critical. For example, the fact that Riven's Art of War/Runic Blade stacks last... what, 5 seconds? I don't even know how long they last. :/\n\nBut there is a HUGE difference between them lasting 5 seconds or 3.5 seconds in terms of her gameplay. If they fall off one at a time or all at once.\n\nThe same applies to stun durations; how they scale up...\n\nI'd say that the base damage of a skill isn't really a number that is absolutely required. The scaling is more important, because it informs how the champion should play with that skill. For example, Jinx's Zap!, which scales with 140% of her total AD. That tells you, *immediately*, that she scales really well with more AD; something already introduced by her Q granting a lot of bonus Attack Speed. To a certain extent, at least, Jinx values AD more than AS in terms of her kit, and this is knowable rather quickly.\n\nSo... \\*shrug\\*. It really can go either way.\n\nI like going for more numbers and mathematics, because it gives me a sense of satisfaction to see the numbers after doing the math.\n\nBut... it's definitely not needed. If I have a skill that ramps up in damage based on stacks which are gained in combat; I don't really need to define the base damage, but I should give a range for the first and last ranks (like, say \"50-70 scaling up to 200-220 based on rank\")-- to give a ballpark on what the skill is for.\n\nLike Zileas' example \"500 damage 10 second cooldown\". That has choice built into it.\n\"250 damage 5 second cooldown\" has less choice.\n\"100 damage 2 second cooldown\" has even less... but you can add some with a high mana cost or a mana-cost-stacking mechanic (Kog/Kass R; for instance), because of how low that cooldown is.\n\nYou can write anything, and to some degree it will be correct... I'd say a concept, no matter what, needs:\n\na) Formatting. Don't give people a huge wall of text. It's easy to lose trains of thought in such.\nb) The core ideal with which the character is created. It might be an ability in isolation. It might be the idea behind all the abilities. It might be a playstyle. But you need to make sure that people know exactly what the main point of the concept is-- otherwise you get something muddled and confusing in purpose, no?\nc) That you like your product and can feel proud of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomatosx","date":"2015-05-21T04:31:44.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Umm...ok?","replies":[{"poster":"PeachyBubbleStar","date":"2015-05-21T06:31:24.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"it's mostly for people who need to know what a decent champion concept SHOULD look like, because some of them iv'e been seeing just arent what they should be.","replies":[{"poster":"antymattar","date":"2015-05-21T08:52:41.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would disagree heavily. This is not a champion concept, this is a description of a finished champion. This is by no means good. I do not encourage people to post their abilities with hard thought numbers and cooldowns. It is all subject to change if it ever gets picked up, and it's just a huge waste of thought and time. Sure, knowing how much damage someone deals is good, but for that you can just say \"some damage\" or \"lots of damage\". Instead I think a good champion concept is one that gives some original ideas. If I made a champion who has basically a veigar q for every ability, and made all the fancy numbers, it would still be a shit champion concept. Infact, id wager that it would be made all the worse by adding specific stats and all. It would highlight how little knowledge of design and understanding of the game I'd have.\n\nNo, a good champion design can look many ways, but most certainly not like this. The idea is lost behind the numbers and the data. It hurts the eye of the reader and it takes up mental space. A good concept for lulu can even look more like this:\n\n> So Lulu is this sort of quirky fae champion little Yordle who has her head in the clouds and doesnt take anything seriously and mostly just talks nonsense because she's used to living in a fairy world. \n\n>Her passive is that she has a fairy follower pix who attacks a bit whenever she uses a basic attack. He's always behind her and follows her around like a pet or something, the positioning is important.\n\n>Her Q, glitter lance, is like a standard skillshot that slows BUT it comes out from both lulu AND her faery companion pix, so it's hard to land and you can make some cool positioning tricks with it.\n\n>Her W is a movement speed buff on allies that can scale with AP, but when you cast it on enemies, it turns them into CUPCAKES so they cant really do much for a short while. \n\n>Her E is like a shield when cast on allies that causes your fairy companion pix to start following THEM for a little while, giving them your passive. You can also cast it on enemies to make pix follow them for a while and deal damage to them and grant vision. Note : You can still cast Q from his position when on enemies/allies.\n\n>Her ultimate literally causes the target ally champion to become HUGE and gives them bonus health and knocks up nearby enemies.\n\nNotice how I deleted like half the content of the original ability list without even losing the idea and heart of the champion. I've seen far too many people who think that their idea will get noticed if they only make it look more like an in-game already existing champion, but really it only serves to obscure that which makes the champion who they are.","replies":[{"poster":"PeachyBubbleStar","date":"2015-05-21T15:29:01.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"thats so simple and dislike-able it hurts me eyes, you cant say \"this is a bad champion concept completely\" thats just your opinion... and if you want to read a champion concept that literally has NO THOUGHT PUT INTO IT then go search for them thats fine by me, but this is what a PROPER and WELL MADE champion concept should look like, it should look like they took the time to make the dang thing and no it doesnt have to have super small details like \"specific rang, damage, and all that\" if you want one thats not very decent, and sweetie, i can *garen*tee you that riot would much rather have a champion concept thats nice and detailed with a good picture, than reading some little scribble scrabble of a messed up looking essay, you took it too deep, and especially the way you said \"THIS IS A BAD CHAMPION CONCEPT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS!!!\" thats pretty stupid, thats your opinion! and dont try and tell me that this one is my opinion because this is all owned by riot if they saw this champion concept before lulu was even designed they be like \"WOW AMAZING\" you dont have to state all those wierd non-detailing things you said because if you actually wanna be noticed you have to actually try! this one provided details of the characters, gameplay style, in game details, lore, abilities(in detail), quotes, and even a picture! making a champion concept is like making an essay you're not gonna be graded on.

It gives information that the original author, who has NO access to any tools to test it with, has created and figured in his mind that it's the right thing to put there. Those stats mean NOTHING. Look at how riot designs their champions. Look at a few interviews, some blog posts. Ziggz was originally a yordle with an anchor for Christs sake! All data is subject to change. \n\nThe second ability will give less faulty guessing information AND it will most certainly highlight something much more important. The innovative information about the ability. Reading the second ability(which is EXACTLY the same ability, but worded without the clutter-data) you understand that this skill is in fact very generic. It's a standard skill shot. The most basic form of skill shot. It doesn't even do anything. It's just damage in a can, the most boring thing you could add to league. It is more important to come up with new and original content than fully fleshed out generic unoriginal content.\n\nThat's why numbers are bad. The thing you posted is not lulus concept.

They come up with a champion idea that is actually terrible, but they fool themselves into not properly reviewing it because the numbers get in their way. The numbers are often not the issue, its the abilities themselves. \n\nYour idea of what a concept should be like isn't even taken from a champion concept.
