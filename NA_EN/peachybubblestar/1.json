The word is contracted from \"ロリータ\" (\"lolita\"), which originated from the novel entitled Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov. Lolis are central to lolicon subculture.\n\nlolicon definition by google:\nThe sexual attraction to young girls. n. An individual fixated on young, generally prepubescent, girls. n. Erotic or suggestive art depicting prepubescent females.\n\nYou seem to be quite familiar with this \"loli\" bullshit. \nIt seems to me like these definitions are pretty much describing what these images are...\nI rest my case! \nPeople like you should go to jail! \nThis is a sick subculture and is in no way a laughing matter!","replies":[{"poster":"PeachyBubbleStar","date":"2018-02-18T01:47:52.767+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A loli is a term for Anime used to describe a person who IS OR RESEMBLES A LITTLE GIRL it is a fucking character type, why are you reaching so hard to call people %%%%philes who AREN'T ??? i think you need to leave, and ONCE AGAIN replying for the other comment, SHE IS WEARING SHORTS THOSE AREN'T PANTIES AND NOBODY SHOULD BE THINKING OF IT IN SUCH A NASTY WAY LIKE YOU'RE ASSUMING JUST STOP. -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"P4ppino","date":"2018-02-18T07:26:05.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice troll.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sanshi","date":"2018-02-17T19:10:30.887+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather have her wearing some onesie, just like Meowkai or Gnar. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/RXyI5I0.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigSquirrell","date":"2018-02-17T06:09:54.587+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, that's awesome!
