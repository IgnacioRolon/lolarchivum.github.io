FW actually played with Sol pretty poorly since he wasn't roaming as much as he should've been. You can give Sol to FW and counter-pick with TF and you'll probably beat the hell out of them. CLG on the other hand, it's Huhi's favorite champion and obviously his comfort pick... he's never getting it again even if you do plan to pick TF into it, he probably knows the match up well enough to stay even and since TF isn't in the meta, he'll probably become fairly useless late game (but that depends on the player and how the game's going).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-05T00:47:29.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically.\n\nNobody expects the Aurelion.
