Here&#039;s an example:\n\nWith no W but 40% in attack speed buffs from runes/items/levels: 6 x 1.4 x .679 = 5.70\n\nWith W activated and the 40% attack speed buffs (total 80%): 6 x 1.8 x .679 = 7.33\n\nDifference = 7.33 - 5.70 = *1.63 attacks gained*\n\nWhile its true that this is only at rank 1, just about every Warwick guide has W leveled last. With the new much slower level progression rate, its likely that Warwick will have a rank 1 W for 20-30 minutes, and even at max ranks the number of autoattacks gained is only doubled to 3.2 autoattacks over 6 seconds.\n\nCompare this to, for example, Darius&#039;s W. Darius&#039;s W resets his animation, and even though its not written in the ability, he gets a free auto-attack immediately instead of having to wait 6 seconds. On top of that, at rank 1 he gets 20% bonus damage, slows the targets movement speed by 20%, and slows the targets attack speed by 20%. It&#039;s on an 8 second cooldown that drops 1 second for each autoattack or ability use on the target, down to a 3 second cooldown (Warwick&#039;s cooldown is 24 seconds), and it costs 5 less mana than Warwick&#039;s.\n\nCompare this also to Volibears W: he passively gains 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 % bonus attack speed and that can stack 3 times.  So he gets up to 60% attack speed bonus with no duration limit, no mana cost, and no cooldown.\n\nRiot, now that Warwick has been nerfed into obscurity, could you consider giving him something back, at least to his W?","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-04-12T18:54:19.074+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly WW just needs his entire kit reworked in a way.

Also WW's is more effective than Malz's anyway, because it's attached to a bruiser/tank who WANTS you to blow all your CC on him instead of a carry. He also WANTS to blink into the enemy team in order to melee and disrupt.\nMalzahar's ult is a powerful dueling/isolation tool to obliterate a single target. WW's is a disruption tool to lockdown a high-priority target, scatter the enemy team, and panic them into wasting CC on the tank............. and has the added benefit of dealing damage.\nMalzahar also doesn't (usually) jungle, so he doesn't barrel out of nowhere and suppress from Fog of War.\nThey're very different abilities serving different purposes.\n\n\nI do agree that WW's W nerf was a bit excessive and probably should be reverted now that Devourer + his ult are weaker, but don't pretend that his ult isn't a defining facet of his play patterns and isn't among the more powerful R abilities in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-04-13T17:28:09.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have a massive misunderstanding on Warwick.

His ult needs something back, They nerfed his ult cooldown, damage, the W duration got halved, the devourer got nerfed and that one enhancement he used to get with it got nerfed.
