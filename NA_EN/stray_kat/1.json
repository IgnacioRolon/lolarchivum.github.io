But last time I was against a Rammus and noticed a problem.  If you hit him with Whimsy(Polymorph him) while he&#039;s rolling at you it does nothing.  He DOES get poly&#039;d, but he continues to ramp up his speed, and he still knocks you back when he hits you.  Is this intended? I mean, while Poly&#039;d he really shouldn&#039;t continue to build up speed AND keep his knockback, as though he wasn&#039;t CC&#039;d at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce\r\n1. Play Lulu\r\n2. See Rammus super rolling at you like a crazy little ball of rage.\r\n3. Cast Whimsy on him, turning him into a fluffy critter.\r\n4. Proceed to watch him gain speed and knock you back anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2016-08-08T01:57:13.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also used her against a Zed, expecting to counter him really hard.  He managed to R while whimsy'd, and he Q'd during Whimsy but only his shadow shot the shuriken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-08T01:17:40.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is probably a derp from when riot declared that CC would only apply at the end of a dash, but rammus is not technically dashing..\n\nSquirrel roll.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2016-08-08T01:36:01.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=UxEER03T,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-08T01:17:40.925+0000)\n>\n> This is probably a derp from when riot declared that CC would only apply at the end of a dash, but rammus is not technically dashing..\n> \n> Squirrel roll.\n\nI dunno, but it's lame lol.  I was sitting in toplane bullying Illaoi out of lane, and I saw Rammus coming - Started spamming laugh IRL like \"Yay, more food\".. Hit him with Whimsy and he just sped up even more and knocked me back - As a fuzzy critter.  Needless to say, he and Illaoi immediately popped my yordle butt.","replies":[]}]}]}
