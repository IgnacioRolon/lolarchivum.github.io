I&#x27;ve reached out to our tech team and they&#x27;ve also received reports of impacted connections around the Denver area too.  I&#x27;m trying to get more info, but we don&#x27;t have a lot of visibility over ISPs or their nodes.  I&#x27;m trying to find out if the issue is isolated to a single ISP for example, or if there&#x27;s anything we can do on our side.  \n> \n> For now, your best bet would be to grab traceroutes via [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) while routing to 104.160.131.1 (NA region) and give them to your ISP.  Reach out to them, let them know what&#x27;s going on, and offer those logs so they can review the situation.\n> \n> Hopefully, the nodes causing these issues or anything else going on can be repaired in no time!\n> \n> --VPN may assist in the meantime, but only temporarily and could cause higher ping.  The key is to resolve the origin of the problem!\n\nIf this information helps, I have several friends around the same area with the same ISP who don't seem to have any issues.
