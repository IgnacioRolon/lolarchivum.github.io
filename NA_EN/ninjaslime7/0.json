But thats not all though, my damage dealt to champions was 20k higher than his(ad thresh btw) physical damage lower magic damage higher obviously more damage dealt by about 50k, more healing done, 24k more damage taken(higher in both categories too),and more turrets destroyed. So what i would like to know is how he managed to get an S+ and i got an A+? If someone can explain this reasoning\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"DreamerP","date":"2016-08-20T19:22:42.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your score is compared to other X characters played in X positions. In other words, \"AD Thresh\" is compared to other \"Ad Thresh\". You won't see many \"AD Thresh\" so the pool of comparisons to base the grade on is small so he did pretty well overall for that play style since most Thresh are played in support style. The game picks up on items and positions of character movement. Your score as Singed is also compared to others in that same position, I'm assuming Top so based on the pool yours was worth an A+ vs others and I'm guessing it's because of the CS. especially on a character that can easily proxy and farm. Warding can also be a factor to help your score as well in any position.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-20T19:54:27.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nemesis draft is bizarre as far as ranking go, because your performance is often being compared to people playing weird, off-meta picks.\n\nI got my first S+ this year playing, of all the stupid things, midlane soraka against aurelion sol.  11/2/19 or so.
