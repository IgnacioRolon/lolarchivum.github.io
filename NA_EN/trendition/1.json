I have encountered so many frequent problems it just feels so unprofessional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA list of bugs I encounter frequently.\r\n-For patch 6.18 I had to download it 3 times(Meaning downloaded it once. Was able to play a game. Closed LOL. Opened LOL and had to redownload it) Every time it took up to 3 hours. I have a very reliable and fast internet so it wasn't my doing.\r\n-Client closing itself without warning\r\n-When my character dies and I click the spacebar the camera locks onto my dead body. And no input will pull me off of the body until my character respawns.\r\n-Having to redownload League of Legends every other month because the current client I have just won't open. \r\n-Getting kicked out of the loading screen and having to wait for the game to start before I can reenter through the loading screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyroneology","date":"2016-09-27T23:23:29.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No issues with their mac client at all  use it on two different mac books with literally 0 issues, actually notice less issues with the Mac client than when I was using the windows client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T23:20:48.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like most of your issues are actually fairly resolvable and less related to the current state of the Mac client. For your installation issue, I'd ensure you've installed the client according to our guide [here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends#section-mac)\n\nAs for your client closing and not being able to open it, this is most likely caused by a problem in your connection to the server. The mac client is especially sensitive to drops in your connection, so I recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) to ensure your local settings are good.\n\nLet me know if these issues persist through those changes.","replies":[]}]}
