I agree with Ixian below. This should be on a Riot-owned resource, just so we can expect some level of precision and timeliness. The guys from the wiki are doing an incredible job, but they are fans and volunteers, we can't (and shouldn't) expect them to be 100% correct all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSeltzerBaron","date":"2016-10-13T03:21:08.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=51VAoqsJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-13T02:01:48.373+0000)\n>\n> We don&#x27;t have anything on our website, but I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of third-party sites that may have this type of feature.

For that matter, why aren't they in the game already where everyone can plainly see them instead of playing hide and seek to find them on a 3rd party website? I don't understand that at all. Is Riot intentionally trying to make things more difficult?","replies":[]}]}]}
