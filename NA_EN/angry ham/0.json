I test it and its 50ms on average with other games like wow. But then when i play league i get 200-300 spikes all the time which makes the game barely playable. Does anyone have a fix yet? {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T04:17:40.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ISP are you on yourself? If Verizon, there's likely not much anyone can do until it's smoothed out by Verizon, but if not we can try a few things to fix this up. \n\nFirst I'd like to see a traceroute to see where things might be going wrong. Grab [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a trace to 104.160.131.1 for about 10 min, then post those results here. That'll give me a good picture of what's going on.\n\nIn the meantime, (AFTER this trace) try updating your DNS to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 to see if we can get your connection to take a slightly better route to our servers. Test that in a custom game after the traceroute and let me know how this goes as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Ham","date":"2018-01-22T16:02:33.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just Wanted to say thanks, The DNS actually helped out a lot{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Hands","date":"2018-01-21T20:59:56.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope, no fixes and guess who has yet to post on any of this...","replies":[]}]}
