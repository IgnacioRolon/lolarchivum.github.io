The Borders that show for your loading screen will depend on whatever queue you're in.\n\nWe actually have a bullet list for each queue if you'd like to check it out:\n\n- Ranked Solo/Duo - Dynamic Queue\n- Ranked Flex 5v5 - Best of Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s\n- Ranked Flex 3v3 - Ranked 3s\n- Normal Summoner's Rift - Best of Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s\n- Normal Twisted Treeline - Best of Dynamic Queue or Ranked 3s\n- Co-op vs. AI Summoner's Rift - Best of Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s\n- Co-op vs. AI Twisted Treeline - Best of Dynamic Queue or Ranked 3s\n- Custom - Best of any queue\n- Rotating Game Modes - Best of any queue\n- ARAM 5v5 - Best of any queue\n\nWe don't have confirmation yet for how they will appear next year, but I can only imagine that it'll be similar.
