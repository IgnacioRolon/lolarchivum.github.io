He&#x27;s not even 50% winrate.\n\nWinrate alone doesn't allow for a claim to balance\nKayn is oppressively strong, one of the best soloQ junglers out there, but oh whats this? he's not even 50% winrate according to op.gg, he's 49.96%. Oh, but that probably \"doesn't count\" because he has a high pick rate, so there's such a huge pool of bad players that it levels out, i assume?\n\nas of this moment in time, the very same website cites darius as having 50.16% winrate, the exact same as aatrox (Albeit with 1% less playrate)\n\nIf you want to moan about only winrates, look at OP.gg, at \"Highest winrate\" in the toplane\n\nFucking hecarim and karthus have 53% winrates. Oh but may i assume \"that doesn't count\" because of low pickrate.\n\nSo if i'm reading the kind of argumentative and biased person, (otherwise correct my self debunking), you're likely the kind of person who think a champion needs to either have a high winrate, or a high play rate.\n\nDarius, a champ with a higher winrate than Kayn, someone i play *solely because he's oppressively strong*, and the FOURTH HIGHEST TOPLANE PICKRATE, is a fair champion as things go.\nHe also has the 4th highest *ban* rate, so people clearly dont like fighting him. perhaps because everyone thinks he's too strong?\n\nIf you want to mope that darius is a fair champ, and you demand that basic statistics back you up, you can no longer argue that any of these champions are OP because they have worse pick/win rates than your so-called \"fair\" champion.\n\n{{champion:39}} Higher banrate (30%), sure, but lower pick and win rate.\n{{champion:24}} Significantly lower play rate, roughly equal winrate. MUCH lower banrate (4.44%).\n{{champion:114}} S I G N I F I C A N T L Y lower pickrate, and a 47% winrate. 3.11% banrate.\n{{champion:17}} Tiny pickrate, 49.20% winrate.\n{{champion:164}} yes. camille. a fucking balance nightmare everyone hates. equal winrate, 0.07% less pickrate. yes that's petty but since you choose to bring stats into this i will too\n{{champion:74}} 1.54% pickrate, 48% winrate. That long rant whining about every other toplane being more OP than darius is starting to look a little thin, no?\n{{champion:23}} 1.16% pickrate, 48.91% winrate\n\nSo, by your own choice of \"statistical proof that darius is fair\", we've proven that he's actually stronger than every champ you listed as a counter-arguement that are \"more op\" or that you think beat him in every way. The only person with a higher win or ban rate is aatrox by a miniscule amount and urgot by a significant amount, but that's no surprise because they're flavor-of-the-month LCS picks.\n(viktor top too, but thats because he counters melees like nothing else. still a shite champ when played AP mid, mostly a gimmick pick.)\n\nWell\nto quote you\n\"StAtiSTicS dOn'T LiE\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarukongSr","date":"2018-11-04T23:46:26.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AetherArising,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TVlx3EH9,comment-id=0006000000010001,timestamp=2018-11-04T22:08:00.643+0000)\n>\n> I take it that i deeply offended you. well thats tough shit because i don&#x27;t give anybody special privilege just because they like a champion. i don&#x27;t think any of the champs i play are quite fair either, thats why i play them. it&#x27;s clear you do the same, but you are under the delusion that because *you* play them, they cant possibly be broken.\n> \n> You&#x27;re not looking at your own main from an objective outside view.

I'm not wrong, dar has tons of counterplay and a meh winrate. What you fail to notice when saying dar takes ghost and deadman's is the opportunity cost of doing so. Deadmans is actually mediocre as far a tank items go from a defensive standpoint, and by taking it, dar is worse against dps. But taking ghost, dar can't have to or ignite. By suggesting nerfing dar, he'd go from approximately 49% winrate even lower. That is fair in what universe? Your prejudice is showing. How about I look up your main and advocate nerfs for completely arbitrary reasons?

When you look at seasons past and compare champions with their past versions, you can clearly see they are no where near as strong as they were before. Kassadin and Leblanc for example, their season 3 selves would absolutely destroy their current iterations.\n\nThe way the game is today is completely derived from nerfing everybody instead of buffing those who have been underperforming.

Those things are crammed more and more into kits to make \"interesting\" and \"exciting\" new champions. And nothing is sacrificed to gain an excess of one or 3 of these. Look at malphite. Look at renekton. Look at ashe. They have SOME of these as very strong in their kit, but other things they are weak at. They are exploitable, but good at what they are meant to be good at. Their power curves are more balanced... having a point where they are stronger than average, a point where they are average, and a point where they are weaker (not necessarily in that order). They require items to emphasize these strengths and/or make up for innate weaknesses. Ex: You want to be tanky on renekton? You need to BUILD tanky - no free 70% dmg reduction spammable spell or shield. You want to do damage? You need to BUILD damage. No insane overtuned base stats, no double your crit chance... just average or even below average bruiser level base stats without over-the-top scalings too. You stack armor on malphite because his kit makes extra good use of it? You still have to build mr or you are toast. And your basic abilities are largely mediocre at best - a tradeoff for having such a powerful ult.\n\nThis kind of balance and logic has been forgotten or ignored when designing new champs and items in favor of non-stop hype. You don't need everything about a champ to be obnoxiously op for them to be fun or good. Make things balanced. And look at the scaling on champs too... their power curve. You over-buff hyperscaling champs so they don't get seriously bullied in lane... then are you going to buff the early game champ so that they don't get seriously bullied by the hyperscaling champ in late game? There's a lack of logic as far as balance between the two going on for some while now. Fiora braindead wins late game duels vs other toplaners not named jax? Then she should equally braindead lose to early game champs in early game. Taric is hella op in teamfights, yet counters most aggression in lane... nearly matching leona in power even though leona falls way off after laning phase unlike taric? Why you nerf leona hard and leave taric untouched (earlier this year... not recent) when he was 2nd in lane for melee sup only to leona... before leona got nerfed?\n\nThere's a complete lack of simple logic and critical thinking by the design and balance teams. Those of us who have played the game for many seasons tend to see this and get frustrated. Because they are catering to younger people coming over from stuff like cod who want insta-kill and 15 min game or faster. Sacrificing skill and individual outplay (aside from the few champs they deem acceptable to have as op) in favor of a quick flashy boom. If I wanted to play cod... I'd play cod. If I wanted to play fortnight, I'd play fortnight. Change CAN be good, but forgive me for arguing to defend keeping the parts of league that made it unique and special to most veteran players when I argue against the way some aspects of league have been changing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarukongSr","date":"2018-11-04T23:43:26.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mention all of darius's strengths, yet you forget he has to actually hit people 5 times for most of his kit to matter at all.
