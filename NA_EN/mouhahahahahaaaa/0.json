You just have to take a look of what videos on youtube say about the game and how many likes and dislikes this video has to give you an overall example. However yes if you want to take in consideration the players that play 1 game or 3 games per week. I dont think That's a good idea. My friends and me are the kind of people playing 5 games a day so we can establish way faster where the actual state of the game is compated to people playing 3 games a week. However we never received any survey. You should survey people which play a lot of games because those know better what is really going with the actual state of the game.\n\nBut it seems that you are now prefering the the community of players which don't like long games and that want a fast experience. Those kind of players which will leave lol the fastest way possible when it will stop to be a trend. You are neglecting veterans and transforming this game to fast games made for casus.\n\nYou owe your succes to the generation of players which came from the rts generation aka warcraft aoe strarcraft. Now you are giving to the cod generation the keys of the game ? And you expect veterans to be happy ?\n\nIf vets leave, streamers will leave and your game will stop to be a trend. Casus will leave too. \n\nYou'd better take a look at the video from the act man on youtube he tells you everything about what's wrong with your actual game.
