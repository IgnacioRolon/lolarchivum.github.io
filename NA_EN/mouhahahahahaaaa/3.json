They wanted it to be a succes and hoped for a better future. Thank to this mentality they cared a lot for the players feedback. When community had suggestions or wasn&#039;t happy they didn&#039;t lose time : they directly communicated and announced changes.\n\nNowadays morello doesn&#039;t work on lol anymore and one of the worst thing that happened to league was Coronach departure from riot games. This guy alone has created around 1/5 of lol champions and his designs were rock solid. Since he left riot lost a monolith in champion designs and developpment. The new unexperimented rookies wanted new approachs and innovative designs... the unexperience of those created a lot of mess in the game.\n\n\nWhat i find terrible is that those guys i mentionned before they made a triple A game without a lot of money and got it close to be balanced.\n\nNowadays riot makes 1.6 billions a year and does worse than riot and lol at his beginning. Riot has now high budget but the quality by the actual strandards of gaming industry is very low.\n\n\n2014 : new map rework\n2018 : changes on the old chest keys system which was way more friendly to the players\n2018 : still a lot of old champions to visually or to gameplay update\n2017-18 : popular champions favorised by gameplay improvement and skin comception\n2018 : destruction of a processus of balance that took around 9 years to be optimized \nEvery champion was meant to be balanced around runes and masteries.\n2018 : crazy metas, crazy champion designs, unfinished and non polished ideas that were brought live.\n2018 : extremely low communication with players, non consideration of players feedback, riot had to wait the rage streamers and of the pro players to began to act...\n2018 : the massive amount of players lost have brought them to unbann permantly banned accounts.\n\n\nDoes all of this looks like a 1.6 billion profit a year gaming company ?\n\nYou are trying to be like blizzard but you are getting closer to ea games.\n\nAs i said earlier the guys mentionned at beginning made it better faster and with higher quality (for its time) with perhaps only 1/100000 of the profits riot currently has.\n\nThe uptades were better they focalized on the players need and feedback. The communication was better and they didn&#039;t wait 6 months to makes big changes going in the direction of the community. If players were massively complaining about something the next week it was solved.\n\nSo tell me why do you do worse with more money, more employees and with a big reputation ? In the past riot games worked way better.\n\nDid you decide to rest on your laurels and to wait for money coming from the sky ?\n\nBlizzard would have updated visually all the existing champions one month. In 2 months they would have updated all the old existing kits. It has been 4 years now since map update and the promise to update all champion\nwe still have potato malphite, kite anivia, toilet paper amumu, 3bit caitlyn, candy skarner, flintstone udyr, power rangers pantheon etc...\n\nYou want to look like the amazing blizzard, rockstar games or even ncsoft ?\n\nWell you are light years aways from the speed and ratio quality/speed they work.\nThey work fast/ they adapt fast to their communities/ and they release high quality content at high speed.\n\nRiot you are more like an old diesel engine. By working slow your content quality should be way higher than the companies listed above. But you can&#039;t. You tried this year to release content way faster than in the past it was a big failure. Why ?\n\nYou need to listen to your gaming comunity and you need to hire experienced employees and some rookies that will be formed by the old guys.\n\nThis year was really bad but not a failure because you finally reacted !\n\nDon&#039;t become like ea and everything should be fine. I hope for you all the success possible because i do love riot games and its game league of legends. What i hate it&#039;s when riot games try to alienate his game to bring more players to it.\n\nLet&#039;s hope for a good season 9 and that we players and riot games will continue to walk together and with communication this time.","replies":[{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2018-08-06T06:04:34.288+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Won't happen, unfortunately.

And I want to agree with some of the other stuff, but you're making it really hard with bullshit like this:\n\n> 2018 : changes on the old chest keys system which was way more friendly to the players\n\nChest and keys basically haven't changed at all. The only difference that I know of is the addition of honor check points, which are an improvement to clarity and transparency if anything. Oh, and [these small changes](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/zKItWb9m-champ-mastery-costs-masterwork-chests-and-some-loot-buffs), which all seem like buffs to me.\n\n> 2018 : still a lot of old champions to visually or to gameplay update\n\nYeah, because Riot actually has decent standards now. The old one-new-champion-per-patch cadence is the entire reason that we have so many shitty, old champions in the first place. Good work takes time, no matter how big your company is. Do you want quality, or do you want more Karma reworks? (Sorry Scarizard, it wasn't your best work)\n\n> 2017-18 : popular champions favorised by gameplay improvement and skin comception\n\nWhy wouldn't Riot focus more on the champions that people enjoy? They make more people happy that way. And it's not like they are leaving other champions in the dust forever. Not even counting the complete reworks, I've seen plenty of new skins, lore, and small balance changes given to old champions recently. Yorick, MF, and Volibear (respectively) are just a few good examples.\n\n> 2018 : destruction of a processus of balance that took around 9 years to be optimized\nEvery champion was meant to be balanced around runes and masteries.\n\nArguing in favor of the new runes is a pretty in-depth task that I'm not going to attempt here. But I can say that they haven't affected \"processes of balance\" at all. Champions are still balanced around their best rune setups, and if a rune is too strong, it's obvious (too many champions use it/it made those champions generally dominant) and it gets fixed. This isn't new. The same shit has been happening forever with masteries and items.\n\n> 2018 : crazy metas, crazy champion designs, unfinished and non polished ideas that were brought live.\n\nI'll agree on the first two. (Although I personally don't have a problem with the \"crazy\" designs, I understand Riot is pushing too hard on that front, for most players.) However, it's not fair to call any of it unpolished. There's always been a huge amount of \"live testing\" when it comes to League (and a lot of other online games). It's not realistic to expect new features/champions to be perfectly tuned (especially the crazy ones). It's an iterative design process, that involves player feedback, which they get a ton of **after** release. PBE can only get them so far, given the small playerbase and terrible match quality.\n\nCould Riot spend 3 more months on every champion/feature/issue, to make sure it's perfect? Probably, but that would slow down the overall rate of improvements and new content by a lot. It's not a workflow I would advocate for. I'd rather have slightly unfinished designs, that are perfected quickly thanks to feedback from live players.\n\n> 2018 : extremely low communication with players, non consideration of players feedback, riot had to wait the rage streamers and of the pro players to began to act...\n\nThere is no way this can be objectively argued for or against. It's entirely up to perception and expectations, compared loosely with other games/companies that don't even work the same way. All I can say is that I continually see Riot fix 80% of the hot-button complaints in the game. (The other 20% being infeasible to fix, or just stupid.) It's just takes them a while. Maybe too long... In any case, \"extremely low communication\" and \"non consideration of feedback\" are waaaay off target.\n\n> 2018 : the massive amount of players lost have brought them to unbann permantly banned accounts.\n\nDo you honestly think Riot is experimenting with unbanning players because they need more players? I've tried to be respectful with the rest of my comment, but that is actually ridiculous. Less than 1% of player get permabanned in the first place, so unbanning them would be a drop in the bucket. Seriously, unbanning players is such an incredibly bad business decision for so many reasons... Anyone who thinks Riot is unbanning people for any reason besides pure good-faith or generosity is sorely mistaken. I guess you could argue it's a good PR move, but any kind of AD campaign would be 10x better for their bottom-line if that's what they really cared about.\n\n> You are trying to be like blizzard but you are getting closer to ea games.\n\nEA isn't even a game developer. They are a publisher. Regardless, I get your meaning, and I reject that as well. League of Legends is still a free-to-play game. With free loot. And the recent addition of free runes. And skins may be a bit more expensive now-a-days, but it's largely because they are higher quality. Speaking of which, even when champions get VGUs, their old shitty skins get updated/improved too without increasing those skin prices. Riot is nothing like EA.\n\nBring on the \"Riot fanboy\" comments. Riot is fine company to be a fan of, IMO.\n\n_______\n\nAight, I can't read any more of this.

So i really doubt they'd have updated every single Model and Animation in the game in 2 months. You clearly have no idea how much time goes into it. \nWould it be possible to do? definitely. But it would probably require riot to hire a bunch of extra people to help their current staff, while also not putting out skins during that time.\n\nas for NCSoft, they just made 4 MMO's, i don't know how much they differ from each other but other than the visual thematic it's still just 4 MMO's. none of them were ever as big as league was.\n\nTruth is none of these companies are really bad.
