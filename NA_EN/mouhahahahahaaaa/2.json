In fact i never wrote in forums until season 6.\n\nI never had a chat restriction or a ban before season 7. I didn't used to get angry or to flame during games even with feeders, troll etc.\n\nIt all began with the end of season 6 beginning of season 7.\n\nAnd this not only goes for me but for many of my irl friends which many stopped the game without getting  disciplinary measures.\n\nI suppose we can say that :\n\n- The actual state of the game make it more frustrating to play than ever. \n\n**AND THERE ARE THE BIG DIFFERENCES : **\n\nI think it's normal to be sad/upset or to be angry when you are doing a good game however bad/new players fed opponents.\n\n- In the past i rarely trashtalked anyone even in 0/15 in ranked... Nowadays it's different. You will certainly ask me why ? Because in the past even having 0/15 players with you. You could use lategame or have major turnarounds. Now with the amount of damage and snowball it's just like mission impossible to come back. And what makes it way more frustrating is getting one shot by the fed opponent when you made a good game. And when you have a really bad game you get yourself frustrated because you know that there are not a lot of probabilities to come back. It results a lot in many early surrenders... In the past there wasn't this amount of damage and tunarounds were way more numerous and appeared often. If you had a bad early and most of the lanes fed. If you had a lategame comp you still could make a strong comeback and win. Those kind of games happened a lot.\n\n- The actual state of the matchmaking equals to more frustration too. During my 7 years of playing lol, i have never seen such unfair matchmaking, Sometimes you can play with or against smurfs but you can play with iron players which have a very good MMR but have not enough experience and are not able to read the game to play with gold or silver players. How many games have i played with a team full of silvers 3 2 against almost full team of gold V.  Don't tell me there isn't a difference between those even if it is still trash level. \n\nIn my oppinion LoL community was always toxic even when i played League in the past. However most of the toxic players trashtalked for everything and even for dumb things. I'm not saying that nowadays trashtalk and insults are justified (no one should be) but it seems that those have more validity compared to those in the past. The reasons mentionned above should give you some clues.\n\nI'm sure there are more bans and more disciplinary measures compared to the past. \n\nYou will tell me it's normal there are more players.\n\nI will say no i'm talking in % i'm sure the % of players under disciplinary measures compared to the % of total amount of players has raised.\n\nWhy ?\n\nBecause this game with snowball and it's high damage has become highly frustrating. You can add to this the unfair matchmaking. Add to this the baron buff on minions and the drakes and the herald which clearly favorise better teamfights comps or early jungler champs. Those elements didn't exist before when turnarounds were way more frequent.","replies":[]}
