Result min. 6-9. the first turret is down and with the gold advantage the snowball begins. WTF is this. In those games, this hapenned while no lane got a real advantage on the other side...\n\ncome on wtf is this new way of playing ?\n\nIf this continues like this junglers who farm their jungle and which do ganks will be useless compared to the ones pushing.\n\nNew meta S8 : A wild jungler appeared he joins a laner or a bot lane until they get first turret and the gold. It's super effective so, if your jungler play classic clear jungle + ganks in early your team is lost.\n\nthe main problem is that :\n\nIn the past seasons even being 3 at lvl 5-6 it would take you at least 1 min to destroy a turret you'll need at least 2 waves of creeps if the tower is undamaged. Now it takes 15 secs and only one wave is suficient... You haven't the time to comeback and if you stay you'll be poked hard until you have to back... The time your jungler comes the turret is down...\n\nAnd if you tell me ah this already hapenned in past seasons...\n\nI know the difference please i am playing since s2, so i've seen a lot of things in this game (probably things that some of you had and will never see) : I have more than 5000 games played... i never made any placement game before season 5. Because they didn't really interested me. During season 6 i finally decided to invest some time to ranked games. (my elo max was Gold iv). S7 i didn't want to play a lot of ranked so i staid in silver. Finally if this continues like this i will loose all my interest in ranked games. In the past season the rankeds were intense, interesting and there was a real competition to know who would have the advantage in late game.\n\nFor what i have seen, Its not like those things already seen in league in the past... we were in lane we saw him we got under turret and he staid like 4 min in lane pushing while our jungler was ganking other lanes. He staid until they dived and we backed and they destroyed the turret. And this hapenned in the 3 games, not only in bot lane.\n\ni know about the lane basics and advanced techniques : Freezing, when you are supposed to push and when you can back etc.  Please understand that i know all of those things.\n\nwhen the jungler stays permantly in the opponents lane pushing with the botlane during 4 mins without going back to jungle or into a bush. playing like it was a 3 vs 2 and this hapenned in 3 games in a row... Those junglers stay permantly in lane pushing and poking permantly until you have to back because you and your mate are under 10% of life.... After that they get the turret. That is not how the game was played before the pre season... \n\nThey look for the weakest of an opponent lane to make this\n\nThe great difference between past and now is that now they wont leave the lane until the first turret is down. By not leaving in mean they play the game as they were top laners, mid laner, supps or adc. They farm they push, they stay they poke and dont leave and that during 4-5min. \n\n\n\n...","replies":[{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2018-01-12T05:32:03.799+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":8,"body":"This \"new\" way of playing is Riot's answer to the problem of macro and strategy.

The only turret to take early that may have been good was middle, for it gave the jungler a lot of power and pressure on the other lanes. That and mid lane is the shortest lane. But if you were top or bot and you took that turret early then congratulations you gave the opposing laner some safety to farm. You can't over extend to stop their farming, and when their creeps over extend then they can farm in the jungle. Monsters back then spawned fast enough to share. \n\nSure you could go to another lane but then you're taking gold and XP from your fellow laner. You had to strategically time out when to take turrets depending on what your champion was and who your opponent's champion was.

This isnt news. Getting forced to back when the wave is crashing at your turret is going to result in some serious tower damage and a ton of lost XP and gold. What exactly about this has changed? This has always been the case. This has always been punishable by the enemy jungler too. The difference is back in season 3 a silver jungler wouldnt have the game sense to come top and chunk the tower more with their top laner.
