I think that's a pretty big edge case. He was top tier in pro play forever because he had everything and no mana constraints.\n\nI'm saying that while it might not be good for spectators, farm lanes make for a genuinely better and more consistent mid and late game for everyone.\n\nThe current hyper aggressive early game is more fun to watch, but from a player's standpoint it's utterly exhausting and it removes distinct phases of the game, as the entire thing might as well be a massive deathmatch.\n\nWhen people say that LoL sucks now, it's almost entirely because of that philosophy. Damage is high enough at all points of the game right now that there's basically always a 100-0 scenario. The damage has been added to shorten the game and make it more exciting to watch. But it just makes the game shitty to play because any lane could turn into an all you can eat buffet before you've even established yourself in lane, and the game is over before it even starts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-10-05T02:58:34.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then they need to lose something else. \nCan't be like right now where tanks outsustain, outtrade, outwaveclear you and scale monstrous into teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-10-05T03:10:36.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks generally don’t have as much healing mechanics as fighters. \n\nExcept Maokai and Cho, but _fuck_ Maokai and Cho.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LeBlanc Rose","date":"2018-10-05T02:46:57.257+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing Talon vs Malphite\nI got first blood, had a pre good cs lead against him\nDidn't matter.

Kai sa was not fed she was negative and Yi was decently fed but like I said both full build so being fed doesn't matter.\nI righteous glory into fight cc half their team press R and then died.  Killed me through my W and Iron elixar, and Locket. Took me down in just under 2.5 seconds, I know cause I texted my duo buddy about it.\nI know late game hyper carry full build but I mean 2.5 seconds is still fast for a full tank with shields","replies":[{"poster":"crispy66","date":"2018-10-04T22:48:18.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for the details, that's how you should always provide context","replies":[{"poster":"Wilyum","date":"2018-10-04T22:50:40.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=crispy66,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ggwxlhQa,comment-id=000c00010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-04T22:48:18.835+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for the details, that&#x27;s how you should always provide context\n\nDidn't feel like writing a paper to explain myself online during my statistics class but you are welcome","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2018-10-04T21:26:55.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2018-10-04T21:36:45.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And now days, tanks can't even tank properly due to the ease of access to true damage or health% magic damage on adc's and top laners.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalizard","date":"2018-10-05T06:08:56.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks are op and with adcs are the most important role in team.

This is the same problem we had with getting rid of the ADC monopoly on bot lane. ADCs weren't 90% of the top 10 picks so they were suddenly \"garbage,\" despite the fact that 3 of the top 5 bot picks were ADCs, and 6 of the top 10 bot picks were ADCs.
