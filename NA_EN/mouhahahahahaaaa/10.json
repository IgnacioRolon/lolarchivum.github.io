The open mid phenoma doesn&#039;t really exists in na or eu. But in asia they really let the opponents go straight to the nexus if the game is looking bad to win time and to not spend a lot of money. In asia lol is really popular so after school or college you go with 4 friends play games in internet cafe its easier for you than everyone at home. And many kids don&#039;t have their own computer.\n\nSo winning time for them is winning money. It&#039;s a little bit paradoxal to have to pay to play a free game. Kids or young people don&#039;t always have a lot of money... yep... we don&#039;t live all in wealthy countries (china for example).\n\nRiot said they used surveys in the past and majority of the players wanted shorter games. Majority of the players = china and korea. That why we don't hear their complains.\n\nI foud this video which talks about the subject https://youtu.be/UjunINOwvVw\n\nAfter knowing this, well i have to admit i&#039;m not against it, if it can help them.\n\nHowever i think its a problem that the entire world has to adapt to this phenomena. Because in na or eu it this phenomena doesn&#039;t really exists\n\nI think riot should have a kinda different meta for occidental countries and asian countries. Or try to find another solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Draehl","date":"2018-01-15T07:19:17.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Or much more likely it's simply the results of the new rune system backfiring.

While the american average is almost 200 dollars a day, per person.  Pretty hefty difference, that even scales harder at the higher echelons of pay grade in na/eu, places that asians countries dont even touch in comparison.\n\n**I understand fully that this is not the only factor when deciding money spent on said video game.  But it is a massive one.\n**\n\nGive the asian countries that are \"DOMINATING\" our purchases, our gdp, then maybe talks of shunning na/eu could start.\n\n\nGDP per capita is an amazing tool for measuring a countries purchasing power.\n\nUntil i see actual numbers that state Asians countries spend more on lol, im not buying it.

And that was a few years ago, I can only imagine they have grown since then. \n\nAnd then your talking about GDP depicting who spends more? They are already paying to play the game, a free game and they pay to play it at a rate of like 2.3:1.. And they shell out for much more than skins, they buy boosts which I didn't think anyone was foolish enough to buy. \n\nin 2015 Riot released a statement saying that 15% of Korea's TOTAL POPULATION plays League... That's roughly 30 million people in Korea alone...\n\n2017 Riot's server population puts NA at 10% of League's playerbase (EUW comes in #1 btw), TEN PERCENT compared to Korea at 23.5%... This also shows that the previous two years Korea came in #1 both times.\n\nAgain your talking of GDP, when that is just a gross estimation of a national economy. It's not at all an accurate indication of a single company in a single industries standings. \n\nAnd your still talking hypothetically. This \"shunning\" (bad word choice again, but we will run with it) has already taken place. The asian gaming cafe market demands games not run longer than 30 minutes. Around season 5 Riot started implementing snowball mechanics, and other mechanics and meta's that put focus on early game and snowballing. There are currently around a dozen or so snowball mechanics, all intentionally designed to speed up the game progression rate, and shorten the length of game time.\n\nBut lets get to the juicy part:\nIn 2017 Asian gaming industry revenue was around 51.2b... and NA?
