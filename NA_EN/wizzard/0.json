We usually bait a lot and keep our health low to make greed be the enemy player's downfall and trap them. Its a high risk high reward strategy, but now that shaco got nerfed twice its a borderline suicidal tactic now. Either way shaco can get killed in 2 secs from full health which is why we just bait using ult so we have our clone explode quicker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-15T23:35:23.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I walked onto a box on crystal scar last night.
