{"poster":"ihaveN0keyboard","date":"2016-06-27T00:57:02.781+0000","title":"Player behavior gets worse every year.  5 years, quitting. 3 perma banned accounts","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":9,"down_votes":22,"body":"I&#039;ve toyed with player behavior over the years. Like the title says, I HAVE BEEN PERMABANNED 3 times. Maybe 4, I don&#039;t even remember. I consider accounts disposable and I stopped buying anything with real money. I poked and prodded at players who decided to waste my time. By Riot&#039;s rules I absolutely deserved every ban, except the first one. I was banned for sarcasm and arrogance the first time, for brushing off stupid behavior by having some individual character. Sorry Riot, sorry for being arrogant in the midst of garbage behavior.  \r\n\r\n Riot has the &quot;safe place&quot; philosophy. Anything that upsets anyone can be reported, and where there is smoke there is fire.\r\n\r\n My problem, and the main reason I have more insight into bad behavior is that I have always had non-meta builds. Not troll builds, but not popular, at least at the moment I used them. Many became meta but that&#039;s not the point. My builds and playstyle  can get me to Plat-Diamond SOLO. Every tier has difference behavioral challenges to face, and to a lesser degree gameplay. The majority of players think the grass is greener higher up, it&#039;s not. There are players in Plat and Diamond that are just as dumb as toxic as lower ranks. (And when I say dumb, I mean in game only! I know from real life experience some players just turn into idiots when they login.) \r\n\r\n I faced an onslaught of ignorant behavior from players who look for a reason to blame when a game goes bad. It is common for a player to press tab and LOOK FOR A REASON TO BE MAD after a play goes wrong, or an enemy play goes right.  If you play your own builds, you will face every bit of toxicity this game has to offer nearly every losing game. Even worse, every game that is still completely winnable, but your team gave up and is now blaming you while being tilted. \r\n\r\n I call it Moba Mental Illness. Players have very specific and reliable responses to in-game occurrences. I know what they are mad about, almost word for word what they will say, and how to stand my ground with logic. AND I DO IT FREELY.  When I do it in excess I feel the ban coming, and I push it further, I throw in some verbal Kung Fu, I teach lessons. Feelings are hurt for the overall purpose of good. \r\n\r\n Riot says to ignore and report. Right? The threads of &quot;how you are supposed to behave&quot; are sewn into this game, but they don&#039;t work.  I&#039;ve turned chat off for months. Like I mentioned, I take most of the blame in situations where I&#039;m off meta, that means my teammates are being toxic at me. By ignoring them, do I just report them all and just assume they are toxic? If my team decides my gameplay is the problem, so they start using their keyboard to launch their stock phrases meant to insult and blame, are they reporting each other? \r\n\r\n If a player stops trying (but does not blatantly quit) while blaming others, teammates are likely to bandwagon in and feel hopeless. The players who stop trying are now the majority, and they bandwagon report the player who got ganked/had bad game/off meta build. In this scenario, does the report system make the game better? NO. IT EMPOWERS BAD BEHAVIOR THAT SPREADS LIKE A VIRUS.  \r\n\r\nNobody is standing up for logic anymore. There is no natural social regulation. The strict chat log based-no context based ban system devolved player interaction to grade school level. It&#039;s not just the age of players at fault, teens will always be little punks, if they are old enough to be little punks then they are old enough to have someone stand up to their bad behavior. LET PLAYERS GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT, LET THEM GROW. \r\n\r\n  I want to log in and play a GAME. I want to play my best, think, use TACT. I play games as a form of meditation, to be in the zone. I feel it&#039;s beneficial. I&#039;m old and it keeps me sharp, I feel good when I&#039;m deep into a game. Why is it that even in top single digit %, can I not fully play the GAME? Why can I not stand up to idiots without infraction? This was one of my favorites, top notch all around EXCEPT in player moderation where Riot has failed at a unprecedented level... that will effect future games for years. This is like prison culture on the streets, this is the Compton of gaming. \r\n\r\n Hey Riot: BAN PLAYERS WHO LOG IN AND REFUSE TO TRY. CHANGE PLAYER BEHAVIOR WITH INFORMATION, ON HOW TO WIN WHILE BEHIND, OR HOW A COUPLE DEATHS BEHIND IS NOT A LOSS. STOP FORCE FEEDING KIDS LCS BULLSHIT, DELETE ALL VIDEOS THAT SHOW PARENTS APPRECIATING AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR CHILDREN ONCE THEY ARE &quot;PRO&quot; GAMERS.

Then, someone says something far less incendiary and they get hit as if they were a repeat offender.  It appears Riot likes to randomly take down some toxic players and then do nothing for a period of time, where these people do whatever they want in the meantime.\n\nSometimes it gets so bad I just don't even say a word, and wait for the game to be over.  If I say something, it'll possibly be a suspension, if I don't say anything the game ends at some point soon and I can go try and find a winnable one.  But one thing that should exist is a stand your ground rule, where if somebody flames you you have the right to flame them right back within reason.  If somebody calls me a name, I should be able to call them a name, and that's the end of it unless they say something again, in which case I get a response without punishment (within reason, no death threats/wishes/etc) because trolls get away with it by using tons of accounts and there's no defense for the regular player who just wants to use one account and play a game.\n\nWe need to wake up folks.  Ban smurfs in ranked, rework the behavioral system, throw out designers with biases towards/against certain champions, and get this game back where it was 3-4 years ago when I was dragged on by friends talking how great it was.  Those same friends quit last year, citing how awful the game has become in many different ways.

Why do you NOT want smurfs to be banned in ranked?  Remember, a smurf is the low level account of somebody much higher.

Especially when you're new to the game and have no realistic chance to beat somebody who played for four years? I honestly believe smurfs ruin the game because you have no idea why this person can buy a champ and go 32-0 with them on their first time and play them better than you can, with over a hundred games experience, and find out \"oh, that dude's a smurf\" and realize how stacked the deck really is.\n\nFrankly, I know we'll never see the day Riot bans smurfs in ranked but the concept of banning people for boosting and then allowing them to be boosted by their buddies on accounts that are PURPOSELY lower ranked than their mains is beyond despicable and makes for a really questionable experience - how can they justify it?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-27T01:20:31.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just avoid calling them noobs or anything that will tilt them further.

Many pros have been banned before for various forms of toxicity, such as [IWillDominte](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2864421&page=1#post32080366), [XhaoWeiXhao](http://2015.na.lolesports.com/articles/competitive-ruling-xian-%E2%80%9Cxiaoweixiao%E2%80%9D-yu), [Incarnati0n](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1122163), [FORG1VEN](http://2015.na.lolesports.com/articles/competitive-ruling-konstantinos-%E2%80%98forg1ven%E2%80%99-tzortziou) and [Stixxay](http://2015.na.lolesports.com/articles/competitive-ruling-stixxay) just to name a few.\n\nYes they got to play again but that's only because they proved that they had changed their behavior for the better (the past accounts of the previously banned players are still banned though-they didn't get their accounts back).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ihaveN0keyboard","date":"2016-06-27T02:39:10.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks to anyone that read or responded, I'm walking away now. The way these boards work, the down votes will bury this or Riot will delete it, but I am curious to see what others have to say if it sticks around. \n\n It's been fun, I enjoyed League in the past, I know many enjoy it now and I'm not here to ruin that. Sometimes you just want to leave some sort of imprint, even if it's just trying to hit the moon with a slingshot. \n\n PS: \nTanky AP CDR Vel'Koz is what I got to Diamond with most recently. You do full damage with just magic pen boots and Guise. Iceborn Gauntlet is AMAZING on Vel. You get free auto attacks between spells, Iceborn procs and allows you to land more shots and gives free damage, CDR, AND mana. 0 wasted gold, its amazing. Do not rush damage, rush Spectres Cowl and Glacial shrowd... complete Iceborn and Banshee's Veil, THEN buy magic pen boots and guise... finish with Rylias.. learn to play this and you do more damage than AP vel AND you can tank/solo enemy teams. CDR runes or MAgic pen runes.
