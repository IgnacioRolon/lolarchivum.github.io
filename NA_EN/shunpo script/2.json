After playing for a while, I left the post match screen on in the background while browsing some online forums and youtube. When I went to close the client and shutdown my computer before I went to bed everything just froze. My entire computer froze from the client. It took 30 seconds for the Windows task manager to open when it normally takes one second. The league client was the only program open at the time.  Even after after the client was closed my computer took much much longer than usual to process normal tasks and to shutdown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2020-01-01T11:12:44.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's weird...I left the client open over night once (rather recently), playing the occational game.

No warning, no unresponding application error, it just shut itself down and automatically restarted.\n\nHere's the weird part: It didn't take more RAM than usual and the CPU load was negligible. So what the hell actually happened with the client, I have no idea. \nNever happened to me before (on prior crashes, it at least gives an error - this time, nothing!), and never happened since.\n\nI have had a proper memory leak though, but that was with Firefox (v.69): 2 tabs open (this was a replicable error), and upon opening any image on a specific web page (reputable webshop), the RAM counter started. \n\nDidn't catch it the first time, until I was suddenly told I didn't have enough RAM to open even a small .jpg image in my editing software. And found Firefox taking 26 GB RAM (of 32).","replies":[{"poster":"shunpo script","date":"2020-01-01T11:25:13.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a phenomenon like a memory leak but for bandwidth?","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2020-01-01T12:16:14.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=shunpo script,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=fTQT6jG9,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2020-01-01T11:25:13.495+0000)\n>\n> Is there a phenomenon like a memory leak but for bandwidth?\n\nOh yeah. Depending on circumstances, that is called \"siblings\" or \"parents\".\n\nBut there are sometimes unexplainable \"black holes\" in a connection that just swallows up bandwidth (I am serious here btw.). They are rare, but for us in the know, we know of them.

But that's really just a case in peer-to-peer software (.torrenting being the most notable). Or using multiple online services at the same time, like browsing, streaming and downloading at the same time.\n\nThe higher number of connections, the more bandwidth will be consumed. The only limiting factor here is your connection speed or inadequate hardware (i.e. crappy router) that will eventually lock up because it can't handle all the simultaneous connection requests.\n\nToo many connection requests with a limited connection speed (like ADSL), and you'll shortly feel lag ingame. Other exceptions would be like a DDOS attack, where thousands of ping requests are made at the same time (instead of like a handful), to deliberately overload a server or networking unit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2020-01-01T00:57:56.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's farming bitcoins.","replies":[{"poster":"Levantern","date":"2020-01-01T11:04:39.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean?

You can \"dig\" after Bitcoins using either your CPU or GPU (certain on-board hardware features requires), putting a preset maximum utilization (determined either by you, or if by unscrupulous corporations, up to 100 %) on either component.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I  Yuke  I","date":"2020-01-27T21:31:57.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too but I get it from the game with the client closed","replies":[]},{"poster":"VanBracken","date":"2020-01-13T06:41:37.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is definitely a memory leak.
