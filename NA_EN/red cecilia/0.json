I needed to do this because I think my email address has been somehow compromised. However, since about yesterday morning, my password no longer works, making me very uncertain about what happened. I sent another help ticket to try to get my account and intended email address sorted out in case it was a support staff fault (like sending a recovery link to the bad email address), and now I'm playing the waiting game. I created this account to help pass the time until I can log back on with all my fun jungle champions. I've heard sometimes it's less than 48 hours, other times it can take 6 weeks. 6 weeks scares me, because I want to be a part of the Halloween sales with that account. I'm sure I've given a great deal of personal info only the player would know, so I'll get it back eventually. I would just like to know how long this is going to take so I can at least have closure.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T22:25:18.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never personally seen an account recovery take 6 weeks, so I'm not sure where that figure is coming from. I don't have a timeline to provide you, but if your ticket for recovery includes as much information as possible, we should be able to get this resolved soon.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
