I am still a little unfamiliar to some of the gaming mechanics of LoL so any suggestion for lore, art, or kit especially is appreciated. I attached an image of what he would look like but the link is there too :)\n\nhttp://i59.tinypic.com/2gwhou9.png\n\nOverview\nKappa is a close range mage who would probably function best as a jungler or support. His starting speed is high, but damage takes time to build.\n\nLore: (this is just a summary, not really a final write up)\nHe was an unlucky young yordle child who became lost in a forest. Tired, he decided to sleep by a river bed in a nest of mushrooms. Unfortunately, as he slept he tumbled into the river and should have drowned, but for mysterious reasons, likely due to the mushrooms rose up again, reborn in a stranger body. No longer accepted in his yordle village due to his alarming appearance he began to play pranks as revenge upon the villagers, often times resulting in them being almost hurt. Finally, Lulu came to deal with his harassment of the village and seeing his power decided to recommend him to the league. \n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive- Mushroom trail\nKappa leaves a trail of luminous mushrooms behind him that act like wards lighting up the FOG and bushes for an additional 3 seconds\n\nQ-Spore shot\nKappa shoots a barrage of three spores in a line that stop once hitting something, dealing damage and an additional lingering poison for about 1.5  seconds.\n\nW-Sopor cloud\nActive: Kappa shoots a cloud of soporific spores at an enemy making them fall asleep for a short time (stun basically)\nPassive: If cloud hits a champion Kappa is granted additional speed and damage for a short time. \n\nE-Faerie Ring\nKappa places a ring of mushrooms granting vision  and healing ally champions in the ring while slowing enemy champions. The ring lasts for a total of 5 seconds but the heal and slow will decay quicker leaving only vision. \n\nR- Seed Spore\nKappa seeds all champions in close range to him with a mushroom spore blinding them and dealing damage after a few seconds when they burst. If Kappa is killed before the spores burst the damage dealt is doubled. \n\nTaunts:\n\nFunny: What?!? I'm **not** a plant!\nTaunt: sticks out tongue and blows a raspberry\nWhen running: Can't catch me!\n\nBasis:\nMy inspiration for Kappa came from a few bits of mythology. The first being the Kappa, which is a Chinese monster that lives near river beds. The second being the mandrake, a humanoid plant that was of middle age folklore.","replies":[{"poster":"Aquaman711","date":"2015-01-11T00:38:28.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm loving this artwork, and his passive is very unique. Good job!\n\nThere are a few problems, though. Unless he was designed to be a support, he's very under-powered. He has a nice heal, slow and stun, which are good staples for a support, and his Q shouldn't be doing too much damage because of the poison. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be geared toward doing much of anything else. Also, how close is 'close' range when we're talking about his ultimate?\n\nHonestly, I can't make any final assumptions withoit knowing more about his mana costs, cooldowns, etc. \n\nGreat job so far, though! Keep up the good work!","replies":[]},{"poster":"infinate 8s","date":"2015-01-10T23:58:08.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump... anyone know if riot actually looks at champion suggestions?","replies":[]},{"poster":"infinate 8s","date":"2015-01-10T16:09:29.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated W","replies":[]},{"poster":"infinate 8s","date":"2015-01-10T09:05:38.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bumpity bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gunpoint","date":"2015-01-10T03:54:54.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He ain't an imp.","replies":[{"poster":"infinate 8s","date":"2015-01-10T07:42:42.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Its better than kappa, the mischevious kappa O.O","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-10T03:25:16.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like him, i think that he is original, (i dont see how hes like Teemo at all, Kappa is like a supp not a marksman, thier not similar at all) a mushrom champ would be cool.
