I was wanting to get a second champion for higher elo that is, well, tanky. \r\n\r\nI dont think Jayce would work well as a Tank, but I will try it out sometime. But what are the current meta tanks? Or are tanks not good anymore? Mostly what I find people playing top lane nowadays is Jax, Fiora, Kennen, Riven, and Darius. Not any true tanks like Poppy/Naut. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Chumpzi11a","date":"2017-12-15T21:01:53.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ornn if unbanned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSmileZ","date":"2017-12-15T20:26:06.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:16}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcus Diabolus","date":"2017-06-18T17:26:48.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen is alright.
