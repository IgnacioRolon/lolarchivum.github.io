Thanks, Lutzburg!**\n\n**A shout-out to Davepowa, who drew Xeno's amazing concept art.  Thank you, Davepowa!!**\n\n**A shout-out to Angeluslight, who was so kind as to help with Xeno's numbers.  Thank you, Angeluslight!**\n\n**Role:** AD Fighter\n\n**Lore:**\n   Xeno is a girl born in Bilgewater, scorned and hated by most -if not all- of her fellow humans.  She now fights along side her ghostly-guardian Hades to make them feel the pain and fear that she&#039;s endured for most of her life.  Hades is a specter from the Shadow Isles, originally unable to leave and unable to kill with Mordekaiser and Hecarim.  He now wields his scythe, Thanatos, in order to protect his vessel Xeno who is all that stands between him and confinement to his native land.\n\n   The instant that she was born, Xeno was doomed to a life of pain and solitude.  Her birth wasn&#039;t the problem, it was WHEN she was born.  Unfortunately for her, Xeno was born into Bilgewater in the middle of the Harrowing.  No one knows why, or how, such a miracle was able to occur, but they do know that it was no miracle.  Rumors quickly spread that the Harrowing had somehow ALLOWED this child to be born in its midst, and with good reason.  Her skin was as pale as the dead, save for her right arm which was as black as the dreaded fog of the Shadow Isles, and her hair was a ghostly blue.  Frightened by how such a thing could happen, Xeno&#039;s parents abandoned her almost immediately.  Alone and cursed, little Xeno had to struggle more than many others in order to survive.  She lived in constant fear of her own curse, and of the pain that many other townsfolk would inflict upon her at first sight.\n\n   Desperate to escape her life of misery, Xeno grabbed all the food and water that she could carry and stole the first little boat she found that was able to hold her and her supplies.  Without hesitating to attempt to chart a course, or to even decide where her destination was, she bid farewell to Biglewater and set out to sea.  She sailed aimlessly for what felt like months before her stolen boat finally hit shore.  Upon surveying her surroundings, Xeno found herself starring directly into the Shadow Isles.  Terror quickly gripped her heart when she realized where she had landed.  But that terror soon faded, and was replaced by a strangely calm sensation.  Xeno collected her essential belongings and ventured deep into the heart of the Shadow Isles.  She was completely alone, yet she could hear their voices.  The voices of the dead, many likely to be here after being swept up in the Harrowing.  But there was one voice that caught her attention.  A lone voice filled with frustration and distaste whereas all the others held nothing but dread.  Xeno followed this particular voice to its owner: a shadowy-looking specter armed with an equally ghastly scythe.\n\n  Hades turned and looked at the mortal girl who wandered into his territory.  At first he glared at her with disgust for bothering him, but then smiled with glee.  He may be trapped in the Shadow Isles, unable to hunt the living like the others, but now a human has actually come to him.  Unwilling to let this chance slip away, Hades reached quickly for his scythe Thanatos and prepared to strike.  But the girl didn&#039;t flinch.  She just sat and stared at him.  As if sensing his situation, the girl looked him straight in the eye and offered him a deal.  Xeno offered to act as his vessel, a body he could use to leave the Shadow Isles and kill as many humans as he wished.  And all he&#039;d have to do in exchange is fight by her side and protect her.  It was simply too good to refuse!  Hades eagerly agreed, using an ancient spell he&#039;d discovered some time ago to bind himself to this girl like an extension of her own shadow.\n\n   Xeno spent a few years in the Shadow Isles, honing her teamwork with Hades and getting to know her new partner better.  Once they agreed that their training was complete, she departed from that dark land and set a course for Valoran.  Her sights were now set on the League of Legends.  There is simply no better place to provide Hades the killing that she&#039;d promised, as well as demonstrate the might of their contract.\n\n**(Xeno's partnership with Hades was inspired by Ansem - Seeker of Darkness and his Guardian from the first _Kingdom Hearts_ game)**\n**--\n\n--Base stats:\n\n--Health - 575 (+80)\n--Attack Damage - 50 (+3)\n--Health Regen - 7.9 (+ .55)\n--Attack Speed - .668 (+2.7%)\n--Mana - 330 (+50)\n--Armor - 25 (+3.5)\n--Mana regen - 7 (+ .7)\n--Magic resist - 30 (+1)\n--Melee - 125\n--Movement speed - 340\n\n**Strengths:** Consistent damage threat, various AoE abilities, three forms of CC, grows in power the more nearby enemies she damages.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Durable, but not exactly tanky; no real escapes; no self heals; must be in the thick of the action in order to get the most out of her passive.\n**--\n\n_**Abilities:**_\nPassive - Black Essence:  Every time Xeno damages an enemy champion with one of her abilities, she charges them with a stack of \"Black Essence\" up to a cap of three per champion.  Xeno gains bonus Attack Damage for every stack of Black Essence nearby.  Enemies will lose all their Black Essence stacks after going a few seconds without being damaged by one of Xeno&#039;s abilities.\n__Stack duration - 2.5 seconds\n__Bonus Attack Damage per Black Essence stack -  3.25/5.5/7.75 (Lv. 1-6 / 7-12 / 13-18)\n\nQ - Drop dead:  Xeno summons Hades&#039; scythe and cleaves a target enemy, dealing physical damage.  For a few seconds afterwards, she will fight using Thanatos, gaining a small increase in attack range and causing her basic attacks to strike in a cone in front of her.\n--When used during \"Hades' contract\", Hades will swing his scythe in a wide arc, dealing physical damage to all enemies struck.\n__Initial cleave physical damage [Including w/Hades' Contract) - 35/70/105/140/175 (+35% AD)\n__Increased basic attack range increased to: 175 (melee)\n__Conic angle: 35 degrees\n__Conic range (from behind target): 200 units\n__Buff duration: 4 seconds\n__Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8\n__Mana cost: 45/50/55/60/65\n\n__With Hades' Contract - Skillshot:\n__Conic angle: 65 degrees\n__Conic range: 325 units\n\nW - Hold it:  When cast on an ally, Hades will appear in front of that target and spread his arms wide in an effort to defend them for a few seconds.  Hades can only block single-target skill shots and basic attacks (skill shots that can pass through multiple targets, hitting them all, will not be blocked).  If Hades absorbs 3-5 hits, he will automatically return to Xeno and \"Hold it\" will go on cool down immediately.  When cast on an enemy, Hades will appear behind that target.  After a couple seconds, Hades will grab the target, dealing physical damage and rooting them in place for a short time.\n--If cast on an ally during \"Hades' contract\", Hades will reach out and wrap his hand around the target, granting them a damage-blocking shield based on how much of the shield Xeno has left.  During \"Hades' contract\", \"Hold it\" can only be cast on Xeno's allies.\n__Cast on ally:\n__Wall width - 100\n__Wall length - 300\n__Max number of single-target spells/basic attacks absorbed: 3/4/5 (Ranks 1/3/5)\n__Duration: 3 seconds\n\n__Cast on enemy:\n__Cast range: 600\n__Cast delay: 2 seconds\n__Root duration: 1.75/2/2.25 seconds\n__Physical damage: 30/60/90/120/150 (+30% AD)\n\n__Hades' Contract (cast on ally only)\n__Shield strength - (See Hades' Contract)\n__Shield duration - 3.5 seconds\n\n__Cooldown: 17/16/15/14/13\n__Mana cost: 80\n\nE - No escape:  Hades sinks into Xeno&#039;s shadow and shoots forward, latching on to and slowing the first enemy struck, and forming a tether between that enemy and Xeno for a few seconds.  While the tether holds, Hades will inflict continuous magic damage to the target and increases Xeno's movement speed when she is moving towards that target.\n--When cast during \"Hades' contract\", Xeno's shadow will grow larger before it shoots forward.  It will then tether to and slow the first 3 enemies struck.  Enemies tethered will take continuous magic damage, and Xeno will gain increased movement speed when moving towards any one of those three targets.\n__Range - 950 (Stretches to 1000 before breaking)\n__Tether duration: 2.25\n__Slow: 15/20/25% (Ranks 1/3/5)\n__Movement Speed buff (toward target only): 10/15/20%\n__Damage over Time: 50/60/70/80/90 (+50% AP) Magic damage\n__Skillshot width: 75\n\n__With Hades' Contract:\n\n__Skillshot width: 125\n\n__Cooldown: 14/13/12/11/10\n__Mana cost: 70/75/80/85/90\n\nR - Hades&#039; contract:  Hades grows to his full size, enveloping Xeno for a few seconds.  During this time, Xeno gains a powerful damage-blocking shield and she is able to re-cast &#039;R&#039; to use the ability \"Thanatos\".\nR - Thanatos:  Hades sends his scythe out in a line and pulls it back, dealing physical damage to all enemies struck as the weapon travels.  Additionally, enemies struck during Thanatos&#039; return will be dragged towards Xeno.\n__First Cast: Hades' Contract -\n\n__Shield strength: 150/250/350 (+50% AD) (+20% AP)\n__Shield Duration: 3 seconds\n\n__Second Cast (within 5 seconds) : Thanatos -\n\n__Range: 700\n__Projectile speed: 1500\n__Projectile width: 150\n__Physical damage: 100/200/300 (+25% AD) [Per hit -- Max 2 hits]\n\n__Cooldown: 125 seconds\n__Mana cost: 125\n\n**(I imagine \"Hades&#039; contract\" to appear something like Riot&#039;s version of the Susanoo from *Naruto Shipuden*.

Ult first; originally, it was pretty much like {{champion:12}}'s with the whole \"reducing damage\" effect.  So I changed it to providing her a really powerful damage-blocking shield to try to stay within the _Naruto_ style susanoo **inspired** theme.   Xeno's original W was a problem as well, as it was almost a carbon-copy of {{champion:31}}'s Q.  To fix this problem, I changed it to one of those abilities that can be cast on allies as well as enemies.  Now, casting it on allies (or herself) increases that target's defense by granting them a guardian to take a few hits for them.  Casting it on enemies will deal physical damage and root the target in place, though there will be a minor delay to provide some counter-play value to the ability.\n\nSecond, I adjusted all of her abilities to be slightly augmented during the duration of her ultimate.  This was done because with Hades growing in size to provide further protection for Xeno, it would be difficult (thematically) to have him leave her during that time for her W and E abilities.\n\nAfter I realized just how big of an error I'd made in designing her abilities (accidentally copying two pre-existing ones), I did everything I could to fix Xeno up.  However, I do recognize the possibility that I may have gone a little overboard.\n\nAll that aside, I'd like to hear what you all think.  I can only hope at the moment that I did a good enough job fixing Xeno's problems without going overboard.
