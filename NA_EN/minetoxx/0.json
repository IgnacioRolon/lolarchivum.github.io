I'm a member of a build team in Minecraft and for one year we work on a new map called : **The Crystal Scar**. We have given ourselves the challenge to do a reproduction of the League of Legends map.\nAt the beginning we just expected to create a map who looks like but the more we advance more we wanted to reproduce the gamemode.\n\nToday I wanted to show you our work, it's not finished, we will not release it before few weeks but have a look :\n\n______________________\n**THE CRYSTAL SCAR**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UkkBiuL.png\n\n**Towers :**\n\n* *The Refinery*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GBVSBwK.png\n\n* *The Quarry*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wAeOwXd.png\n\n* *The Boneyard*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XyaRc3d.png\n\n* *The Drill*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3tz54FG.png\n\n* *The Windmill*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X8PZ11E.png\n\n**Middle :**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XPez0fW.png\n\n**Blue Base (Red base is the same) :**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VmmVFUn.png\n\n__________________\n\n**FEATURE**\n\nWe also build a lobby, players can chooses their team, role and there is a tutorial room.\n6 role are available : Support, Tank, Marksman, Mage, Assassin and Fighter. Every role have 4 spell and different attributes.\n\n* *The Assassin :*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gLbL3B3.png\nThe **Assassin** is the most powerful class in **The Crystal Scar**, but he has to deal with the lowest health points. He is **black stuffed**, and has a **diamond sword**.\n\n* *The Fighter :*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ly2OVji.png\nThe **Fighter** is the most polyvalent class in **The Crystal Scar**, his stats are like a vanilla player. He is **orange stuffed**, and has an** iron sword**.\n\n* *The Mage :*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D4sOndP.png\nThe **Mage** is an elementalist in **The Crystal Scar**, he has crowd control and blast damage. He is **purple stuffed**, and has a **golden hoe**.\n\n* *The Marksman :*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NC2n97L.png\nThe **Marksman** is the only range class in **The Crystal Scar**, but he has to deal with the lowest health points. He is **green stuffed**, and has a **bow**.\n\n* *The Support :*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RGpkE0Q.png\nThe **Support** is the helper class in **The Crystal Scar**, he got more health point than usual but, he has weak damage. He is **yellow stuffed**, and has a **golden sword**.\n\n* *The Tank :*\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aThDQFS.png\nThe** Tank** is the most resistant class in **The Crystal Scar**, he got more health point than everyone but, he is slow. He is **gray stuffed**, and has a **Stone sword**.\n\n\n We build a shop, players can buy enchantment for their weapons, we took the items from League of Legends to illustrate :\nhttp://i.imgur.com/92rFEbu.png\n\nWe also had sound, so when you capture a tower you can hear \"The Blue Team has captured the Drill\" and when a game starts the original music from The Crystal Scar is playing.\n\nThere are more feature but I will stop here for today, if you like it let us know ! we need support ! Thanks to pay attention !\n\n*More screen of the map : *\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PL7oi#0\n\nEDIT: Wow i just woke up, thanks guys for those comment it means a lot for us !\n\nUPDATE!\nHi guys, I'm sorry to taking so long to do this map. We want to do so much on the map for this can be perfect, but minecraft can't let us do what we want (thx java). Also one of our friend (redstone guy) have examen and can't help for the moment.\nI'm gonna drop a cinematic video of the map, maybe.\nBye.","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2014-11-25T18:27:09.588+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is amazing.
