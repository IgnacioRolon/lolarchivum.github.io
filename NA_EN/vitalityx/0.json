You might be able to use the legacy client in the meantime as a workaround, though you might still run into issues:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nBe sure to bookmark the service sites for updates!","replies":[]},{"poster":"√êaft","date":"2017-01-13T14:25:01.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.
