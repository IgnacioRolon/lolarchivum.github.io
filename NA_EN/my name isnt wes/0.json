I am welcoming and encouraging your opinions in case i have interpreted the changes wrong. I do not find this update bad, just needs a bit of tweaking.\r\n\r\nLets start off with positives, towers.\r\nI do believe these towers did lessen early roaming potential which was a heavy key of me and my team playing with a support meta, which we rewarded with a kill or two for our comp which would fall off without this early pressure. I think the towers offer defense for ANY laner to get through the early game, even adc&#039;s without supports (I dont think this is right.) This gives junglers even more power to just farm, which is too much power for the power they got just from the jungle changes, which will be discussed next.\r\n\r\nJungle Creeps\r\nExcellent! I love every change to this! Amazing graphics on them finally and junglers have their place in TT (Atleast allot more than before!) The changes make more junglers open to be played and its not a &quot;Pick this or we lose,&quot; situation, although lots of junglers cant gank past the towers we mentioned in the 1st point! All in all, positive feedback, please add Madreds back  {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nVilemaw\r\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, you were in the right direction. Teams with double altar buff and vile were pretty hard to fight, but I feel like Vile takes too long to kill, even after a early game ace, we were not able to kill it quick enough without them coming back, maybe it was too early and our comp didn&#039;t have much damage but still, we got aced and they got it.\r\nSecond of this buff.. Really? The baron buff for vile? This is completely wrong. The pressure these newly buffed minions put is IMMENSE and they are WAYYYYY too tanky for 3 people to clear, and its rare all of them have great waveclear. A simple splitpush will put an end to any game. Simply put, too tanky, damage is fine, and the moving through other units.\r\n\r\nPlease post opinions and comments below and i&#039;ll be sure to reply, really interested in how to play this new map {{champion:74}}","replies":[{"poster":"poodoo","date":"2015-06-12T19:12:13.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing positive, they broke it.","replies":[]}]}
