If youre going to try and make a point, make sure youre at least accurately describing what happened.\n [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STwkWFJGnY&t=29m5s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7STwkWFJGnY&t=29m5s)\n\nWhat do we see? We see a Rumble who blew all his cooldowns to push the wave, who was about 99% to overheat - his entire heat bar was yellow, but he didnt overheat. At that moment, the Ekko wanted to fight - basic principle: if the enemy blows all their cooldowns, they dont have any more tools to fight. So we start the duel with a Rumble who had the last couple ticks of his Flamespitter entering into the fight. When Ekko decides to go for the fight, we see that the Flamespitter was pretty much gone - Ekko took maybe 20 damage from it.  \n\nAt this point, Smeb cant risk using an ability to overheat or else he would be stuck with just autos. So he basically takes free damage until he gets back down to 70 heat, which takes about 3 seconds. During this time, Duke had all the tools available to him to fight - he used his E, landed first part of his Q, landed his W shield, and landed a couple autos for that passive proc. This was basically free damage that chunked Rumble down to 66% health. \n\nSmeb kites Duke with 2 harpoons, and used his shield to overheat. These are the only attacks that Smeb used in the fight - he didnt cast flamethrower again because he was overheated. During this time, Duke E's again and Q's again. Smeb walked away taking basically no damage from the second cast of Duke's E and Q. Duke was at 75% just from the 2 harpoons. \n\n[http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001930052?gameHash=1a9610d23d989190&tab=builds&participant=6](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001930052?gameHash=1a9610d23d989190&tab=builds&participant=6)\n\nFrom Smeb's skill order, we can see at this point in the game he has both his Q and E maxed. Both his E harpoons combined did 435+120% damage. His Q would have done 472.5+150% damage. What does this mean? Smeb, using less than half of his offensive power (outside the ult), was able to hold his own against Duke who basically blew multiple rotations of his abilities (again, aside from the ult). And this was even with Duke getting the jump on Smeb. \n\nThis is not a situation where Ekko is overpowered - this is a situation where Duke knew that Smeb blew his cooldowns and had very low resources and tried to take a favorable fight. We saw that when the shield was up, Rumble basically could tank an entire rotation of Ekko's spells. If Smeb had enough heat to use his Q, E, and W when Ekko first engaged, it wouldnt even have been close. It was only close because Duke knew he had a 2-3 second window where he could get free damage where Smeb couldnt retaliate or or get his shield up. Duke only had this opportunity since Smeb was trying to hardpush the wave so he could fight at baron - if Smeb wasnt so intent on clearing the wave as fast as possible, the fight would have gone differently. \n\nLook at what happened after that fight - Ekko backs off. Why? Because Rumble had his cooldowns and heat back. But when he overheats again, then Ekko goes back in to fight. Thats just great knowledge of toplane matchups by Duke and knowing when he can go in for free harass, especially when he knew that Smeb wanted to hardpush the lane as fast as possible. \n\n_______________________\nAnd i still dont see a situation described by the OP as: \n\n> [{quoted}](name=WookieJesuz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BE4U1LuN,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-22T23:03:33.431+0000)\n>\n>  could still duel the 4-0 rumble and win, then chronoshift out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adriqnohee","date":"2016-10-23T10:59:04.421+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People need to stop looking at how many kills they have, and start look at how much gold they had, just because he was 0/3 doesn't mean he was too far behind, hell depending on how much farm and objectives he had, he could be ahead of rumble, and lets also not forget that Ekko heavily out scales rumble in the late game and the guy was completely outplaying the enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kurthl33t","date":"2016-10-23T01:54:58.481+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"You could nerf tank Ekko.\n\nOR\n\nYou could admit that a champ with a slow, a stun, a shield, a heal, a dash, an escape, and zone control is MAYBE not actually an assassin.
