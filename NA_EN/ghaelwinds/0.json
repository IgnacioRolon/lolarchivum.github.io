What a silver experiences in game, a gold could experience something completely different. \r\n\r\nI frequently have conversations with lower elos players and I would talk about how oppressive someone like akali is and how easy yasuo is in lane. They would have the opposite experience of yasuo taking over games and akali getting stomped in lane. \r\n\r\nThis large disparity is normal for a game that has such a large playerbase as this but then how are we supposed to actually talk about experiential evidence vs hard facts. How a champion is to play against is relatively subjective but is VERY important to think/talk about when discussing if a champion has a good design. So then at what rank should a champions experience be based at? The lowest of bronze-silver where a majority of the player base is or the highest tiers of Master and challenger where few people are but where the competition is most palpable?\r\n\r\n(Note: None of this is to bash any elo, It is merely marking a difference in experience that people in those elos have.)","replies":[{"poster":"Endorcer","date":"2018-01-17T13:55:55.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If somebody gets to master/challenger, chances are that he understands the fundamentals and mechanisms of league. And although their experiences are very different from lower elos, they still know how to counter or play up against certain champions, and they know that that kind of thinking or mechanics or tactics are missing from low elo. Yes, it is completely different due to playstyles and the absolute lack of synergy or compositions or teamplay, but it can still be boiled down to the fundamentals. Low or high elo, the champions and the items, and all the other in-game variables stay  the same.","replies":[{"poster":"GhaelWinds","date":"2018-01-17T17:49:03.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's the crux of the issue. Because while the top tier players do know the right way to deal with them, they are the minority. So then balance is split between majority balance and competitive balance. I'm personally a fan of competitive balance but if you do that then the majority gets screwed over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-01-17T19:44:21.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I don't feel rank should have anything to do with the conversation.  It has the potential to stifle an argument with its me at mention and often seems to raise tempers when it should not.  If we want anything constructive to come from such conversation there should be more effort placed upon why and how each side finds ease or difficulty with each situation presented.","replies":[{"poster":"GhaelWinds","date":"2018-01-17T21:51:09.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So then how do you propose to actually talk about the experience of facing a champion? Or would you prefer to only use statistics and hard facts?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-01-17T22:37:11.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is actually what I would propose we start with.  Asking the individual if they learn better from playing out the situation or researching it.  I personally learn via hands on practice and while I do some research in between games I have trouble recalling that information in the heat of battle.  Some people are the opposite and it's a disservice to not find this sort of thing out first before offering advice.\n\nTo further my point on rank, I feel not knowing anyone's rank or telling anyone your rank is a good way to foster the idea that we are equals in the discussion.  Feeling this way helps place you in a more agreeable mood towards all involved and allows all parties to remain as receptive as they can be for the duration.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShuyinTheX","date":"2018-01-17T13:40:10.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I remember Phreak saying awhile back is that you should only follow the meta and builds based on YOUR elo.\nIf a Bronze player tries to build like a Platinum player, they're going to have a bad time because the Bronze meta is a totally different thing than Platinum meta.\nIt's one thing to copy builds, it's another to do it in the way wrong ranking.","replies":[{"poster":"GhaelWinds","date":"2018-01-17T17:50:27.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, that's something I'm personally running into. I can copy the Comet Camille runes all I want but it doesn't fit my playstyle (I prefer PtA). So while it is statistically worse it is experientially better. Much like the differences in high/low elo.","replies":[]}]}]}
