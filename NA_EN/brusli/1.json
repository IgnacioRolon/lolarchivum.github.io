Like i get  6 games in a row where someone dodges cause they dont have any points to lose or they get lower point losing if they dodge. this people should get banned not a slap and they do it over and over again. If a person is troll picking someone else leaves instead of reporthing that person...so trollers and leavers get away easy...why dont u implement a punish system designed to make them not do that anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-02T16:19:49.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering dodging games is actually an offical Riot advice for dealing with trolls, that really isn't gonna happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EagleOfAlbania","date":"2017-06-02T15:25:21.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention everytime someone dodges you have and increased chance of being autofilled, even if you were in Q and had your role someone dodges and you immediately get back in Q youre then autofilled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-06-02T08:08:56.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If a person is troll picking someone else leaves instead of reporthing that person...so trollers and leavers get away easy...why dont u implement a punish system designed to make them not do that anymore?\n\nI completely agree, but i cant imagine a system that fits this that cant be abused. It isnt the person dodging at fault entirely imo","replies":[]}]}
