I always see yasuos dashing to enemy minions for fun in lane just because it looks cool then they get ganked and have nothing to use because they were being reckless. Or they expect you to play a knockup champ to cater around them and then they end up feeding in lane, just because Nami uses her ult to peel doesnt mean go in with yasuo 1v5 lol!!!!!!!","replies":[]}]}
