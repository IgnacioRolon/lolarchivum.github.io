If you're in communication with your Kallista, that's not an issue because you can coordinate, but if you don't happen to know your Kallista, they can kind of just do whatever they want to you.\r\n\r\nKallista's ult is EXTREMELY disruptive and needs to be heavily coordinated to be effective, otherwise it pulls the tank away from whatever they're doing and messes up the team fight. And you can't say \"no\" to any part of it.\r\n\r\nPlaying a Tank in ARAM with a Kallista usually goes like this for me:\r\n1) Without saying anything, she activates the spear on me while I'm out in front of the tower trying to position for an early kill, effectively stunning me and leaving me vulnerable to attack.\r\n2) Once she hits 6, she pulls me out from tower right before my Demolish goes off, drags me away from their ADC, and generally just doesn't let me do what I need to do in fights.\r\n\r\nI've tried asking to not be bonded, I've tried asking to not be ulted, but in the end my play experience is left up to someone else because there's no way to decline this champion's passive.\r\n\r\nI've had a similar issue with Tahm Kenches who won't let me fight as an ADC, but that's not nearly as big of an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-04-26T23:58:43.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some of you might have missed it, but this thread is in Gameplay.
