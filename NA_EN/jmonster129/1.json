I&#039;m hoping the scaling for the shield makes up for it because for mid lane karma it was the only way to damage the backline and also most likely to proc your passive multiple times at once for insane CD reduction on R, but we&#039;ll see how this works, definitely makes support karma stronger, while not affecting mid lane karma too much other than she will really not be able to hit the backline now, but hopefully with the (hoped) increased e scaling and lower cooldown/mana costs she keep her carries/tanks alive and in good position while waiting to fire off a well sniped RQ\n\n(oh yeah, w on monsters has opened the gates for JUNGLE KARMA, get ready, she is now able to literally go to any lane/position)\n\nEDIT: so im not sure, but i don't think there has been any scaling changes to her shield value which is disappointing, I'm not sure if this how it will end up being but i'll wait and see,\n\nLastly i wanted to emphasize that i am myself a karma Main, currently in Plat 5, and have been playing her since before the rework and have played current karma in all roles, jungle, mid, tanky top, support, and even adc bot/top.","replies":[]}
