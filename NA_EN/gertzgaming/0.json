In an effort to rule this out as a possible root cause, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!  It has some of the most common solutions that should resolve this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"GertzGaming","date":"2016-06-22T05:49:24.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ISP's DNS server returns IP addresses even for domain names which should not resolve. Instead of an error, the DNS server returns an address of 92.242.140.2, which resolves to unallocated.barefruit.co.uk. You can inspect the resulting HTML content here.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for this behavior. The most likely cause is that the ISP is attempting to profit from customer's typos by presenting advertisements in response to bad requests, but it could also be due to an error or misconfiguration in the DNS server.\n\nThe big problem with this behavior is that it can potentially break any network application which relies on DNS properly returning an error when a name does not exist.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-22T20:56:17.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you ran some tests to help figure out how your connection is doing.
