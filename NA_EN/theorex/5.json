Fighters/Skrimishers/Divers/etc shouldn&#039;t have 40% at 2 items.  That is part of the reason why the game state is so fast.  Removing CDR from everyone&#039;s build paths opens up more power budgeting.\r\n\r\nThe items with CDR being:  Zhonya&#039;s, Banshee&#039;s, Mikeal&#039;s, Redemption, Knight&#039;s Vow, Spirit Visage, and Righteous Glory.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning is, literally everyone has their spells up after recalling and coming back to lane.  Everyone can spam spells super quickly and clear waves or poke you out of lane for the fun of it.\r\n\r\nCDR shouldn&#039;t be on every single first time in the game.\r\n\r\nBlack Cleaver, Seraphs, Ludens, Triforce, etc.\r\n\r\n2:  Dragons being reverted back to Gold Dragons instead of Stat Dragons.  \r\n\r\nDragons add way too much variable into the game.  Say that you&#039;re team &quot;in a organized setting&quot; goes for a longer game where you win late game.  But the enemy team picks up 3 infernal drakes because you can&#039;t fight them while scaling.  Your whole draft is thrown out the window.  You now loss the early game and potentially the late game as well, because they get 24% more AD/AP.  So a normal 800 AP mage is now at +192AP.  Which for most mages with a 50-70% AP ratio adds 100-140 damage.  \r\n\r\n3:  Damage and Tankiness, both are way too high.  \r\n\r\nThese are because of each other.  \r\n\r\nTankiness was brought up because tanks were dying too quickly to feel impactful.  Then when they stopped dying instantly the damage carries couldn&#039;t carry and &quot;felt&quot; useless.  So the damage was upped.  Repeat until now.  \r\n\r\nAlmost everything needs a 20-35% reduction.  Everything should take between 20-35% longer to kill.  From Squishies to Tanks.  Look back at point one, that is a good starting grounds.  \r\n\r\n4:  Objectives.\r\n\r\nAre all set to make sure games end fast in Pro Play, while having the adverse affect.  While in Solo Queue, they are compiled effects.\r\n\r\nA:  Turrets need more HP, and higher rate of fire when on champions.  \r\nB:  We can leave herald and baron as is, if Turrets are more lethal to champions and take 10-15 seconds longer to kill for 2 champions together.\r\n\r\n5:  The end to the stupid mechanics/gimmicky spells that are continuously added to new champions.\r\n\r\nSuch as but not limited to.\r\n\r\nIrelia:  Disarm.\r\nZoe:  Free Summoners\r\nPyke:  Shared Gold\r\nEtc.","replies":[]}
