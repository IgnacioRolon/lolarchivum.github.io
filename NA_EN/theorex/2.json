But I noticed after patch I am more consistently getting \"clear direction\" on what to build for a few rounds, then suddenly the game stops letting me build that or any related direction and will totally swap out what I should be building.  \n\nFor example: It might be void/wild heavy rolls for me until the 2nd carousel, then suddenly--even if no one is out yet--all I see for a long time is nobles and nothing that relates to what I have been building.  Then if I start backup building into what the game is giving me (or not), I will go through a third wave where all I see are, let's say gunslingers and pirates.  \n\nYou basically get whatever it gives you, and if you're building that direction and no one else is hogging your resources, you see more of that.  But if people aren't building correctly and they have a salad bar on their backline, then it seems like you get a saladbar on your backline, and all you can do is hang on until other people lose so you can hopefully farm a refreshed (albeit lower drop rate since those cards are old now) inventory of something you have already been trying to put into place for 10 matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-19T12:00:29.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They TELL you that there's 39 of each 1-cost unit.  I've had dozens of games where it's impossible to find a single \"Champion Name Here\" even after rerolling literally over a hundred gold (at level 5-6, so there's still a good chance of getting tier 1 units).  During those times, there were only 2-4 of that specific unit on everyone else's board combined.  If you do that math on that, it should be freakishly rare, yet I get a game like that maybe every 4.\n\n**What I know:** There's more going on behind the scenes that they aren't telling us about.\n**What I don't know:** exactly **WHAT** is going on behind the scenes that they aren't telling us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PikemanDim","date":"2019-07-19T07:24:28.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did some searching on this awhile ago and found this.
