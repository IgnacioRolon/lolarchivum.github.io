I was going to buy Mafia Jinx/Jinx at 70% off only to find it updated with Firecracker Jinx/Jinx. I believe ( but am not sure that ) the resets are intentional. When I tried to buy the updated Jinx set though I found the shop had an error with the Jinx skin and other skins were still able to be purchased.
