Before the removal of armor pen, I would use hpen runes on supports like sona, janna, and karma. I&#039;m aware that lethality is stronger late than early, so this will diminish the power of early game auto attacks, right? Should I be swapping out my hybrid pen runes for magic pen to maximize my early &amp; late game whilst increasing my lane dominance? It seems like this would be the way to go, considering the fact that I won&#039;t necessarily be poking with autos very often in the late game as a support. Is there any scenario in which lethality would be better on supports than magic pen? Just doesn&#039;t seem like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-11-09T15:39:16.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am mostly joking, but you could buy yourself a dusk blade on a roaming support like a bard.\n\nIf you did, the hybrid pen would increase the proc damage a bit. The out of combat speed is useful, and the blackout passive is nice for clearing vision. \n\nBut then again, support budgets =(","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-11-09T17:44:45.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh shit, \nI play bard, \nthis shit is hilarious. \nand maybe also effective.\nmust try.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Painguin Parn","date":"2016-11-09T17:41:16.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It scales with the enemy level, not yours, so it'll still be some relevant despite the fact that supports level slower than everyone else","replies":[]},{"poster":"Restless Slumber","date":"2016-11-09T16:10:32.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just go armor reds and hp/lvl yellows.
