(TL;DR at the bottom, if you don&#039;t like reading)\r\nIn my opinion, {{item:3089}}  Is an unhealthy item because it provides to much of a champions total AP.\r\n\r\nIf you have 300 AP then build a Death Cap you have  537 AP, that Deathcap is 47% of your AP.\r\nIf you have 400 AP then build a Death Cap you have  702 AP, that Deathcap is 43% of your AP.\r\nIf you have 500 AP then build a Death Cap you have  837 AP, that Deathcap is 40% of your AP.\r\n\r\nWhy should one item be 40% of your power? this makes it mandatory to build, if you plan on building any notable amount of AP.\r\n\r\nThis means that AP champions only really have 4 items slots to customize their build (assuming you get boots) rather than 5, making their builds pretty stale.\r\n\r\nIt also hurts Hybrid builds as its usually much better to just go AD if you don&#039;t plan on getting a DeathCap but its better to just go AP if you invest in one.\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be to just give all other AP items a small increase and  remove DeathCap all together or just turn it  into a flat AP item (maybe like 160). This way, you get 5 items to chose from, but still have enough AP to actually do stuff. Hybrid builds or buying a single AP item on a tank or support could now work.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Remove DeathCap, give all other AP items a small increase.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-11-15T21:36:53.794+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Deathcap was removed, Riot would need to adjust every mage's AP ratios. Do you know why mages tend to have, on average, 60-90% AP ratios, while AD casters tend to have bonus AD ratios that surpasses 120 bonus AD sometimes?\n\nIt is because in the end, AP champions will usually end up having more than 600 or 700 AP, sometimes much more than that. While an AD caster on average will have only 200 bonus AD on average and rarely they will have 300 bonus AD. Note that I am not counting base AD, generally AD casters have spells that scale only with bonus AD.\n\nTo balance out, AD casters need to have higher bonus AD ratios, when compared to AP champions' AP ratios.\n\nIf Deathcap was removed, they would probably need to adjust and increase all AP ratios because you would not be able to get more than 600 AP on average and it would be difficult to even get 500. \n\nAlso, this is the same reason why AD casters don't have an Deathcap of their own.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-11-15T22:20:31.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be amazing.

Damage remains about the same, but all Mages are now either tankier or pack greater utility.  This would be a universal Mage buff.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-11-19T22:18:52.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additionally, everyone would have access to the increased ratios from the get-go.
