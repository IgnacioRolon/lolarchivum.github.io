Because the mute did not change who they were, they still *need* to express their discontent. Now, because they're muted, the only way to do that is through trolling. Perm mutes turn ragers into trolls, which is not the goal.\n\nThe goal is to reform people or get them to leave the game.","replies":[{"poster":"p3rmaban1nc","date":"2017-09-17T22:20:04.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just make a new account, /mute all and troll the hell out of games.

If you are reformed, you can make a new account and play on that, but your old account will not be unbanned.\n\nAlso, Riot has already tried something similar to permanent chat restrictions in the past with infinitely stacking chat restrictions, with many players reaching hundreds and even thousands of chat restricted games. They found that the majority of players that reached that point simply resorted to other forms of toxicity, like trolling/intentionally feeding, that can be harder to detect. I'm not saying that you personally would do this, but based on past data, Riot has found that permanent chat restrictions simply don't work very well.","replies":[]}]}
