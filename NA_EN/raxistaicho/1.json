People from the Winter's Claw (esp Iceborn) have very different ideas about how a person should die than we might.     For Olaf-- \"dying with his eyes open\" would be a great honor.  --Thus ironically he can only get the lamb's death in battle -- fighting to his last breath.","replies":[{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-08-10T20:59:26.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always felt that Olaf (and most Winter's Claw people) would run from death, but not out of fear.

The whole point of a prophacy is you really cant steer from it. Its clear Olaf path, even if it seems to go against his prophecy, is actually all according to how his life is ment to be like. No matter what he will not die until his time when he is old and gray, not from epic beast or such. Lamb and Wolf care not HOW someone dies but in the end when they do if they accept it or not, which he is more than willing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-08-08T18:23:41.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He gets Lamb because when he finally does die, he will accept it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2016-08-11T03:36:04.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-08-11T03:26:24.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always felt that Olaf (and most Winter's Claw people) would run from death, but not out of fear.
