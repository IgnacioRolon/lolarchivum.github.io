Always assumed Yorick was just using a shovel, even after the rework. It's genius honestly -- monk spades are used to bury any corpses that monks find along their path, along with helping to keep wild animals (in this case, wild undead) at bay, which fits Yorick's character super well while still resembling and respecting the old shovel design. Awesome!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tribbles Foxfolk","date":"2017-06-24T21:28:11.454+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sound design in general for League is almost flawless.
