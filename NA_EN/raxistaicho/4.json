I'm only looking at the set of melee ADs, which is the relevant set here and that makes the total 14 of 36 characters being pure or mostly pure casters or 38.9%. Only 10 of 36 are pure or close to pure AA champs, or 27.8%.\n\n>Both Irelia's theme and her gameplay - a telekinetic blade wielding warrior - have strong leanings towards reworking her towards an AD-caster playstyle.\n\nMaybe her theme leads this way (I'd make arguments to the contrary) but her gameplay certainly doesn't. In terms of gameplay she's an auto attack centric bruiser. Any rework which ignored this fact would be a terrible rework. Irelia has a fan base and the fan base she has expects her to play like Irelia, not like some randomly sown together caster.\n\n>she can't ever be strong otherwise she spirals out of control and can facetank teams while insta-gibbing carries.\n\nThis is endemic of casters. If you look at casters like Renekton and Darius they will often fall into this pattern. Characters like Irelia and Jax tend not to unless there's an immensely broken item. Normally they will take several AAs to kill a target giving them and their team far more reaction time. \n\nMaking Irelia a caster would make her more likely to fit this definition.\n\n>I'd welcome a chance to see Irelia in her full bladed glory.\n\nYou don't even have a single game of Irelia on your OP.GG, why do you care?","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2016-05-21T17:28:44.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia's original design intentions really didn't have her set to be a heavy auto-attacker.

It could be more interesting? Sure. But resistance to CC is a valuable tool if it can be used.\n\nJax and perhaps Lucian are only others that really falls in this same group of super high synergy with Trinity in both attack speed and sheen procs based on how they are usually played. With a few others like Xin, Fiora, Ezreal and Vi having potentially similar aspects but not having the short enough comedowns to make sheen procs nearly as much of a focus point or not nearly as much of a value put on attack speed for on hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2016-05-21T19:33:07.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Irelia Bot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pvy7aELw,comment-id=00010005000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-05-21T17:46:47.186+0000)\n>\n> Is it the play style of a champ that defines a champ or the supposed theme of the champ that defines the champ.\n> \n Fiora is a pretty good example of a champion that had an older kit that really didn't translate itself well into representing the playstyle of a fencer. She went from being a burst assassin highly reliant on quickly executing a combo, like Talon or Zed, to a melee hypercarry reliant on passive procs, AA resets and more sustained engages. I would agree that weaving Sheen procs is a very important part of Irelia's kit, and one of her best expression of player skill, and I think there's room to explore that if her kit relied on sustained telekinetic blade strikes. Truth by told I'm surprised there just isn't that much range in her kit to begin with - you'd think her R wouldn't be her only means of catching someone at a distance. \n\nAs for the Tenacity, right now it's extremely binary - makes her impossible to deal with for champions reliant on cc and inconsequential against characters that don't. It's also a great deal of invisible power that doesn't have good readability in game. Conditional tenacity effects have had a lot of success (Alistair's and Olaf's ults, Eve and Garen's mobility) and I think her tenacity could be placed in her Hiten style skill in favour of giving her a more interesting and engaging passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-05-21T19:47:31.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora had some rather bad issues mainly due to her old ult having no real counterplay, Riposte beign basically worthless against a number of situations and overall kit feeing like it failed to work together all that well.\n\nOnce her old ult was going there was nothing you could do to stop it or react to it. You could not have a janna ult or Ali Headbutt interrupt it.\n\nIn that Fiora needed some real changes to her kit and displayed issues that Riot considered important enough to move her rework up above a lot of older champs. Her new Kit is far healthier and addressed at least to some degree the issues she had. She is not perfect but far better. \n\nWhile Irelia might have some issues she is not displaying a lack of things you can do against her when she is even or a bit ahead.

If you look at what she's building in her [champion spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFcsOX9xcIo) she has a Youmuu's and old Stark's, both of which were AS items. \n\nThe game was fundamentally different when Irelia launched. AD casters weren't a thing, If you were an AD champ you were an auto attacker. Riot's only real foray into an AD caster up to that point was Pantheon, but he was just built Triforce>Ghostblade and played as a sort of soft AAer because there weren't better options. AD casters didn't really start being a thing until Riven's release, almost a year after Irelia's.\n\n>It's all great and fine that Irelia uses auto-attacks to kill a target, but I'd argue the most fun aspects of her kit lie in her Q and R since they both exemplify high moments of gameplay and visceral displays of power.\n\nI actually enjoy chase-down and auto attack styles far more than casters. For the most part I've found casters to have very bland \"mash all the keys\" styles. I don't know why this style is so prevalent amongst AD casters, it's not in mages but it seems like almost every AD caster plays this way. The only two exceptions I've found are Riv and GP, but I just don't enjoy GP's barrel chaining so that leaves Riven as the only AD caster I enjoy.\n\nIf you don't like AA centric champions that's fine, don't play them. Don't call for them to be changed into casters just because you don't enjoy them, because other people do.\n\n>As an Irelia player, do you have ideas that could improve her instead of attacking someone who sincerely wishes for her to be better?\n\nShe doesn't need that much. All she'd actually need is passive changes. I'd agree that her passive probably isn't that great for the game, but nothing else on her kit is really bad, I actually think she has quite a good kit considering it's 5 and a half years old. It probably is the best kit from her time by quite a long way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-05-21T09:20:15.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:41}}  {{champion:120}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:86}}\n{{champion:104}} (raw AD/armor pen build)\n{{champion:56}} (AD/armor pen build)\n{{champion:150}} (mega)\ncan all be considered AD casters.

This is often stratagies such as picking on a weak early game or forcing a champ who can't splitpush into a splitpush scenario. Irelia and Jax have far more counterplay than Fiora and Yasuo.\n\nOutplay potential is the ability to beat a champ with mechanical proficiency. This isn't actually counterplay as when the champion plays well you cannot outplay them. High outplay actually correlates to low counterplay, champs like Zed, Lee and Fiora actually don't have high counterplay because your only option to play against them is to be a better player, you can't pick on strategical weaknesses because these champs are just too well rounded and can play too many strategical roles.\n\nI'd also argue Yas and especially Fiora aren't AA based. Yas's damage is as much from his Q as his AAs and Fiora is heavily reliant on her Q. I'd consider them both to be hybrid AA/Casters.\n\n>She'd be much, much more likely to succeed as an AD caster because that design is inherently less offensive.\n\nIs it? Last I checked people often complain about champs like Riven, Lee Sin, Renekton, GP and Darius when they're strong.

She'll always be at odds with her character if she's based on autos.\n\nIt's better for Irelia to be at odds with her theme than at odds with her player base. The simple fact is that Irelia players enjoy her as an auto attack based bruiser, you can't just ignore that when suggesting rework ideas.\n\nYou're a Sona main so I'll put this in a way you can understand. It's kind of like if the community started saying Sona should be balanced around being a midlaner. From a mechanical standpoint it makes sense, Sona's current kit is closer to a strong fit for mid than support, if her Q had an AOE splash ala Karma so she could wave control she'd be a pretty good mid and they'd be reasons to pick her which are currently somewhat lacking.\n\nIt's also a complete bastardisation of what Sona should be. In my case I'm bastardising Sona from a thematical standpoint while being consistent in a mechanical standpoint (she still plays the exact same), you're bastardising Irelia from mechanical standpoint (she plays completely differently) whilst being fair from a thematical standpoint. Both of these are terrible for the players of the champ.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zeta","date":"2016-05-21T03:57:09.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's main issues with her they discussed about a year or two ago.

Her ult is unique but it looks soo anti-climatic. Maybe make it similar to Syndra's R or make it work of a charge system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kyrrion","date":"2016-05-21T17:42:34.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pvy7aELw,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-21T01:41:31.507+0000)\n>\n> Here&#x27;s where we&#x27;re up to with Irelia:\n> \n> &quot;Maybe we should do a full update on Irelia someday?

He was over nerfed back then.\n\nThe biggest potential issue I am seeing with new trintiy is likely too much CDR potentially making it too strong.\n\nDo you know if Movement speed has ever been considered to replaced the CDR on Sheen?
