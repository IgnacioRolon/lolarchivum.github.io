How is that in any way shape or form balanced?\n\nShe's also been nerfed across the board significantly in every way to the point Kindred OTPS have to abuse rune and mastery gimmicks just to even be acknowledged. How is that balanced? \n\nKindred players have to have countless games on her just to even compete with a basic FOTM jungle player. How is that balanced?\n\nKindred starts, continues, and finishes behind the enemy jungler regardless of how far ahead she somehow miraculously gets. How is that balanced?\n\nKindred can single handedly lose a game based off of RNG first mark spawn. How is that balanced?\n\nKindred can single handedly go an entire game without getting a mark if the camp double raptor procs due to the nature of how jungle clearing + levels work. How is that balanced? \n\nHer current winrate in NA is being held up by me and like 15 players in diamond and we're all Kindred players with hundreds upon hundreds of games on her. If a champion being balanced is only being playable by an extremely small hand full of players I'd argue that's not balanced. \n\nWhatever, I guess you better go buff Graves since LCS is coming up.

IT took players all of a hand full of games to counter it, and now she's back in the dumpster again x3.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/tSEg7/1e723cd88c.png\n\nThat's the creator of the gimmick.  It got him to masters but now that everyone knows how to beat, I'd argue it's even easier to shut down than former Kindred because if you get invaded with your Q down you're done. \n\nAdditionally, I wouldn't doubt it, but the sad reality is . . . Moon didn't even perform that well on her. In fact Reignover gave an exact demonstration of what any jungler does to you if you think you're cheeky and level 3 gank with your jungle open.\n\nAnd I know people are going to reference his KDA, but here's the thing.  He was consistently really far down in CS + had a very solid comp and just picking low health people off. He really wasn't doing that much damage, in fact Reksai was 1v1ing her the entire game which shouldn't happen at all except level 3-5-6ish unless you're really far behind.  But the 5 armor nerf got rid of that.  If anything, the game should have shown she needs a buff, but instead people are just going to go \"Well, Kindred got a few kills using an extremely unheard of gimmicky set up to cheese people before they're used to it, so clearly the're _balanced_.  When in reality, it shows the avg Kindred player is always behind other players regardless of how well she does simply because she's undertuned.

Once the meta swings back around and damage goes down I think Kindred will be a lot better.\n\nThe meta won't shift downwards though. In fact it gets faster every year because people won't stop stroking themselves to Korea ((Whose been proving time and time and time and time again that they are not, as a server, blatantly better than any other server)) They are just an extremely lane dominant, super fast paced, early game style meta server. Their mid and late game is actually super atrocious, and they are some of the most toxic little human beings on the face of the planet. Unfortunately, like the katana, another super hyped up asian thing for absolutely no reason . . . we're going to continue copying their extremely fast paced gameplay which revolves around them  playing in cafe's instead of at home. So, the meta will always be fast unless Riot intentionally over powers other champions for absolutely no reason and nerfs offensive items + buffs tank items even further to the point Cinderhulk is the best jungling item in the game.  ((it's really good, but they're all balanced right now. A tank jungle meta implies cinderhulk is usually over powered.))\n\nYou can tell this is the case because the current lethality builds adcs are building because of KR. Even in master/challenger you see people just spamming lethality builds, even when extremely behind fighting 5 tanks because ((KR does it, so it's obv the best build.)) When the KR build is exclusively to snowball and end in 25 while you're so far ahead you don't even need crit, but this is heavily countered by mid/late game tanks and people don't understand that crit with dominiks is actually the tank killer, not lethality. \n\n\n I guess what I'm trying to say is in order for Kindred ((in her current state)) to be relevant the meta would have to slow down considerably to the point if she goes for her first mark . . . her entire opposing side jungle won't fucking disappear by the time she gets over there + dies anyways, and since clear speeds have only increased  further and further to the point Kindred has to use an hilarious amount of attack speed just to even come close to the other junglers . . . and only on 3 camps. I don't foresee it ever slowing down.\n\n I foresee it actually getting faster and faster and faster, and Kindred growing more and more weaker.  I know Kindred players are looking forward to the \"vanguard update\" MM juicy tanks for Kindred to kill amirite?  What's actually going to happen is they're probably going to be over powered and run her down all game long after the massive assassin update flop where only two champs came out relevant and the rest were tossed into the trash can. \n\nAnd this makes me sad because she's one of my 3 favorite designs, and I know my ELO is basically being held back because I play her =(. If you don't believe me, take a look at Graves winrates on LoLskill compared to Kindred. He's considered balanced btw.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"V The Support V","date":"2017-02-07T15:13:37.270+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"_CRINGE_\n\nThey , Them, Their, They're*","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2017-02-07T16:21:04.505+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"The particle effect doesn't count as a person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frank Ocean","date":"2017-02-07T17:49:56.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That doesn't make any of their points less relevant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr Manly","date":"2017-02-07T18:21:53.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Preach brother !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yadid","date":"2017-02-07T05:38:05.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Semi-curious.

However I'm sure that'll clear up as more champions get put into line with the reworks Riot pushes out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReZisT Lust","date":"2017-02-07T10:28:09.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance Sols Q can scale with distance but cost hp since it hurts him to blow up stars?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2017-02-07T05:49:01.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come no planned changes for Kindred?

It was regarding aurelion's rework.\n\nHow about other champions that are in similar situations (e.g. Kindred)?\n\nAnd Riot Axes replied:\n\nI don't think Kindred's in a similar situation. They were faring pretty well before preseason - niche but pretty strong - but seem to have been hit pretty hard by the jungle changes. We'll likely do a balance pass on them once the jungle is a bit more stable (or sooner if that takes too long), and that might involve some small mechanics changes to get them feeling better about itemization or something like that, but I don't think we'd do any major work on their abilities in the near future.\n\nSo You are not going to make them playable again? I thought that jungle is now stable and we can expect something... And tell me how 33 % win ratio among pros (probuilds) makes You think it's not an underpowered champion. Clear is slow and mana costs are way too high because of the time You need to spend on clearing camps. I want to see kindred in the LCS again in a winning matchup. Since 6.13 they are absolutely forgotten among pros as they have no reason to pick them. Graves does everything kindred could do much better, being tankier and having better clear. I hate Your approach towards the Eternal Hunters left in the Eternal dumpster and I have no idea why do You refuse to work on them with all Kindred players telling You that their main is weak and almost unplayable. Dedicated mains (of any champion) usually have about 65% win rate. Kindred OTP's can't even make it to 60%... How is that fair? If this is balanced then give Kindred difficulity of 10...","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2017-02-07T15:17:40.145+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can you explain how you think Kindred is in a balanced spot? I never see them played in LCS nor in lower divisions. Their win rate is below average and they seems like a champion that has a fairly high skill cap without the payoff for mastering the kit. To the average player, it appears that they are weak. I would argue that Graves, an ADC not even designed to be a jungler, is significantly better than Kindred right now at both the jungle and ADC position.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Àhrí","date":"2017-02-07T15:21:14.723+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VcNZ7TEh,comment-id=000100020000,timestamp=2017-02-07T07:17:54.817+0000)\n>\n> Particle work, probably a bit of character animation and sound. \n> \n> We think Kindred&#x27;s in a pretty balanced spot power wise.

They feel terrible compared to their release state. It feels like your passive really limits your options as to what items you are supposed to build and forces some wierd itemisation choices. Their early game just isn't there anymore, their late game isn't really a thing, the Fervor change hit them hard and to top it off, camps now take longer to respawn so can't claim your stacks as easily. Not to mention, you can't really claim your stacks anyway, since there are so many of their natural predators out there. Furthermore, her ult is a great counter to assassins and divers and this should have been their time in the spotlight, but they are in such a disappointing state. It would be very nice if the Mark hunt wasn't so mandatory and if you could itemise for AD without feeling bad about it.
