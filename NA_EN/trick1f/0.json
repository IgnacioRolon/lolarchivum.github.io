Sadly, this is what online games are like.

In Warframe, you can get a group of friends together and never leave spawn, making it impossible for the other person to leave (this actually happened to me. I got a freaking Tranquil Cleave (a very rare item) from that mission and I couldn't get it because the other three just walked around the spawn room).
