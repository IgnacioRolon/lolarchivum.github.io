Besides which, there are queue wait timers, loading screen wait timers, death timers, COOL DOWN timers, champ select timers......there are only so many timers I can fap to.

You can use items, masteries, abilities and runes to accomplish this.\n- To show that you know how to last hit and can accumulate a decent creep score when uncontested.\n\n2) Place at least 9 wards in the first 20 minutes to simulate keeping vision for your lane.\n-To show that you know how to work with your Jungler as well as keep an eye out for possible enemy Junglers or roaming ganks.\n\n3) Demonstrate proper usage of Enemies Missing, Requires Assistance and Targeting Pings at different check points in the game.\n-To show that you know how to properly communicate with your team in a way that is objective and informative.\n\n4) Avoid dying more than 6 times throughout the course of the entire game. \n-To show that you know how to protect yourself, play safely when needed and otherwise not constantly feed the enemy team.\n\nI know I would love to have this kind of system in place for players like myself.
