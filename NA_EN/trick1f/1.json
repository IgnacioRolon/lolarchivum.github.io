Not one, but three or four bad ults from Core, and the game was just....torture to watch. Anyways, calling it the worst game of the spring split now.

Gravity attempted to engage then poke to death after getting Dig to sub 50% (to get objectives)\nDig's comp countered that at every turn. The only reason Gravity won was because of out-rotations, some engages that worked, and overall safer play.\n\nWhile this game wasn't an exciting bloodbath like most of the LCS games, it shouldn't be considered a bad game. Just different than the norm. And also, it wasn't even the longest game of the LCS (See 63:51 EL vs Roc)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trick1F","date":"2015-01-31T21:46:53.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kobe and Riv were considering seppuku.
