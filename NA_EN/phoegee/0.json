The first was with a kassadin that had zhonyas.  The second was a lux with a zhonyas.  The kass was able to rift walk right out of the silence and the lux was able to flash out of it.  Occurred on NA with the reaper soraka skin (if that has anything to do with it).","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-02-27T22:12:26.539+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report. This one's been a long running bug that we think we've just tracked down the cause of.

I'll pass mention onto the designer who did the changes to Zilean's Q a while back though, so if he's able to identify what's going on there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-02-28T13:00:47.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't that just the frame for the \"is in silence zone\" check being too big, allowing people to flash out?
