The only way to fix this is to quit and rejoin the game. The weird thing is my ms is at 80 and FPS 130. This issue affects all devices (three) on my network, and doesn&#039;t affect them on any other networks. Another issue, other online games I play ( such as Arma III, The Forest Online, and Dead by Daylight) do NOT have the same problem. I have tried the basic troubleshooting, and it has not helped. It is clear it has something to do with my network, but even through multiple league patches it has not been fixed. \n\nThanks for the help\n\nEDIT: I can also see others move/attack and type in chat. I am just unable to attack and move, but can type in chat ","replies":[{"poster":"Curious Kat","date":"2018-07-05T06:37:25.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same exact issue, it's not a internet problem on my end i know that for sure. I use a wired connection, nighthawk router, internet is fully capable of multiple tabs and downloads, and yet it's happening when i have absolutely nothing else open or on besides my PC. I figured oh it was the ps4 downloading something or a update for my phone or something and no, it was not.\n\nNo idea what is going on, but it's gotten me killed multiple times now. Never had an issue with this until a few days ago. I don't have to leave the match or anything, i just can't move all of a sudden clicky clicky clicky and nothing happens meanwhile everything is still able to move around me lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Męöw","date":"2018-07-05T22:33:12.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another weird thing I added in the edit Is I can also see everything else and still type in chat, abilities just don't work for me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-04T23:42:43.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What sort of LAN hardware and config do you have?","replies":[{"poster":"Męöw","date":"2018-07-05T00:53:33.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My router is an Actiontec GT784WN-01, if that's what you are asking.
