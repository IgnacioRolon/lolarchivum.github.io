He has nerfed so much that by the time world's began he was not picked barely ever. Have you seen him in group stages doing well? No he was 33% win rate.\r\n\r\nHe didn't shake the meta up nor was he a \"surprise\" to anyone. since every rework you do is absurdly overpowered at their conception which was around the start of worlds; and by the end of it has been nerfed to oblivion. He fits no bill that previous victorious skins typically fill.\r\n\r\nSome Victorious skins make sense, Graves, Maokai, Sivir all made their mark on their seasons. Aatrox? Honestly I forgot he existed... pretty much same as pre-rework Aatrox, that honestly at this point I prefer his old version, was fun to play. \r\n\r\nOff the top of my head a pick that didn't seem as obvious, hasn't been picked in worlds very often before, and is doing quite well in Nautilus. In fact he hasn't been buffed since 9.8, meaning his success right now is because of the need for him in the meta not because you absurdly buffed him right before worlds. Plus he doesn't have a skin that looks EXACTLY like the Victorious skin theme already and lacks any really good skin and *ahem* doesn't already have like, a prestige skin already...\r\n\r\nOr I don't know, Gragas? 66% win rate in worlds with a 29% play rate, with a nerf in 9.11 and last real buff not **since patch 8.7**. Not only that, when a Gragas does do well, its usually because of an amazing ultimate that is actually really hype in a worlds scene. \r\n\r\nBut no. Aatrox \"victorious skin\". Something tells me that in the final worlds match Aatrox won't even be played. But I am willing to bet we'll see a Gragas or Nautilus, played by the best of the best with some actual hype plays.\r\n\r\nSo while everyone *rightfully* is bagging the design of Victorious Aatrox, even if it did look absolutely amazing I do not think Aatrox is a good pick at all for the Victorious skin line, and honestly I'm a bit appalled that you'd waste it like this. Especially when skins like Victorious Elise, Sivir, Maokai, and Graves actually look really nice and I enjoy playing them even if they aren't my favorite champs.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-10-25T06:28:00.597+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot wants to assure us that his rework was worth the money they wasted on him. \n\nToo bad it doesn't fucking work at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Koiyaki","date":"2019-10-25T07:49:56.128+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"they choose the victorious skin around spring/summer ish. aka when he was still pick/ban worthy. he had a huge presence for more than half the season...thats why he was giutted.\n\nso its a feeld bad now, but thats just how the cookie crumbles.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-10-25T15:18:47.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's in Spring","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrEnds","date":"2019-10-25T12:06:35.735+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Some Victorious skins make sense, Graves, Maokai, Sivir all made their mark on their seasons.

If you really wanted to be an autoattack based drain tank go play olaf.\n\nno reason to call him a moron for having a opinion. everyone is entitled to thier opinion and a LOT of players feel the way he feels about reworks. There are people who probably enjoyed the shit out of old Diplomatic Immunity Poppy that are completely turned off by nuTank bruiser poppy. There are also people who probably really enjoyed old wonky Sion with his 100% lifesteal nonsense or full AP EYE LASER gameplay. I've met a TON of people who wish release Graves would come back when he was played bot and just lept in your face w buckshot and collat damage. Hell man I PERSONALLY enjoyed Blade Waltz Fiora {{champion:114}}  more than her current rework. While it does have a lot more things going on, tons more skill expression and a pretty satisfying minigame to me personally it just comes off as more complicated and worseoff Master Yi. the kit is all style no actual substance in terms of what it brings to the table. I find her rework very self-defeating in a lot of ways (cant teamfight,meh tier splitting, not that good of a diver, doesnt have the juggernaut tier 1v3 power, actually kinda sucks against tanks because by the time her passive has scaled enough to be relevant against them it will be teamfight phase where a tank is far more effective than you) and every time I lock in Fiora I just end up wishing I hadnt at the loss screen 30 minutes later(im also just a super huge fan of the Omnislash ability. Juggernaut, Kharazim and Swiftblade were my favorite heroes in other games due to this). I completely understand that this guy might not like nuAatrox especially in his current victimized state (thanks proplay!).\n\nMy point is Its perfectly fine to lament changes to a champion but I think whats important is to  understand WHY the rework happened, cope with the loss and then move on. also you apologize that young man .","replies":[{"poster":"LightswornLance","date":"2019-10-26T09:42:10.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's how lane bullies work.

He sucks balls.","replies":[{"poster":"LightswornLance","date":"2019-10-26T10:19:05.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, lets look at the reason why Aatrox was such a high priority pick and a \"problem\".\n\n1. He is first pickable and blind pickable.\n2. He lanes fine against ranged.\n3. He can get lane priority early on in the game.\n4. He is one of the now dying race of snowballing top laners.\n5. He has a high skill cap and potentially very high damage.\n\nAatrox not having any actual big counter match ups is one of the things that made him strong, thus they tried to introduce Kled as one of his counters by adding a 60% grievous wounds to his pull. However this really didn't change anything. Also he isn't able to be abused by ranged which is insanely important because this is a meta where Karma was commonly picked top lane. Aatrox being able to get lane priority ( can clear waves fast ) is very important in pro play for many reasons. Him being a snowballing top laner is also important to his identity because it makes him incontestable in both side lanes and team fights. After Aatrox's gut Renekton has taken his place, as they share many things. Mainly points 4 and 3. Point 5 just means that he is going to be more effective in pro play than in solo que due to the skill it takes to unlock all of his damage.\n\nAatrox being a snowballing top laner is probably the main thing that made him strong in pro play. It basically allows you to play off your top lane rather than your bot lane. However in clown fiesta solo que people just play for themselves so this isn't relevant. IMO Aatrox wasn't a big balance problem at all, he just has things other champions SHOULD have. Aatrox and Renekton seriously shouldn't be the only good team fighting top laners. In season 10 they plan on giving top laners more EXP and they think it will help them carry, but it truely is the CHAMPIONS that are holding top laners back from being able to carry. There is only a single real scaling top laner and it is Jax. And Jax is insanely strong ATM for carrying games. Abusing him is how most of the top laners that are in challenger got to challenger. People talk about \"how does top lane have no influence if TFBlade can get rank one\" its because of Jax.\n\nWe don't need to nerf Aatrox, we need to rework the other top laners.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Volcano","date":"2019-10-25T05:40:51.897+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"They pick it sometime in spring and he was performing well around that time.","replies":[{"poster":"Kiwi Lemonade","date":"2019-10-25T10:09:07.899+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's sad considering the quality of the skin is truly truly bad.

Quick notes:\n\n1. P: No longer reduces healing/shielding by 40%, 25% healing off minions rather than 100%\\*, now reduces Q's CD on auto and tipping.\n2. E: Single charge, removed AD steroid, longer CD\\*, more sustain.\n3.

He was highly volatile in the summer split because he was a super safe top-laner that had great sustain, a get-out-gank free card via revive before and post 9.9 and easily proc'd the over-tuned Conqueror's rune. He was THE champion to be abused by pros and in soloQ. I can't think or remember a time Aatrox during the pro scene actually did something cool or defining because he's just become Renekton. You've seen one Aatrox, you've seen them all.\n\nThey always preach that W/L and P/B don't mean anything for balance unless it's severe so it's shameful that the Victorious this year was defined solely on the fact he was P/B'd for the entire summer split because he was toxic to fight against.\n\nThe most I've seen a Aatrox do this summer split is kill deny, out-sustain, and run away like a coward for 3 seconds while he revives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-10-25T10:29:13.457+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only thing Aatrox did was make S8 worlds less entertaining than watching paint dry.\n\nEvery single game was Aatrox vs Urgot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2019-10-25T23:22:14.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I do understand their reasoning why he was picked.
