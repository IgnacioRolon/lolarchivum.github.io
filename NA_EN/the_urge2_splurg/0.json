Let's run a quick trace to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1 so I can get a picture of how your connection is faring after it leaves your network.","replies":[{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2018-01-18T05:17:23.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if I did this right...\n\nTracert came up like so:\n\n\nTracing route to 192.64.170.1 over a maximum of 30 hops\n\n  1    48 ms     5 ms     2 ms  hitronhub.home [192.168.0.1] \n  2    31 ms    27 ms    34 ms  104.220.32.1 \n  3    18 ms    18 ms    15 ms  174.127.183.28 \n  4    21 ms    22 ms    22 ms  cr1-9greatoaks-hu-0-2-0-20-0.bb.as11404.net [192.175.28.110] \n  5    34 ms    22 ms    19 ms  eqix-sv1.riotgamesdirect.com [206.223.116.158] \n  6    21 ms    33 ms    18 ms  104.160.130.44 \n  7    47 ms    42 ms    44 ms  104.160.159.102 \n  8    73 ms    70 ms    69 ms  ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.22] \n  9    90 ms    72 ms    99 ms  104.160.131.101 \n 10    73 ms    72 ms    74 ms  192.64.170.1 \n\nTrace complete.\n\n\nI take it this is what areas my connection is passing through and at what speed, so you can see if something looks amiss.

Reproducing the ping spikes is easy, happens every game right now from the moment I load in.  Everything else acts normally until then, but even web pages open slow while League is open.  The ping jumps up and down the entire time (it's not static) and often goes above 1000.  It's jumping as soon as I'm in the game, but in practice tool becomes even worse when minion starts spawning in (that's when I start to see the big numbers).\n\nWinMTR tracert results:\n\n                    WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                          hitronhub.home -   98 |   38 |    1 |    6 |    6 |    6 |    6 |\n|                            104.220.32.1 -    2 |  175 |  172 |   12 |   28 |   91 |   17 |\n|                          174.127.183.36 -    2 |  172 |  169 |   13 |  131 | 1947 |   20 |\n|cr1-9greatoaks-hu-0-6-0-20-0.bb.as11404.net -    3 |  165 |  161 |   14 |  132 | 1946 |   40 |\n|            eqix-sv1.riotgamesdirect.com -    3 |  165 |  161 |   15 |  129 | 1947 |   19 |\n|                          104.160.130.35 -    3 |  165 |  161 |   16 |  129 | 1947 |   20 |\n|                         104.160.159.102 -    4 |  160 |  155 |   39 |  163 | 1997 |   63 |\n|          ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    4 |  161 |  156 |   65 |  202 | 2227 | 2227 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    3 |  165 |  161 |   65 |  198 | 2227 | 2227 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|_\n\nLet me know if you need more info.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T21:35:13.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmmm alrighty.
