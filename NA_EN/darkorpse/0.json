He stepped down from the team and got a new position in C9 in management (Chief Gaming Organizer or some such).\n\nNothing has been confirmed until it comes from Cloud 9 management. The only thing I have seen about Incarnati0n and C9 was a post that seemed to be an April Fools Day joke. And something from HotShotGG on Reddit saying he couldn't contract him to CLG because he was already signed.\n\nNext, Incarnation has declined any involvement in DDoS attacks of any kind, and since there is no actual proof that shouldn't be held against him. He admits that he was a toxic player (another reason for his perma-ban) but Riot monitored him in a parole type situation and after 6 months found him to be fit for return to playable gamer status (which includes access to competitive League of Legends).","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2015-04-23T16:59:22.623+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kind of pisses me off that a permabanned toxic player can get paroled back into their old account if they are a competitive/pro gamer, but if one of us regular folks do the same bannable offenses it's \"tough shit, make a new account and stop being a jerk\".","replies":[{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2015-04-23T17:14:57.767+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strawberrycocoa,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=c426VMj0,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-04-23T16:59:22.623+0000)\n>\n> It kind of pisses me off that a permabanned toxic player can get paroled back into their old account if they are a competitive/pro gamer, but if one of us regular folks do the same bannable offenses it's \"tough shit, make a new account and stop being a jerk\".\n\nHey, they are toxic but successful, where as common folks are only toxic :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-23T17:09:17.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know of 3 non-Pro/Competitive players that have been \"reformed\" by Riot and given their old accounts back.
