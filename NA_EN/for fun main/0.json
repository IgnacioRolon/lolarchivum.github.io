Smite offers a great way of doing it of having all of your unlocked champions sorted alphabetically at the top, and all the locked ones at the bottom. I can understand if it's not available for ranked for obvious purposes, but it'd be useful if you have the urge to try a champion but you don't own them yet.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakeG","date":"2016-10-22T17:32:04.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such a feature would only be able to be available in blind pick (maybe ARAM though how would that work), making it a pretty low use feature.\n\nNot sure it would work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rubichasm","date":"2016-10-22T02:21:39.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be interesting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
