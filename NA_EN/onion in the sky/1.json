I only play on the NA server because I don't speak any Korean. I have been playing like this for years with no issues and a ping around 200-250. The past 36 hours my ping has been over 2,000. I'm not exaggerating one bit. My ping is over a full 2 seconds and the game is completely unplayable. This is not the case with any other service. Youtube, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and CS:GO all work perfectly fine. Any idea why I might be having such a massive latency issue with exclusively LOL?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T01:20:19.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be an issue along your network routing to the servers. I'd recommend running a traceroute to see where the issues lie. You can grab the network app called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) and plug in **104.160.131.1** into the host field before starting the trace. After it's been running for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into issues with this.","replies":[]}]}
