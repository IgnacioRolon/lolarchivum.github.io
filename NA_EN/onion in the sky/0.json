I'm having some serious ping issues on the NA server that just started about 48-60 hours ago. My ping usually hovers around 200 but it has popped up to a consistent 2,000+. The game is now completely unplayable. Other games don't seem to have this problem and pinging things in the area give me a 200 or so ping. I've attached screenshots of me pinging the League server @ 104.160.131.3 with a 200ms ping. I get 200 ping EVERY time I ping that IP. However, in game EVERY time I get a 2,000 ping. I have no idea what could be causing this issue. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T01:53:17.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big changes in latency are typically influenced by changes in your ISP routing to the servers. Before we take an in-depth look at your route, we need to ensure your local network settings are A-Okay. Work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and let me know if you still encounter high latency.","replies":[{"poster":"Onion in the Sky","date":"2016-11-01T09:22:27.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you greatly for your response. One of my big issues is that I have absolutely zero access to my router settings. It is borrowed from my ISP and connecting through the default gateway IP simply returns no connection at all. I did what I could from the guide but it did not solve the problem. What would be the next step from here?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T21:54:16.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running a traceroute during a time you experience these symptoms will give me an idea of what's going on along your route. You can complete this by grabbing [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) then plugging **104.160.131.1** into the host field, then starting the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MELI0DAS","date":"2016-10-31T16:43:49.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in the same situation myself.
