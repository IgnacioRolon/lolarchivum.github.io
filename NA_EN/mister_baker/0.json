Everything else is fine and balnced, i know some people may say &#039;Just dont attack him in the early game.&#039; but he can just freeze the lane if he is good enough.{{champion:58}}","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-22T08:16:59.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a 30%winrate with irelia, you're the problem, not the renekton.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Black Jesus","date":"2018-06-22T08:15:37.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Renekton's stun is only 0.75/1.50.\nRenekton have hard time freezing due to all his aoe.\nRenekton is ment to be strong early as he scales poorly, Irelia is a scaling chamption and should lose to him early.\nRenekton is pretty weak and has been for a while, Riot is not gonna nerf him, they might even buff him.","replies":[]}]}
