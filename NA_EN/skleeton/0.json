This time around just feels really lackluster compared to other years. In other years, the Harrowing was much bigger and happened at least a week before Halloween, along with details on sales and dates and such. However, this year they didn&#039;t tell us anything and I just assumed it would be like last. Sure, I&#039;m a little disappointed Harrowing isn&#039;t as big now, but I really wouldn&#039;t have minded if Riot told us that; that this time would be small. I mean, look, correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but they have barely given us any details, let alone any.\n\nI&#039;m content with what we got, I&#039;m just a little peeved with the lack of communication and I hope future events aren&#039;t like this.\n\nOh, and also, sure, I get worlds is going on right now too, but that hasn't slowed Riot down before.\n\nEdit: Upvote so Riot can see.\n\nEdit 11/2: I'm pretty disappointed in Riot right now. It's Nov 2nd, and there's STILL no new news or confirmation or ANYTHING. I bought RP in advance to buy legacy Harrowing skins and there's still no show. I'm extremely disappointed in the lack of communication and clarity here, it really seems like they don't care at all.\n\nEdit 11/3: Forget I ever said ANYTHING.\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/index.html\nRiot has redeemed themselves.","replies":[]}
