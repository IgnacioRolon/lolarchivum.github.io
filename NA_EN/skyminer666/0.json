Each time you are punish the penalty increases, and it tells you that continuing your behavior will do so, including when you receive a 14 day ban that the next penalty is a permaban.\n\nWhile you are unlikely to ever recover this account you are still allowed to play on a new account, so I encourage you to post the chat logs you received so we can review them and help you improve your behavior so that this doesn't happen again.","replies":[]}]}]}
