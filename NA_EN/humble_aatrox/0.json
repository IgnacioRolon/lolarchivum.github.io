And here is why...\n\nCoffeeMug linked the concept art for {{champion:25}}  and she is holding a whip. Now I think what Riot is trying to do is the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse like many are saying and here is why. Let's use the game series Darksiders for a minute.\n\nIn Darksiders there are 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, Death, Strife, and Fury.\nWar is the embodiment of war itself and carries a massive greatsword. Who do we know that wields a big greatsword? {{champion:266}} . \nDeath is the embodiment of, well, death. His signature weapon is a scythe that can break apart into smaller scythes. He is also the edgiest of the four and looks visually similar to {{champion:141}}  in a way. So this is Kayn/Rhaast.\nStrife is someone that we have yet to see in the Darksiders universe, BUT in every concept art or picture of him we see him wielding two guns. Yes I am aware that two guns is Lucian BUT Riot instead went with {{champion:110}}  to be the ranged champion of the Darkin.\n\nNow we get to Fury. She is the horseman(horsewoman?) to be the one with a WHIP and the only female of the four. Since Morgana's concept was supposed to have a whip this is where I say that she is going to be the next Darkin. I will probably get ripped a new one for saying \"she is going to be one because she looks the same\" but it is definitely the only possibility that could fit here. She fits the Darkin look as well.\n\nAlso, with the Aatrox rework that has just come out you can take a look at SkinSpotlights (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0NwzCHb8Fg89eTB5eYX17Q) who has the Special Interactions for Aatrox https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pn41Ecefm4&t=786s)                                              and his voice lines towards her are very convincing.
