It says I'm level 5, but I'm level 30 on my account and I'm not sure what's happening. I also can't post anywhere other than here so I can't really post/comment to raise my \"board level\" like I assumed was what this is. My new theory is that posting this will either raise my \"boards level\" if that exists or it'll just refresh my info and show me as the correct level. \n\nIf I'm just wrong overall plz help me because I'm very lost otherwise\n\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}}\n\n\nEdit: I'm dumb, I didn't see the level sync tool pinned to the board, my problem's most likely gonna be fixed in a matter of minutes, sorry about that!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T18:49:53.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, they are kind of separate so your account may need to sync to the boards when first posting.
