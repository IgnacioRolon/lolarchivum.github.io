I can still hear noise from league but the gameplay is frozen and if I press alt+tab I can see other screens while they move but I can't click them. In order to solve this I have to ctrl+alt+del and sign out then sign back in. Needless to say, I end up needing to re-login to league and now I've had to afk for 2-4 mins on my team. I would like to point out that I never freeze with any other game/application and I directly plug into the wall with an ethernet cable so it is not connection issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T17:55:27.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you on Windows 10?  It sounds like your freeze might be a case of the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which auto-enabled for some players after an update and causing freezes like this.  Disabling it should fix it up.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Crohns Malone","date":"2017-01-23T14:39:55.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just looked and yea, it was on.
