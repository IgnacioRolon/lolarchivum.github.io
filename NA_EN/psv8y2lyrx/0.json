But right now in the game you get banned or restricted for saying mean words over stuff that actually inhibits and ruins game for others. Mean words actually do nothing if your an adult, it happens in real life. But then support acts like dickbags that have snowflakes so far up their ass its not funny. &quot;The Anivia has been in 3 of my games in row afk ruining them&quot;  one of my accounts, response i got was because i called her a &quot;stupid fkn fggt&quot; &quot;I am toxic and ruin comminity&quot;  and get banned. My mean words ruin community over her literally wasting time 10 people 3 games row? 30-45 min 30 people lives just gone no competition.  I add her an account 2 days later not even chat restricted or any bs punishment. in a game that has alcohol, tobacco, and is called the league of legends why is mean words that bad? &quot;legends&quot; would swear and say mean words over acting like degenerate children who are sensitive and cannot handle mean words. So can we like change the support/community to match name of game or change name to like the -league of sensitivesissys-  or something?","replies":[]}
