I just hopped on, hoping to play some ranked before work and everything went through, I was on the loading screen which normally takes less than a minute to get to the game for me, ran roughly 5 minutes before I decided to force close the game and try to re-log in. Everyone was at 100% mind you.\r\n\r\nThen it starts giving me the you've been disconnected and nothing would get the client to open the match without the disconnected message coming up. I restarted my computer and nothing. \r\nI tried about 2 more times and finally got into the game but it was to late as it seemed my entire TEAM DCed and the one left guy remaked. Leaving me with a flag on leaver buster and a loss in ranked and a sour apple on my Reputation. \r\n\r\nI ran the hextech connection tool or whatever, re-installed my client and everything just now but I'm alittle nervous to play as I don't know if I'll connect or not.\r\n\r\nNow for disclaimers every other online game I play works. H1Z1, planetside, starcraft, etc. Nothing gives me issues.\r\n\r\nI'm hardwired.\r\n\r\nI was running the new beta client.\r\n\r\nWindows firewall already has an exception for league related connections.\r\n(At least it will now forsure with the hextech tool)\r\n\r\nI never had this issue before this last patch.\r\n\r\nRunning in Admin would solve it but now it doesn't. \r\n\r\nI run LOLreplay2.\r\n\r\nI have logs I can send you guys in a support ticket.\r\n\r\nIs this happening to others? Because I'd like to play ranked without worrying if I'll get banned or punished for afk, dc issues. The \"leaver(remake)\" in my match history is a pretty ugly mark right now.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and submit a support ticket with this copied to the ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-14T23:45:27.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think this is a permissions problem, so running as admin won't really solve anything.  The issue to me appears to be a network issue that just can't hold a connection to our game servers.  The client and game can load just fine because it has permission, but can't reach out far enough to connect.   Go over every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to work this out, and be sure to go over each step.  Test it out in a custom game to prevent any penalties.  Let me know what you find!","replies":[]}]}
