I still remember running around top-lane as Singed trying to make sense of everything. \r\nRecently, I tried to log in to play with my girlfriend and all I got was a message saying I'd been banned. Permanently. For \"toxicitiy\".\r\nI looked at the logs linked and thought... sure, calling people something like \"asswipe\" and so forth is rather toxic, but it was also both ways - difference being I didn't report them after the match (we won) but they did. How is it that just pressing a button can take away something someone put 10 years of love into because a few trigger-words appear in the chat. I was always the guy greeting everyone at the start of the game, and saying GG when we lost - but none of that matters... if you type the wrong thing, at the wrong time. \r\nI wish I could play one more game, but truth is I don't think I will be allowed to. For that, I wish everyone here in the community the best of luck in the rift - and that you get some wins for me, much love, Regn.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-03-22T17:26:09.483+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"'I was always the person greeting my victim before I harassed it and would always tell him good banter, after I left him emotionally devastated at the ground' :)\n\nEDIT: \nAfter reading the logs, great banter.\nAre you out of your mind calling *this* bloody banter?

The only time you get insta permabanned is cheating.  So you were given at LEAST 1 chance. You claim it is **IT IS A MATCH WE ARE SUPPOSE TO TAUNT EACH OTHER.(YEAH BUT NOT YOUR OWN TEAM!!! THEY ARE NOT THE ENEMY.**  All you did was tilt them though them replying to you makes them guilty as well since you guys were not operating at your best in a rank match I will assume. So you ruined it for the people that were just trying to win. Weather they suck or not you can say at the endgame lobby. I tell people they need to get better. stop fn feeding. w.e I just dont spend the entire match doing it and i havent been chat banned.
