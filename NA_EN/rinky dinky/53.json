How fed was xin? What was your and the enemy team comp? What items did you have? Did you properly CC him? Did you ignore him? Did you walk in one at a time, expecting him to let you kill him? Does walking in 1 after another really count as &quot;1v5&quot;? Did you position properly? Have you even played against a xin? have you even played league recently? Are you basing your entire opinion off of youtube/reddit videos? \n\nAnswer all of the above questions, and you will see this is a circlejerk. Nothing more.  Is xin overtuned? Probably. Is he a gamebreaking free win? No lol \n\nIts the same thing with {{item:3147}}. The item, statistically speaking, is mediocre. It is not breaking any champs.

If a champion is getting 1v5s or quadras/pentas easily then that's very likely a problem no matter how badly the fight was played by his enemy - most champions don't 1v5 just because people didn't adequately CC them. \n\nI was watching a friend playing a game earlier where the Xin on his team was 2/6/5 before the fight, had Sated + tank items and got a quadra in a 4v5 (his Lulu mid wasn't there). He was against Rammus, Alistar, Cho, Draven and Kassadin. I didn't rewatch the fight ten different times, nor do I know precisely what items people had at the time, so I can't say if Rammus focused him enough, if Draven kited him well enough or if Cho missed his Rupture. What I can say is that a 2/6 tank generally doesn't walk out of a 4v5 team fight with a quadra.\n\nXin's stats are insane for champion.gg by the way. If he's doing well enough to be one of the best (even if not the best) junglers in Plat+ then he is absolutely retarded the further down you go from there. He is a champion with a permanently inflated low ELO win rate because people who play him are at an instant advantage compared to people who play champions with relevant mastery curves. If he's performing as strongly as he is on champion.gg then you know he needs gutting.\n\np.s. I've not made a single post complaining about Xin Zhao up until this point, nor have I lost a game to him. But people absolutely have the right to call him broken, because he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2016-02-13T23:49:18.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is not dude lmao\n\nIf you cannot factor any of what I just said above, then the issue is you, not xin.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-02-14T02:07:01.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rinky Dinky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oyG0BB2d,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-02-13T23:49:18.715+0000)\n>\n> He is not dude lmao\n> \n> If you cannot factor any of what I just said above, then the issue is you, not xin.\n\nOf course I -can- factor all of the possible reasons that a Xin 1v5d or whatever. But I'm not gonna spend a couple of hours analysing a 10 second team fight just so I can conclude that there's no possible way Xin doing something ridiculous was actually OK.\n\nAnd he is broken as hell - the champion.gg stats support that. That a champion with a skill ceiling/floor as pathetically low as Xin Zhao is performing better than the vast majority of other junglers (ones that actually involve some level of mastery) in Plat+ is insane. You have no reason, even in high ELO, to bother learning a jungler that requires actual practice now because on average you'll get better results with Xin pretty much instantly.\n\nOnce you go Gold and lower it's even more extreme. Just don't bother playing anyone except Udyr or Xin because even if you're miraculously a god at Kindred you won't do as well as you would with them. Even if you want to argue that Xin isn't broken once you hit Diamond, that doesn't mean he's OK. He's probably the most obvious freelo I've seen since I joined the game at every tier below and it's not because people don't know how to play against him, it's because people don't know how to play anyone and you don't need to know how to play Xin Zhao to win with him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-02-13T21:40:30.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i don't think his buff is gamebreaking. its a significant buff. but honestly. its not a big jump in his power as devoure users like jax yi warwick shyvanna are better than him imo. he has good ganks. but thats about it i feel like. his damage output is low. the crit isn't A BIG damage buff as he doesn't build a lot of ad. he goes tank. most of the damage is still coming from devoure and rageblade. his winrate will prolly jump by like 1-2%.\n\na champion like {{champion:104}}  and honestly even {{champion:42}} are breaking the game right now. might as well add{{champion:236}} \nthat graves nerf was nothing. his scalings are quite high. he already 2 shots a squishie. i doubt 60 damage or so is a big deal in the grand scheme of things","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tohob","date":"2016-02-13T21:30:22.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:5}} is pretty strong now. before the buff he was **underperforming** despite being a perfect match for the currently very complained-about {{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} combo, but people are acting like he now heals more than {{champion:36}} and crits harder than crit runes {{champion:41}}  when in reality the AD scaling on his heal is minimal at best and the crit is just another 3-hit auto attack buff that also uses up his crit, meaning that it can't crit on top of dealing it's additional damage.

The power of having both all the time is what is amazing, It is like they took all of Aatrox's decision making about damage vs survivability and just gave up.\n\nComparing them is really saddening now, Xin has more reliable cc, more reliable steroids (both offensive and defensive), even has better base stats, and now he has the one thing that made Aatrox unique while also removing his opponents option of forcing him to move to the defensive stance to survive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-02-13T23:14:19.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tohob,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oyG0BB2d,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-13T21:30:22.840+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:5}} is pretty strong now. before the buff he was **underperforming** despite being a perfect match for the currently very complained-about {{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} combo, but people are acting like he now heals more than {{champion:36}} and crits harder than crit runes {{champion:41}}  when in reality the AD scaling on his heal is minimal at best and the crit is just another 3-hit auto attack buff that also uses up his crit, meaning that it can't crit on top of dealing it's additional damage.

Yes he was good with Sated-Rageblade, but Riot didn't want him to be stat bound to that build. (as it also binds him to the Jungle role.) \n\nI don't actually play Xin, so I have to ask. With riot giving some support to his AD-Crit build, while not trying to touch his Sated-AS build.
