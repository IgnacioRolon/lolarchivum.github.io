They might of over did it with the shield buffs anyways. I am not saying burn him to the ground but he now brings more than any other ADC, when it comes to damage and defense. Blu ez is a close 2nd though.","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-04-08T05:45:32.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand changing him up a bit, and Riot has already said they are working on a rework for sometime after Poppy, so he will be changed up and Sioned. I don't think ADC is the right monicker for him since Riot said they want him to be a slowish tough ranged damage dealer and may shift to a ranged Bruiser, what are AD caster classified as?\n\nThat said, people have a long memory, and the Internet a longer one. If people see Urgot nerfed again, it bring back strong memories of \"Urgot Tier\" and it will breed resentment. I have a feeling that the reason Sion himself is so powerful still is because how weak he was in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-04-08T06:10:37.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"See this is the problem with pure range AD casters. They are ADC by default and mage at the same time. \n\nI am not sure why they gave his shields a buff out of everything they could of done this was the biggest mistake. A range AD that can actually scale his shields is huge.  Which is why he was picked for mid LCS and in some regions they are using his as the ADC. \n\nUrgot is proof concept that range AD mages are a bad concept. With a full manamura blu build he can hit as hard as an crit ADC with so much more tankiness. He either has to be weak or strong, middle ground does not seem to exist.\n\nI am calling it now that riot is going to have to nerf urgot in the next couple of patches. The fact that LCS team are straight banning him out is proof of a problem.\n\nBut do not get me wrong here. I loved seeing a zed finally have a bad match up. What was good to watch in this case is probably bad for the game. ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-04-10T06:18:15.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
