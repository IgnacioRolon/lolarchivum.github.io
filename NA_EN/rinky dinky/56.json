You can open that with esc and then keybindings.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-10-08T20:09:16.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Won't let me bind attack move to mouse button 1 through the menu.","replies":[{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-10-08T20:24:37.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O.o that's pretty strange\n\nLooking closer at the actual file compared to the input.ini file the format looks like it should still work.

There should be a \"Persisted Settings.json\" file in the same folder. I don't know what your knowledge about json files is but basically it's a way of storing key : value pairs. If you open that in a plain text editor and look towards the bottom there's a \"name\" \"input.ini\". League is using this file to create the ini file whenever it runs. The values should be the same so try changing it there and see if those stay.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-10-08T23:55:46.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I legit just figured that out before checking here to let you know I fixed it.\n\nThanks for the help man I appreciate it.
