If someone has 50 HP and a 400 magic shield, he will die to a 50+ damage autoattack or physical spell","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2016-02-06T00:20:18.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure why you mentioned Garen's E, I clearly typed ult. \n\nGaren's ult is magic damage 80% of the time. 20% of the time it is true damage, via villain mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-02-06T01:29:34.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lane Cancer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=an1ByzQk,comment-id=0001000000010000,timestamp=2016-02-06T00:20:18.336+0000)\n>\n> Not sure why you mentioned Garen's E, I clearly typed ult. \n> \n> Garen's ult is magic damage 80% of the time. 20% of the time it is true damage, via villain mechanic.\n\nSorry the quote was a bit too big\nConsider the quote was  \n> BUT, if he was e'eing, the magic shield would take no damage","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-02-05T15:33:06.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like a new ninja has risen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-02-05T17:31:03.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not supposed to block your ult. it should however block your Q.
