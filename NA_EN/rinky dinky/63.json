Lower his W damage if you must, just shorten the delay. Better yet, you could even copy Xerath&#039;s W. Lower the delay, but make the center take full damage, while the edges deal only 50%. His W relying on the stun, when his E is obviously not ment to be a 100% stun anymore, rather, a zoning/disruption tool, such as Sion Q, makes him very clunky. His W does not fit into his kit, and makes him very unsatisying/fun to play.\r\n\r\nOr, even better, why not give his E bonus effects? You made it block dashes (Not blinks or Swaps), but this does nothing to help veigar against opponents who can just sit inside of the cage and STILL murder you very easily (AKA all of them except Karthus). His E is half of a spell now, which is very bad considering half of his kit and champion design relies on that spell. You guys said you wanted to play up the feel of locking people in a cage, why not provide any incentive? As it stands, you throw out E, pray it stuns, and if it doesn&#039;t, you lose the all in. The only champion this is different against is Karthus, and he can STILL kill you from beyond the grave if he managed to land more than 2 q&#039;s.\r\n\r\nThe only other option is blindly buffing his ult, which does nothing to make him feel less clunky, or buffing his Q/W&#039;s damage, which again does nothing to make him feel less clunky.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a balance problem, it is a feel problem. He feels annoying to play. In lane, you throw out your E, W, and Q. If the stun lands, great (If minions don&#039;t block Q), but it usually won&#039;t. Smart opponents will dodge if you cast the edge on them, so the only option usually is to cast the cage in the center, blocking them in. This does nothing for veigar, as you will now be forced to use q and r, then awkwardly wait an additional second for W to land. 9/10 times it won&#039;t land, and even if it does, your enemy is probably going to have killed you in that second of downtime, unless they are a dps champion (Cass, Swain), but even if that is the case, they will have just vamped hp (Swain R, Cass E), and then you will be left dead, trading 1 for 1 at most.\r\n\r\nSomething is missing in his kit now. You guys said you wanted to play up the feel of locking people in a cage, why not provide any incentive? As it stands, you throw out E, pray it stuns, and if it doesn&#039;t, you lose the all in. The only champion this is different against is Karthus, and he can STILL kill you from beyond the grave. \r\n\r\nVeigar can currently only function very well in teamfights, and that is only if he has been able to farm, and has a frontline who can hold everyone down so he can use his W and E. You are forced to overly rely on your teamates for the entire game. You need a jungler for lane if you want to reliably go for an all in, you need a frontline for teamfights, and you 100% need a teamate with cc for skirmishes. \r\n\r\nJust knowing that there are plans for change would be enough. I&#039;m not asking for an immediate pbe update instantaneously buffing and removing all of veigar&#039;s problems, just an update for any changes currently being considered, or if Veigar is even still being looked at.\r\n\r\nRito pls, talk to us Veigar players.","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-04-13T20:50:06.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I've been trying to get some attention to my idea for a while, and it lines up with what you're saying. I go into more depth [Here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/hZHslnlg-what-if-veigars-spells-interacted-with-his-wall) but the basic idea is that Veigar's cage should interact with his other basic abilities. This could be something like expanding the width/range/number of hits on his Q if it passes through the cage, or letting his W have a faster impact time, a larger radius or maybe a secondary hit (maybe with 50% dmg) if it lands within the cage's area.\n\nThis would actually make Veigar's gameplay **way** more engaging. As you said, if he misses his stun he basically backs off or blindly throws out his spells. This way, you are actually incentivized to try to \"trap\" your opponents *inside* the cage rather than just tagging them with the edge of it.","replies":[]}]}
