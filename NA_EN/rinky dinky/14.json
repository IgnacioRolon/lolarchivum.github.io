Stop thinking it is, it makes you look silly.\n\nPersonal opinion: I don't play Gangplank, so I don't really mind him being disabled, but if a champion I enjoyed were disabled for a week I'd probably be upset. If you want lore to periodically remove part of the cast because it's \"impactful\" then more power to ya, but anything more than two days is just silly.","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-08-03T06:30:16.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I would be on the other side.\nIf my main Malzahar got disabled, I would be a little annoyed, but I would be excited about what would happen when he returned storywise.\nA week off my favorite champion just to get a skin, A nice bonus.
