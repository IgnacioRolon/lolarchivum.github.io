I mained him to Challenger a few months ago on my main account.  He is not suitable for competitive play, but is quite viable in solo queue.\n\nHe is okay, but there is really no reason to choose him over just about anyone else. Rek'Sai does what skarner does but a hell of a lot better, minus his grab ult, which can just be cleansed out of or some such. \n\nI still love Skarner, at least aesthetically, but I just can't justify picking him over so many other champions right now outside of \"because I want to play him\" compared to not playing him \"because I want to win easier\".","replies":[{"poster":"DEADLIFE","date":"2015-08-01T05:47:48.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure there is.  I pick him because I like winning, and he helps me win.  I see him as such:\n\nQuick and easy clear.  Shield, movement speed steroid, and a spammable AOE wrapped up in a very straightforward, mechanically simple package.  W to a camp, start tapping Q, and begin to watch the lanes.  This is a luxury many junglers don't afford me, as their camp clear mechanics carry a bit more complexity.  \n\nExcellent snowball potential.  Skarner has strong synergy with Sheen, and all melee Sheen champions have intense snowball potential.  Skarner has the tools to reach this point consistently, due to his quick clear and all-but-guaranteed level 6 ganks.  \n\nQuick, with good single-target lockdown.  A fed Skarner is similar to a fed Udyr in many aspects.  You can get around the map doing things _faster_.  Farm faster, move faster, kill faster.  This is an amazing quality in solo queue.\n\nPlaystyle simplicity.  This can be seen as either an advantage or a disadvantage.  Can Lee Sin potentially do many more things than Skarner?  Of course.  Is your usual solo queue Lee Sin going to be capable of doing those things on a consistent basis?  Nope.  Similar to Amumu, Skarner has a very simple focus come midgame - use your ult to start a favorable fight.  I'm not a player suited to making complex in-the-moment decisions, so a driving goal like this helps give structure and purpose to my play in the midgame when you typically see many junglers fade in impact, not knowing what to do.  \n\nAre there downsides?  Yes, many.  And as you say, Rek'sai is objectively a better jungler.  There really aren't many if's or but's about that.  But so what?  Skarner is not Rek'sai Jr.  He's a different champion with a different kit and very different qualities.  If you look past \"what champions are top 3 in their roles right now\" you may very well find one of the \"worse\" champions is exactly what you need to win.  :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-08-01T01:42:07.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want him to be stickier... but i like his overall kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bad manner kid","date":"2015-08-01T01:39:13.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Skarner's plate:\n\n<insert picture of dog poop>","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-08-01T01:58:52.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't want you refereeing my chat ;-;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-08-01T05:02:20.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"He needs a new passive, the current one is absolute garbage.
