If he was forced to channel, he would lose out on damage and chase potential meanwhile. He only has a silence for CC, so it would only hurt him. At least Sion has a cc lock before he channels his Q, and Garen can't do that. The current mechanic is probably the most fitting, as it wouldn't make him generic with a single fast spin (if you wanted that direction aswell).","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2015-04-08T02:12:58.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the problem though, he (Right now) is a generic I Q up to you and press E.

The first one sends a chain like Leblanc's E, binding them together, and the next use creates causes him to channel the abilility, and the third use sends him towards the target and starts to spin once he reaches it, with an added slow to the spin.

He continues to spin for 3 seconds after he has reached the target area but is also possible to cancel it during the channel and final spintime. (not during his travel-time.) If he hits the target with his body, it is slightly knocked back and slowed by 90% which decreases over 1.0/1.25/1.5/1.75/2.0 seconds. \n\nI like silly ideas, since he is a silly champions. ALSO! I want his Q to give him a backflip again when he attacks with it. My life has been so empty without it.\n\nWhen I think of Garen I think of BeyBlade.

As of right now it is pretty lackluster as in order for it to feel strong it needs to do large amounts of damage which should not be the case. Taking a page from the Sion rework we see that his stun was retained and given something to make it feel more impactful. Making an ability feel strong should be the primary focus of redesigning a champions abilities, This doesn't mean it should be powerful in a damage sense but in a effectful or in its presence. \n\nIn both of your examples it makes the ability into more than just something that does damage. This allows the ability to have a different form altogether in different situations. Designs like this allow the champions to be used in different ways depending on the player and situation that arises, it is also how (it seems) Riot has been doing their ability reworks to include new ways for the champion to interact with the map and rest of the champion pool, hence why there aren't many abilities that only have one effect in recent champions. \n\n\nOnto your abilities themselves.\n> His E has THREE actives. The first one sends a chain like Leblanc's E, binding them together, and the next use creates causes him to channel the ability, and the third use sends him towards the target and starts to spin once he reaches it, with an added slow to the spin. The damage AND slow is increased depending on how long you channel, for a maximum of 2 seconds (200% base slow and damage).\n\nThis is very unique in the way it would interact for the Garen player as it adds 3 conditions to the ability. \n1. The player must hit a skillshot in order to activate.\n2. The player must channel the ability while trying to keep the enemy in range of the link.\n3. The player must be aware of the situation that he will be landing in.\n\nThis allows the enemy player a decent amount of time to counter it and decent ways for the ability to be used against them if they are not aware of the situation around them (thus teaching map awareness). This in turn allows the ability to be stronger and allows it to be used in different ways. For example it could be used as an escape by linking a minion/monster and channeling (unless interrupted) to launch away from enemies on him. (even better if it can move him through walls)\n\n> We could give him a stationary channel, which increases in range rapidly over the channel duration.

If he hits the target with his body, it is slightly knocked back and slowed by 90% which decreases over 1.0/1.25/1.5/1.75/2.0 seconds.\n\nThis was more along the lines of my thoughts for how to change his E. It makes it so there is a distinct amount of time for the enemy to react (channel time) and a distinct way for it to be used in more than just an offensive fashion. \n\nThe ability limits its use based on these conditions.\n1. Player must be aware of the situation they will land in.\n2. The player must keep the enemy in range while channeling (if used offensively).\n3. The player must plan the route to hit the enemy for maximum damage (collision box skillshot).\n\nThe knockback is a decent way to reward or punish players for positioning as well as allows him more than just to bodyblock late game. The knockback should only affect 1 or 2 people at most to avoid minor abuse, and it should be determined if the ability should allow him to pass over terrain (a la Vi). \n\nWhat are some others thoughts on these?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-04-08T02:06:25.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered giving his spin-to-win a knock back at the last tick?

He becomes very viable lategame, especially in longer fights, but in a single quick fight, his passive goes entirely to waste and he feels weak again. Though I would also agree on that ultimate change was a good direction. But his kit feels restrictive for him to become a stronger champion that does other stuff than just going for a single target in a teamfight. What I would be interested to see would be maybe some changes to his ultimate. Concidering it's no scale at all, and calculates the damage dealt in a very retro style. \n\nAnother opinion I have is that revolving his W. A long time ago it provided the bonus armor/mr % to base stats aswell, and not just bonus armor and MR. It removed some of his early game power, which honestly wouldn't be too bad to test out now that ranged champions and burst champs are picked frequently in toplane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-04-08T22:20:32.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly, i think hes close to being in a fine spot right now.\n\nif you want to look into possible changes, to help him out lategame a little more, then remove the self slow on his rank 5 spin.\n\ni remember, that back when he was reworked shortly before season 3, the self slow was added as a mechanic for the lane phase. it was supposed to make it harder for him to kite or chase other melees through minion waves. it was supposedly added to give other melees more counterplay against him during the early lane phase, so it would open up buffs to his lategame.\nthe problem with the mechanic is, that it screws him over throughout the entire game. especially in jungle chases or teamfights down the lane later on it happens, that you scratch a random minion, and poof. people are walking out of your spin and start kiting you. \n\nconsidering that it was never intended to impact his lategame, it would be a good idea to remove it on rank 5 judgement.\n\n\nother possibilities would be slight increase on his w passive to give him a tad more resistances lategame. a compensation for what was lost, when the w passive was nerfed from 20% total resistances to 20% bonus resistances.
