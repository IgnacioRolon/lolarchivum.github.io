I don&#039;t think that is worth losing out on so much gold.\r\n\r\nI hope {{item:3301}} will be recieving buffs along this path as well.

They're clearly unintended/have been put out incorrectly.

He can activate 2-3 ticks from it with one auto-attack that strikes within the AoE cone it makes later on from meep collection..It allows him to do some damage and pressure more (let alone grant more mana regen for more healing, and other spells) than he ever could with the coin. The only benefit the coin brings now is the Tier-3 movement speed buff from its top of line upgrade path. Even then, the frost-AoE shot is a lot more useful than the coin speed buff for the bard, allowing him to line up a good Stunning Q, or well-placed ultimate.\n\nSpellthiefs has been tied in dominance with the Targons since they showed up. Coin has always been the lesser, weaker choice sadly. If anything, the buffs here are stupid, and the COIN needed the buff. The coin doesn't nearly give as much gold as the other two. Not even two coins can equal up to ONE spelltheif.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-07-09T02:06:49.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the idea is that Coin comes with the better utility in most cases. And is the safer choice. \n\nShields and slows are not hard to come by. But a full team large speed boost isn't something you'll find as easily. 3 champions I think? Two of those require an ultimate. \n\nIf Coin comes too close to the other two then it will easily out shine them. \n\nI'm sure these changes wont go through. It's just asking for players to abuse it. It's likely a typo.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-09T02:08:32.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been on PBE for 2 days now.
