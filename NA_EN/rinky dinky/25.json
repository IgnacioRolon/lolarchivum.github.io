For each enemy champion slowed, gain 15% attack speed for 6 seconds (60 second cooldown).&quot;\r\nChanged: Slow duration increased to 3 seconds from 2 seconds\r\nNew Effect: &quot;For Each Enemy champion slowed, gain 15% attack speed for 6 seconds&quot;\r\nNew Effect: &quot;afflicts them with Cold steel&#039;s debuff for 3 seconds&quot; \r\nRemoved Effect: &quot;+1 second per 200 armor and +1 second per 200 magic resist&quot;\r\n\r\nSeems very... different. I see al ot of uses. Certainly a good purchase on champions like {{champion:5}} {{champion:56}} and {{champion:254}} who can utilize the attack speed, and even tanks like {{champion:111}}  and {{champion:54}} could see alot of use out of this. I see it being an amazing combo with the new Black Cleaver (http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/8V3YcXOb-black-cleaver-reworked) on {{champion:122}} and {{champion:150}} \r\n\r\nI wonder what Riot&#039;s reasoning is behind this change. I certainly wasn&#039;t expecting it. Hopefully we can get some context.

Like, I get that Randuin's is a good anti-ADC item, but this change didn't really do anything to change that. It will give the attack speed slow on the active, but that slow was already on the passive and both Kalista (particularly hurricane Kalista) and Jinx could have already been hitting you to activate the attack speed slow (and Jinx is the ADC most likely to be outside of the Randuin's active range anyway). I'd almost venture a guess that they'll be hurt less by this Randuin's change than any other AD carries. The attack speed you get from the active now doesn't really do anything special against them either.\n\nI still don't see how this change does anything special to either Kalista or Jinx.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"goldensilver09","date":"2015-04-08T18:16:19.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before those two, who are glass cannon adcs with good range (At least Jinx, i can't remember ~~the OP one~~ Kalista.
