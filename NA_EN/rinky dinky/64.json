W will not reduce attack speed when used. This is true for ranks 1 and 2, and others have informed me it still does not work even at rank 5, when it should be applying a 40% attack speed slow.\r\n\r\nThis seems like it would be a simple fix. I really hope riot looks into this, because that is a huge amount of power gone from his kit.\r\n\r\nI linked a thread that brought this to my attention. It didn&#039;t have the gameplay tag, so I added it to mine in hopes of boosting the chances of bringing this to riot&#039;s attention.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate some info on if this will be looked at. His passive bleed has been bugged for a while, and now his attack speed slow is as well.\r\nIf we factor in his E, which can pull people whom have flashed/dashed away, we have a seriously bugged out champion.\r\n\r\nPlease, fix these bugs. This is a huge amount of Darius&#039;s power gone.","replies":[]}
