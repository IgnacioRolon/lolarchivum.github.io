This is a SERIOUS bug. Also, his passive bleeding sometimes don&#039;t do the full damage. Please, he is unplayable this way.","url":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/NkfBAj4c-darius-w-is-not-applying-the-atk-speed-slow","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.\n\nIn addition to Darius&#039;s bleed bugs, in which it does not reliably do full damage, his W attack speed reduction does not work on minions, champs, or monsters.\n\nThis was tested in a custom game against a Vayne. W will not reduce attack speed when used. This is true for ranks 1 and 2, and others have informed me it still does not work even at rank 5, when it should be applying a 40% attack speed slow.\n\nThis seems like it would be a simple fix. I really hope riot looks into this, because that is a huge amount of power gone from his kit.\n\nI linked a thread that brought this to my attention. It didn&#039;t have the gameplay tag, so I added it to mine in hopes of boosting the chances of bringing this to riot&#039;s attention.\n\nI would really appreciate some info on if this will be looked at. His passive bleed has been bugged for a while, and now his attack speed slow is as well.\nIf we factor in his E, which can pull people whom have flashed/dashed away, we have a seriously bugged out champion.\n\nPlease, fix these bugs. This is a huge amount of Darius&#039;s power gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-06-10T02:18:13.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MAJOR EDIT!!

(Like how they nerfed his pull animation), because it has no info at all in 5.11 patch notes. So most likely 5.12.
