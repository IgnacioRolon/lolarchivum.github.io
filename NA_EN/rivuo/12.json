She used locket shield but still she was by herself and i was like wtf i should do more damage than that.\r\n\r\nIs it because no void staff against locket 60 mr + merc tread 25 mr = no damage?

Void wouldn't really make you kill her (not even close), you just experienced why assassins are bad late game. Locket just invalidates your initial burst and an adc will kill you while you don't have cds up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-11-05T21:08:47.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like there was bigger problems that game than no void staff","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesus Is My King","date":"2017-11-05T21:04:27.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"35% pen.... now... just think about how IMPORTANT this item is... void staff.... 35% ... not flat, but %","replies":[]}]}
