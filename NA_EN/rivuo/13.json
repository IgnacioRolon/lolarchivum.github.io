They aren't good and just do bad things. They ARE bad at the core. In the context of league of legends this means my opinion is that players are all toxic. They aren't good and just happen to act toxic. They are toxic at their core. Thus, a group of players would ALSO be toxic at the core. That would make this an intrinsic quality they have by default.\n\nThere can be no more correct use of the word \"inherent\". Its not even possible. It was literally used in its literal definition.\n\nI didn't mean to say something else. I didn't say what I intended to say incorrectly.\n\nI said exactly what I meant.\n\nNow its an opinion that I feel that way. And this opinion is exaggerated. But nothing changes the fact that I LITERALLY meant that I feel players are toxic by default, particularly in premades.\n\nGood luck passing english class mate.

Then again.\nSuppose you watched that game and saw that the jungler did not touch a single other lane?\n\nDespite the fact that the jungler and top had a good k/d/a ratio probably, the teamplay only composed of that single duo getting anywhere. Win OR lose, that game resulted in at least one negative outcome of gameplay balance and probably didn't help anyone else's mood or enjoyment of the match.\n\n\nWhile there is a distinct positive outcome from most premades, there is definitely a greater downward tilt when it happens.
