Who the hell thought it was a good idea to make a champions laning phase be based entirely around RNG? His kit is designed to just sit in lane and push. Nothing else at all. Atleast Nasus gets to come down once a game because he wants to smash the the enemy ADC with his 600 stacks. But with Tryndamere all you can do is sit in your lane. And somehow im always playing top when the enemy picks him so im stuck with the boring job of babysitting his ass, and he always gets picked after me so i can't even go Rammus top or something to make the lane funny for me. While the rest of my team is making plays and fighting, im in a permanent 1v1 against one of the least interesting champions in the game. Im just not sure how Tryndamere hasn't been put on the VGU list yet because he is a shining example of poor champion design.\n\n{{champion:126}}: He looks like one of the biggest fuckbois on the planet. But you never get to bash his face in because his play style is \"Im a poke mage, i get to chunk you for 1/3 of your health. Oh but you just dashed on top of me, now im a fighter who can just push you away. Look im a poke mage again.\" His Melee form covers almost all of the weaknesses his ranged form has and his ranged form bails him put of all matchups that should be annoying for the average melee fighter. Like what the hell Riot?\n\n{{champion:76}}: Riot knows how to fix her, but refuse to do it. Ever since she was allowed to jungle for pretty much no reason shes been overbearing and one of the top junglers in the game for pros. This wouldn't be the end of the world if she was interesting to watch/play against, but shes not. Every time the camera shows the Nidalee in the first 10 minutes or so, its just her farming really fast so she can run into the enemy jungle and do the same thing. You get to see 1 gank, and when the stars align you might get to see her gank twice in a pro game, but mostly shes just farming really fast and I feel like it takes away from the game. Normally when i dont see an annoying champion for a while my hatred for them goes down a little bit, but Nidalee is special in the fact that every time i see her in my games or in a LCS game i feel even more bored than the last time i saw her. Riot keeps nerfing her but it never does anything because shes always still there still doing the same old shit. They know Nidalee is in the club of champions that can't be balanced for both pros and normal players, yet while {{champion:268}} {{champion:429}} and other members of the group sit there in the gutter, they keep on thinking that Nidalee isnt like that and cant be fixed when she just shouldn't be allowed to jungle. At the rate their going, Riot will end up killing off all the Nidalee mains and throw her on the VGU list (probably ahead of Tryndamere too) when they could just kick her out of the jungle and buff her up to let her play mid lane or top lane.

Infinite mobility so he's incredibly hard to hit with skillshots.  Windwall to negate your powerful spells, ultimates, or even basic attacks without you being able to do anything (the success or failure of wind wall is all on the Yasuo player's reactions).  An insanely strong shield that can often negate any damage that does get through his other two defences, and refreshes rather fast.\nNo cooldowns to speak of.  Manaless and AD, meaning that he can stay in lane almost indefinitely *and* is really good at pushing.\nA third-Q which is a long-ranged, wide-skillshot knockup which he can hold for **ten whole seconds** and completely zone you during that time.\nSeriously, the worst-designed champion in the game and it still boggles my mind that he was not only released, but still exists in that state after three years.\n\n{{champion:64}}\nOverloaded kit and way too forgiving.\nYes, he takes mechanical skill, but his kit allows him to make tons of mistakes and still either get out alive, or even kill his opponent.\nHe also has very little counterplay other than \"hope the Lee Sin player is bad\".\nI never feel like I've been outplayed by a Lee Sin, rather when one beats me I feel like there was nothing I could do to avoid it because that Lee Sin player could hit his buttons fast enough that there was no counterplay.\n\n{{champion:238}} \nBecause his kit gives the false illusion of counterplay when it fact it has fairly little other than counterbuilding him with Zhonya's Hourglass.\nWhen he ults you, can just spam all of his abilities and is guaranteed to hit them (because he's already inside you), and then blink back to safety.  It takes you a while to die because of the mark, but short of an Hourglass or some kind of barrier/shield spell, there's not actually anything you can do to prevent yourself from dying in most cases.  The delay gives the illusion that there's something that you can do, but often there isn't.  You're already dead, you just haven't caught up yet.\nAdd the fact that he's another manaless AD caster who can push easily with no cost, and is also quite low-risk because of the escapes in his kit.\nOf the three, I think he's the one that could most easily be \"fixed\" and made into a healthy champion with a small-scale rework, rather than outright deleted.\n\n\nHonourable mention:\n{{champion:429}}\nShe would be on the list if she wasn't currently nerfed to the point that I never see her.\nThe infinite hopping which makes her hard-counter any champion with a shorter range than her and without a strong gapcloser/burst should not exist in the game - and it also looks ridiculous and breaks her theme, to boot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"option paralysis","date":"2016-12-03T19:05:46.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:114}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:23}}","replies":[{"poster":"Vesemir","date":"2016-12-03T19:10:22.343+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you want from my waifu dammit","replies":[{"poster":"Zen Ineth","date":"2016-12-03T19:37:26.003+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is Tryndamere your waifu","replies":[{"poster":"resumed","date":"2016-12-04T01:55:50.934+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"the real question is why isnt he yours\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/53d880cb7fde471393096227b39f1e86.png","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zach Sandwhich","date":"2016-12-03T17:15:42.886+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:16}}: I heard you pulled off a flashy combo and nearly killed my ADC, _but how about no?_\n\n{{champion:143}}: If she could, she'd probably make a giant plant middle finger to any melee support.\n\n{{champion:67}}: I may be 0/12, but I will still 1v5 you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2016-12-03T18:03:12.584+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:157}} Because.\n {{champion:64}} He is overloaded......(notice I am not saying Op)\n {{champion:27}} To stop this stupid shit about the \"support\" singe...........","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sckullzz","date":"2016-12-03T18:28:35.297+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:420}} \nHenti gives me night-terrors...\n\n{{champion:16}} \nI just have an irrational fear of bananas.\n\n{{champion:62}} \nBECAUSE MONKEYS ARE ALLOWED TO THROUGH POOP AND I CAN'T.","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2016-12-03T18:30:58.748+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}} {{champion:420}} Take turns making that Hentai.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-12-03T22:14:46.485+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"We already know the answers. \n\nYasuo spams.
