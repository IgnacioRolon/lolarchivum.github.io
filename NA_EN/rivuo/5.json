Sometimes ill go to 5000 ping for no reason.  itll stay at 200-300 ping for a few minutes then go back to normal 24 ping.\r\n\r\nBut i check my internet and everything is working there is no lag or anything and my chart shows there is no spikes on my internet?\r\n\r\nIm not saying its league but maybe something on my computer is interacting with league and giving me hard ping. i know f:lux used to give me 140 ping no matter what until i uninstalled it.\r\n\r\nIs there anything i can do to find out this issue?
