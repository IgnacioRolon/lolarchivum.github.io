And if he had more farm he probably had just as much gold as you if not more.\n\nYea but looking at both of their builds, assuming darius had the cleaver, randuins, and deadmans at that point, it wouldn't matter what hecarim had, he has been outscaled permanently in dueling scenarios.\n\nI will be able to view the video once I get home, but the OP isn't sharing the full story or he really fucked up hard and just doesnt want to admit it/he doesnt see it. The OP said he was fed, and it's possible to \"farm champions\" with a lot of roaming which gives a lot of gold but not a lot of experience, allowing hecarim to get a sizable level lead if he was farming instead of trying to skirmish and kill people.\n\nBaron is a sizable buff, but not ridicilous enough to really tip the matchup in hecarim's favor. Hec's team also got a bunch of drakes while the OP had none, fire drakes would help to further skew the battle if they made up any part of the drake advantage.\n\nEDIT\n\nAlthough I couldnt see the video, the OP laned against an AD top lane and an AD jungle, and yet he bought spirit visage before buying randuins, he completed randuins at the 32 minute mark, after the duel. That in and of itself is a pretty huge fuck up. I understand that there is a twisted fate, but why the hell delay randuins for spirit visage when your lane opponent and the jungler are both heavily AD? Not to mention, the OP doesn't know how to or refused to farm up like an intelligent league of legends player. No game should end with a jungler having equivalent farm to a solo laner. The fact that hecarim had only one cs less than darius at the end of the game is a red flag.\n\nAt 30 minutes the OP had {{item:3742}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3065}} {{item:1011}}\n\nHecarim had {{item:3078}} {{item:3009}} {{item:1401}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3742}} \n\nUpon further checking, here was another red light.\n\nThe OP went W over E max. Oh boy... What is this? Season 4? Holy shit. Max E over W always. The OP was missing out on incredibly valuable free armor pen against a bruiser. Cmon, first grade darius tips here.\n\nAlso, OP ran stormraiders surge while hecarim went SoTA, so the keynote advantage goes heavily to hecarim. Stormraiders is a terrible keynote on darius when fighting against other durable opponents, especially if you're going to derp and max W over E so you miss out on armor pen.\n\nAnd the veterans scars over runic armor... No scale, no scale at all. Pure early game, fall off like a brick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivuo","date":"2016-11-04T16:46:42.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TragicTricks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2pTBLsUH,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-11-04T16:39:58.926+0000)\n>\n> If he had a 2 level lead on you, im going to assume he had more farm.
