Provided they followed an object oriented approach when coding the game, yes it should be fairly simple to accomplish being that they have hundreds of coders and code comments are a thing. They somehow manage to code new champions every other week. They are coding an entire new client (Which no one asked for). Yet their player base has been CLAMORING for a proper death recap since like what, season 2? I'm sorry but the excuse \"My job is hard\" really doesn't fly with me when I'm a paying customer. Perhaps if their project managers actually looked at what the community wanted, instead of just pushing whatever agenda they came up with, it would get done. \n\nLet me explain to you how easy it really is; Stand up in the coder meeting and say \"Hey, on your own time, the first one to come up with a working death recap gets a 10k bonus.\" - Would be done in a week.\n\nKass","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-12-26T15:22:59.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't be done in one week.\nYou don't really know how much spaghetti code there is (probably years of worth) and just refactoring the client spaghetti code took months, and we're still in open beta that's nearing at the end of 2016, beginning of 2017.\n\nGranted, Death Recap isn't as complicated as the new client but Riot's resources are already occupied with the new client and they don't want to spend months in the beta, they're trying to deliver the new client in the optimal working shape as soon as possible so they can then give us new and improved features, monumentally quicker then before.\n\nDeath Recap wasn't something that was broken since Season 2 because that was still League's growth spurt.

Anyone who tries to defend Riot on the death recap is just being a biased asshole. \n\nYes we love League, Yes Riot has made the best game and they are excellent at so much stuff, but for a competitive ass game there is no reason for rift scuttle to do 600 magic damage to me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Νichirin","date":"2016-12-24T16:39:47.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol...yesterday *Illaoi* killed me with game_spell_name_evelynnR which dealt 150 true damage..just..c'mon..Evelynn are you hiding into Illaoi again?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-12-24T15:22:34.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is Rito's damage recap in LCS looks fine...That means they don't have issue calculating damage dealt in a certain time period, then why it is so hard to fix death recap for them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-23T07:06:16.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unless your using a mac, get fucking overwolf for video replay and if you only want numbers send an E/Gmail to riot telling them you want a better death recap.\n\nand yes the one right now is confusing because  I got killed buy a 900 damage{{summoner:14}}  and a 500 damage{{summoner:31}} during poro king.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-12-24T15:20:05.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got ignited twice.
