Let me know what you find!\n\nYour average ping was 34 milliseconds.\n\nThe worst ping you experienced was 70ms. This means you experienced high ping during this game, which is likely where you were seeing issues. See below for a few recommendations to help out with this.\n\nPACKET LOSS OVER TIME\n \n0%\n0.5%\n1%\n1.5%\n2%\n2.5%\n3%\nYour average percentage of packet loss for this game was 0.89%.\n\nOverall, this means you had a low amount of packets lost during the game.\n\nClick here to jump straight to solutions\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN?\nPing is the amount of time it takes for your computer and our server to communicate. A high, consistent ping results in the delay you sometimes feel between clicking and seeing your champion act. This is more predictable than packet loss; action is delayed, but smooth.\n\n\n\n \nSOLUTIONS\nBefore getting started on the following solutions, check out the server status page to see if there are any known issues affecting servers.\n\nHigh ping can be caused by problems on your home network, with your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or, most importantly, by your relative location to the game servers you’re playing on. If your ping is consistent, but relatively high, you may be located far from your region’s game servers. In this case, troubleshooting steps may not be as useful.\n\nQUICK FIXES\nIf you’re playing on a wireless connection, switch to a wired connection or move as close to your router as possible.\nUnplug your router and modem, leave them unplugged for 30 seconds, then plug them back in. This reset can often clear up intermittent network problems.\nClose other network-heavy programs before playing a game (such as torrents, streaming video services, or other games).\nNetwork firewalls on your router or computer may cause degraded network performance. Check out our guide here for info on how to add exceptions for League of Legends.\nIN-DEPTH SOLUTIONS\nContact your ISP to see if you’re eligible to upgrade your hardware. The latest networking hardware can improve your connection, and older hardware can cause degraded network performance over time.\nLook into transferring your LoL account to another server closer to where you live. Playing on a nearby game server will help alleviate consistently high ping.\nIf none of these steps are successful in improving your connection, contact your ISP again to see if there are any known network issues in your area.","replies":[]}]}]}
