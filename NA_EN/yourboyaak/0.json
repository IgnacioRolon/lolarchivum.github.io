Let's focus on your latency (ping) issue first. Inconsistencies or jumps in latency (ping) are typically caused by certain issues along your network routing that cause your connection to take a longer path to the servers. Before we take a look at your network routing to our servers, I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nPlease let me know if this caused any observable change to your latency.","replies":[]}]}
