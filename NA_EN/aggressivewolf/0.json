As a quick introduction let me flash some of the most common champions you will face during your stay at toplane:\r\n\r\n{{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:84}} AND LETS NOT FORGET THE NEWEST EDITION TANK FUCKING {{champion:112}}.\r\n\r\nNow, you may ask, Wolf why are you quitting due to one cancerous LCS build when your up against cancer all the time!?\r\n\r\nBecause the other cancers HAVE COUNTERPLAY. Irelia can have her shit dodged. Darius has weak spots (in his Q) and can simply be kited or played safe against. Sion can have his shit dodged. Aatrox can have his shit dodged. Riven is manageable early game. Yasuo is mained by idiots (most of the time).\r\nUrgot can have his shit dodged and can be bullied (by my experiences) , Tryndamere will just afk split push while you win the game. I can dodge champ select vs jax and alkali.\r\n\r\nBut viktor, no. He will:\r\n\r\n1) Out movement speed you, you cannot run from him nor catch him. (thanks for giving a mage the ability to run at 600 mv speed)\r\n2) Out last you, shields up to 13% of his max mana on practically no cool down that keeps procing Kleptomancy which will most likely give him sustain items ontop of his corrupting potion that has time warp tonic.\r\n3) Out damage you. THIS IS THE POINT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I HAVE HAD DEATH CARDS THAT READ 1500 SIPHON POWER DMG WHEN VIKTOR HAS 180 AP? WTF? AND ITS FROM BASICALLY 3 CASTS OF THE ABILITY. ON NO COOLDOWN.\r\n4) You can&#039;t even play safe against him because he is ranged. He can poke you under tower, out of tower, fucking ontop of the tower it doesn&#039;t matter. And if he IS HIT by a turret shot, he is most likely shielded.\r\n5) He scales well into late game, as I have mentioned above he deals ~~fucking ~~  amazing amounts of damage with as little as 180 ap so when he does start building Ap and gearing away from his iceborn, your fucked.\r\n6) The part that annoys me the most is his dodge-able abilities don&#039;t even matter, his laser and gravity field don&#039;t matter because he deals enough damage without the laser and runs at mach 50 with a shield so he doesn&#039;t need the field to keep himself safe.\r\n\r\nAll of this leaves us with a point and click tank juggernaut mage that does well in the early game, is a capable lane bully and scales well into late game with no apparent weakness. I have defeated tank Viktor once as some idiot first timed it and went 1/6 in 10 minutes. 10 minutes later im being 2 shot by the same Viktor while my team is ravaged with his Chaos storm. \r\n\r\nIf anyone disagrees Im welcome to hearing counterplay for someone that mains non-mobility champions and his junglers basically tell him to go fuck himself if he pings for help.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time looking forward to the addition of shield bash {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-10-27T18:42:24.929+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk Hashinshin went 0/19 on it so it must be unviable, Riot needs to buff it\n\n/s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Festive Bear","date":"2018-10-27T18:40:28.335+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"*Sorry this is quite the rant*\nAs a Darius one-trick, I can confirm it is horrendous right now. Recently had a game against a Viktor top, DEMOLISHED the kid, I mean, he was 0/4 before the game had really ramped up. I leave for 10 minutes or so, walk around the map, a few skirmishes here (cuz I'm already pushed up to second tier tower top). I come back, and I find the Viktor 5/4, with an item on top of me. How is this possible???\n\nLater on, what was my destructive lead, turned into a nuisance as I was attempting to press my advantage on their carries and other laners but soon found it near impossible when Viktor was there, why? Because he would not stop dealing damage. Every second of the fight, he was on top of us tearing us apart. I could not find a single moment when I could jump on top of him and try and pry him off. He would sprint away, laser my team, q me, stun me, then that was it. It's a complete suicide attempt to focus him in team fights because he can silence, stun, and slow you whilst running away at mach 1. Don't forget he also has a shield, and is A TANK so if you focus him, good luck killing him in time before the rest of his team kills you.\n\nI find it ridiculously unfair to have this as a strategy. Same with inting Sion, and same with Irelia in general. Darius is incredibly proned to being kited. Same with almost everyone else on that list. Buit Irelia, Viktor, Sion and Trynd have honestly taken a shit in the soup that is top lane. (To be fair, I have won lane against MANY Tryndameres, even good ones, BUT then proceed to almost loose because they afk split push, join a random fight, delete you with their 1k damage autos, and continue on their merry fkin way.)\n\nIf Riot is going to be allowing these kinds of champions to exist, that's fine. What they can't allow is their simply, anti-fun playstyles. Tryndamere should not be able to activate his ultimate under stuns, silences, knockups, or other CC like that (that would regularly not allow you to cast anything). Irelia's scaling needs to be turned wayyyy down. If she manages to complete her item before you, that's game honestly, and dueling her in any way shape or form within minions (early game for that matter) is off the table. Sion, BUFF TOWERS, make them deal % max health damage or something, some way to counter super tanks because else they're worthless once you have 1-2 tank items. And finally, Viktor, lower his unique item AP scaling, or the same but with his Q, maybe even force his movespeed buff and stun to scale with his AP?? So he'll be forced to build AP in order to really get value out of the extra parts in his abilities.\n\n*link to the match* https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2894593572/227820752?tab=overview&participant=1","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-10-27T19:26:20.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Viktor doesn't have a silence.

In fact, the match up is hard but winnable, even though it depends more on the darius and RNG than the trynda.\n\n And, well, trynda afk farm because he can't teamfight efficiently ( unless you face a team that forget their carries, you will be CCed and kited for 5 seconds and die, which is ~~not ~~less the case in 1 v 1 or 1 v 2 ).\n\nI however agree that trynda’s ult is working out of all logic possible, but I m clearly relying on that to go through lanes like urgot. If they nerf that … well, trynda will become like the 1st aatrox ( ie unknown ), riot will ~~destroy ~~rework him then we’ll have another broken champ.\n\nIf that makes you happy, tryndamere cannot do anything vs viktor as soon as he gets 1st upgrade ( he gets more speed with it than what you get with rank 2 boots + another ms item, and he doesn’t need to farm thanks to klepto so outfarm is not an option ).\n\nIn the list given in the main post, trynda can face and win ( with equivalent jungle+laner presence ) lots of match up. However, the one you face are viktor ( unwinnable despite at least 6 different builds tested ), urgot ( winnable IF the other player makes mistakes ) and the other from time to time. I can’t speak for aatrox since I permaban him.\n\nBut be sure any change like this will not happen. Riot likes diversity, and they enjoy having 1 champ moving on another lane even when it means 3 laners disappear. They are planning to waiiiiiiiit since _“top laners without much Viktor experience will take a bit to build up the experience needed to play it usefully.
