I tried selecting \"Unlock Permanent Skin\" and I got a popup saying that my shard popped back out and to try restarting my client. After restarting my client I was unable to select \"Unlock Permanent Skin\" option. I've been trying for several days and I still can't unlock it. I even tried logging in using a different PC. I've read similar post and none of the solutions worked for me.
