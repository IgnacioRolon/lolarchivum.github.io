He is the most antifun champion in game. All he has to do is run around and split push and no one can stop him since he is retardly fast. I am starting to think there needs to be a movement speed cap. Hecrium gets retarded damage from his E also because of movement speed.\r\n\r\nUdyr is just toxic play and either give every other champion a speed boost or something. I'm sure everyone else in this game would be happier if udyr would just slow down to make his \"split pushing\" more of a riskier play.","replies":[{"poster":"U cl y r","date":"2015-01-08T17:06:10.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got a problem with me?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-08T05:51:08.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ony ting notable that bothers me is movement speed cap.... uuh NOPE\nI like my rammus and way he is tyvm\nalso something about Hecarim's \"damage\" oh heeeeell naaaaw...\nHecarims dont often build damage, shit they dont even build movement speed\nmaybe triforce at most\n\nNow about Udyr's split pushing\nIdk.. seems okay to me\nRek sai pushes much faster with a much more ridicuous escape...\nTryndamere simply doesnt die and spins over a wall, end of story \nTeemo with runaans+shrooms+camo is by far the safest thing ever\nI dont think split pushing has every been all that risky..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-01-08T18:54:50.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, you're in Silver IV, that doesn't give you all that much leeway with calling someone else a Bronze.\n\nSecondly, Udyr is fine, coming from another Jungler. He's only difficult to deal with if he gets fed early on, but the same can be said for almost any other jungle champion.\n\nPowerful ganks? His gank is literally running headfirst into the lane with a small MS boost. Assuming you're playing smart and not constantly shoving, and if you have wards up, you literally should never get ganked by an Udyr, if you are getting ganked constantly by an Udyr, you're doing something wrong. Very. Very. Wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Whitest Kid U KO","date":"2015-01-08T20:47:15.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all I'm a diamond player so I believe I know what I'm talking about.

Udyr doesn't get played competatively but that doesn't mean he doesn't need fixed. Udyr has overly stupid powerful ganks. Udyr's later game has been a problem for a long time. He is just too fast compared to anyone else.
