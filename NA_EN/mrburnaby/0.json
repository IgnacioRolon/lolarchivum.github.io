First, you may see features like the [**Annotated Timelines**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/client/client-features/road-pre-season-replays-horizon) and the record button before you&rsquo;re able to download and watch a replay. This is an expected part of the rollout process, but we wanted to give you a heads up. Second, the initial live test will be in NA. We&rsquo;ll continue to keep you updated on progress as we get closer to a global launch. In the meantime, let us know what you think!\n\n~MrBurnaby","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Kara","date":"2016-11-12T04:28:15.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is the folder where downloaded replays are located?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Rapwnzel","date":"2016-11-15T01:46:44.656+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your replays and highlights should be saved in a local directory, something like this: C:\\Users\\<Insert Your User Name Here>\\Documents\\LeagueofLegends\\","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UnbornHeretic","date":"2016-11-10T23:47:09.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the reeplay system so far.

Is there any way to which the files could be compatible with  Premiere Pro if possible since I use that program to edit my videos on (which I'm sure most of us do as well at this time).

It's fairly benign for items built and all the stats you can get in post-game, obviously. But there are things like total spell cast counts for each spell which may be a gray area (though it could prove an interesting stat to know about yourself). And then other things that appear to indicate a player's ping, who in the game that player had muted, who in the game had muted that player, if they were detected AFK that game, etc. which I'm guessing you'd probably not want people to be able to freely download and view?\n\nAlso, thanks for keeping the .rofl file format from way back when you guys tried replays the first time around :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-11-09T20:36:00.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-I7VzI6nPafw/VOJQYWjxugI/AAAAAAAASV0/mek_Obf7zG8/s1600/jojo30omg4.jpg\n\nWorked perfectly, thanks!","replies":[]}]}
