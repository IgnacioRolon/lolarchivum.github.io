They are using the “competitiveness” excuse to expand the TFT game into a pro scene and whatever. You know why everyone plays ranked TFT over normal TFT? There is no downside to it other than party restrictions.\r\n\r\nIn TFT, you aren’t teamed with **trolls, inters, griefers, toxic teammates, racist teammates, afks, and the matchmaking is semi-competent.**\r\n\r\nIn SR, all those things have a much higher likelihood of appearing in ranked.
