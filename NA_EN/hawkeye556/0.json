In game I have been lvl 30 for almost 2 full seasons. Is there some weird leveling system in the boards separate from the game? or is this just a glitch.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nHawkeye556","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T22:41:17.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your Boards and Summoner profiles fall out of sync if you haven't used the boards in a while.

I've encountered this before, but on a normal way. This was when I was on a different platform, (aka server eune, euw et.c). It said just like you said, atleast lvl 7. But as I can see that you're posting from a level 30 account. Obviously a bug. If this keeps going on, turn your direction to the Riot Support and they will help you more than I, hopefully..!\n\nBest wishes, A Kat Main {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-11-14T16:44:55.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Looks like a glitch,\n\nGet rekt.","replies":[]}]}
