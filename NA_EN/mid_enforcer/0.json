Even if you go 2-8, you will still get silver.\n\nBUT BUT BUT. Do not do placements this season. WAIT until next year. \nIf you do it this year, you get silver. Next year, you WILL get bronze. You always drop, so just save your freebie for next year.\n\nI have heard of some really high rank players start above silver. But I think you would need to be playing diamonds in normals consistently, Idk for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"MiD Enforcer","date":"2017-10-15T09:31:45.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info.
