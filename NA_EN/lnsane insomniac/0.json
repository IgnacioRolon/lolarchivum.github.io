I also get that there's going to be updates etc., but you know how League's balance team screws up League a lot? LoR's balance team is like... League's team on steroids pumped with every known drug that is designed to screw you. \r\n\r\nThink of it as whenever you play a game and your Yasuo is horrible but the enemy team's Yasuo is a god? It's literally the same thing, but instead of individual skill, it's RNG and you are your allied Yasuo while your opponent is the enemy Yasuo\r\n\r\nGreat game btw. 7/10.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-26T03:58:54.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't it a card game, like MTG or Hearthstone? Randomness virtually defines the genre (which is why I don't enjoy it). It shouldn't be a surprise, and it's not something that's going to change.","replies":[]}]}
