And my personal postings seem to get auto deleted within minutes of being posted. And I have not posted a single post in days.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out the follow active threads in the \"Team Recruitment\" that are still advertising just like we have been doing for the last 2 years.\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/3EX0AExL-support-main-lf-goldplat-team-to-playsub\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/3EX0AExL-support-main-lf-goldplat-team-to-playsub\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHaving one section dedicated to Prized Tournaments and allowing us to advertise our non profit events would really solve a lot of problems!

I really want to help out, and I know my suggestion would benefit 100s of smaller start ups and the many large organizations like mine. \n\nI'm simply trying to protect the interest of the smaller sites, and offer a fair advertising to all of us.{{champion:78}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"denipon","date":"2015-03-04T16:27:31.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should try posting in Esports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePinkGoat","date":"2015-03-04T22:50:27.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct we run random mixed elo and pre made team brackets.

Saw your post and decided to check them out, as my 5s team is looking for some premade 5s tournaments.  Sadly, your \"we encourage smurfing\" stance in the rules has turned me away.  I wish y'all did some fair tournaments and my team might be up for them.  But I don't really feel like playing Diamonds (or their smurf accounts).  Just free RP for high elo players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThePinkGoat","date":"2015-03-04T19:05:20.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm happy to discuses this with you.
