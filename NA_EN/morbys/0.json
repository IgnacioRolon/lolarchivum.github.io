Its strong the entire game and let me say again, can be kept on with the only punishment that his movement is slowed? As if that matters b/c he can kill someone that gets close all the while not having to pay attention to anything since the ability has zero interaction, apart from just turning it on. His kit is nice but that ability is just busted and needs tuning desperately.","replies":[{"poster":"Immortal Fenix","date":"2019-04-29T21:25:15.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just it. The punishment IS that he moves slow. He can't chase like that, and he's already pretty slow to begin with. Not only that, but I remember his W dealing less on-hit damage from item procs, as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2019-04-29T21:34:06.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, urgot attacks 3 times per second but does 33% damage. \nIt applies Cleaver stacks regularly but in 1v1 situations is basically 1.00 aps. \n\nSince he keeps it on indefinitely, hes rewarded for building squishier rather than Cleaver into Gargoyle/GA etc","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-29T21:50:18.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ACTIVE: For 4 seconds, Urgot is ghosted, gains 40% slow resist and autonomously basic attacks the nearest enemy at 3.0 attack speed, prioritizing enemy champions marked for Purging, refreshing the mark with every attack. He can keep attacking without interrupting his movement, but while firing his base movement speed is reduced by 125.\n\n> Attacks deal modified damage, down to a minimum of 50 damage against minions, with only 50% on-hit damage and cannot critically strike.\n\n> MODIFIED DAMAGE:\n12 (+ 20 / 24 / 28 / 32 / 36% AD)\n\nPros:\n\n* 3.0 AS\n* 40% slow immunity\n* Ghosting (ignores unit collision)\n* Attacks while moving\n\nCons:\n\n* -125 base MS\n* No manual target selection\n* No crits\n* 50% on-hit damage\n* 36% AD scaling\n\nBasically, the interaction you're looking for is avoiding his other abilities and sitting in a wave of your creeps. If he uses W in that situation, the only thing damaging you is his passive.","replies":[]}]}
