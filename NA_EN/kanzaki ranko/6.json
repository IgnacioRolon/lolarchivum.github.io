Examples of this would be Vayne and Kog because their damage continuously scales well based on levels and enemy hp regardless of their own gold. Same thing with Kindred.\n\nNo one in this game can truly 1v5 like Anti-Mage or Faceless Void. We still have a concept of hard carry that applies to others besides marksmen though, and thus we still have a concept of a truly powerful late game carry.\n\nA passive steroid that you cannot reliably control or press on-demand does not count. This includes Varus and Caitlyn. High ratios on Q mean nothing in a late game teamfight because you will be pumping out dps using your basic attacks. Caitlyn has some of the worst AS at all stages in the game. Pretending that you can ignore that for massive Q poke and play her like Graves is silly. And it's the ONLY 'steroid' she has.

Tristana statistically has the worst damage per game out of almost all marksmen. The reason safety is so essential to hyper carry status is that if you aren't safe, you're dead, and if you're dead you aren't dealing damage.\n\nIn fact, safety is more determinant of a hyper carry than the damage they deal.\n\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} are all the marksmen hyper carries, and of those 6, 2 have inherently massive range, 3 have major range steroids, all 6 have self peel, and 4 have mobility.
