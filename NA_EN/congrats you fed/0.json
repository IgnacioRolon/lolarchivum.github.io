Now the only game that i think should be viewed as toxic in the slightest out of these three is the 3rd one. After I got my 2 week ban and my brother got his account permabanned (reduced to 2 week sentence) I decided that I just needed to type way less so i completely turned all chat off. Now I really think that the ban system needs reformed because of how its automated and not reviewed, but i will leave that out so this isn't biased. I'm not even that upset I just feel i've been done wrong by the system. I completely reformed, did what riot wanted me to do, and i got reported in these games because I guess I said things they didn't want to hear. I have my all chat turned off and I have not flamed a single person since I got my 2 week , i have even been getting probably 50% more honors for friendliness. Really don't know what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"LordBadToo","date":"2019-05-04T17:44:58.421+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When something looks hard to believe, it usually is.

You don't need to say anything to people who are being jerks; just mute them. When you get into a back-and-forth it makes a bad situation worse. It's bad enough to have to deal with a jerk on the team without also having to deal with another teammate egging them on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-05-04T17:38:28.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"were you off a recent 14 day ban?\n\nbecause they give you a notification that any further issues will result in a perma ban\n\ni'm not sure how many matches you need to play (without getting reported) to de-escalate into a point where you aren't at risk for being perma banned","replies":[{"poster":"Congrats You Fed","date":"2019-05-05T04:25:55.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"semi-recent, december","replies":[{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-05-05T14:03:36.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then yeah, this was well warranted \n\nI think you have to play somewhere in the realm of like 300+ matches without being reported for your behavior (matchmade only) to get a de-escalation on your punishment tier","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"skills of luck","date":"2019-05-04T06:07:08.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean if u check the report options, giving up (if a surrender doesn't go thru) is considered an offense. \nOn the other hand, I think a permaban was massive overkill if these 3 games weren't close to consecutive.\nI've said far worse things to teammates but only like 1 in 12ish when teammates are str8 up absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Cant Mid","date":"2019-05-04T06:14:43.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends, saying im giving up on this game and sitting in the fountain are 2 things, people say they give up and keep trying all the time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sona Cant Mid","date":"2019-05-04T06:09:18.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really only game 3 on this could be considered toxic in my opinon, seems like the other 2 are pretty subjective, like there's not much i see that warrants punishment on 2 of the 3","replies":[]},{"poster":"905","date":"2019-05-05T07:27:10.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The system is a failure.
