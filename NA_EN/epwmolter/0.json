It was a little back and forth between me and the enemy player and they didnt get punished. Is there any way for me to try and prove that i can be better and get unbanned? And also one of my games was a joke between my friend. We were joke flaming each other and I guess someone reported me.\n\n\n\nEdit: I wasn't a complete toxic person. You can look at my logs and generally i was trying to keep my team together in ranked. We all have slip ups and im only human. I try to be positive most games its just the specific day I was having some shit happen and i know thats no excuse but in times like that you can't control stuff that happens. It's pathetic and i hope eventually my account will be given a second chance. Rito pls.","replies":[{"poster":"exxpose","date":"2018-11-27T02:28:30.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. You can't undo a permaban.\n\nMake a new account and start over.","replies":[{"poster":"epwmolter","date":"2018-11-29T03:57:32.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well kinda hard to start over when you spent over 500$ on the game for the past 5 years.

You seem very reasonable now, but the facts are you broke the rules enough times to get perma'd.

All my \"warnings\" were given to me back in 2014, I was good this whole time. Matter a fact, I haven't even played the game in 8 months, started it back up 4 days ago. I flame a Lulu who is running down mid til mid laner had 15 kills, 10 min in, she reports me TA-DA perma banned due toxicity. I already tried, and i've read logs from years ago, they aren't going to lift your ban. So start a new account, and save yourself the trouble they don't care. If they did, they would take into consideration the gap between offenses. or be like Videogame Dunkey, and never play this game again because being banned for flamming a moron, shouldn't get you banned.","replies":[{"poster":"epwmolter","date":"2018-12-05T01:59:12.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i already have my new account to 30.
