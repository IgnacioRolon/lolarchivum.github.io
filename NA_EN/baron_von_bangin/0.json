Or just annoyingly repetitive to the point of being cemented in our mind because we had no choice?\n\nI would say Ezreals' museum meme is iconic because Riot and others would refer back to it but most of these old lines are only iconic because the champion had like 15 voice lines to begin with.","replies":[]}]}]}
