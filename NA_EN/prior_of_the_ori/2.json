Everybody is NOT SO bright SOMETIMES. Even Einstein. Actually I think he is right. Dota2 for example can be installed through Steam which has a Linux client. It looks like other companies are willing to make Linux clients, some have already made them and then there is LoL. It's not easy to digest that the best of them all, League of Legends, still lacks a Linux installer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
