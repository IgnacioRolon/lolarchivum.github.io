I&#039;m curious how people feel about the number of champions in the game right now. Do you think we have enough or should riot keep pumping out more? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m personally of the opinion that they should stop making new champions for the time being, let the game settle for a bit, focus on improving other things instead. \r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-07-27T21:43:59.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are focusing more heavily on reworking old champs for now and releasing champions much more slowly than in the past.
