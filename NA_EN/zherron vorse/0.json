When he decloaks his goggles are supposed to go back up and the infrared beams are supposed to disappear. However instead of the infrared beams disappearing they are instead harsher and more visible than when he was invisible and it looks like he has two glow sticks sticking out of his head. The glitch isn&#039;t very noticeable at first but if you cloak then decloak it seems to add more of the same particle effects to the infrared beams and eventually after around 5 cloaks it appears to just be green rods sticking out of his head.\n\nThis has been happening for a few patches now but I never said anything about it cause I thought someone else would notice it and it would be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-10T18:40:25.199+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! Thanks for the report! We are aware of the issue, and will be working on a fix. It's a bit less of a priority than some of the other bugs we have, but it's absolutely on our list to resolve. :)\n\n**EDIT:** I poked our VFX friend and he's working to get a fix in. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zherron Vorse","date":"2017-01-13T17:48:21.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for telling me this... I didn't see it until now cause I didn't have internet for about a week... But as a teemo main with every skin this glitch has made me avoid the Omega skin and I'm happy I will be able to spam my \"You want Teemo? COME AND GET HIM!\" taunt again at my withering enemies. lol\n\nHail {{champion:17}} ","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-19T17:46:16.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha, well, you are free to spam again!
