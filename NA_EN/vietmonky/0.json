I have been playing this game for years and years and enjoyed every single thing it has to offer even with the many changes. To sum it up before the last year of my life I had only been banned once a few years prior and that got me shook so I straightened myself up right away. What changed the past year is that I have been dealing with nerve pain (the head and neck area) and headaches that never relent, and are 24/7. It has gotten progressively worse destroying every part of my life such as starting with school as the length of the pain screwed with my concentration and memory making it impossible to study and attend class. All my aspirations and dreams of sports and school were being suffocated and still are being suffocated by this pain to this day. I hate my life at this state right now, but League kept me alive and doing something I enjoy as all the doctor appointments and pain clouded my mind all day every day. Although I was having fun playing League I still had hate toward the real world which has shown in the game the past year through my subconscious thoughts that spurted through my keyboard as I have been banned twice the past year (these bans were all for chat toxicity and not inting,griefing or trolling) and these bans were only for arguing with a teammate and swearing things of that sort. However, when I was in champ select and I saw that my account had been permanently banned I felt as if something had been ripped from me as it has been most of what I have been doing &quot;correctly&quot; the past few months every day. I know my medical condition does not make an excuse for me being a bad person in game; this game was all I had and now that I have lost my account that might I say raised as my own the past few months I feel wrong as if I just lost someone. This may be hard to believe to most people, however, I just want a second chance and I will not fail that second. **So my cry is that RITO can you please UNBAN my account a second chance is what I need right at this moment ** As of now this game is my therapy and escape from the real world so RIOT you could call yourselves doctors because you are doing more than they are because they don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong and I hope the best for your company.\nThank you, \nKenn (vietmonky) \n**Thank you for taking your time to read this it means a lot","replies":[]}
