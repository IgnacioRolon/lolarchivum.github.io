Oddly,  I noticed that my latency failed to change when this happened and I could still see new spells and abilities hitting my character in a spaced fashion. Clearly I was still receiving some information, just my ability to input new commands seemed to be affected. Additionally tabbing out would still allow me to navigate to an arbitrary website. \r\n\r\nI proceeded with the following investigatory steps:\r\n\r\nA series of speedtest.net tests to a local server in virginia produced results of 40-80mb/s down and .2-20mb up.\r\n\r\nA series of speedtest.net tests to a server in chicago produced results of failure-50mbs down and failure to 10 mb up.\r\n\r\nping -n 100 to riots na server 104.160.131.3 resulted in  (I ran this a couple of times the results are representative) :\r\nPing statistics for 104.160.131.1:\r\n    Packets: Sent = 100, Received = 83, Lost = 17 (17% loss),\r\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\r\n    Minimum = 29ms, Maximum = 142ms, Average = 35ms\r\n\r\nPing statistics for 104.160.136.3: (lan server in florida)\r\n    Packets: Sent = 100, Received = 77, Lost = 23 (23% loss),\r\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\r\n    Minimum = 41ms, Maximum = 97ms, Average = 47ms\r\n\r\nPing to my  wan ip (to prove it wasn't a local modem/router problem)\r\nPing statistics for 98.233.14.117:\r\n    Packets: Sent = 100, Received = 100, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\r\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\r\n    Minimum = 4ms, Maximum = 159ms, Average = 8ms\r\n\r\nRan tracert a bunch of times,  trying to find a conspicuously failing branch, no luck.\r\n\r\nRan the test at lolping.org, which I THINK is duplicative of the ping test I already did but got these results   (result variation is representative of the types of results I got during test testing , tested way more times then shown here). I then switched to testing for LAN instead of na (in florida instead of chicago ) and got similar results, also included in the album. Finally, I ran a couple test using the wireless hotspot feature on my phone. Pictures here : http://imgur.com/a/jk3ac\r\n\r\n I  then foolishly attempted to contact Comcast support and explain the above and after going through the \"did you reset your router? Can you browse to google? script\" twice before the third person, who I'm still not convinced actually understood anything was saying, told me that since \"other comcast servers\" came up during the tracert, I should use google to find phone numbers for \"those servers\" and call \"those people\". \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what exactly to make  of this. I think the fact that I have no problems reaching out to my immediate Comcast address eliminates the reasonableness of the problem being inside my house. The fact that the routing issue occurs to both chicago and florida makes me think its an issue that's quasi local with comcast routing. The fact that my phones hotspot has lower latency and less latency variability is absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-15T23:57:05.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From looking at those trace routes, it definitely looks like your main issue is packet loss. Essentially that means that not all of the data coming from your pc is getting to our servers properly, which means that the game can't properly render whats going on. Packet loss can cause some really weird stuff like rubberbanding or champions behaving oddly to your commands.\n\nTake that traceroute and hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Our tech guys will be able to explain what's going on a little better, and they may be able to find a way to smooth out that connection.","replies":[{"poster":"EvaricKyoumi","date":"2017-04-16T02:32:59.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooops,  for some reason I thought this was the ticketing system.

In fact I also did the same things you did, but with a little less CMD work than yours, I also saw that a few other players are having the same problems.","replies":[]}]}
