Unfortunately, the feedback is a bit late, and many of the changes you're suggesting aren't able to be adjusted. Feedback is best giving as early as possible in the PBE cycle so the team has time to discuss and act on any potential changes. \n\n> 1) I don't like how the transformation gauge % is weighted to time, with the 2nd transformation unlocking at ~20 minutes. I play almost entirely Co-op vs AI, so I don't get to access the other 5 forms, really.\n\nElemental power is gained by damaging enemy champions, as well as gaining power passively over time. With that said, there is a bit of constraint so you aren't at your max form by 10 minutes. The spacing of forms was determined due to average game time. \n\nThe team can talk about this one, but currently, the functionality in terms of timing doesn't change per map. It's something we could talk about, but not guaranteed to change.\n\n> Why can't we just pick which form we want, like DJ Sona? I really bought the skin to use the Storm form, but since my game mode doesn't last 30~50 minutes, I'm never going to be able to use it, realistically. Even if the transformation gauge scaled to game mode, that still means I'm using a form I'd rather not use that game for half the game...\n\nThe goal of this skin was to have players discover which elements could be combined to create new ones. Lux is an elementalist, and thus, needs to learn how to craft and use new elements - this is why she starts off in a classic Light form. By allowing a limited amount of forms per game, it a. for the player, encourages choices. This was a conscious decision with the design team. We did consider other options, but ultimately (heh), wanted a more unique experience, and something that didn't piggy back off of DJ Sona. Lastly, we didn't want an enemy to have to worry about 10 forms in one game - it may be a bit difficult for someone to memorize which form Lux was in the last time you saw her, and hope she hasn't changed forms since.\n\n> 2) Her Q/W/E tend to look very samey visually, so it's hard to pick apart which one I threw, even as the Lux player\n\nI think this is a personal call. I don't think they look similar, but it's perhaps because I've seen the particles for several months and have become accustomed to them. We did run this by several gameplay teams (like we do every skin), and they had us make adjustments to the first few iterations, but gave us a thumbs up on the final set of particles you're seeing on live. \n\n> 3) Q/W/R, similarly, do not visually match up to their hitboxes well--I know how to play default Lux, but the different visual sizes are throwing me off with Elementalist Lux.\n\nThe hitboxes are the same in this case - they were tested by our team. We can check them again, though.\n\n> 4) Her shop purchase voiceover lines don't appear to change with the forms, or else I had a bug.\n\nSpoke with our audio engineer, and this particular point is working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"koreansmurf8751","date":"2016-12-01T17:25:25.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"little question id like to drop here\n\nare there any other ultimate/ 1820 skins riots working on that you could\n*cough cough* ¨hint¨ at?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-01T17:43:17.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can promise  you that there isn't another ultimate skin in the works - we just finished up with Elementalist Lux. :) No details for you on if we have any legendaries in the works at the moment, but rest assured, there will be more in the future!","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-01T17:50:43.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long does it take to make an ultimate skin?

D: I know I personally try to respond to everyone, but there are some instances where a personal reply is pretty difficult, especially when you're sounding like a broken record with a copy paste response. *This was an example of what happened to my PBE thread with Elementalist Lux*. But, with that said, we do read the comments and bring them back to the team. \n\nPBE posts have helped us make several changes, based on player feedback. A few examples that I can think of off the top of my head are\n\n* Giving Firecracker Jinx a jade dragon tattoo.\n* Adding Soraka's tattoo back to Order of the Banana Soraka.\n* Giving Zombie Nunu a different colored passive.\n* Adjusting Braum's passive to be skin-specific, when we originally said it would be a gameplay clarity issue. \n* Changing Blood Moon Elise's color scheme three times (I worked on this, it was pretty interesting to see the responses each time - we settled on a happy medium). \n* Changing Sweetheart Sona's hair from a lavender gray to a more white tone. (A player actually had a Photoshop lineup of several options she thought would work!)\n\nAs for bugs, there are a bunch to list, hah. PBE is certainly full of WIP content. \n\nI remember changing one of Mecha Zero Sion's emotes to not be spammable because the mech sound was absolutely horrifying. We most recently changed Winter Wonder Karma's snare particles because they were showing up green, and weren't thematically accurate. \n\n> 1) I never saw the 'passively over time'; as I've been at 100% and still unable to transform until I went out into lane/enemy base to snag them with an E some 45 seconds later.\n\nOur rounding system... isn't the best. It tends to round up right before you are actually at 100% This is a systematic flaw in the game, and not something exclusive to this skin. D:\n\n> I'm well aware that the product has already shipped, so I know we're past the point of swapping to a DJ sona system. I would be very grateful if the weighting on elemental power could be changed for average game times across non-SR queues.\n\nJust giving context as to why choices were made. ^-^ I'm not entirely sure how this is codes, and what the limitations may be for separate queues, but it's something I can poke our designer about. \n\n> Re 2) and 3), it's hard to visually distinguish the edges on some of the abilities like her W, or distinction of her E and Q while in travel due to the soft edges. Specifically, her Q feels like it's not the same visual size as the collision box.\n\nGotcha - I'd be interested to hear your feedback once you've had a week or two under your belt playing this game. I'd be happy to revisit this conversation to see if it's something that is learned with an adjustment period, or something that you're committed saying is off. With legendary and ultimate skins alike, particles can vastly vary in terms of looks, and it may take some getting used to - especially in Lux's case, when you've most likely been playing with base particles for years. D: \n\n> 4) It was just jarring to go from hearing the Air VO while moving in lane, then the Light VO while buying. But, okay, at least I know it's not bugged.\n\nTotally understandable. From what I took away from that conversation was that multiple hookups for purchases was something that wasn't feasible, due to limitations. Elementalist Lux herself is 10 forms (literally 10 skins), which means, we have different particles for each form, allowing for different sound hookups - same goes for her VO. There are constraints for audio in some spaces because she's still considered to be one skin when you're loading into the game itself. One shop, one skin. \n\nI hope this clears up some things, and I'd be happy to continue the conversation. I really do appreciate the feedback and taking the less aggressive path when discussing your thoughts. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xilixer","date":"2016-12-01T18:30:00.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"honestly why would you even play against the ai? you dont even get the feel of playing a real game becuase the ai does duo top and thats not to mention their braindead builds.","replies":[]}]}
