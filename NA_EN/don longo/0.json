Do we need to sign a petition to nerf him?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":207,"down_votes":80,"body":"Everyone I know who plays this game HATES Fizz and he pretty much ruins my experience every time I see him. Its gotten so bad that even when he's on my team it just infuriates me to lay eyes on him. He doesn't make sense. He's naturally more bulky than other casters and assassins, even though he has more mobility and invincibility, which directly influences his overall \"durability\" already, yet he seems to do far more damage than many other champions as well. Why are his moves doing a huge amount of damage, having low mana costs, high utility, and also almost no cooldown? His ultimate is one of the strongest and easiest to land ultimates in the game and it barely has a cooldown. Why does he reduce healing and do percent health damage? Its like they just wanted to give him every possible advantage. I just really can't and don't understand. Can someone show me some numbers to prove why he is fair and balanced when compared to other champions? I would love to see it. \n\nThe concept of balance (or so I REALLY hope) is that if someone is extremely strong in a certain category, they need to be weak in another category to balance them out. Fizz is one of the best champions in the game when it comes to every aspect of his character. That's not balance.\n\nSo, Riot has allowed Fizz to exist like this for far too long, so here's the conclusion I've reached. I'm done waiting for them to nerf him, it isn't going to happen. Maybe if we work together and sign a petition they will be more willing to change him. PLEASE just say you agree he needs changes if you feel that way. Let's draw some attention to this!\n\nHere's the strawpoll to nerf or keep the same.
