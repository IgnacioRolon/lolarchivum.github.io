But ever since the latest patch i get a weird type of lag, in intervals, throughout the game.  Specifically at time stamps between 7:03-7:26, 22:08-24:14, 32:12-35:46 and 41:13-46:43. These are the time stamps where i notice it most. I have asked several other players and they tell me they get the same issue around the same times. Spells and and animations seem to go out of sync, such as MF ult, or a dragon's death.  I've only noticed this after the latest patch, and wonder if there is some issue with Riot servers. it's not completely game ruining, but makes playing most champion's extremely difficult and hitting minions almost impossible. Do you have any information that might lead to a discovery regarding my issue?","replies":[]}]}]}
