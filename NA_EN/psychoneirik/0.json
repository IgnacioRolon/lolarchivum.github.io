Yasuo and Jhin have &quot;assassin&quot; as their secondary role, but they&#039;re not the kind of champions I like to play. So my question is, can we expect to have at least one assassin champion this year? \n\nI also heard about the possibility of an assassin class rework in the preseason, so if it does happen, should we expect to have an assassin champion before or after this?  Also, should we expect an AD or AP assasin first?\n\nI really like the new champions you&#039;ve been releasing, but I think a new assassin would be amazing, especially with your new design philosophy I know I can expect an amazing champion like Ekko was (even if he is not being built the way you expected him to).\n\nEdit: Also, can we expect a Shaco rework anytime soon? He has the potential to be a really awesome assassin and is one of my favorite champions to play, but I feel that he has several problems.","replies":[{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2016-05-05T18:22:00.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco is perfectly fine what is wrong with him?","replies":[{"poster":"Psychoneirik","date":"2016-05-05T18:58:05.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his main problem is how hard he falls late game compared to other champions, I know this is to offset his amazing early game but I think they could smooth the curve a little.

I love the general playstyle of assassins being \"get in, cause some hell, get out.\" I didn't start playing league until just after Ekko came out, so I haven't seen any new assassins come out and I'd love to get excited waiting for a new champ to play.","replies":[]}]}
