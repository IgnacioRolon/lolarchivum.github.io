A good Yasuo player is fast and decisive, so if you're available for a trade he's gonna get you, and he's gonna do it really fast so you'll have very little time to react before he's safe n sound again.\n\nYes, theoretically this will give you those precious _seconds_ where he can't dash through that one same minion again, but there are 6 minions in a no-cannon wave.  And by the time he dashes through the 5th and 6th, the 1st and 2nd are ready to dash through again.\n\nAnother problem I see coming out of this is that this is what some call a \"gateway\".  If we make this sort of visual changes for our opponents, how many other champions will now have to be considered for a similar change?\n\nI think a nice way to take something out of this is to, instead of make it visible to our opponent, allow Yas to dash again through the same target in the time window but punish him for it with a much higher cooldown.  This will separate the good players from the bad ones, and it will open a window for his lane opponents, and we'll call this window the \"that's when Yasuo knew... he f*cked up\" window.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2017-08-01T03:11:15.026+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt people will even attempt to play around his timers anyways","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-08-01T11:44:16.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, no dashing through the same minion.

You only thinks it matters because you are laning against yasuo's who are beginners who dont take advantage of yasuos low resourceless cooldowns.(Unless you are against laggy yasuos) but regaredless....\n\nIf the mark is made visible for enemies on minions then there would also have to be marks shown on monsters and enemies. If its a blind pick game,  then how would you know whos mark is on a monster. Making the mark visible to enemies would also give an unfair advantage to them. Enemies would know if there is a nearby yasuo and they would be able to also use it and trace yasuo.  The visual cues should always be hidden from the enemies. The only possible way riot could allow visual cues are if they added bars under yasuos health bar. Just like Jhin, Annie, and Twisted Fate you  are aware of what the next enemies attack could be. \n\nBut, it doesnt make sense to add a third bar to yasuo. Unlike other champions, a third bar is primarily shown to you so you would know what the next attack would be but its not to see cooldowns on abilitiy. Yasuo's \"e\" is resourcless, and has a low cooldown so there would be no point and no possible way to show minion cooldowns on yasuos \"third bar\". However, yasuo's \"e\" can stack damage with each dash  but the damage is not suppose to feel like yasuo is doing more damage on an enemy when he stacks his \"e\"  magic damage in contrast with a jhin who crits on his 4th consecutive aa.  Since his ap stats for his \"e\" were nerfed early and late game, Its intended to help players farm waves faster in the early game.\n\nIn conclusion, making visual cue visible on yasuo  for enemies would not be fair to all champions . If a visual cue does not affect the champions abilities but affects the way an enemy sees them that would give them an advantage, then riot would have to add visual cues on all the champions. It would be alot of confusing work because it also has to be color coded and sizes of each abilitiy would have to be different. Remeber when I said that the visual cues would just act likes wards? Exactly. There would be no point of wards. It is not fair to only add visible marks on yasuo just because you laned against him. League has a bunch of champions. You need to really understand most champions before suggesting  a change that could be similar, or not fair when compared to other champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2017-07-31T19:19:47.627+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Another thing they should do as far as marking goes..
