So i started this game in around march 2016, and after a couple weeks, took a long break. Now i am getting back into the game, but i want to refund the champions i already bought (only have 2-shaco and katarina). I recall the refund button used to be in a purchased tab on the bottom left of store, but now the interface for store has changed i think? I can't find the purchased section anymore where i can refund my champions. Does anyone know if they removed that purchased tab? Or if it is hidden somewhere? Thanks\n\n\nEDIT: i found the purchased tab under the accounts section in store, but it seems that my shaco and katarina purchase arn't there? The whole thing is just blank. I only bought my heroes 4-5 months ago, is that too long time to still refund?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T18:08:31.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you were able to find the puchase history section!  The store recently went through a [visual update](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/jwhApRPE-store-visual-update-incoming), so some things have moved around.  \n\nAs long as an account has available refund tokens, you can process a refund for purchases made within 90 days per our[ refund policy](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).  Once that time period has elapsed, unfortunately the refund will no longer be available.  I hope that helps clear things up, but let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
