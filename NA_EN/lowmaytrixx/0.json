After getting through the queue, you need to connect to a service called Maestro.  This service is what helps run Champion Selection and connects you to all of the other players in the game.  If you have an unstable connection and it delays your connection to it, it may explain why you enter so late compared to anyone else.\n\nTo get this fixed up, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
