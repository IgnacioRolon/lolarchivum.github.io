It's true that we look for people who have a history of positive behavior on the rift, and those who will give us some great feedback! Sometimes we will send out a batch of invites to players who are heavy players of something we're looking to test. For example, if we were looking to rework Taric, we'd look for those who play a ton of Taric and look fabulous while doing so. :P\n\nYou can find our complete FAQ on the PBE [here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"belacZick","date":"2016-08-21T19:39:01.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot looks at your history of bans, restrictions, or leaver busters, They look for people that have a good attitude and are willing to help so if you have a clean background they probably just aren't accepting that many new people and they also look for people who are in the meta such as a new feature that has to do with junglers they will let high level junglers test out the new feature.
