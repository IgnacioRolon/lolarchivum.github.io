But as you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/ABHYyN7.jpg), he just stays the same as in his normal form. He SHOULD turn white, like [here](http://imgur.com/j906QZz.jpg). This gives this skin a slight disadvantage, since it makes it a bit harder for your team to know when exactly you&#039;re about to transform.\n\n1. Choose Snowday Gnar as the skin.\n2. Attack minions/champions until you have 100 Rage Meter.\n3. Observe the character.\n\nI&#039;ve played about 5 games with the skin, and every time I&#039;m about to transform, he looks the same as if he has 0 Rage Meter, and doesn't turn white.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot iZac","date":"2016-06-03T18:18:55.326+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo!\n\nI'm the VFX dude that worked on him.
