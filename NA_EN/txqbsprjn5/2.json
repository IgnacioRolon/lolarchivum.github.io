For instance, say no compensation is ever administered and Yi builds the same things he does now after direct nerfs to this build. He would proceed to do mediocre damage and just be a bulky champion with no CC, aka basically useless. Scenario 2 with no compensation is this Yi is tired of doing no damage so he goes for a damage build. In this scenario since they trashed his bases (aimed at tank build) and didn't touch ratios his damage is now still PRETTY garbage, but he now dies the second he gets CC'ed since he built damage, aka basically useless.\n\nViktor received 1 nerf to E recently and yes, it did hit his waveclear, but he can still waveclear if ahead and burst people like before. Viktor wasn't breaking any \"rules\" in the game and still scales extremely well, but has to buy a bit more early AP if you REALLY want that 1 E clear the entire wave (which was a tad bit rediculous tbh). Viktor was designed as a bursty wavecleary mage that cleared waves and killed people if they were caught out. He did that and thus, only received a nerf because he did it a little TOO well and can still theoretically do it with a bit more AP. Yi/Fiora on the other hand were designed as \"light fighters\" that have high mobility and shred your back line if you let them, but die relatively easily when focused. They do most of this, but they do it without the downside of \"die relatively easily when focused\" part since they do enough damage with low items and can just for 2 damage+4 tank items. Hitting bases stops this scenario, but makes it so they can now die easily when focused, but also make it so they cannot even kill their targets WITH damage items so it is a complete lose-lose and the champion is now trash tier. This is why scalings were buffed to make it so they can still DO their job at dealing damage. Viktor didn't need a scaling buff because he still kills people since his common build allowed him to do so regardless of his bases since his scalings are already pretty f*cking good. Viktor was a case of \"I will blow you up after I get 2 items\", but was guaranteed those 2 items since E made getting gold a trivial concept since it was guaranteed to clear waves (or atleast the casters) early on regardless if you were 0/2 or 3/0.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LSmaster16","date":"2016-03-22T23:05:22.325+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the reason for compensation buffs is because they don't want to nerf fiora/yi they want to nerf bruiser fiora/yi.","replies":[{"poster":"Igotlazy","date":"2016-03-22T23:26:02.868+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically this.
