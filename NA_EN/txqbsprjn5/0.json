Most people agree he's too simple to play and isn't enjoyable to play as or against. Hell, Old Taric was more interesting than WW and he got reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"tXQbsPrjN5","date":"2016-09-01T00:20:04.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why does it matter if other ppl don't share my sentiments.

They're not going to keep one champion dumbed down so a small minority can continue to enjoy playing him. His ult is cancer to play against even if the champion itself is balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"tXQbsPrjN5","date":"2016-09-01T00:32:33.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yasuo's entire kit isn't cancer right.

He's essentially a watered down Malphite where he can be really tanky but isn't really worth anything aside from his ult. He also lacks any kind of skill ceiling. He's braindead to play and you've pretty much mastered in him 5 games. There's really nothing else you can do with him beyond that.\n\nRiot are wanting to raise his skill ceiling while keeping his kit super simple still, much like Annie where she's mechanically simple, but there's a real difference between a mechanically skilled Annie and someone who isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dale Wardark","date":"2016-09-01T01:11:57.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick was the first champion I ranked to 5 back when the ranks only went up to 5, and when I stopped playing him, I found many different champions mechanically more fun. Honestly, from a business standpoint, Riot can make much more money by making Warwick more fun. I'm excited for a Warwick rework, especially since I know Riot won't completely remove what he used to be. When they reworked Taric, they left the stun and heal, but added so much more. They made the stun much more rewarding to hit, and the heal requires more skill to use. The upcoming Yorick rework keeps his ghouls, his ability to zone out enemies and his splitpushing power, but retools his kit completely to be tons more fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2016-09-01T00:13:09.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"source?","replies":[{"poster":"tXQbsPrjN5","date":"2016-09-01T00:17:57.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/state-champion-update\n\ntl;dr mage unqie update was pointless healthy but we're done unique with them lol, warwick's healthy boring needs a unique rework. delta delta","replies":[{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2016-09-01T00:44:49.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't see anything there saying he'll get a skillshot, just that his skill ceiling will be raised\n\nAltho idr know how they can do that without a SS, maybe a dash?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Juggernaut628","date":"2016-09-01T00:06:17.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How on Earth could you turn a werewolf into someone with a skill-shot?
