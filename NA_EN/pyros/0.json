I would like everyones opinion, my account was banned on December 2018 and I played this game since season 1-2. I know flamming isnt good and thats the reason I got perma banned, but I think everyone desirves a 2nd chance since people waste time and money to get just banned instead of getting some kind of approach to help them not to flame. Leave our comments below if you got anything to say so it could help me retrieve my account, because for me is unfair to just get rid of people if they complain with their reasons and nothing changes, inspite of having a easy solutions for people that flames, called \"mute\", but tell me your opinion. \r\n\r\n\"Hi again, im here to ask some questions and to retrieve my account back.\r\nIm open for any suggestion, i havent played league of some time now, but i really apreciate the game and i've spent a lot of time and money on this account. I just want to play the game on my account, thats all. You guys can disable my chat, I can pay back my account, any value, i can do anything, except spend tons of hours to get a account where I was and with the content I had, from old icons to skins i used my money to buy! \r\nI would like also what kinda of toxicity is choose to be banned and what you guys consider a toxic player. I also use to judge some cases like mine on your tribunal back in the days, but I only saw there people that flammed, what about griefing? Is that relative in ranked? If someone, in 30 minutes, ward 8 times, isnt that a bigger reason to ban? Or if someone just goes solo tons of times and feeds enemy team all game long and doesnt communicate or group up, isnt that a bigger reason to ban someone? Because a flammer can be muted and its possible to win a game. But if a griefer or feeder continues their work, its easy to lose games like that and I believe, along with several players from this community, that, if everyone plays 10 games and gets a griefer or feeder in ranked that doesnt communicate or group as a team, i can guarantee you that if you have those objectives like getting to gold, plat, etc... its just a case of time to you start being toxic. No one plays ranked to lose and with flammer, there is a easy way to ignore them in chat, but with griefers and feeders, there is no way if they dont communicate well with teammembers, group up and just continue their work or troll. \r\n\r\nI am open to any suggestions to get my account back, i can fly to the headquarters, i can pay back my account, i can get my chat permanently disabled, what ever. Just want what i think its mine to keep, as long as the time and money I inserted on this game and account.\r\n\r\nIts one thing resolving the problem itself and create a better community, but its another to never listen to a \"toxic\" or \"flammer\" player opinions and just ban those out of the game after invested a lot! \"Toxic\" or \"Flammers\" are also apart of the community and are also players. Even professionals can be toxic! \r\n\r\nI know this is just going to be another failed attempt like everyone else attempt to get their account back, but yeah, i'll try 'till 80 years old, believe it or not. \r\n\r\nHave a great day,\r\nJoÃ£o Vieira\"\r\n\r\n100% nothing will change as always but yeah, {{summoner:4}}  .","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-02-02T17:15:36.374+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry brother, as of the current policy, accounts that were correctly punished into permaban status will not be overturned. \n\n\nAs for a second chance, you can always start a new account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2019-02-02T17:28:04.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I know flamming isnt good and thats the reason I got perma banned, but I think everyone desirves a 2nd chance since people waste time and money to get just banned instead of getting some kind of approach to help them not to flame.\n\nI totally agree, but you have to realise that you've already HAD your second chance. \n\nAnd Riot has tried giving even more chances in the past, and it has never gone well..\n\nThe punishment ladder goes like this:\n\n10 game chat restrict\n25 game chat restrict\n14 day ban\nPermanent ban\n\nYou can skip levels if you're extremely toxic, but the intention is that you'll never have recieve a permaban without first receiving a 14-day ban.\n\nWhen you recieve the 14 day ban, it states that the next punishment will be a permanent suspension. It warns you, but you don't heed the warning. So in reality, you've already wasted your second chance.\n\nThat being said, Riot has experimented with giving players their accounts back. Sorry to say it, but when they initially did it, 95% of players got banned again. They did an experiment recently, but we don't have the exact stats of it though. News are that it didn't go well, sorry.\n\nAnd these players were the exact same as you. They said they'd never be toxic again. That their chat could just be muted. They'd do anything. And when they got what they wanted, they just got banned again.\n\n---\n\nSo you might understand now why you probably wont be recieving your account back :/\n\nI'm not saying that you'll definently just get banned again, but you're statistically likely to.","replies":[{"poster":"I Like Teemo","date":"2019-02-02T17:35:43.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ive actually asked to be permanently chat banned before and riot refused to do it to my account, so their punishments are pretty set in stone","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2019-02-02T18:38:41.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you're replying to? \n\nPerhaps \n\n> They said they'd never be toxic again.

In your daily basis, if you put up with tons of gossip, trash talk, consequences from little things you missed, did or heard, I bet you will feel frustrated and get some relieve somewhere or with someone. But the moment where you are playing a competitive game, you dont wanna put up with 10 games lost just because your team doesnt group, doesnt ward, doesnt read the game, colaborate to do drakes, heralds, barons or even crabs! \n\nI think everthing has a reason and flamming or being toxic isnt really a problem in this game, because everyone can press that little button that is \"mute\".  \nThe real problem always was trolls, griefers and afks!\n\nIf you go to CS GO, Call Of Duty, Fortnite, PubG, any rated game as awesome to play, you wont see many cases of perma bans for flame or toxicity, because people usually flame on competitives. \nRiot says that flamming community in LoL is 0.003% (i dont quite recall if it is this exact number), but they are saying that 99.997% is not toxic? The rest is normal? If we all search for banned players, I bet you will only find players that flame or are toxic, in riot terms, because for me toxicity is very relative and as I said, mute is always on competitive games. \nI love LoL for very reasons but the competitive mode and this ridiculous bans are insane. No other community has this issue, i've searched. \nEvery player that reaches lvl 30 can play rankeds and if someone with experience plays their placement, it will be just 1 more player without the skill to be on Silver and it will be just 1 more reason for people to lose games and at a long term, flame. Or they could just get lucky and win some games 'till Silver or Bronze but yeah.\n\nI think Riot should have more consern about the afks: reason to afk using the player IP so understand their network status, griefers: watching each game that someone gets reported for grief and trolling. \nAs well with competitive, they should have, when people reaches lvl 30, tutorials about warding, doing objectives, early, mid and late game gameplay, etc... so people could really improve. \nI got tons of times people that wrote to me in chat \"wards dont work\", with only 8 wards used on a 30 minutes game.... As well as other things. \n\nOh well, this is my opinion, i've seen this game transform from season to season 'till this state but 2 things that never changed was the easy way to competitives and the \"toxic and flame\" bans. \n\nIgnoring the problem and removing it from the platform isnt the way to resolve as the problems related to junkies or assassins. They dont just kill them or get rid of them, they get aid or justifiable investigation and trial, in the way of resolving the problem. \nIt just makes people think that the money comes first. And I used a lot of my own and family members to get some skins instead of other things. Was it a waste of money ? Or was worth it? \n\nGiving chat restriction doesnt solves anything neither bans, if you warn a bully not to buly, what he does? The same thing over again. If you tell a shy person not to be shy, what he or she does? Exactly the same. Behaviour doesnt change with warnings, but with attitudes to turn every negativity around. I dont know the mind set of the responsable team member that sentences players but I think they just think about this last paragraph or at least change something really important for next season instead of just doing new skins or a pass to do missions that costs real money... \nStill, love the game, but It exists too much unfairness in my point of view that were never took care of. \nEven if they unban me, the problems still exist and people will one day get sick of this struggle.\nBut yeah, league of legends is a great game.\n\nThanks everyone that replied :D \nEnjoy your games and cheers,\n\nJoÃ£o Vieira","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Like Teemo","date":"2019-02-02T17:25:26.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"as someone who has also been playing since the first few season (not specifically on this account) i went through a rough patch a while back and i received consecutive bans, a 2 week and then a permanent, i made a support ticket and due to the kindness of rioters and my accounts quite clean history i was granted a chance to redeem myself.. \n\nI don't have perfect interactions or judgement all the time but i feel that players mostly get banned for swearing these days.. i don't see all that many people on the boards getting banned for inting or poor game skills or anything of the sort, mostly just \"flaming\" in chat..\n\nthis game is pretty pg and i feel like the fact its so strict its just kinda one of those things.. i for one know that the culture of kids that age and especially older, all we do is flame each other in real life and online.. we swear and tell people all kinds of rude things, its our nature...  in most cases i think bans related to chat are just stupid, they don't make the community any less toxic and it all gets directed into the boards in \"f*** you riot\" posts \n\ni think you do deserve a chance to prove yourself as \"worthy\" to have your account back, but weather or not you will ever get that is slim to none","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ichabod1","date":"2019-02-03T03:45:27.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are advocating the use of toxic behavior because your teammates aren't playing the game like you want them to. It's a multiplayer game. Lower ranks has many of these types of players. In order to leave them behind, you ignore them and play to the best of your ability and you'll rank up. Any other excuse is just an excuse to treat others how you want to no matter the consequences, or whether YOU are making the game horrible for them. \n\nIt's simple. Be nice. If you can't, then go play another game, because Riot wants players that encourage others to have fun. Players that have fun will return to the game more often, and spend money more often. Toxic players hurt their bottom dollar, and thus they go bye bye. \n\nIt is very, very fair to ban a player that is toxic enough to warrant a perma-ban. They've given those players more than enough chances to redeem themselves, and become the type of player they want in their game. While I will grant that Riot needs to change some things to improve player behavior, their warning/banning system really isn't one of them. \n\nLet me put it this way. If you owned a store and a customer who's spent $1,000 started flaming 4  other customers that might only spend $300 each, would you allow them to keep coming into your store? That's your $1000 vs a total of $1,200 from other customers (plus even more from other customers as the toxic customer kept returning). What if you've already given them several chances to improve their behavior? Does it matter how much money they've spent? Would you care what that toxic customer had to say about how you could improve your store? Or would you worry more about the experience of all those other customers that are going to be spending money in your store? If you say anything other than \"I'd boot that toxic customer out and ban them from returning,\" then you are not being honest to yourself or anyone else. They are running a business. You are hurting that business. Simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyros","date":"2019-02-03T11:31:47.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really understand what you are saying but for me there is a difference between being a flamer and being toxic. I dont flame anyone, i point things people, as me, are doing bad in a ranked and I think its quite normal to do that. I've been very close to Gold, but doesnt matter the rank because I have a lot of friends in Plat, Diamond, etc... and some of them struggle with the same problem. \n\nAnd now i'm going to put it in your way, if the costumer flames other costumers, I would talk with him, trying to reason with him in a way that he would not do the same thing and I would profit $2,200! You are saying those things like no one changes and toxicity can always be \"muted\"! It isnt a big of a deal. Now, because other people forget about that button or really want to have peace on chat, they shouldn't play ranked! Easy, or maybe the matchmaking should be more decent? Not always depending on the mmr and tier? Maybe just on tier? Because you can have low mmr on silver and play with bronzes, like the same happens in every rank, but everyone know that when you are in the tier's top division, the gameplay and the toxicity is different! So maybe, still going with the \"elo\" or \"mmr\" is old school? Idk, my opinion. Anyway, Riot wants a peace environment on rankeds, I understand that and I also understand that they created the \"mute\" button for some reason. Nowadays, people are so sensitive that if you say \"gg\", \"omg\", \"wtf\", \" im going afk\", because you are tilted about your game play or your team's gameplay, its a reason to get reported and banned. \n\nI can show you the last games I played on my main account and I really ask myself if this is consider really toxicity or its normal the type of frustation you getting playing competitive games. \n\nPre-Game Lobby, just said 1 thing \"Someone wanna go adc?\", that was me being kind.\n\n    [All]Pyros: Frank Ocean - Nights\n    [All]Pyros: bitches\n    [All]Pyros: u think it was worth right?\n    [All]Pyros: 1st blood and stuff\n    [All]Pyros: lets see what u do with this\n    Pyros: why\n    Pyros: ward plz\n    Pyros: got stuned by jinx E under tower..\n    Pyros: sry\n\nThis was the start of the game, I said \"bitches\" so I might the a toxic human who wants to get them crawling on the floor due to my agressive words! But no, I was sharing music as I normally do and provoking them a bit, not being toxic, in my opinion, just having fun as well.\nThen I asked people to ward, that is very important on ranked games and I admitted my mistake and asked for forgiveness due to my bad play that could cost the game or not, such a insensitive player I am, really I should be ban.\n\n    Pyros: 5/1 Pantheon\n    Pyros: akali\n    Pyros: why are u doing that?\n    Pyros: u are just faking moves\n    Pyros: u die to panth in 10 secs\n    Pyros: wanna come bot?\n    Pyros: and i go mid?\n    Pyros: bro\n    Pyros: come bot\n    Pyros: and i go mid\n    Pyros: u can get kills easily here\n    Pyros: i go mid\n\nThis is a flamer and toxic player acting, because he said \"faking\", lets ban him, he is not even trying to get a solution to help his teammate getting better by trying to swap..\n\n    Pyros: PANTHEON GOING BOT\n    Pyros: ..\n    Pyros: WTFFF\n    Pyros: Trundle what are u doing in this game?\n    Pyros: are u this useless?\n    Pyros: omg\n    Pyros: akali died to jinx\n    Pyros: Dont fight\n    Pyros: omg\n    Pyros: pantheon is 13/4\n    Pyros: just dont fight ffs\n    Pyros: 'i0Â«ugvhsnkdÃ§i08ygfvlsbjnÃ§Âºpi0Â«u9yÂ´8fichjlnÃ§smdo'0ygovahnkÃ§sdo'ipgolvhÃ§+\n    Pyros: pdupglvbaÂºmspoÂ«uyvabjÃ§nms+o'di09pglvhanmÂºs\n\nRight now, this my be the start of the flame as someone that is trying to fix the issues to win sees a player 13/4, that isnt normal if people really know how to play competitive games that after some time, if they get sponsored and a team, earn greats amounts of money.\nWas I being good to trundle? No, I was questioning him indirectly about the reason pantheon was 13/4 and yeah thats 2 things I said that deserves attettion in some point of view.\n\n    Pyros: FCK Y'ALL\n    Pyros: FUCKINGG NOOBS\n    Pyros: USELESS SHITTS\n    Pyros: FFS\n    Pyros: HATE THIS SHITT\n    Pyros: WHAT ARE U DOING IN THIS GAME FFS????\n    Pyros: JUST FEED?\n    Pyros: IS THAT WHAT U CAN DO?\n    Pyros: god\n    Pyros: i hate playing league\n    Pyros: i get so toxic\n\nNow this is flamming, I 100% agree, but what is the use for that \"mute\" button if is not used? This was the maximum flame I did when I played. I should be banned and get my possesions taken away from me? With these sentences I really hurt people that are playing a ranked game with consequences to everyone that tries to climb? So if im playing 1 week straight league and I get all types of players in my games that makes me lose as well as my bad plays, at the end of the week if I get to promos to a new tier and on the last game I get again griefers, afks or troll, I should just smile and think \" Well spent tons of hours on this game so I could get most games hijacked and I should just stay positive and not say what is on my mind\"? I am not encouraging no one to flame and usually people who flame on games are just PEOPLE! Because frustration is completely normal. If you are aiming for that scholarship on soccer and if you lose the game that will take you there because someone on your team just gave up or failed a defense that was really easy or some else, you wouldn't get frustrated? Yeah, people wouldn't go to the kid, hiting him or cursing him. I believe normally, people would just get frustrated. And in a game, who are you really hurting with these kind of sentences?? You dont know the person and the person doesnt know you. Even if you are hurting someone, how can you know? Every time i get a player flamming at me I ignore him, mute him or say to him or her to leave me away in a kind way :) \n\nAnyway, after the game, does this players affect my life in a negative way? No! It is just a game that I enjoy playing with people who knows at least the basics and I normally except that in rankeds, competitive games!\n\nAnd if your team is forcing you to waste more time by not surrending, what is that? Self punishment then? They wanna win the game but they are uncomfortable with the player that is hurting their feelings ? If someone says any thing like this, without even tell something to me, I can report him for flame or toxicity and the guy gets banned. Is that fair? Maybe he or she is having a bad day and being forced to play with people that dont know the basics and just play competitive for fun without any objectives is kinda of painfull too? But no one cares about that just the way he or she is communicationo chat. And riot doesnt care about the context, if others players and saying garbage to be I should just be quite and report him or she so he could be banned? I dont care about the bans, I care abou the seriousness on competitive games and that makes the game fun. I can lose a game that I spent 1h playing but if everyone did their best and played good, I will have fun and even add anyone for what matters. I just hate playing with players that in 30 minutes uses 8 wards, that doesnt gank when possible, that forgets drakes are a benefict for everyone on the team in gold and buffs, that doesnt protect the squiches, etc... for me, its the basics that I learn seeying LCS back in the days and Worlds.\n\nI could show you all the chat from this game and the 2 left, but its the same thing, the hardest flame was the last quotes that I pasted. But yeah, Riot should just remove \"mute\" button if people dont use it. And yeah keep banning everyone for saying mean and noty things on chat because they deserve to be ripped off their money and times wasted on a game that doesnt care about the negativity and just says \"\"I'd boot that toxic customer out and ban them from returning\".\n\nThat the thinking that helps this planet and every industry to keep messing up the planet and forgetting about what \"we\" should change to make it a better place. As everything else. \n\nIn conclusion, I dont think I deserved the ban, I think I would deserve a approach from one of Riot Support members to help me improve in this matter, because in every report I make, only when I report toxicity is when I get the \"Instant Feedback\" notification. So for Riot, only flamers and toxic players and banned, so who they approach to help? Exactly...\n\nHave a great day and thanks for your reply.\nCheers,\n  \nJoÃ£o Vieira","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-02T18:45:57.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got many chances, actually.
