Seems like you guys play dumb about this and it annoys me much more than the refund that I wouldn't care about anyway","replies":[{"poster":"sir craps a lot","date":"2017-08-03T11:27:57.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly. It was mandatory before so thats why most people bought them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2017-08-03T23:46:49.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's insane to me that since 1 month ago discussion has been:\nPlayer: I want muh rp for pages back\nRito: you can still uses the pages so no rp for you, ha\nPlayer: but having 1 editable rune page is worth more than 900 non editable ones\nRito: oh look!
