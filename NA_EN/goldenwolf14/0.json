So I hope that it gets more bells and whistles added on to it because I think it could be a great skin and if you do all of this it could easily be justifiable to make it a 1350 RP skin in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-25T18:02:30.330+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys! \n\nJust wanted to hop in to talk about Arclight Vayne! \n\nAs mentioned, this skin is super WIP as compared to the other skins that are on PBE currently. \n\n* Are you referring to [these](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MQ-I38gqeDs/VRJDLnigBlI/AAAAAAAAmsw/cNUdLNj9-kQ/s1600/bw2.jpg)?\n* The tumble will be losing the bats, I'm not sure how they ended up on PBE. D: Rest assured, no bats! \n* New SFX for Arclight Vayne will include Final hour (R) and her recall animation. \n* She'll be a 975 RP skin.\n* Texture updates will be coming soon!\n\nHope this clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Goldenwolf14","date":"2015-03-25T19:04:45.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's great to here and thanks for letting us know what her skin will look like when it's finished.

The good news is that they'll very probably fix point 1 and 2.\nI'm not sure what sound you're talking about in point3, but I'd expect they'd change it *if they have an official sound for arclight*. Do Varus and VelKoz have similar soun deffects with arclight?","replies":[]}]}]}
