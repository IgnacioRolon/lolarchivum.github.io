The swearing is just emphasis for the insults and harassment.\n\nSimilarly, you can get banned for telling people they're \"useless\" and that they should uninstall; you can get banned for calling people \"idiots\", \"morons\", etc.\n\nYou're focusing solely on the use of swears in the example that you're completely ignoring any other behavior that could be punishable.

Language is nothing more than a tool to convey thoughts. That's also why you can't \"prove\" anything regarding somebody's intention behind the words they use. Until we find a way to communicate telepathically communication will always rely on some degree of interpretation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"insomniacjezz","date":"2019-05-21T21:52:13.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That statement is toxic enough to earn a chat restriction if you say it often enough, though.","replies":[{"poster":"House Money","date":"2019-05-21T21:55:00.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"if you saw a stranger walking down the road and repeating \"you you piece of\" and you think he is toxic I question your sanity.\n\nBro, you would say what the hell is this dude or wtf or something of the sort.

It's an indicator that those people don't care for the filter.\n\n> ...then report players for chat that they willingly subject themselves to. It's not an excuse to be toxic but it is fundamentally flawed.\n\nWell, here's the thing; the Mature Language Filter is there for people who have lighter/different sensibilities in regards to swearing and curse words. It filters out and censors swearing, but it doesn't do the same for flame and abusive language.\n\nFrankly, I don't see how you can 1. determine who voluntarily turns off the Mature Language Filter and 2. leverage that as an explanation for people getting punished.\n\nYou don't know who reports who, and you don't know who has their Mature Language Filter on or off; and I'd reckon that there are just as many people out there with it on who report misbehavior as there are those who have it turned off that do the same.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Mature Language Filter isn't flawed; you're simply misunderstanding its purpose.\n\n> Players should only be restricted if they manipulate chat to bypass the filter, and are reported. Otherwise how can any chat ban be justified. You willingly turned off your filter and that action may as well say \"im ok with seeing anything in the chat\"\n\nWell, again, read above; the Mature Language Filter censors cursing and swearing, but it doesn't censor abusive language, flaming, etc;\n\nAnd while, yes, the general idea being sent when someone turns off the Mature Language Filter is \"I'm okay with seeing swearing in chat\", it doesn't automatically translate to \"I want chat to be a complete toxic cesspool\".\n\nAnd, regardless of what you believe, the rules take precedence over the existence of a Mature Language Filter, and punishments are justified by the rules. You should check out the [Code of Conduct](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#code-conduct) and the [Summoner's Code](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code) for the rough details of the rules.\n\n> If you have filter disabled, any chat related report should be instantly thrown out.\n\nNo. The Mature Language Filter does not supercede the rules you agreed to, and it absolutely should not deny players the ability to report people for breaking those rules.","replies":[{"poster":"House Money","date":"2019-05-21T21:47:26.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"I disagree, but I see where you are coming from and you make some valiant points for the other side.\n\nI'm specifically talking about curse words.
