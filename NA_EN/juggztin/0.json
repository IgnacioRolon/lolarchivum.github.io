Imagine Xayah and Yasuo are in a lane.  Xayah has preemptively set feathers down behind Yasuo and then Yasuo puts up his windwall between Xayah and himself.  While the windwall is up, the feathers from before are still behind Yasuo.  Xayah then recalls her feathers back to herself, multiple feathers fly through Yasuo and then hits the windwall and disappears.  While the feathers hit Yasuo because they then hit the windwall and disappear, Yasuo doesn&#039;t become rooted or affected by Xayah&#039;s feathers even though they went through him.  I don&#039;t know if you meant for the ability to root only if the feathers reach back to Xayah but I feel like if Yasuo is hit by the feathers he should take damage and be rooted.","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-06-08T19:03:44.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also likely that not all 3 feathers hit yasuo, sometimes the hitbox on them gets abit buggy/wonky cuz they are so small","replies":[{"poster":"JUGGZTIN","date":"2017-06-08T20:29:30.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the situation where it happened to me I first used my ultimate sending out 5 feathers, Yasuo then got up in my face and used his windwall, I then responded by calling back my feathers.  Since Yasuo was so close to me it's very unlikely he was hit with less than 3 feathers.  I know the possibility is there but I find it hard to believe that that's what happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-06-08T21:03:03.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"could u make a video file of it?
