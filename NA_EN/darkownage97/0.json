I have had a few leaverbusters in the past myself when I d/c'd (I live in Alaska so the connection is horrible). \n\nWhat you could try to do is the following: (1) run a full file repair (click the cogwheel at the top right), (2) if the file repair doesn't work then you can download the hextech repair tool here --> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool and run it, and (3) if the hextech tool doesn't work then you can send the logs it provides to Riot Support and they can help you (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). I hope this helps you!","replies":[]}]}
